welcome back in the last video we talked
about home world's pitch notation and in
this video we're going to be talking
about scientific pitch notation now it's
very very similar to homeless pitch
notation it's more commonly used because
it makes more sense although both are
used hey look weird but I'm both are
used very frequently so we're going to
relate scientific sidesteps scientific
pitch notation do home molds pitch
notation so if you remember we had in
Helmholtz pitch notation we had a seed
with a little tick or an apostrophe or
whatever you want to call it now this is
the equivalent of middle C and if you
remember I think I've said this hopeful
that in middle C is in the middle of a
keyboard when you have a keyboard or
piano there's a logo usually then you go
down and then it's to the left I think
the first C there I think it vibrates
out like 260 tons is second 261 point
something but close enough right so we
had to see you with a little tick so
this is the equivalent of c4 so now
we're just doing the same concept except
with numbers so Mary sauce crab
see tick is the equivalent of c4c double
tick equals C 5 C triple tick equals C 6
we're going downwards we had C with
nothing
which is equal to C 3 we have capital C
should go to C 2 and we have capital C
with thick a comma which is equal to C 1
we have capital C with 2 ticks which is
equal to C 0 we have C with 3 ticks
which is actually able to see negative 1
so here is our entire range the
equivalents for scientific pitch
notation let's take a look at this on
the keyboard we can see the letters let
me try to make this focus on feel
letters here that says G 1 I think
all right now we can go back to the very
bottom the first key we have is a zero
and we can actually go lower-pitched
which gives us into the negatives but
we're not gonna get into that right now
so now I mean if I don't display this
properly all right if we go up an octave
we have a one or well we can go from the
ranges C C to C to go up an octave we
have C 3 4 5 6 7
oh whoa cool if I don't get distracted I
could probably teach pretty good now
those are just different ways to
represent pitches now both are fine and
dandy and all right but the most common
way is with a staff and the staff is a 5
lined way to represent pitches then we
have this little cool looking thing on
the side which we'll get into this later
but don't worry about it for now
and we can represent see right here as
middle seat so here's C 4 then each line
in space is a different pitch c d e G a
B C so here's the next C this would
represent C five or one octave higher d
4 represents that note and then we have
C 5 which represents at note
that is the concept of scientific pitch
notation you should be familiar with
both hum waltz pitch notation and
scientific pitch notation and also
another form of notation is tablature or
tabs which you should be familiar with
that but I'm not going to get into that
too much because there's so many
different ways to represent it so pick
an instrument such as guitar and look up
Guitar Tabs
and it'll display what they look like
they're pretty simple they're for
beginners typically they can get pretty
advanced well yes those are all forms of
musical notation see you soon
