video I'm going to be talking about ear
training specifically over the concept
of keys so I conveniently drew some
beautiful pictures but obviously that's
not the kind of keys on that I just
thought it was funny obviously it wasn't
very funny I get it you don't have to
say it wasn't funny obviously anyways
scale that's the first thing you may
want to figure out so if you're figuring
out your notes see ya you got to figure
out the notes first and once you got the
notes you can try to figure out what
scale the song is built off of if you
remember it's dark in here I forgot to
turn some lights on boom boom pow pow
there we go now that looks better so you
can figure out what scale the song is
composed off of so if you remember I
said most songs are built off of a scale
so let's say you're making the notes and
you find out you have three sharps three
notes have a sharp and they're all
different pitches like they're not all
see than a high RC and the lower seat
there are different letters well this
can help us figure out what key were in
so if you look at the circle of fifths
so so so obviously I'm saying so too
many times so I'm going to try and stop
c g d a for example you follow the
circle of fifths this has zero
accidentals this has one says 2 this is
3 so this tells us we may be in a key of
a which allows us to create the egg
scale a b c d e f g a then we have some
notes F sharp C sharp and E sure if you
don't know about that go learn about go
watch my scales videos and my circle of
fifths that's going to be helpful so now
we know what notes will fit
appropriately will fit appropriately in
this song now we may have some chromatic
notes if you remember chromatic just
means out of the scale example d sharp
we may have a d sharp but the chances
are we
won't unless it's some intense song but
if this is just like a common song
chances are low but don't don't be for
sure if you have a d sharp you may be in
another scale or you may have an a-type
chromatic note now another thing they
want to pay attention to is if you have
a g-sharp for example specifically a
g-sharp you may not be in the scale of a
you may be in the next scale which would
be c g d EI e may be in the scale of e
rather than the scale of a and you're
just not sure about that so if it's a
note that's not in the scale make sure
it's not beside it on the circle of
fifths and you're just a little confused
or something like that so be sure of
that now check the chords with the key
so we can go through our chord
progression a major B minor C sharp
minor a d-major you sharp major F sharp
minor and G diminished now you may have
for say a B diminished and that's all it
so you probably won't but remember these
are just guidelines the composer can do
anything he wants its art so if you have
a be diminished you may just possibly
have a B diminish that doesn't mean
you're in the key of C automatically so
that is one thing you have to look out
for so now that you have all this you
can help you can help use this you can
use this to help you figure out the rest
of the song figure out the note we note
resolved on probably a figure out the
intervals figure out the rhythms use the
scales because if it's a major third we
know it's to see sharps and now all the
major thirds from a are going to be C
sharp and so forth so that is using ear
training to transcribe using the key so
these are all just little videos of
different techniques and you don't just
want to use one combine them all
together
sir to master your transcribing skills
and your ear training skills to recreate
music like a boss so that's allowed to
say if you want to support me please
