video I wanted to talk about operators
operators are something that's used in
pretty much every programming language
you are going to run into and I'm
specifically going to be talking with
JavaScript but most of these are going
to carry over in any programming
language so if you just want to learn
about operators this video will probably
be useful for you all right so I'm going
to be explaining these defining these
and where we go we'll be going over
specifically arithmetic operators and
then in the upcoming videos I will talk
about some of the other ones so
operators and operands those are two
words you need to know like for example
five plus eight this plus sign this is
known as an operator five and eight
they're known as the operands basically
the operator does something with the
operands and in this case you guys
probably know 5 plus 8 is 12 haha just
kidding 13 but anyways the operator
basically tells JavaScript add 5 and 8
and return 13 so here's another one
var X oops equals 5 all right so this
the equals sign right here this is known
as the assignment operator this is a
equal sign and in in programming this is
different than this and this you will
need to know the difference and we'll be
getting into that as we go into future
videos but this is known as the
assignment operator this would not be
like five plus five whoops come on be
scrapped five plus five is equal to ten
that's not how it works this because
that would be trying to say five plus
five is an identifier of this value ten
and we can't use five plus five as a
variable so that's not going to work so
there's a sign
operator is only used in this case it's
not used in a mathematical equation
where it's equal to something like this
in that situation we would use two equal
signs and we will be getting into that
as we go alright so here's another
example this greater than sign I think
that yeah that's the greater than sign
is comparing 5 to 4 if 5 is larger than
4 it will return true
so is 5 larger than 4 yes so it will
return true there are actually a lot of
operators in JavaScript and it is
important to familiarize yourself with
the type of operators and how to use
each one so in this vid video we're
going to be specifically talking about
arithmetic operators or math simple
English terms addition subtraction
multiplication and division I recommend
you understand all of these for if you
don't you probably want to check out
some basic math tutorials you can find
those online or just youtube search yeah
anyways then we have some more advanced
ones such as the modulus which is the
remainder and then we have increment
decrement and a negation and I'm for
example let's look at the modulus
alright so let's do some examples here
as you can see I have a new file I'm
going to save it let's make a new dot
HTML
lowercase here new HTML I already have
farms gonna read it and then we can make
obviously if we're working with a large
JavaScript application we will have
other HTML within our page and this
would be either in the title or that not
the title the head or at the end of the
body but this case I'm just gonna write
script so we can run some JavaScript in
testing so we could have a variable X
and we can make that equal to 5 now
let's make it 13
and then we could say actually the way
the of the modulus works is it takes the
remainder of a sum some values so for
example we could have 13 modulus where's
it all right modulus 2 and well the way
this works so if I if I sign it here 13
modulus 2 will the remainder basically
how many times does 2 go into 13 we get
2 4 6 8 10 12 and then we can't go one
more because then we'd have 14 so we're
left with one extra the from 12 to 13 so
this is going to make the variable X
have the value of 1 and then I can
display it on our page JavaScript alert
1 so that works as planned and we'll get
into the other one soon so here are some
examples five plus five returns 10 5
minus 5 returns 0 5 x 5 returns 25 5
divided by 5 returns 1 13 modulus 2
which I just showed you
returns 1 negative 5 that is going to
return negative 5 obviously so yes we
can do that with so we could be like var
x equals negative negative 2 and that's
going to change our values within our
program so now it's equal to negative
so there's also increment in dealing or
decrement I don't know how to pronounce
that but basically how this works is
it's going to take our variable and add
one to it or subtract one from it
so X plus plus return six as well as
plus plus X returns six minus minus
returns 4 so as you can see there's four
different possibilities here and
basically the only thing we do is switch
the order so we always have two plus
signs or we always have two minus signs
before or after the variable well one
sometimes in our programs obviously this
will be for a larger scale but I'm just
trying to give you the basics we will do
something with a variable such as use it
within a statement of some sort and we
will need to increment it or decrement
it so let me show you some examples with
this we could have var X is equal to 10
all right so we alert it it's 10 simple
all right but now we could say X plus
plus refresh the page now we have 11
make sure to save your file we could
also go plus plus X and Euler X 12 so
this is an operator basically it says
var X let me erase this up here actually
no okay
lower x equals 10 and then we could say
X is equal to X plus 1 sorry I'm typing
so slow my keyboard is pretty far away
and unlike phones in the way so that's
pretty much we could just sum this up as
X plus plus it's just a short hand
version of that pretty much and it
returns the same value although you did
notice there was two versions plus plus
X versus X plus plus well this has to do
with the use of X so let's say variable
Y and let's go variable awesome is equal
to X so basically
awesome is going to have the same value
as X so we can alert awesome here
save it refresh the page whoops did
something wrong Oh spot all small that's
pretty lame so now they're both equal
they both have value 10 well we can
actually assign this to an incremented X
so we could say plus plus X now and we
alert awesome it's 11 as you can see
over here that's because we incremented
it and then we assigned X back to the
variable but if we use the other version
with the plus signs on the other side
now what we're doing is we are signing
it to the value of x and then we're
incrementing X 1 up
so now awesome is equal to 10 but if we
alert the other variable X we refresh
the page here so we first we alerted
awesome it's 10 we could say yeah
awesome is 10 but alert X gives us 11 so
you can see there's a difference here so
alert awesome
gives us 10 alert X gives us 11 why is
this
that's because awesome takes the value
of X originally which is 10 and then X
is incremented 1 so that means awesome
has a value of 10 and X now has a value
of 11 you could also do this with X - -
for example which just does the opposite
direction so awesome is the value 10 X
is the value 9 this is often used for
loops if you want a loop to end after a
certain amount of time say 10 times well
then you could go X plus plus and each
time through the loop we can add 1 to X
and once X reaches 10
from let's say zero or from one whatever
then it'll stop the loop so that's just
an example of what we can do with this
alright let's go back to our PowerPoint
because I'm just rambling on now
so when multiple operators are used in
sequence sometimes we run into problems
so for example this what does it return
I don't know it's question mark
JavaScript and mathematics does not
simply go left to right it doesn't just
add these and then subtract 3 and then
multiply 2 and then divide 3 they follow
operator precedence which tells which
operators to do first so in JavaScript
this is first going to do the
multiplication so we get 3 times 2 which
gives us 6 and then division so 6 minus
divided by 3 is going to give us 2 then
addition 5 plus 5 is going to give us 10
10 minus 8 will give us a final answer 8
so yes another thing to worry about is
what is known as associate ivities this
is left to right or right to left so
addition and subtraction have the same
operator precedence which is which one
to do first so for example right here 5
plus 5 minus 2 which one goes first well
that has to do with the associativity so
if two or more operators have the same
operator precedence then we must look at
the associativity of the operator
addition and subtraction are left to
right so in this case since addition
subtraction or left to right that means
they have equal precedence so we're just
going to go left to right five plus five
is 10 10 minus 2 is 8 let's look at
another example here 2 plus 2 minus 3
what does it return well since its left
right first we just add because its
leftmost and then we just subtract 3 so
2 plus 2 gives us 4 minus 3 returns 1
left to right or right to left would
give us the same answer in this case but
this is all not always the case so for a
great
reference material you can go to this
website hopefully I put the link in the
description if I feel like it and yes so
this website it's of the Mozilla Mozilla
developer Network which has a lot of
great JavaScript tutorials sorry I was
trying to make this easier to view oh
shoot say yes here has a group has a
great example of how these work as well
as a table that gives us all the
operators and you can see there's a
whole lot of them and this will give us
the precedence on the left basically
which one goes first and then if there's
two that have the same precedence such
as multiplication and division both have
a precedence five well then we go left
to right which means whichever one is
the farthest left goes first in the
situation that we're in so back to the
PowerPoint we can also force or clarify
precedents so to make things easier it's
often recommended to use parentheses
which if you don't know what those are
just that to force precedents so here we
have three plus three times four this
gives us the value 24 versus three plus
three times four which returns fifteen
so as you can see right here I've forced
this three plus three
even though multiplication always goes
first in this precedence but since I use
parentheses that is going to keep this
separate from this over here and it's
going to add these and then it's going
to multiply four so this will give us
different values so it's very important
to know what you're doing with the
precedents and forcing the precedents so
I'll be doing a lot of this as we go on
in future videos but this is often
useful to make code clear and large
expressions such as this as if anybody
else is working with you in your program
or your website or your JavaScript
whatever
project and someone sees this well
they're not going to know exactly what's
going on they could figure it out but
there's high chance a mistake and it
does it it's confusing but if you've
clarified such as well obviously I want
these one separate and then I want to
multiply that by 820 oops don't delete
it yeah but you get the point you can
force that way so that's pretty much all
I have to say in this video and
hopefully that helped clear things up
and I will be getting into some more
operators in future videos so now that
you know about operators go give them a
try and you if you want just like to
show what for like what the value is
just use an alert function which we've
done that multiple time so you should
know how to do that
