we're going to be covering database
normalization so this is your fourth
video and the five series database
primer essentially my goal here is to
kind of give you like a rough overview
of everything database design but
naturally you can't learn everything
about normalization in just one video so
this is going to be something that
continually shows up in future videos
and throughout your database career so
don't blow this off it's pretty
important so database normalization is
basically a set of rules that you can
optionally follow and it will help you
get a better more protected database
design it protects your data integrity
it prevents redundant data and
contradicting data like oh here's John
his phone number is 1 2 3 whatever and
then oh here's also John his phone
numbers 4 5 7 something else and then
you don't know which one's right so
these are the kinds of things we want to
avoid and then the main ways we design a
database is one with relationships and
then two once we kind of got those
relationships designed we start doing
normalization which is kind of like a
check that looks through your database
and catches anything that might not work
the way you want it to well you guys got
to realize that a lot of these decisions
like oh should we design it this way or
should we design it this way these are
things that are decided by the business
rules your assignment what you need for
the project you can't always look at a
table and say what's the correct way to
design this because it depends upon what
the requirements are you can choose on
certain things but I'm kind of getting
off-topic so let's get started three
normal forms our first normal form
second normal form and third normal form
there are a couple other ones after that
but who cares about those let's start
with the beginning ones so we're going
to start with the first normal form now
the first rule of first normal form is
that all of your columns need to
describe something that is atomic what
does it mean if something is atomic it
means that it is in its lowest form like
the most you can divide something up the
reason being is that
one time these science people believed
that atoms were the smallest thing and
they assumed that oh you can't split an
atom right pretty hopeful how does that
apply to database design I don't know
but we're using that word so essentially
we want the column headers or whatever
the column is about to describe one
individual thing but don't make it so
small that it loses the meaning of what
it is right so there's like a fine
balance so like for example we have a
phone number right so here's my phone
number
and this is something that is atomic
it's the smallest indivisible thing that
can describe a phone number if I wanted
to split this up like let's say I split
that now you have to do some extra
combination like oh the area code and
junk but I would say that the full
number qualifies as being atomic when it
comes to names I would say first name is
atomic middle name is atomic and last
name is atomic if you just combine all
of those into a column like name I
personally think that's not very atomic
you can do that though it's up to you
one reason that might be good is for
different countries names are separated
different so people don't always have
first middle last they might have like
first second middle second middle I
don't have an eraser
don't worry t-shirt to the rescue so as
a reminder the first part of first
normal form is that the columns are
atomic the second part is that the data
for each row is one thing so it's
similar to things being atomic but now
it's the number of items that are not
divisible so if we go back on the phone
number so this is my phone number
this whole entity is atomic you want to
want to split it that puts you at risk
of making a nuclear bomb so we're just
going to keep it at that but what if I
have two phone numbers so now in our
database we have a column phone number
in within
individual row for me I have one phone
number and I have another phone number
how do you go about storing this are you
just supposed to put them both in there
as one giant string no that that'd be
stupid you don't want to do that so this
is an issue databases are designed to be
atomic we don't want to put a bunch of
junk in one thing of data because if you
wanted to go through here and grab phone
numbers you might say something like Oh
select the phone number from this table
and it returns this and then you try to
like automate a phone calling system or
something this isn't going to work
because these are two things but how do
you actually fix this whenever you have
the situation where you might have
multiple entries for one person you need
to create another table now when it
comes to phone numbers some people will
just put phone one phone two and leave
it at that and if they don't have a
phone to then they'll allow you to put
nulls into that field but some people
prefer to have no nulls in their
database and if you don't know nulls are
just the absence of a value so no phone
number but if you want to force we we
want you to be able to have unlimited
phone numbers and if you don't have two
phone numbers we don't want you to even
have a second phone number because
that's just wasted space right the way
you would do that is you create a new
table for phones or phone numbers and
then within this table you're going to
have two columns at least the first
column is going to be a reference to the
person and the way you do that is with a
foreign key so this might be an ID of a
person and then the other column is
going to be the phone number so let's
say we have a person over here and he
has an ID of 7 we're going to put an
entry over here 7 and then we're going
to put one of his phone numbers over
here then if you add another phone
number you would make another entry into
this table with the same foreign key
referencing the
dude and you would put his second phone
number this solves that problem of
having phone number to null null null
null for like everybody so the way it
works the way it prevents nulls is if we
have another person and our ID is 8 and
she only has one phone number you only
need one entry in this table problem
solved so to conclude first normal form
every column is atomic and then every
entry for that column only has one value
let's move on to the second normal form
second normal form deals with something
known as partial dependencies so before
we dive in and talk about what partial
dependencies are let's just talk about
what normal dependencies are essentially
dependencies are when an attribute
depends on an entity or basically it
describes the entity so this goes back
to like the very basics of databases
where you have attributes and entities
so if we had a person this would be the
entity and an attribute would be the
name phone number I was looking back in
my old videos and one of the attributes
I used was their pH level really so
let's go there pH level all of these
attributes depend on the person meaning
that if you change the person these are
also going to change so usually this
entity is described with a primary key
so usually it's an ID but not always
that's called a surrogate key meaning
the database just generates some random
number to represent an individual person
so that's what we're going to go with
but if you don't want to use random
generated numbers you can look into
natural keys but those are complex so
forget that so let's go with person and
we're just going to make this a person
ID so everything depends on the person
ID that also means that this person's
name does not depend
on something else like an order this
order is placed by a person so we could
say the person with the idea of 46 but
this name is kind of unrelated to the
order so you got to be able to tell
where's where dependency is and where
our dependency is not the easiest way to
think about it is usually the columns
and a table all depend upon the primary
key but occasionally we run into
something known as a partial dependency
which is stuff so we're going to teach
you how to get rid of it so as you may
have guessed partial might imply meaning
like part of something so in order to
have a partial dependency you need to
have what's known as either a compound
or composite key essentially two keys
combined to make one key the reason that
is is you can't have a partial
dependency if you only have one key
because you can't split that you'll see
what I mean so we always need a compound
or composite key when we are dealing
with second normal form so where do you
find such compound or composite keys one
example is when you're designing a
many-to-many relationship the table in
the middle it's known as an intermediary
table it's going to have two primary
keys and the combination of those is
going to qualify for something that
might have a partial dependency so let's
dive in that a little bit more so in the
previous oracle video we talked about
books and authors and book authors and
essentially what we did is we set one
table as books one table as authors
because books and authors are a
many-to-many relationship essentially
what we're going to do is split this off
into two hexxit to do into two tables
with a one-to-many to a third table and
a one-to-many also from the side so
essentially one many-to-many is split
into two
one two minutes hopefully it makes sense
it's basically this rather than because
this is not a good design for databases
so over here we're gonna have books over
here we're gonna have authors and in
between we're gonna have you guessed it
book authors so in this table we're
going to have a book ID and an author ID
and the combination of these two need to
be unique for example if we had the book
47 like the ID 47 and the author 47 and
then we had another entry 47 47 this
would be describing the same thing it'd
basically be saying hey this guy wrote
this book and the same guy wrote the
same book it's redundant so we don't
need that so essentially we put a kind
of like a drop my chalk kind of like
this overarching key on both of these so
these as a whole need to be unique so we
can have 47:43 these don't have to be
unique but both of them together have to
be unique all right now let's say we
have some super meaningful data like the
author's favorite food because that's
relevant and you're like huh I wonder
where I'm going to store this yeah let's
put it right here so we have the
author's favorite food here now but we
just introduced a partial dependency
because the author's favorite food only
depends on one of the two keys that make
the overarching key so it only depends
on the author and the way you can kind
of think about that or basically prove
that is you can change one of these and
see if this changes so if we change the
author the food that that author of
likes is going to change because if we
had an entry in this table and it was
like Oh John he likes tacos and then we
had another one like Oh Hannah
she likes mac and cheese we basically
looked at the difference from John to
Hannah the food could potentially change
I mean they could both like the same
food but we're just talking
could change but if you go through the
books and you change them this is always
going to stay the same the food is not
going to change so Oh John he wrote
three little pigs his favorite food is
tacos Oh John he wrote mary had a little
lamb is that even a book I don't think
so but his favorite food is still tacos
you can see that it really has nothing
to do with the book so the appropriate
place to put this as you guessed it is
over here that would fix the partial
dependency but this also brings up the
question when is it appropriate to put
something in here and the only time is
if it depends on both of the keys so a
good example is the author's position on
a published book so you know authors
they get all like mad because they want
to compete for like the number one
author right like the first person
because then basically they kind of get
most of the credit for the book so
that's something that might be important
if your publishing company is what
position that author is for a specific
book but as you can see it kind of
depends on both because it depends on
who the author is and what book you're
talking about if you were over here and
you said Oh John
he's position number one but that
doesn't tell you position number one for
what book but if you put it over here
you'd say oh three little pigs position
number one doesn't really make sense but
if you go in the middle and you say Oh
John is position number one on the three
little pigs now makes sense so in that
situation you would not have a partial
dependency and the correct location
would be is to store it here so
hopefully that kind of sums up second
normal form it's one of the more
complicated ones it's taken me a couple
years of my life to really meditate and
grasp all the details of second normal
form but one day one day young sir you
will get it or mail moving on to third
normal form this deals with something
known as transitive dependencies these
ones are a little easier so
relax so one the world is a transitive
dependency essentially it's when you
have a column that depends upon a column
that depends upon a column that depends
upon the column that depends upon a key
you have like this weird hopping thing
going on and it doesn't have to be that
many levels it could just be like a
column depending upon a column that
depends upon the primary key yeah I know
that's like really conceptual so the
easiest way to show this is to go
through an example so let's say you are
a publishing company and you have this
beautiful website where people can go on
there and put their ratings for all of
your books and you know these websites
usually have some sort of star system or
like dislike we're going to go with a
star system so that way people can go on
there and rate their book and it's
generally accepted that like five stars
it's like wow this book is incredible
and made me win the lottery
it's awesome three is like yeah this was
okay and then one is like wow this book
gave me Lyme disease okay so we kind of
understand that but let's just say you
wanted to store what those stars meant
in a database for some reason you might
try something like this inside of a
rating table you might have the users
comment their star rating and then
you're going to have the star rating
meaning now you may already see the
problem here the problem is that the
star rating meaning does not belong in
this table we have a transitive
dependency that's because the star
rating depends on the comment and then
the star the star rating meaning depends
on star rating it's kind of like this
bouncing thing so the way to fix this is
to create another table you could just
name it whatever stars now within this
table you could have the ID and then you
could have the the rating so you could
say rating one two three four five and
then another column for the rating
meaning and then inside of this table
instead of having both of these you
would just have a star rating that would
be a foreign key to one of the
those inside of the stars table so let's
just go over an example so here is a row
in this table super-great and then a
star ID of five which could conveniently
correlate to like five stars but it
doesn't have to and you might also have
like a user now I'm gonna kind of
comment my opinion on this putting the
star meaning in a database is probably
unnecessary because mainly just cuz one
through five stars is kind of
universally known like one is bad five
is good so do you really need to put the
meaning in here plus programmatically in
like whatever programming language
you're using to make an application you
could put that phrase like oh this is a
five star it's great you could put that
on the application but you don't
necessarily have to store that in the
database you could just put it in HTML
or whatever you're using so that was a
pretty simple example but it wasn't the
most practical example but there are
plenty of other examples for example you
could have a person table and one of the
columns in that person table could be
the person's driver's license number or
something and then another column could
be the state in which they got their
driver's license but does that actually
belong in the person table is the state
that the person got the license in
related to the person itself
himself/herself not really that would be
an appropriate situation where you could
break it off into like driver's license
table or something like that now that's
what the compromise because now you have
an extra table you have to do more joins
and the database design becomes more
complex so the lesson learned from this
video is that the whole normal forms and
database design is very subjective and
it really depends on what you want so if
it was me I'd go on like the more simple
side and don't normalize it too much but
if you do that at work and get fired I
said nothing don't come no nothing thank
you guys for watching I've been trying
to give these videos in a very
conceptual way so that way this stuff up
- every single relational database you
guys use whether it's Oracle sequel
server mysql etc the concepts are what's
important if you know these concepts you
can design a database in whatever
database management system you want keep
that in mind as you go on to the next
video which is the last video in this
five video database primer but in that
video I will try to give you some more
information on what we're going to study
relating to just Oracle database design
for example different data types and all
of that stuff that stuff's going to come
a little later but this is the
foundation for it all so thanks guys
keep at it keep with it see you in the
next video and I'm hoping you're
enjoying this series Thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
