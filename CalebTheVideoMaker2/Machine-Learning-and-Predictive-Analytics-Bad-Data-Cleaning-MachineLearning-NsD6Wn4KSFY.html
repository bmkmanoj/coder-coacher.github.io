to processing our data now I know you
guys just want to jump in there and
start writing machine learning
algorithms but as always I'm just going
to tell you to slow down you can't take
a large crappy data set and make good
data models you have to go through a
cleaning process so data cleaning is a
huge process okay
so I did a senior research project on
machine learning and it was more just
like a survey of machine learning and I
was I was hoping you know like to pick
up like 10 to 30 books and just read
like all the way through but the reality
is the content is very dense and man 90%
of what I studied was all about data
cleaning and data formatting and I
didn't even get to like algorithms until
I had like a week or two left in the
course so I'm gonna try to not make you
wait the rest of your life to learn a
machine learning algorithm but the
important thing to realize is that in
order for our algorithms to work
correctly and to work good we need to
have clean data and what does it mean to
have clean data that's what I'm going to
be defining in this video and the
upcoming section of videos where I'm
going to be talking about the key
processes to cleaning your data I
mentioned this briefly in a previous
video well just to reiterate think of
trying to teach a computer to recognize
cats you are going to give the computer
a bunch of images of cats to learn from
and importantly the images are going to
represent what a cat would normally look
like you're not going to give the
computer these extravagant images of
cats that would take a human a couple
seconds to really process that's because
those are not considered normal you want
a computer to recognize a normal cat and
then just like a human you can start
teaching the computer some of the more
extravagant versions of a cat but you
don't want a computer
to think what is abnormal is actually
normal so what that means is when we
have a giant data set this may not be
the best data to use and this goes back
to just the previous video with
continuous and categorical features some
of the cardinality might be messed up or
there might be a lot of outliers and
there's all these little things that are
going to distort the process of making
machine learning algorithms work to make
models so what we need to do is go
through a cleaning process we'll end up
with a slimmed down version that we can
use for a machine learning algorithms so
what are some of the things that we need
to do to our data to go from here to
here let's talk about it the cleaning
process goes through our data and gets
rid of bad data so what is bad data well
there's actually two categories of bad
data there is bad data from legit
reasons and bad data from illage entry's
ins or you could say valid bad data and
invalid bad data okay so what does this
mean well let's first talk about invalid
bad data this would come from an issue
with the ETL process which we talked
about in a previous video or it could be
an issue with the documentation process
on getting all of this data but mostly
has to do with getting the data and
correctly formatting the table the
analytics base table for processing so
for example if there's a feature where
every single row is null hole then
there's a chance there's some invalid
bad data essentially what that means is
you need to go back figure out where
something went wrong and you need to fix
it then there's valid bad data this is
the hard stuff so this is when the data
itself is kind of crappy but there was
no issue in how we process the data just
the data is crappy examples of this is
for example we might get data from two
different sources and one source has
extra features than the other source so
when you combine them we have a lot of
nulls and those are the three categories
of valid bad data missing data
five cardinality and outliers and in the
upcoming videos I'm going to be teaching
you guys how to deal with these three
issues so check out the next video where
we will go into missing data piece oh
please do not forget to subscribe okay
you don't realize how important that is
to me okay
please subscribe to this channel I would
be really grateful okay see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
