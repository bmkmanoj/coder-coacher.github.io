believe it's your 24th python tutorial
who knows yeah I'm pretty sure that's
right though this video I want to talk
about miss I can't really pronounce that
very well Nest's this is basically we're
going to be talking about if statements
within if statements so how does this
work well basically we're going to test
the first if statement and then within
that it's going to test some other ones
so let's try this so I'm not really
going to give any practical examples for
this I'm just going to be showing you
how it works so you can understand it
that way in your programs you can know
how to do this when you need all right
so let's say let's let's make a variable
first all right score and let's set it
to zero and then we say if score is
greater than 100 print you rock my socks
off
Oh oops loser
alright so here are our two options this
should return the second one loser or I
should print that all right so that's
how this works now what if we have a
nested if statement that means we have
an if statement within this block so
let's create a variable so now we have a
score and we have money okay now when we
copy this if statement down into here we
say within here we could say if money is
greater than 50 or let's say if money is
greater than or equal to 50 print you
win
all right so in order for this to win in
order for you to get this message you
have to have a score that's over 100 and
then we have a test if money is greater
than or equal to 50 we can also add an
else statement to this
close enough all right
so let's just take a look at this and
see how this is going to work and you
know what I think I'm going to actually
I'll do that and I'm gonna pause on you
anyways basically now it has an if
statement and it tests if your score is
over 100 if it is you rock my socks off
and we can say you have enough points
then it tests to say if your money is
over 50 and if it is you win if it's not
you have enough score but you do not
have enough monies and then if you for
some reason don't have enough score then
you get print loser so how does Python
run this well it goes from the outer
block first okay so it does this one and
if it tests true it goes and does all of
this if it tests false it does all of
this so let's say a test true so then it
works its way in first it's going to run
this and it'll continue running until we
get to the this if statement if this is
ran as true this this part right here
then this is ran if it's around as false
then this is ran so let's let's try it
we should just get looser because we
don't have enough of enough score all
right so now let's change score to 9001
and then we can take this if statement
we can copy it back down here now what's
gonna happen is we should get you win
we should it should print you rock my
socks off you have enough points and
then it should print out you win that's
because our score is greater than 100
and our money is greater than or equal
to 50 so let's try it Wow that's awesome
so that's just the basics of how a
nested if statement will work and you
might get very long programs so you
might have like if something and then
you might put your like whole program in
there and to check if a certain value is
met or whatever it doesn't really matter
how you use this I just want you to know
that it's possible and this is how you
set it up a one thing that you need to
pay attention to very closely is the
indentation you see here is an indent
here's a second indent these are what's
known as blocks okay now you can go
through the effort to like label each
block like block a B or C or whatever
right I think that's a bunch of
unnecessary work basically just think
that the first one that's going to be
all the way to the left and that's the
depth D code that it's ran first and
then if that's test that is true it goes
in one indent and then if that's tested
is true it goes in one more indent so
when we were looking at the structure of
our program we can work our way
backwards we see these are the farthest
one indented so they are part of this if
statement and then this whole block as a
whole is part of this if statement and
it's important to maintain that or else
you're going to get some funky things
happening
all right so pay attention to the
indents which allows you to see that
this if goes with this else and also
this if goes with this else otherwise
you're going to get very confused very
quickly and you'll probably get some
errors alright so that's all I have to
say in this video so I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
