for you welcome back - Caleb the video
maker - this video we are going to
continue our discussion on numeric data
types specifically we are going to be
talking about floating-point numbers in
more detail regarding scientific
notation so to get started we're going
to continue working on our file from the
previous video but if you don't have it
that's fine you can just start fresh
here so numeric data types see this is
what we have literally all we're doing
is printing some values it's really
nothing complicated since you've seen
the basics in the previous video it's
important for you to understand how
floating-point numbers are actually
stored well let's go down to this
floating point section floating point
numbers are actually stored in
scientific notation now if you need a
refresher of what scientific notation is
that's okay I didn't pay attention in
science class either essentially what
scientific notation is is you can take a
number and multiply it by 10 to some
power so for example if we have the
number 24,000 we could represent this as
2.4 times 10 to the 4th power if you
wanted to write it Mathi we could also
have negatives for example if we had the
value point 0 0 0 0 4 5 this would
become 4.5 times 10 to the negative 5th
sometimes it's actually easier to input
our data in scientific notation now when
we're typing it into a computer it's a
little bit different than this and I
will show you what it looks like in just
a minute
alright so I've simplified this code
quite a bit all we have now is a
variable and then we're going to print
this variable but we actually need to
initialize this variable with some value
but I want to do it in scientific
notation so how do we do that in the
computer well let's say we want to say
we have 25,000 dogs how do we do that
well we start with 2.5 and that's just
part of the rules of scientific notation
you go up to the point till we only have
one decimal on the left
and then we grab every number that's not
a zero now we put e and E is short four
times ten and then we say what power of
ten we want that to be right after it so
we would say four and essentially you
can think of it as this a decimal is
right here I multiply it by ten we scoot
over one multiply it by ten it's good
over one multiply it by ten waste good
over one multiply it by ten and we have
25,000 all right let's see if it works
as we expected and the output is 25,000
awesome there's only one problem this
here we are typing it in ourself this is
called hard coding and it's generally
frowned upon that's because if we ever
wanted to change this we would have to
go in here and retype something
recompile and then redistribute our
program to all of our customers that's
bad
we always want to try to get values from
some other source such as a database a
text file or input which is what we've
been doing so in the next video I want
to talk about how to get this as an
input from the user this will be useful
if we were given some kind of text
document with a ton of numbers but
everything was in scientific notation
well this next video might help you
convert that to numbers like this which
is called decimal notation by the way so
thank you guys that's all I have for
