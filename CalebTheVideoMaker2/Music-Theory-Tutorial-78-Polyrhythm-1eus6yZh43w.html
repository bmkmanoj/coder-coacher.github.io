about something more technical with a
cool fancy word
it's called polyrhythm alright I'll be
sure to never make spelling tutorials
cuz nobody will watch them well that's a
really good idea spelling tutorials
anyways polyrhythm are these two rhythms
that don't fit together now we've
already talked about an example of this
tuplets triplets they're not the same so
it's like I mean they're not together I
mean that was a horrible example that's
triplets in eighth notes or any triplet
sighs this pendulum speed but on that's
a polyrhythm is two or more rhythms oh
yeah I remember why I went upstairs so
in the last video is like okay I'm gonna
go upstairs real quick to get something
and I forgot I was gonna get I was gonna
get chapstick now that I said I don't
forget all right so two plus rhythms
that don't fit right fit together
now there's something cool about these
eventually they will hit at the same
time so for example if I play a beat
that is off with polyrhythm I'm saying
then eventually it'll connect with the
other one so if I have one that'll hit
you think let's say seven beats perm
perm yes seven notes in one beat and
then I have another one that plays eight
notes in one beat well guess what every
beat they're going to click for example
if I have seven let's say there's seven
in here versus eight well guess what
they're going to click here they're
going to click here you're going to
click here so for several every seven
notes this thing place this thing plays
eight and they will eventually line back
up hopefully that makes sense
because every B they start so one two
three four five six seven one two three
four five six seven one two three
five six seven or one two three four
five six seven eight one two three four
five six seven eight
they both start on the beat that's the
school about polyrhythm so for example
if I have rhythm that's two three they
will both start here and they're both
starting together this won't apply to
this one we'll play three but you can
see they're offset this one doesn't
quite line up with these but on the next
beat guess what this one's going to play
two this one's going to play three they
start it together again on the next beat
because this place two per beat this
place three per meter but I'll show you
that up close and personal one and two
so here's two here's one here's three
here's four just the beats really counts
you can see that you see my dad there we
go
now this is going to go one two three
and four and they're both both the first
note one two they're on the beat now for
this one up here the first note is still
on the beat this is an example of
polyrhythm and guess what this is
actually triplet triplets and eighth
notes so if we were to plan together
this one's going to hit a little bit
before this one and then a little bit
after this one and then we play them
again they're together so even though
they're not the same rhythm when you
play them together sometimes it'll sound
nice so if we're playing a song da da da
da like triplets while someone else is
going with eighth notes it can sound
really cool in fact I might drum long we
usually do that they got the end of like
every single song it's pretty awesome
okay
but um spyler them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
