our series I have some very useful
information for you guys in this video
we're going to be talking about logging
this is going to really help you when
you're developing signal our apps but
before we go into that I've noticed a
bug in our application and I think we
should fix that before I move on so I'm
not sure how this happened I might have
just got lost in the code and forgot to
update something but I'll show you the
problem I'll run the application and
it's gonna stay connected anytime
someone joins this web app but this
click mean was supposed to display the
server time on the page but when you
clicked it nothing's happening if you
look at the console log you can see that
it says my hub is not defined so let's
go back to the code and try to figure
this out by the way you can click here
and it will display where that error is
so you can see we're referencing my hub
which is not a thing anymore so let's go
back to the code and you can see that
this variable here used to be named my
hub and that would probably fix things
but what I'm gonna do is keep that at
chat because we already have it
references chat in multiple different
places so we just forgot to update this
here to chat and let's save that and
let's give it a run and see what happens
refresh and you can see it's working
also something interesting to share with
you guys notice how we're referencing
the chat here but it's not defined until
here I think the way that works is
JavaScript kind of goes through your
page and defines all the variables first
so I don't I don't really think it
matters on location but just putting it
at the top makes it kind of clear that
hey we're gonna reference this chat and
now everywhere below it references it
another thing I'm gonna take this event
listener and just move that to the
bottom because we don't really need that
right now so you can just hold alt and
use your arrow keys to kind of drag that
around so I think that's where it needs
to go save it make sure there's no red
squigglies or errors anywhere and just
to check sure check to make sure
everything's working let's go back to
the page
doing refresh nothing's broken so at
least it's nothing I know about one
other change that I'm going to do to
this script file is I'm gonna bring this
down to a new look that just makes it
all fit and it's a lot more clean so
that'll make it easier to read now onto
logged the actual purpose of this video
logging is built-in so there's really
not much we have to do we just have to
enable it so all we have to do is we can
do it after the connection is
established we can say dollar sign back
connection hub dot logging equals true
what this is going to do is start a
console log for signal R so if we go
back to our web app refresh check the
the console log you can see we get these
new signal our messages and includes the
time so this is going to tell us every
time we invoke a a method and a whole
bunch of other stuff so this is really
super cool so in this situation you can
see we're invoking the hub announced to
everybody method to go back to the the
code you can see that is right here we
are also triggering the client hub event
announced so essentially it's it's
logging that we hit this method and then
we hit this function and you can see how
this would be really helpful when
something's not working the right way
you can enable logging and it will just
tell you everything you need to know but
as I mentioned before logging is kind of
considered unprofessional in production
so you'll always want to try to remember
to turn logging off then people can go
in here and learn everything about your
code you can actually put some of your
own logs in this signal our logger and
the way you do that is really simple
first find a good spot where you want to
do some logging for example right here
we could say
connection Cub vlog and then in
parentheses put whatever you want to log
so we'll save that go back to the
browser do it refresh and I guess I
shouldn't expect the elements here
alright I forgot a period here yourself
add that save refresh and you can look
in here connected so what's the benefit
of that rather than just doing you know
console dot log well there's a couple
different things that makes this a
better method the first one would
probably be that it makes things a
little bit more organized because our
console laws appear different so let's
go back to our browser do refresh you
can see Hello here in black you can
clearly see the difference between our
signal our messages and our console
logging messages another benefit is that
you could temporarily turn signal our
messages off if you want to just see
console logging so the way you do that
is just set this to false but you can
see we still have our signal our message
here it's just not going to be displayed
so save that go back to the browser and
refresh and you can see none of those
messages are emitted onto the screen and
you can focus on just the console logs
so that's the very basics of logging
what I think I'm gonna do is I'm going
to just try to clean this code up a
little bit push it to the repository and
then I'll see you guys in the next video
thanks guys see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
