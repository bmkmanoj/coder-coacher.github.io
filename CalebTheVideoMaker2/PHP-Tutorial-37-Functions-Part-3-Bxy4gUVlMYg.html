series has been helping you if you liked
it please be sure to subscribe this
video and this little miniature function
series whatever you want to call it I'm
going to be talking a little bit more
about arguments and parameters but don't
worry I'm not gonna repeat the same
thing over and over again like I did the
last video it's pretty ridiculous
alright so I'm going to talk about
optional values and default values so
when you create a parameter you may want
it to be optional as in you don't
absolutely need it so I can't well to do
this you give it a default value so that
means if they don't put it in it gets
assigned a value by itself so these
pretty much the same thing here so we
create a function and then here I say X
let's make it number two well what if
they only do add five and you want their
wonted to automatically add two if they
don't add an extra argument there well
you can do that all you have to do is
put an equals equal sign after the RTD
parameter and set it equal to a value so
in case you can't see that it says this
number 2 equals oh yeah number 2 equal
to 2 huh number 2 equal to 2 it's a lot
of two's alright anyways
and it's
second parameter Oh anyways so this is
going to be the default value so when
you call add you put five in what's
going to be given to the boxes we need
to talk about last video five and the
default value of two which is going to
give us seven and obviously if you want
to be optional just set it to zero and
then it's going to add five and zero
which would give you zero I mean five
basic minutes food so that is one thing
you may need to do with your function
for future reference um the optional
values are always going to have to go to
at the end and you cannot skip once in
when you're calling the function so it's
important to put them at the end what I
wanted to talk about next was return so
you may have seen this before
a return is going to return a value so
within a function it can do something
with values but just because it does
something doesn't mean it returns that
value so for example if I created a
function just like this okay and what
we're going to do is we're going to X
plus y okay
so this is going to take the values we
get it so bad five and five it's going
to replace some and it's going to give
us but we have not told it to do
anything with this final value so
calling it does absolutely nothing
except run through this code and do
nothing with the value kind of pointless
in this situation in some situations you
may not need to return something you may
just need to run some
and then boom done but we will want to
do something so if we enter this nothing
is going to come of it because we
haven't returned the value so here's how
I think if we added a return in here
Boyet serenity its return what it's
going to do is it's going to take that
final values ten and give it to the
function so when it's called this is
going to be replaced with the return
value ten and it's going to echo that
value all right so what's the point of a
return well it allows us to use that
within another function as well so if I
wanted to let's say I had the adding
font of that added function and I want
that returned result to be added to be
multiplied with another number so I
might have an ADD function like this and
then I may have a multiply function and
then within here I want to use the
results of this function and three so
this cannot be done unless it returns a
value because if it doesn't return a
value this doesn't work because it's not
replaced when it returns the value of
five plus two we get seven this right
here is replaced with seven and we get 7
times 3 which equals 288 so hopefully
that was helpful and obviously that was
a joke because it equals 21
ha gotcha ha ha oh man that was funny
you need to lighten up so as we go on in
these series when you see a return all
it means is it's going to take the final
value or any value we want to return and
use that value for whatever we're doing
this allows us to echo it so if we
echoed and right here we're going to get
7 so yeah and this right here allows us
to use the final result of whatever we
put in here and it it returns it so we
can use it as another argument within
another function so those are two common
uses of return hopefully this video is
helpful hopefully if it was be sure to
leave a comment or and if it wasn't be
sure to leave a comment telling me what
I can improve upon thank you and be sure
to subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
