theory tutorial and we're going to be
going over the musical alphabet what's
that probably not you've probably heard
of this considering I mentioned in my
last videos we go through the letters a
up to G so we have the notes and the c d
e f and g if we look at keyboard you can
see that we have c d e f g baby back up
to C so you can see it whoops let's stay
attached extension cord now
there's also these Black Keys
which represent different pitches we
also have sharp and flat notes so we can
have an a sharp which references this
note right here a sharp it or raise it a
pitch that's a sharp and we can also
have B flat so if you have never seen
these before that's a sharp sign that is
a flat sign B flat we have B and we
flattened it or lower it a half step and
you can tell that's the same note as an
ace sharp those are set to be in
harmonic because B flat and a sharp
sound the same and they're the same key
so that's that oops what did I do
oh my gosh so we can have sharp notes
and five bits but if we're only going
let's say we're only going to use sharp
notes to represent this we can have a
sharp we have B if we sharp it take a
look at this
would you just look at it look at this
so we have a B if we raise this sharp it
we have we have a seat because there's
no black key in between these two notes
so B sharp heavy sharp like smart
telling you oh nevermind but anyways we
we can't have a B sharp
unless it's a C so B sharp is actually
equal to C I know that it's probably
confusing okay so now we have a sharp B
C sharp d sharp e F sharp and G sharp
the reason we do not have an e sharp is
because there is no black key between E
and F so all in all we can if we start
from scratch
we're gonna have a mysterious little
scrap Hey a sharp B C C sharp B d sharp
F I'm sorry that feels like wave is a
right e F F sharp and G sharp F sorry G
F sharp G and G sharp that's one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve specific pitches within an
octave and if you remember an octave
travels from one letter up to the same
letter of the next so those are an
octave C and C is an octave a to a is an
octave so that means there's 12 specific
pitches and remember a sharp tells to be
b-flat it just depends on how you look
at it B C C sharp D d sharp e f-sharp G
g-sharp and then we go up to the next a
which we don't count because it's in a
different set so now there's 12 that is
the entire musical alphabet and
basically we're going to build off of
this for the rest of the entire series
Chuey
so yeah see you then subscribe and yeah
