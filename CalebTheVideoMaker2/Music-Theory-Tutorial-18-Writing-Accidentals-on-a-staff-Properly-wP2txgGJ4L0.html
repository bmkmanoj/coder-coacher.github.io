and this is you your 18 tutorial maybe
yeah I think so
now I probably could fit this in the
last video but I was rambling on it it's
kind of cold in here so yeah I'm just
gonna make a real quick video this one
is going to be about accidentals on a
staff staff is the five line way to
write music sorry for repeating myself
so many times just kind of make I make
sure I drill this in your head oh by the
way what was that term I said last video
that meant different notes but same
sound and harmonic shouldn't it I'm just
kidding I'm sure you do that because I
said it a lot and you learnt it right
but anyways Oh getting so sidetracked
okay we had sharp natural oops
flat double flat and double sharp don't
ask me why that's not like that twice
who knows it's important when we're
writing on a staff Karen's gonna make
three lines that we put it in the right
position for example if here is our note
and we want to sharp this specific note
it's placed before the no you probably
ask him why cuz earlier I was writing
notes like this G flat well I could
explain when we write the note name we
write it after so what's this note it's
G flat but it says let's just say this
line is G but it says flat G yes but
it's telling the musician to flat the G
so there's like an invisible ball here
and when you flat a G it becomes G flat
you see so the other reason we put it
before the note
is so you when you're reading music and
you're doing it real fast you see this
and you say oh okay the next it's gonna
be sharp let's say it was backwards and
we had notes like this and you're
playing anyway okay there's G play it g
g oh there's another G g-sharp
dang it I didn't see it because we read
left from right no left to right this
direction so when we're reading music
it's important that we put the flat sign
or sharp sign before the note so we know
what's coming up a flat note so now I
won't miss it so I put a sharp here
instead of here it's gonna say oh this
notes gonna be sharp not aha I missed
this note that was sharp and I messed up
the music so yeah so what we learned so
far is the accidental types and when
we're writing the note like a letter we
put it after we're writing it on a line
they put it before sweet but there's
also one more thing
when you're writing you have to make
sure it's placed in the proper position
horizontally for example here's our note
on this line and we want to sharp it the
proper way to write a sharp you see this
little box here's a sharp sign blown up
this box right here
that's it crosses through the line so we
have to make sure it's like that if we
play state let's say we had a no here
and we placed it here
or offset a little bit the person is
going to think you're talking about this
line so they'll sharp this note make
sense
the placement horizontal vertically
sorry I said horizontal earlier of it mm
vertically it's important to space it on
a line properly oh shoot
drop this like a hundred times already
so if here's a line it's like this sharp
flat same thing for natural but I can't
really draw it that good it crosses
through the box double flat and for the
double sharp X is just right on the line
like that now in the future what I'm
talking about writing music there's
something called a measure and I don't
really know what that is yet but
basically we break up music and little
sections so we'll have some notes here's
some notes here's some notes here and
we'll have like let's say four beats and
this measure four beats four beats so
one two three four one two three four
it's just an easier way to keep music
organized when we have a sharp sign in a
measure or a natural sign or anything
it's going to continue so if I have a G
sharp and then I have a G it's going to
be actually G sharp even though it
doesn't say G sharp I'm telling you guys
oh all the tech following G's are going
to be G sharp when you get to the end of
the measure it resets on
next that is why we have a natural note
so if I want this to be natural let me
show you on the keyboard if I want you
to play a G I mean a G sharp sorry
followed by a G so then I have to have a
natural note that way you know oh it's
still not sharp but once we get to the
end of measure resets so if we have a G
right here and there's no sharp sign
before it and then we play it just like
a G sweet so that's all you pretty much
need to know about accidentals for now
and in the next video we're going to be
talking about something really super
awesome so catch you there and subscribe
