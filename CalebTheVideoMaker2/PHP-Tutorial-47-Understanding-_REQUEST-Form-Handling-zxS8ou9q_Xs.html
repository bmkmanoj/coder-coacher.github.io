tutorial my name is Caleb if it's
helpful please be sure to subscribe
alright so in the last video I talked
about how form validation looks when
using arrows and simple terms well this
video I want to talk about the actual
specific what we would type into an HTML
page in PHP page to use our form data in
our PHP script alright so in our HTML
page we create what's known as a form
which is where we submit our data form
and then what we have is in action and
equal sign now whenever we have an
attribute in HTML the value is put in
double quotes so we can make it
validate dot PHP alright so what this is
saying form action equals validate dot
PHP that's saying once this form is
submitted so if someone clicks submit
well all this values all these values
are sent to the PHP script with the page
title validate dot PHP so if you have
another one name of Val V for short
VBS be all that way because we have an
action it knows to send it to this one
and not this one so that is what the
action does and that is pretty much how
we would type that out so just to speed
things up I types I wrote up what an
HTML page would look like and I'm Suman
here so you can see this right so it's
pretty simple we have the form action
what we just wrote and then we assign it
a value handle dot PHP that's another
example it could pretty much be whatever
page we want to use and then we have the
method the method is how it's submitted
and we're using the post
alright and I'll be explaining that in
just a second input type that is an
actual form piece within our webpage so
let me zoom out here for a sec if we
have a web page this form it asks for
something so we could have okay enter
your email and then we could enter a
password right well this input type
that's saying we want it to be a text
rather than a checkbox where you can say
oh you're a boy or a girl
that would be a radio button where you
can pick one or the other or if it's
like select your favorite foods then
it'd be a checkbox we also have text
areas for example and what we want is
the input type to be text because we're
putting text within that spot so we then
give it a name name equals email all
lowercase letters within double quotes
and then we end the input this is the
basic HTML form creation right here and
then you can add other stuff such as a
field set and legend and then so forth
from there but this is pretty much the
basic absolute beginner HTML form in the
last few videos I actually created an
HTML form that you could go view if you
want to check out how an HTML form is
actually typed up alright so this name
right here this is going to take the
value email and as I said in the last
video all of these values are going to
be stored in what's known as a super
global array alright so for this video
we'll be talking about the super global
known as
request and I'll be explaining why we
are going to use this one all right so
what requests does is it will take those
values put within that form and assign
it it'll put it in this array that you
can then you reference the values so in
this whiteboard example we use the name
email so that means this is an
associative array where email points to
a value such as whatever your email
maybe I was gonna write an email out but
I changed my mind
all right so the request method can take
values from post and the get methods so
both of these you can receive the values
from if if for example in the HTML form
for the method I put get instead of post
we can still use the request superglobal
array there is also a post array and a
debt array so if we want specifically
the HTML form is using post we could
those values are also going to be sent
to the post array and if you're using
get those values are going to be sent to
the get already well we're just going to
use request for now because it can be
either from the post or it can be from
the get now as you get more advanced
there's reasons why you would want to
use the specific post or the get array
but for now I want to illustrate how
things work and I'm going to be using
the request array so we can just show
that you can get it from the post and
the gift pretty simple so we want to use
the request array soap since an
associative array that means we have
keys that are strings so the key would
have been
email all right and you can see that
right here because the name is email
that is given as the key this points to
devalue whatever you put within the form
so if you put pool guy twelve one three
at hotmail.com for example well this is
the actual value this is the key so this
points to here and then we can reference
that using array notations which we
learned about decent while back but not
too far back so to do that within square
brackets will use a single quote and we
would use email so this is an example of
how it is set up this is then going to
point to the value let's say the person
put in their email as cool guy at
mail.com so that's what the person
actually typed in to the forum well this
is how we reference that data this right
here this is the syntax that we would
put within our PHP script and then to
validate that we this we could test if
it's in the right form or if it's the
right values and so forth but we're not
going to be getting into that yet right
now I just want to be explaining how to
get data from an HTML form well if you
want to make things simple so you'll
have to type this out when referencing
it all the time we could assign this to
another variable which is not necessary
I'm just showing you for example we
don't always have to use this array
notation we can take this value which
was cool guy at Hakam and to assign it
to another
table we create a new variable you see
that
so we could say email right and we can
assign this the value so this is the
basic setup of what we could call a
shorthand variable I feel like you can't
see that because of the glare or
something
well this means that email the variable
now has the value cool guy mail and then
we could echo out this we could use this
in an easier fashion but if you don't
want to that's fine you can still use
the the longhand version using it as an
array but this way you can use it as a
string so it's defense if you want to
use your value as an array you can use
this syntax if you want to use it as a
string you can assign the I'm sorry you
can use this syntax up here if you just
want to use it as an array if you want
to use that I was in a string you could
assign this to another variable which is
going to take the value and give it to
the variable and the way that this is
dynamic is that we don't necessarily
know what this person is going to put as
their email so the way with what the
reason why we assigned that to another
variable and we didn't put anything
specific all we did was email and then
we use that we basically just put this
array notation down here and assigned it
as a string to another variable the
reason we did that is because we don't
know what this person is going to put in
as there
email we can't write that out so we have
to reference that using the the array
notation
which is where the value is stored all
right so I know that was complex
hopefully I've managed to explain that
well and as we go on more videos it will
be explained in more depth and so forth
