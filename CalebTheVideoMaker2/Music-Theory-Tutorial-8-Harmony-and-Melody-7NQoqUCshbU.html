be talking about two pieces of a song
and that's the harmony and the melody
here at these album you're learning so
many new words harmony melody now when
we play two notes or three notes or
anything more than one together
for example this or
when we play notes that are together
like that they are said to be harmonic
harm monk they're in harmony so this
means those notes are played in harmony
or they are here harmonic or they create
the harmony of the song now if we play
notes one after the other
they are melodic they create the melody
of the song so if we're going to create
a small song we have the harmony and the
melody the melody will be a nice theme
catchy harmony is going to be nice calm
beautiful typically sometimes not so
much so now if we're going to create a
song teach you some awesomeness right
here create this larger so here I know a
song here it goes we think
that's the heart that's the melody the
harmony would be this is like impossible
here's the that's the harmony so we made
typically four very simple songs have
four notes in the melody for every thing
in the Harmony we would call it a chord
but it's not always a chord but anyways
the harmony doesn't usually play quite
as often the melody typically takes the
lead it's the melody it's like what
sounds good shot is like a melody not
like Saudis harmony just doesn't make
sense so yeah that's the basics of
harmony melody in the next video I'll be
talking about something awesome what's
new so subscribe and follow me on
Twitter and yeah see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
