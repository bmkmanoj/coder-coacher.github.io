Python tutorial series so in the last
previous I mean in the last videos we've
talked about three big things we talked
about lists tuples and now we're talking
about another similar thing that is
known as a map so what is a map
well a map is also a a grouping of
different things but instead of having
an index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 we have keys that
point to that object so I will show you
how to make a map let's go with the duh
let's think
hmm let's go with favor it Oh No okay I
have a good one okay let's say me and my
friend my homie seadog invented our
secret language okay and every single
word in the secret language has a
connection to an English word all right
so let's let's do this secret language
now for syntax if we wanted to create a
list we would use an assignment operator
and square brackets if we wanted to make
a tuple we would use parentheses now if
we want to make a map we use we use
these little curly braces so let's do
this what we do is we make the key so
let's say Y comma Hama okay that's our
secret word right I know it's weird but
whatever then what we do is we put a
colon and then we put the English word
French fries so basically you go to the
store you say I want some yarmulke maja
maja and they're like oh here's your
french fries right cool and then what
you do that's a connection this this one
here this is the key
this is the value there's an association
between the key and the value the colon
makes that association it's saying that
this is the key for this value so when
we say yarmulke Mahama har whatever it's
going to be french fries now if we want
to make another item in this list for
our secret language we put a comma and
then we can put another thing within
this list so let's let's make another
word let's make it so we do alright and
what this means is this means homie all
right so now we have two words in our
language this is the first one this is
the second one and the English meaning
this is the meaning for the first word
this is the meaning for the second word
alright so let's do a third word let's
make it the yeah that that's our third
word I know it's crazy and this means
you looking pretty hot so now here's
language we got yarmulke Mihama sui do
and sluggish position all right and then
we can just press ENTER and now our new
map is created so we have three keys in
this language here's our first key here
is our second key and here is our third
key you could also do this the other way
around
french fries being the key and this
being the value it doesn't really matter
for this example but for some examples
it will matter
basically if if you can flip it either
way it doesn't really matter which one
comes first whether the key is the
English or the key is the secret
language so our three keys are those
ones and then we have the three values
french fries homie and you looking
pretty hot
and we can access the values by using
the keys so if you want to use like a
translator we could be like I want you
to print and then within print we want
to print let's print secret language and
then within these little we access these
with the square brackets just like this
we can say Yama let me try and get this
right you know I'm a comma Hama okay and
then you can press Enter okay so we got
an error so let's try figure it out all
right yeah so we forgot to put a a
little quote and I just press ENTER to
bring that down to the bottom so now
when we do that it brings french fries
it translated our secret language and it
gives us the English value french fries
you see what I'm saying so that's how
you work this an original in the
original lists that we used when we did
that instead of using a yarmulke Mihama
we would just use like an index number
so let's try that let's make a list list
and within this list we got square
brackets hey hello and sup and we will
name this list will name it greetings
all right so now when we want to print
this we print and then within this
parenthesis we can say greetings square
brackets and then we could say 0 that's
saying the index 0 it should return hey
well when we go back to a map rather
than having the index 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 we have
the indexes Yamaka Mihama as we do and
slit of shizuka see what I'm saying so
that is how the map works another thing
we can try doing this print and then
within here you could say secret
language and watch what happens it will
print all of the keys and all of the
values with the colon separated so it
pretty much works the same way as a list
the only real major difference is that
we no longer use these indexes we use
our keys that point we use I'm sorry we
use our keys like yarmulke Mihama
to point to the values another thing we
can't do a couple of simple things like
we can't we can't concatenate things the
same way like we couldn't concatenate
two maps it doesn't work you'll get an
error but we can do things like update
old values we could try that we could
try let's let's do it
let's go mmm we want it to be secret
language and then another thing you want
to notice when you create when you
create the map you use curly braces and
then when you use it in the program you
use square brackets why I'm not really
sure but basically you use it exactly
the same as a list but when you're
defining it you use these curly braces
to tell Python that you want this to be
a map not a list but when you use it you
can just use square brackets all right
so what we can do is we can change some
of the values within the map so let's
try do that we can go
I'm sorry well is it a secret
I'm gonna a spell secret anymore secret
language and then we can access parts of
this language so we could say Yama come
home ah and we can give it a new value
we could say this means teacher here
so like if you're doing bad things in
school and then you're just like you see
a teacher coming down the hall you just
go and then everyone's like what but
your secret friend I mean your friend
knows that you mean that a teacher is
coming that's basically how that works
and then you can press ENTER and then
when we print secret language you see
that yarmulke Mihama now points to
teacher here same thing we can use the
delete command just so we could go
delete secret language and then within
these brackets we could go let's delete
so we do and now when we print this we
can see that there no longer exists so
that's just an introduction and maps
obviously all of us can go in more
detail but I'm just trying to give you
an introduction so you know how to use
all of these things so I just want you
to be clear on the difference between a
list tuple and a map a list hat is a
list of objects that can be updated and
changed a tuple is a list of objects
that can't be updated or changed a map
is a list of objects that can be updated
or changed but has keys
rather than just numbered indexes so
hopefully that was helpful and in the
next video we will be moving on to
something new so thank you for watching
and please please please please please
be sure to subscribe and yeah spoiled
that wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
