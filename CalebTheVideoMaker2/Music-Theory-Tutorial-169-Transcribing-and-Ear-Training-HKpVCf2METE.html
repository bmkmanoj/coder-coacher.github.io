music theory tutorial and in this video
I'm going to be talking about something
a new kind of mean it's all music so
it's kind of similar but it's different
sana really know but anyways
occasionally you may be asked to
accompany a music play or something or
some somebody's performance or to
recreate a song in some kind of way so
that's what we're going to be talking
about in this video and a couple more
videos to come after this one and
basically when you take a song that
you're listening to and you don't have
it directly in front of you on sheet
music or any type of writing system
notation to tell you what to play and
you have to recreate it from ear this is
known as transcribing so that's what
transcribing is that's where you take
you can figure out the chords and notes
and the rhythms and put it all together
to get as close as possible to the
original song people often do this for
like popular songs when they want to
make a parody or recreate it with their
band and do something like that so that
is known as transcribing so I have a
couple steps here that you can follow
for a general idea of how to start
transcribing but you don't have to
follow this exactly first one I have
here is to segregate the instruments so
basically figure out what instruments
are in the song let's say you hear a
guitar you hear a bass guitar you hear a
piano playing this beautiful piece and
then you hear drum set probably and you
actually hear someone playing a cello
and then someone playing harmonica so
that's a good set of instruments and
then you can't hear anything else then
chances is chances are you're on the
right path you got what instruments
figure it out and from what you know
there's no other instruments and if you
recreate the song and you can tell
something's missing you may want to
listen a little closer and see if
there's any buddy plan the same notes of
someone else that make it sound like
it's not there but yeah basically just
figure out what instruments
are in the song next one is memorize
memorize each part individually so try
and listen to the drums segregate the
drums in your brain and just hear or
whatever they're playing and then
memorize that so then you can kind of
play along with the song and maybe the
phils or the solos or whatever get them
memorized as well as for the piano or
harmonica whatever whatever whatever
instrument you want to do at the time
figure out the part and try to memorize
it so you can actually sing it or play
it along with them next one is phrases
so if you remember in a few videos ago
we talked about musical phrases we use
like letters a B a basically just figure
out the construction of the song do we
have a verse then a chorus and then the
bridge or do we have another verse or do
we have a musical solo or do we have the
outro or what what do we have basically
just make your own um phrases then what
you can do is figure out the time
signature so that's like is it four four
two three four two two three you can
usually figure that out by listening
closely there may be some confusion like
is it for four or is it to two well you
can usually figure it out but figure
that out as close as possible that's a
really important one or else things are
going to line up right so try to figure
out the time signature if you don't
remember much about that go see my
timing videos at the near beginning of
the series Midway over time signature
and comment on cut time asymmetric time
signatures et Cie go look at that stuff
then once you got that figure out what
time signatures in figure out the
phrases how many measures they are for
say on the verse might be sixteen
measures the chorus might be eight and
then a musical solo might be 10 that's
just an example that's what you can do
then i recommend you figure out the
chord changes so many songs use very
chord changes such as this goes back to
the chord progression IV back to I and
repeat just IV IV IV IV VI VII whatever
however you want to hear it this is an
example of a chord progression and
although this may be C to G it can also
be D to a and so forth so what I would
try to do is just figure out the Roman
numerals because they all kind of sound
similar and if you can play it on a
piano or guitar that'd be great and if
you can try these chord progressions
that'd be awesome then once you got that
out I would try to find exactly what
chords they are so for example try to
find the tonic you can fit you can
figure this out by figuring out what key
it is in so you can also figure out the
key and write that one down that's an
important one if you can figure out what
key the song is in that's great so let's
say the tonic is d and you play AC major
chord it's going to sound conflicting
and not good but if you raise it up to a
D and you hear something click then the
chances already figured out the chord
progression BD a back to d dad yay so
that's those are just some examples of
patterns you can follow to start
figuring out a song dissecting it and
rewriting it yourself using these tips
will guide you in the right direction to
being an expert at transcribing songs so
the next video we're going in to go
we're going to go into some specifics so
