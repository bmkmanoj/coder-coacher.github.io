tutorial series in this video we're
going to be talking a new aspect of
programming known as loops so previously
we talked about a control flow
structures which they control the flow
of the program for example an if
statement it can either be true and go
left in the program or it can be false
and go right figuratively
basically it chews it it controls the
flow of the program and changes either
the entire program or aspects of the
program depending upon a certain value
or a comparison well with loops what it
will do is it will go through something
a certain number of times or until a
value is true or basically until we tell
it to stop and we'll give a condition
and it will follow that condition and
once that condition is completed the
loop will stop so let's explain what the
first loop we will be using is known as
a for loop now when you're first
starting out with for loops these syntax
which is the way it's structured the
other way you type it can be a little
bit confusing but the first thing you do
is you say for to start the loop and
then you give a variable you don't have
to define this variable up here you can
just make it up right here so for X and
then we can do something such as in
range and then we give it a range so
here's how we give a range we give the
first number and then we give this the
number to stop at stop before all right
and then we just like an if statement we
put a colon at the end of it so this
might be a little confusing if you're
starting out so I just recommend that
you memorize the way this is set up but
basically it's going to do something for
every single number within this range so
for every X in the range of 0 to 10 do
something with it now let's say we could
we could just say print
X sorry and then we can press ENTER and
run it and you can see what it does is
it prints every single X starting at
zero and stopping before 10 0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 so a total of 10 numbers now
basically what this did is for every X
within the range of 0 to 10 it printed X
so X was 0 and then for the next time X
was 1 and then for the next time it was
2 and then for the next time was 3 and
so forth that's not the only thing we
can do we don't have to print X let me
take this back down here and I'll show
you what I mean we could say print hello
so I forgot to quote it hello my home
biscuit be sure to subscribe
yo girl and then we could print that and
it will print it 10 times so that's how
we can print something an X number of
times and obviously we don't just have
to print although our skills and
programming are very limited right now
in this series so that's why that's
pretty much all we ever do within these
conditionals but as we get farther we
will do more things of course so now for
every X in the range of 0 to 10 all it
did was print the same thing every
single time so it didn't actually print
the it--are the iteration number of X
what I mean by that is each time it goes
through this X is increased 1 so X
starts at 0 and then we print 0 then it
goes to 1 and then we print 1 and on in
this previous example well for this
example we never printed that number all
we did was print this string right here
that's why I printed it a bajillion
times specifically 10 well you know
that's pretty much a bajillion now one
of the most common and most useful
reasons for I for loop is to do things
with items in a list so let's make a
friends list and if you don't remember
how to make lists you just make an
assignment operator and
you square brackets and then for every
item in the list you just separate it by
commas and you don't put a comma at the
end because there's nothing else coming
after that so here are my friends me god
and a Jimmy from school alright cool so
these are all my friends right now what
we can do is we can we could print these
out we could say print and friends and
it will tell us all of our friends but
with a for loop we can do more things
such as this we could say 4 X and we'll
actually here just to make it easier
I'll take this up here and we'll just
bring it down here by pressing enter so
for X in range 0 through 10 what we're
going to have to do is we're just going
to get rid of this range function and
we're just going to instead we're going
to put our new list so now for every
single value in friends which there's
three of them meet God and Jimmy from
school we're going to print something
out so right now if we did it like this
we should get three values you see but
we don't want to do that let's do
something new we could say print we
could say welcome to my friends list or
if we wanted to change for every person
we could say print X now list me God
Jimmy from school as separate values
rather than as a list another thing we
can do on top of this is if you remember
awhile ago we talked about using
variables within printing and we can
also do that when we are using a for
loop so let's try that now let's copy
this rope here and then within our print
statement we could say hello and then
you are my friend
your name is and then we use a little
percent and then we use an S right and
then what we do is we go percent and
then we tell uh what variable to put in
here and because we righty rating
through X we're going to use X all right
so let's try it hello you are my friend
your name is me hello you are my friend
your name is God hello
you are my friend your name is Jimmy
from school so that's a really awesome
way how we can I T rate through an
entire list and do things with our
values let's try another thing with
upside let's try another thing with
numbers so let's make a new list we'll
just make it numbs and let's make it
five three and ten okay and then let's
make a for loop we'll just copy this one
and we're going to say for X in num so
for every value within nums we are going
to print X plus five so now it's going
to add five to every single value within
nums and you can see 10 8 and 15 so you
can see we're not only limited to
strings so if you had like a list of
numbers that you needed to change all
together such as multiplying them by 10%
or something like that well that is how
you could do that that's a good
introduction for for loops and in the
next video we'll be getting into more
some more stuff but for now I think
that's all this video is getting pretty
long so be sure to subscribe and I will
see you all in the next video thank you
