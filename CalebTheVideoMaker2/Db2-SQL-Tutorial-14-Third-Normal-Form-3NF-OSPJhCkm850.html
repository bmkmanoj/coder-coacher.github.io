this is Caleb from Caleb the video maker
- this video is going to be over third
normal form so this is the last normal
form I have enough energy to care about
so we're gonna stop after this one and
move on to something else
once you get beyond third normal form
it's almost like nitpicking like oh this
thing's basically good enough but I'm
gonna make you change it anyways
personal opinion just thrown out there
so I think third normal form is more
than adequate to consider your database
normalized
alright I'll quit wasting your time
let's get started what exactly is third
normal form well if you remember in the
previous video if you watched it I had
an intermediary table for user interest
and one of the columns that I tried to
put in that table was an interest
category and then I was like oh this
doesn't really belong here let's move
that to the interest table what we have
is an interest table that looks
something like this so we have three
columns the interest ID the actual
interest value and then the category
that the interest belongs to like I said
in the previous video this could be a
foreign key to a category table if you
want to set that up for now you can just
leave it as a varchar' for example and
just type in your category and now let's
say we add a column to this this is a
violation of third normal form but I
actually haven't even explained what
their normal form is so I should
probably do that first third normal form
deals with something called transitive
dependencies essentially what a
transitive dependency is is when a
column depends on the primary key as it
should in normal database design but it
does so through another column if you
think about switching a specific
interest so let's let's think of an
interest I'm interested in computer
science that might be in the category
STEM science technology engineering and
math right well if we describe that we
would say like oh this is a category for
all things relevant to science
technology engineering and math
including blah blah blah blah just a
description of whatever the category
describes and you can decide whether
that description is useful or not but
for this example assume we decided we're
going to have a category description now
if we change the interest we're talking
about to something else like you know
acrylic painting well now we're going to
be talking about art so the category
might be art and the description would
say Oh anything relating to the creation
or production of whatever you know that
would be the description of the category
so you can see when we change the
interest the category description also
changes because we switched from the
interest from computer science to
acrylic painting and in the process the
category description changed so this
category description does depend on the
interest but it does it transitively
which means through another column like
this so when you get this hop here you
have a transitive dependency the way you
fix this is by going from the entity in
going up one hop and whatever this
attribute is you're going to take that
and make it an entity in its own table
and now you can take this dependency
right here and move it over here and now
since it'll be referring directly to the
category it's not a transitive
dependency this is just a normal
dependency but how do we fix this mess
over here what you do is you replace
this with a category ID and that is
going to reference this category ID over
here
so that's your foreign key reference
then you're just going to delete this
category description because it's not
needed in this interest table and this
makes sense we don't want to have this
in here because we're going to have the
category description in here for every
single interest that doesn't make sense
we really only need the category
description one time once for each
category so that is how you fix third
normal form and get rid of transitive
dependencies if you have a chain where
you don't just have three dependencies
or you have four or five just follow
that process through all of them you
start with just going up one dependency
breaking that off into a new table and
then move all the other dependencies
that are connected to that into that
table and then you just repeat the
process go to the next append
move that into a new table and so forth
so yeah there you go guys that's first
normal form second normal form and third
normal form so thank you for watching if

go give DB to a try I'm out of things to
say so I will see you in the next video
