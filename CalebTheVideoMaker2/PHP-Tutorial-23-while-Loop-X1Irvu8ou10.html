actually going to be pretty easy
compared to the last one so this is the
wild loop it has to be like one of the
most easy things to understand hopefully
but if you don't understand it that
doesn't mean anything it I didn't
understand it first either so it looks
like this while then in parentheses we
have another test and then we have curly
braces all right so what do we put in
here well anything we want we can say
wow variable X is less than 100
for example now this means it's going
because it says wild it's going to
repeat it's a loop so while X is less
than 100 this is going to count so then
we could say echo all right so here's an
example ever while X is under 100 it's
going to echo yay so basically it's like
this we enter the test if it's true we
go to the result and then we go back to
the test and then back to the result and
we just keep going in this loop and then
once it's false we leave the loop and go
to the false option which we don't have
so it just goes on with the program so
now there's one problem we're not doing
anything to change X so it's going to
continue forever unless we do something
to change X so if I say variable X
equals 5 well that's always going to be
less than 100 so it's going to echo Y a
forever and over and over and over and
over and over and over and over again so
you may want to do something such as
X plus plus incremented if you don't
remember that is basically that's going
to add 1 to X every single time so it'd
be 5 the first time but then it'd go to
6 and then 7 and then 8 and then 9 and
then 10 and it would print yeh like 95
or 96 or 94 times so that is the basics
of a while loop
pretty simple oftentimes this will be
used to retrieve data from a database so
it's pretty important yeah
this is videos only like 2 minutes and
50 seconds and I have nothing else to
say so I'm just gonna leave it at that
thank you for watching and I will see
you in the next video thank you and
