Caleb the video maker and I'll be your
teacher whatever today your instructor
so this is the first video I've made in
like four months maybe three months I
don't know it's long well I think a
woman that likes five months maybe I
don't know basically I've been in school
so sorry if my teaching skills have
depleted but anyways this video is going
to be over binary specifically decimals
in binary so I figure most of you are
just random people who like oh I want to
know how to do fractions in binary let's
look it up I'm just kidding
so I'm guessing most of you are either
in a class or you're really into
computer science so this video is going
to be in depth although not everything
is necessary like if you just want to
know like a simple step by step how to
convert from fractions or decimal to
binary using fractions like 0.5 or point
7 decimal points essentially well I'm
going to give you a step by step process
at the end of this video so if you don't
want to watch everything and skip to
that but until then we're just going to
be talking about decimals fractions so
forth in binary and I'll be explaining
it all so as for prerequisites I did an
introduction to binary video that's not
necessarily required to watch this video
but you do need to understand basic
binary and also basic fractions so like
3/4 you need to understand well if you
had like apply that's gonna be like that
much which I mean yeah I'm sure most of
you guys understand fractions I mean
come on all right well if you don't just
learn fractions first and then come back
to this video all right so when we have
a decimal number that means it's base 10
so that means we count in 10 so this
number is 100
one thousand ten thousand and then we
use a decimal point to represent any
fractions of warm so if you guys ever
learned you're your place values you
know you have the ones place the tens
place the 100's place the thousands
place and then on the other side of the
decimal
you have the 1/10 the 1/100 one one
thousandth and the one ten thousandth
well these are what we are going to try
to represent in binary now obviously in
decimal you can use up numbers other
than one well in binary you're only you
only have the option 0 or 1 so you have
to figure out how to represent fractions
or decimals in binary
now just first some vocabulary sake this
isn't necessarily required to understand
the concepts this point between numbers
so I'll give like twenty four point six
in decimal well this this little point
right here this is known as the radix
point probably not okay well anyways
this is known as the radix point now the
radix this is another word for the base
of the number so in this case deci so in
decimal this is known as the decimal
point in binary if you had like one one
point zero zero one this is known as the
binary point but in general the term for
this this little period is a radix point
so that's probably what I'll be
referring to it mostly throughout this
video and other binary videos in the
future all right so when you look at a
decimal point such as point 25 let's
make it
Oh point five this is technically a
fraction a fraction is part of a whole
so if you have one 0.5 represents a half
of that so yeah this is technically one
half follow me then if we have something
like point 25 well this is technically
one-fourth I'm going to get a drink well
so we are when we convert these two
fractions we can then understand how to
convert them to binary because binary
doesn't understand Oh point 25 although
it is capable of understanding fractions
all right so let's look at a little
example before we dive into this
tutorial we'll just consider this like
the pre tutorial I guess whatever so if
you have the number 2.5 well you can
consider it we can consider like
breaking this off into two separate
sections greater than 1 less than 1
right now to represent two in binary
it's one zero this is the ones places to
place oh yeah - now just like in decimal
we can use a little decimal place well
we can use a binary place or the radix
point and then anything passed here
represents fractions of one so a 1 here
is going to represent 1/2 anything past
that will be 1/4 1/8 1/16 so then you
kind of you kind of get this pattern
here where spring stuff here so you can
see you have the separator here and you
have 1/2 1/4 1/8 and it keeps doubling
and you can see it's it's all a division
of 2 so
/ - on this side it's all a multiple of
two so you get one two four eight and so
forth hopefully you guys get that
so kind of working on the studio set up
cuz I don't I don't really like how I
how I have to use so we represent
fractions in binary
by using divisions of - now that that's
all cool and all but that is that does
limit us because if a fraction is not a
is not part it's not sorry it's not a
pattern of - well then we can't really
get the right answer so if we have
something like this to 0.75 well this
one's not too bad because we have one Oh
on the left side of the radix point and
then we have a half and then we have 1/4
1/2 plus 1/4 well we can just least
common multiple or whatever it's called
and we get to 4 plus 1/4 which is equal
to 3/4 which is the same thing as 0.75
so this is how we would represent that
number in binary now we're going to go
into the in-depth tutorial so yeah oh
hey so now we are going to first talk
about converting binary with the
fractions back to decimal and then we're
going to talk from decimal back to
binary so the first one binary to
decimal is like extremely super easy so
I can probably explain this and like 20
minutes then I'm getting like 5 I don't
know
but alright so first we have to realize
that each place marker what does it call
to be a place value with in binary
is either a multiple of two or a div
divisor is a division of to be I don't
know but so what that gives us if we
have this radix point the binary point
that separates this side being multiple
of two and this side being a division of
two right you follow me
so each position to the left doubles by
two each position to the right gets cut
in half by two so we get all right so
I'm going to write the decimal
equivalence so I'm not writing in binary
right now so we have 1 2 4 8 16 32 and
then we can just put these little boxes
here to represent that place value now
on this side it's just the same thing
except it's a division so we get 1/2 1/4
1/8 1/16 1/32
all right so now these boxes just
represent the place values now I have an
example here that I will go through all
right let's try one 101 101
I think it's right so 1 101 101 so when
we put them in these place values it
becomes very clear but when you first
look at it you get one one oh one point
101 one and that looks kind of confusing
if you don't realize what you're doing
and you just try jump at it too quickly
but when we do it this way it's very
clear so whenever there's a one we take
that number whenever there's not a one
we don't take that number so all we have
to worry about is this number this
number this number this number this
number or fraction and then we have 8 4
1 1/2 and 1 8 that is basically what our
binary is telling us it's saying all
right we have a number in its value a
number in the fourths value a first
value a half value and one eighth value
basically you just put it out in that
position and then you can really see
what our number consists of so our
original number is 1 101 101 100 this is
what we are left with and now we can
just add each side keeping both sides
separate so we have 8 plus 4 plus 1 now
I have 1/2 plus 1/8 plus 1/16 okay so
let's do this side first we have 8 plus
4 that's 12 plus 1 we get 13 so that is
what was represented on the left side we
have 1 plus 4 plus 8 now for the right
side we have fractions so we have 1/2
1/8 1/16 in order to add fractions make
sure so recording we have to have a
common denominator
hater so we can do is just multiply
these two until they get to 16 so let's
do this one first in order to get to 16
we have to multiply it by 8 but I mean
basically you just double it until you
get to 16 so you get two fourths four
eights
8 16 this one 1/8 you just double it you
get two sixteenths and then you drop
this one you get 1/16 you can add these
together so now we get 8 9 10 11 final
answer is 11 over 16 all right so to
just clear things up a bit
final answer we had would be thirteen
and eleven sixteenths and if you want to
figure out the actual decimal so like
thirteen point what you do is you take
the numerator and divide it by the
denominator so you get 11/16 that's what
we just think of it 11/16 to get a
decimal and I think when you get that
you get point six eight seven five so
this is our final answer for this binary
number when we have one 101-101 one it's
thirteen point six eight seven five now
if that was a little too complicated
well I recommend you do is check out my
introduction to binary video and then I
also have a binary video adding and
subtracting binary numbers I have a
third one called two's complement which
that one's little too off-topic so don't
worry about that one but this is our
final answer and that is how to convert
binary to yes and you can you can do
this essentially for like any number
because this is going to keep getting
bigger you can go farther to one 64 128
one 256 or
anything as 8 to 1 256 514 1024 2048
4096 8192 b12 over that number this is
going to keep multiplying 64 128 - yeah
you get the point
this multiplies by 2 this divides by 2
all you have to do is figure out the
place value of the decimal and you drop
that value down add them together and
boom get your value really simple all
right everyone I'm going to be teaching
you two main ways to convert from
decimal to binary the first one is going
to be more of a logical way I'm going to
be explaining why we are getting the
answer we're getting why it works this
way but if you're just like I said if
you're just in a class you don't really
care you just want to get the answer
feel free to skip to the system is this
systematic approach where I'll just be
telling you do this followed by this
followed by this until you get the
answer
the logical approach is more takes more
time so I just recommend that you like
do it once you figure out why binary
works the way it does and then after
that you can use a systematic approach
or even better just look up a calculator
online or something I mean seriously
this this stuff kind of unnecessary to
do on your own unless you really enjoy
it I'm just teaching you so you know the
concepts for either a class or for
whatever you're doing in life this is
all computer science related I think
when you want to understand computers
you need to understand even the most
minut things and understand them well so
let's get started with the logical
approach I will be using my notes simply
because there there are a lot of numbers
that I don't really want to memorize so
yeah all right so where to start
well we already learned that in decimal
everything is a factor of 10 well in
binary it's factor
the only problem is when you're
converting from decimal to binary binary
doesn't understand your decimal points
you need to convert these two fractions
not only that but binary only
understands fractions that are of two so
one-half divide that by 2 you get
one-fourth divide that by 2 you get 1/8
divide that by 2 you get 1/16 all all
patterns of - all right so when we have
a simple number such as 0.5 well this is
easy because that you can convert to a
fraction 1/2 we have it right there you
could represent that as 0.1 so this is
decimal this is binary now if you have
something such as point 75 well that
case you can't just represent that with
1/2 you want to represent that with 1/2
plus 1/4 see you get yeah 1 1 now the
problem with binary is you can't use
numbers bigger than 1 because ok think
about it if you could a much easier way
to put this would be point zero 3 saying
ok 3 1/4 equals point 75 but that
doesn't make sense to humans or
computers because that's not the way
that we do it so what this means is that
we always have to use only one of each
of these fractions you can't use two of
the same one if you have the number
point 5 you cannot use two of these
you only have one available after that
you have to go on this direction Plus on
top of that you always want to use the
the largest fraction possible for
example if I have 0.5 I don't want to
use this one and then a bunch of these
ones they add up to 0.5 plus some
I want to use the the largest fraction
as in fraction as in percentage of the
whole or one-half it's always going to
be the one farthest to the left so
basically never skip one of the
fractions if you don't have to so if I
have point rather than doing like this
like five hundred ones I could bring
some of those ones up here and get like
a one right here
hopefully that's clear basically you
don't need to use fractions that are too
small you want to use the biggest ones
and you can only use each fraction one
time so I have an example here well okay
so another concept that you need to
understand is that decimals they work
with obviously decimals decimal numbers
point seventy five point six three two
eight one point seven two the repeating
point eight this is all decimal work
binary it's more of a fraction kind of
thing so we have two conflicting things
here fractions and decimals this is what
decimals work with obviously this is
anything base ten after a period so this
is an example of a decimal we want this
to be able to be used in binary so we
have to either convert the binary to
decimals or convert the decimals to
fractions and I'm going to be explaining
this basically when you want to
understand what fractions are the same
as what decimals you can make a chart
which I actually did so I will be
writing that short out now for you and
BX
it's almost had an accident there the
explaining what I'm writing all right so
I must separate this alright so this
side it's going to be these fractions
and I feel like I'm making a database or
something okay
so first one we have is 1/2 that's the
same thing as 0.5 you should know that
by now we also have 1/4 that's the same
thing as a point 25 where else have 1/8
that's the same thing as point 125
we have 1/16 that's the same thing as
point zero six to five
we have 1/32 which is the same thing as
point zero three one five we have one 64
which is the same thing as point zero
one five six two five and so forth
so you can keep doing this in the way
you figure that out is you take the
numerator divided by the denominator
denominator and that will give you the
decimal so now that we have this sort of
like a conversion table we can take
binary and we realize all right so if we
have if we have I'm gonna erase this one
since I have some room to write some
examples if we have the example one one
one all after decimal we can take these
fractions and convert them to decimal
and then we can add those up to figure
out what our decimal is so for example
point the first one is going to be one
half the next one will be one-fourth and
the next one will be 1/8 so we get 0.5
plus 0.25 plus one point point 125 when
you add all these together you're going
to get whatever this decimal
I'm sorry this binary like I'm sure
would have technically be called but
we're going to figure out what the value
of this binary number is now the only
problem is we're not converting from
binary to decimal we already figured out
how to do that in the previous section
so now we look at the opposite
converting decimal to binary I'm gonna
clear this chart I have it on the paper
so I might use it later but I'm not
gonna keep it up here all right let's
say we have the example point point 8 2
8 1 2 5 and we want to know how to
represent this in binary okay I know I
said that cuz all right so in order to
do this sorry my brain is like all over
the place today like I said we want to
take the biggest fractions the one
farthest to the left so we basically see
is this bigger than 1/2 because that's
our first that's our first binary number
0.1 that's 1/2 and you can see that's
clearly bigger than 1/2 point 8 is
bigger than 0.5 point 1 in binary is
going to be 1/2 that's bigger than 1/2
so we have to use that number that's the
only way it makes sense it would not
make sense to do something like this
point 1 point 0 1 1 1 and all of these
add up to over 5 that doesn't even make
sense it's impossible to do it that way
and get a proper answer so we always
have to use the biggest fraction
farthest to the left so we just covered
0.5 or half of it that's from that chart
that I showed you earlier the point 1 is
the equivalent as to 0.5 so what do we
do now
well now that we've already used 0.5
we can subtract 0.5 from this number to
give us what number is left for the rest
of these positions so when we do that we
subtract 5 we get point so basically we
just take 8 subtract 5 and we get 3 2 8
1 2 5 running that storage space on my
things I don't care to stop so if I stop
sporadically that's why so this is the
new number we're left with then we think
of the next decimal erm sigh I'm sorry
not decimal the next binary fraction
which is 1/4 so this is 1/2 we already
got that next one is 1/4 do we have the
decimal required for 1/4 well I don't
know if you can see this try right here
but we actually do because 1/4 is
equivalent to point 2 5 this is larger
than 0.25 so we have enough of a decimal
number to give us another binary one so
that takes care of that one we're just
trying to figure all of the fractions
that are going to add up to give us this
decimal number so then what we do is we
subtract 0.25 from this number to give
us our new number for the rest of the
place markers or the the place values so
what we have is so far we have 1/2 and
1/4 which is the equivalent of 3/4 but
our original number was 8 all right
right right here it's 8 something
something something something that's
bigger than point 75 so that's not going
to cut it this is what we have left
after we take that out of there so what
do we do now we check the 1/8 division
because that's going to be our next
location so before I write that out
let's
first look at it what is the value of
1/8 and decimal using a little chart I
wrote earlier it's taking 1/8 the value
we get if it's gonna focus here you're
probably not oh okay I don't think you
can see it but it's point one oh there
we go point one 25 what you'd see oh
yeah sorry okay so I forgot to subtract
the point 25 from this that's why it
won't work out all right so we take this
number first and we subtract the point
25 because that's this location first we
subtracted the the point five which is
half then we subtract the point 25 which
is the fourth so when you take this
number this number here and you subtract
the five you get point three two eight
one two five then you subtract three
point two five and you get point zero
seven eight one two five so basically
you start with this number you subtract
this number and you get this number so
that gives us point zero seven eight one
two five and we're looking at the
fraction 1/8
well that's point one twenty five that's
not big enough so that fraction is too
big for us to use it doesn't work it
doesn't make sense logically so we put a
zero there because if we put a 1 there
well then this decimal point is already
I'm sorry this binary when it's
converted to decimal it's already bigger
than the original value which is not
possible so we have to use a smaller
fraction in order to get as close as
possible to this value so then we move
on to the next one this next position
well it's going to be 1/16 so let's take
a look at what 1/16 is just gonna load
here probably not all right let rise for
this one a fair one 16 you get point
zero six to five point zero six it's
smaller than this so that mean
that fraction will work so what we get
here is a 1 so now our total fractions
here we have 1/2 1/4 nothing here and
then 1/8 just kind of I'm gonna keep
these up here I'm gonna kind of separate
it there so this is yeah all right so
then what we have to do is once again we
have to subtract that number from that
and when we do that here's what happens
all right so this is the number you add
point zero seven eight whatever and then
you subtract the point six the point six
two five and you get this number
point zero zero one five six five so
this is what the number we have left and
we're just trying to get fractions
obviously we need smaller fractions
because this number keeps getting
smaller all right so then what we do
from here is we try the 1/32 so if we
take a look at 1/32 it's the value of it
is point three point zero three one two
five looking over here it's too big
because this is zero zero the 1/32 was
zero three so we know our next position
is going to be zero and then we move on
to the 164th
finally last one sorry I keep asking to
focus on this garbage I'm still trying
to figure out a new new way to
illustrate concepts better but anyways
164 is point zero one and you can see
that that is in fact whole this same
exact number as what we have left so
that means we have one here and then we
are left with zero so this is the exact
representation of that decimal point
this is the binary version of it so what
we have in the end is we have
1/2 1/4 1/16 and then 1/64 now if we
wanted to add all these together we'd
have to get the most feed to come the
denominator on all these and we would
get 32 64 16 64 4 64 + 1 64 and you
could add these up if you want you get
32 plus 16 would be 48 + 4 52 + 153 see
if 53 / 64 so I basically just added up
all those fractions and then you can
divide 53 by 64 and I'll just double
check but my math is right 53 divided by
64 and you get point 8 2 8 1 2 5 which
is the original number that we started
with so that is the complex logical way
of figuring out what binary will
represent a decimal fraction all you
have to do is figure out the fractions
that add up to give you that number now
obviously if we get into complicated
decimals that you cannot represent in
binary this process is going to be so
complex and you'll you'll be down to
like one out of whatever number that's
like humongous so this is more just like
simple understanding and that is how you
can do that if you're working with a
small number now we're going to move on
to the systematic approach where you can
I just like follow the steps so I'm
gonna get a drink and then we're gonna
do it
alright everyone welcome to the somatic
approach to changing decimal places to
binary this is a very simple I mean kind
of complex but I mean just follow
so that's really not the hard if you
just write these steps down so for those
of you who do not literally like do not
care at all why this is equal to this
but you just want to know how to get
that for like homework or something
let's follow these steps pretty simple
so let's do this with a really simple
example so like we can figure out like
how to do it without having to like
fryer brains
let's try point 625 0.625 in decimal and
we are going to convert that to binary
sorry if my glaring - alright so the
first thing we do is we multiply it by
two so step one take your original value
multiply it by two and we should get one
point two five oh five not mistaken
alright so that was step one now you
look at it if there is a one on the left
side of the radix point that goes to our
binary number so one now what we do is
we take the decimal after that so that
was step two if there is a one you move
it into the first position of our
decimal I'm sorry gosh of our binary
number now you take the point two fifty
you multiply it by two step three and
you get 0.5 is there a one is a step
four is there one no there's not
so what you do is you add a zero then
what you do is you multiply this by two
once again you just take whatever is
after the decimal point multiply it by
two and you get one point zero zero zero
so is this how does this have one yes it
does so you add it to the binary number
then you take the decimal oh well that's
point zero well if you multiply point
zero by two you're still going to that
point zero so
these problem is now solved here is how
you write 625 in binary 0.625 I should
say SEC 0.625 in binary is point 1 0 1
you can also look at the fractions from
that 1/2 and 1/8 is point 65 now let's
try a little more of a complex example
so basically each step you just multiply
by 2 if there's a 1 you add it to the
binary and get rid of it multiply by 2
if there's a 1 do that if there's not a
1 then you read 0 multiply to follow
that pattern so let's do another example
let's go with the original number that
we had in the previous examples which
will is point 8 2 8 1 2 5 and I'm going
to be using my notes for this one
because just I don't I don't want to
memorize all these numbers I know I'm
lazy so you multiply that by 2 and what
you get is you get one point six five
six two five wise you can see we have a
1 here so what we do is we move that to
our first position in our binary number
all right that what we do is to take the
rest of the decimal multiply it by 2 and
we get 10.3125 oh you see well there's a
1 here so let's just move it to the
second position of our binary number now
it's eight point three one two five
multiply that by two and we get point
six two five but there's no one so we
added zero to our binary number then we
take point six two five multiply that by
two and we get 1.25 you take that one
and just move it to our fourth position
in our binary number and get rid of it
now I multiply point 25 by 2 we get
point five
oh well there's no one so we add a zero
so one you move it into the binary if
there's not a one then you put a zero
because basically there's a zero
take that foot up there then we take the
0.5 multiplied by 2 we get 1.0 we take
that 1 put it into our last position of
our binary and our final binary is 0.1 1
0 1 0 1 which is the same solution we
came to when we went through the huge
process of subtraction and all that
garbage so that is how you figure that
out so if you didn't follow the other
stuff you can say ok well that's that's
point 8 whatever blah blah but I really
don't know why it is I mean if you don't
understand the concept basically we're
saying do these we just need to figure
out the fractions that add up to get
that number now this is cool and all but
this does come with some problems for
example what's known as infinite binary
I guess or never ending or repeating
something that has a pattern that goes
on and goes on and goes on forever and
like the prime example for this is point
one all right so let's look at point one
okay I think that's yeah so strikes
alright we get point one we multiply it
by 2 and we get point 2 so we add a zero
in our binary multiply that by 2 we get
point 4 we add a zero in our binary
multiply that by 2 we get point eight
that is zero in our binary multiply that
by 2 we get 1 point 6 add a 1 in our
binary multiply that by 2 we get 1 point
2 you add that turbine a ok and then we
just multiply 2 by 2
Oh what you see this right here this is
the same thing happens right here so you
can see it's actually taking us back to
right here and once we have that we're
gonna get point four point eight point
six point two point four point eight
point six point two and it's going to
repeat on and on and on and on and on
the only thing that doesn't repeat is
this point one right here so the final
repeating pattern
was uh it was a this right here not that
not that left far left zero so here's
how you represent point one in binary
that's decimal and it's just going to go
on forever and ever and ever as you can
see this pattern right here repeats that
is an infinite binary it cannot we
cannot reach an end to this this example
now I mean this happens in decimal to
just think of like dividing one by three
that's that's an example in in decimal
that's a binary earlier and it doesn't
wanna but yeah and that's when we have
the same problems but in binary it's
just different numbers for 0.1 we just
can't represent that so that's why when
you're working with programs or whatever
and you have something like like point
one plus point 0.3 for example now let's
get point two you're going you get
something like point three zero zero
zero zero zero zero zero one or zero
four or whatever just things don't get
the exact number because you're using
what's known as floating point and it's
more of an estimate because we can't
represent perfect decimals in binary if
you want precision you want to use
something known as decimal which uses
different methods for storing decimal
positions but if you use like standard
floating point you're going to get some
basic mathematical errors due to
binaries inability to store every single
pot
ability of decimal points because
computers don't speak decimal humans
speak decimal and when we convert that
to decimal it just doesn't fit right so
a quick conclusion we had we went over
converting binary to decimal which is
the easy one we just took the place
position so like 1 2 1 well this is
going to be 3.5 I mean pretty simple
that was that's the easy one they only
went over like the logical explanation
of converting decimal to binary and how
we have to have a conversion between
fractions and decimals in order for this
to make sense in our brains and I kind
of went through that logically by saying
1/2 0.5 1 fourths 0.25 0.8 that's one to
five and then so forth uh-huh so yes I
think that I think that's bad off so
yeah thank you for watching this was by
far way longer than I expected it to be
seriously I was like ok I'm gonna get
this done like 20 minutes and it's been
like an hour or something crazy so sorry

your friends seriously I want to I want
to get my videos more known and spread
them throughout the interwebs I need
your help for that so if you are a
follower or fan or whatever if you're
not please click Subscribe and become
one if you are please be sure to share
