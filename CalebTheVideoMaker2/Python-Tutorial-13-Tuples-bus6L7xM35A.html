to be talking about something new so in
mathematics you've probably heard of the
difference between a variable and a
constant
well a constant once you assign it a
value it stays that value forever
where a variable might change like you
might say x equals 3 and then later
it'll be like x equals 15 once you make
a consonant it never changes like
standards are constants well we can also
do the same thing with lists so with a
list you will learn that we could add
values delete values and stuff like that
well we also have a type of a data type
that you cannot change so basically we
have what's known as a tuple also you
may also hear pronounced tuples but I
don't really care with what you
pronounce it like so don't get in a
fight about it so it's tough will a
tuple is basically like a list although
you can't change it once it's created
now you might be like oh what's the
point in that
well when it comes to programming you
may want to have something that can't
change to protect your program from
getting errors or getting miss results
basically once it's created it's always
created and you don't have to worry
about accidentally removing anything
adding anything or changing anything
so let's first create a list and then
we'll see how the syntax for a tuple is
different so let's make a list we'll
make it we'll make it legit friends I'm
gonna put all of my friends within this
list oops see that's how that's the
syntax to create a list so that's all my
friends I'm kidding
hey let's add a couple what's it looks
at we can use the append and then within
parentheses if I could type we can add
people so we can got my we got myself my
homie C doll
all right so my home ec dog up in the
legit friends list is now the only
person in this list so if we print legit
friends man I cannot type I'm sorry
friends we got si dog now let's make a
tuple Sam similar syntax so we go let's
go make awesome friends and these these
friends are so awesome that they can't
change actually a better way let's let's
do something else let's go
awesome family because once you're
family you're kind of always family so
now we can use the assignment operator
and instead of square brackets we use
parentheses and we can say mommy and we
can say okay accidentally press the
button but okay that'll work let's print
it's awesome family so mommy and then we
have basically a blank one so yeah
whatever it'll work when we look at this
the difference is is that we can't
change it so if we try to go awesome
family dot append just like we just like
we did up here with C dog we added C dog
to the list will we get an error we
can't append anything so let's append
hey and you can see it gives us an error
so that's basically how a tuple works
you can create it but once it's created
you can't change it yes so sorry for all
the typing errors and stuff in this
video but in the next video it's gonna
be like super awesome so yeah be sure to
subscribe ladies and gentlemen
