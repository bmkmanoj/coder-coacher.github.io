video over my desk you will and in this
tutorial series I'll be going over
everything you'll need to know to start
using MySQL for your databases now if
you don't know what MySQL is and you
just stumbled upon this or you want to
learn MySQL is a relational database
management system basically it allows
you to put information into a database
simple as that and these all these
videos will not be simply on a
chalkboard I'll be switching from the
chalkboard of the computer for
explanation and also to show you
examples and actually be coding now I'd
like to say everything that this course
will cover will be in the description
and also what video to look at if you're
interested in that and also up the title
it will say what the video is about
so before we even start I'm going to say
a great use for MySQL all right so you
own a little computer shop or whatever
kind of shop and you get customers when
they come in you want to keep record of
everybody who's visited your shop so in
case you need to contact somebody or
anything like that so basically you have
them fill out a form a piece of paper
and then sign their name or whatever so
you have them put all their information
that you need to keep on this paper and
then what you can do is use MySQL to
insert that into a database and the
database will be stored on a computer
that's computer by the way and uh or a
server so then let's say you have them
come to your store give them your name
and then a phone number and all that
then you can also have them give you a
user name and password
what you can do is then set up a website
and then have a login with username and
password and then with a server-side
programming languages with with the
server-side programming language you can
have this check to see if it is on the
server and then if it is it will allow
them into their website where they can
see this is exclusive in
information just for customers of your
store okay so let me explain this a
little bit farther here we have a client
in their computer here's our computer
and here's them it's a big computer and
then you have a server now here's your
business down here or your house or
whatever you do this will be like paid
hosting on a website for set through and
most paid hosting will have MySQL
available so when when they get on their
computer and they go to your domain name
such as website comm your your business
name com
it'll request the page on your server
which will then be displayed on their
computer and when then they type in
information and click Submit it'll be
sent to a PHP script or a server-side
scripting language script scripting
language script which will then check
what they put into into the form to see
if it's like an actual name or an actual
email and then if it they'll take it to
your my SQL database and if it's in the
database because remember when they came
in you submitted all their information
into the database it's into the database
then it'll go back to their computer and
allow them into your website now the way
this is stored is through tables and
columns and rows so as I said you have
them come in your store and submit their
information so here's their information
with their paper and a pen have name
address phone number
and that's good for now right so then
what you do is you take this information
and store it in a table so not a real
table it's not like not a kitchen table
it's a digital table so we'll name this
information for the people who shop at
your store and then we'll have what they
call columns so we'll have name address
so when you enter this into the table
let's say paintball address I can't fit
one and then a phone number right there
then when you have another customer gym
same thing so then you can retrieve this
and it's organized that stores all your
information rather than having to write
it down or use Excel and there's also
greater advantages to this compared to
Excel because you can do advanced
queries and also sort very advanced ways
and then you can program with PHP or
another server-side scripting language
to make custom layouts using your
information and basically a normal
website looks like this they have the
little links at the top some information
and then maybe a little sidebar down
here listing more information and then
they usually have a footer with like
copyright information or anything like
that now with when you're making
websites this would be defined as like
everything here is the body and then
this would be like with nav for
navigation this would be a Content this
would be sidebar this would be footer
that's all defined in HTML now to get it
to look like how you want it let's say
you want to move this link right here
for some reason which horrible place
that's done with CSS now to make the
website dynamic or a
to change without having to go in and
change the source code every five
seconds you use a scripting language
such as JavaScript or what they call a
server-side scripting language so
javascript is client-side which means
it's it's sent to the person's computer
when they view the website and it's
loaded to allow instant feedback so
let's say you want when they hover over
this you want it to move so they put
their mouths on and all it's back up
here and then when they go up here to
click it pop it's about here
that'd be JavaScript now if you have
like a forum where it's asking for
information with a submit it be a
server-side scripting language and I
like PHP so rather than having like an
Excel document with just blocks of
boring information you can uh or sell so
I should say you can customize that to
make a user list with sorting options
with just a click of a button and you
can make up functions out do things for
you it's a lot better trust me all right
so I hope that cleared some things up
about web development I know this is
just my SQL which can be used for more
than just web development but most of my
examples will be with web development
I'm sorry for those of you who don't
relate but I will be teaching you and
also I won't actually be doing any web
development in here I'll just be using
MySQL and we'll be accessing last ul
through what they call PHP myadmin so
PHP my
and this will be on a server that will
create using xampp so toupees two x's
what yeah it's it's two-piece so um this
will allow your database to be a little
more graphical for those of you who
aren't so good with the coding part but
um this will be going over almost all
just code so if you actually want to
learn MySQL I would follow this series
this is good because then when you need
a different databasing system you still
you can easily convert rather than doing
everything with PHP my admin you would
just be able to graphically click
buttons which is no talent at all but
with PHP mi min there's little box
saying SQL and when you click that you
can type in your MySQL codes I hope that
cleared some things up and I hope you
know what this course will cover I'll
just be covering what you need to know
to design and build MySQL databases and
I'll also be helping you set up a server
to access this and then I'll be going
over some more advanced features like
encryption and a bunch of stuff like
that so just look in the description
everything will be listed there and I'll
see you in the next video and I promise
will be sweet so I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
