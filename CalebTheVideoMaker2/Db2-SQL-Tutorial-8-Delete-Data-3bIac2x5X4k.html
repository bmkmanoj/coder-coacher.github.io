this video we are going to be talking
about one of my favorite things deleting
data I don't know why but I always get
this satisfaction when I delete a bunch
of stuff so I'm going to express that
satisfaction in excitement to teach you
guys how to delete stuff so it's very
simple all you do is say delete from and
then say the table users and then what
we do is use the where clause
immediately and we make some kind of
condition to decide what rows we want to
delete now just like I mentioned you are
likely to get fired using the update
statement well your EE like to get fired
with the delete statement so be extra
super careful here we want to make sure
it's something that's going to only
delete what we want to delete and not
delete everything so if you just do this
well then I hope you enjoyed your job so
we need to make sure we have that where
clause so who do you want to delete
mmhmm yeah
he has some all data and that bothers me
so I'm gonna delete you Dylan I'm going
to delete you so we'll just say user ID
equals four it ran successfully so my
thought is that he is deleted so I'm
gonna run this statement up here to
select the data and you can see he is
gone haha that's what you get for having
nulls in my beautiful null free table
you ruined it okay let's do some other
stuff let's make a where clause that's a
little bit more complex so let's insert
some data and this is going to teach you
guys something new you can actually
insert multiple rows at one time using
this syntax so let's insert that data
just to make sure it's in there we will
select from the table all right there we
go and what I want to do is delete
everybody who does not have a verified
email so we say delete from users where
and then we say is verified equals false
and you can see it ran successfully
let's run the Select statement just to
make sure they got deleted and they're
gone please be extremely careful for
this there is no undo button so you
gotta be very cautious
now if you remember what I mentioned in
the previous video with us here the data
manipulation language we have covered
the big fourth pieces of data
manipulation language so now you're
basically a database Pro go apply for
tons of database jobs but if they ask
you why you don't really know that much
don't tell them it was because you
watched my videos this is literally just
the basics there's so much more but this
will get your feet wet get you started
and now you kind of have a little bit of
experience with all of the pieces now
we're going to go back into some
conceptual stuff for a while because now
we know how to create tables but we want
to make sure we create tables in the
proper way so we're going to get into
database design which is a pretty
general topic it applies to most
database management systems so once you
learn it you can apply it to all the
other database systems out there that
are relational so yeah guys that's all I
got for you right now thanks for
watching hopefully you enjoyed it be
sure to subscribe click like check the
links in the description and I'll see
you in the next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
