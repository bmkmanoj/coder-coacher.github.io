video I'll be talking about representing
courts so this is sort of a way of
notation as we talked about before which
is just a way of getting your music
written down or established permanently
in some way shape or form rather than
just memorizing it all so so far you do
know we represent the chords by the root
which is the first note in the chord so
if we have a C say this is C this is the
root we would call this AC chord or
whatever it is so a triad 7th chord and
so on now how do we know if it's minor
major and so on what we can go through
and we can figure out the intervals
between them but sometimes that takes
too much effort and we don't want to put
a 4/4 just kidding
efforts good but uh we can figure out
what chords they are by different types
of notation that are given for example
as I've stated earlier we can represent
major capital in minor with lowercase in
augmented with an a do you with a
lowercase D by the way that's capital F
and we can represent perfect intervals
by courts with the capital P so we're
going with chords so just ignore the P
major minor augmented diminished now
there's also other ways to represent
this
for an a you may see a gloss that's a
plus like to add things that's just
saying to add to it which is another way
of saying augment because augment means
to add minor can be represented with an
MI N or just a lowercase n typically
major the M is usually just ignored
although for 7th chords we do have the
major 7th and then we have the dominant
7th but if you see a note chord such as
g7 it's the dominant one not the major
one that means major followed by minor
followed by minor so these are some ways
to represent these so this is minor
major dominant and if you see a note for
like guitar or whatever and it says like
see it's a C major triad if it wanted to
be a seventh it would either say C major
seventh or c7 four dominant or it would
say C dim for diminished or C AAG
sometimes occasionally for augmented but
you can also see you can also see C - C
+ + 4 C - you may also see a degree sign
and also if that degree sign is chopped
in half
that means it's half diminished so this
means diminished and I know there's just
like 400 ways I've just said things so
I'm gonna clear this up a degree sign
means diminished chopped in half if
conveniently means half diminished can
mean no so typically when you're writing
music here's the way we display courts I
should probably get a Tyler so moving
this quicker
major triads you don't put any extra
stuff you just put the roots name so see
where G would be represented as a major
triad if we wanted an augmented triad we
would put a plus sign if we wanted a
diminished we would put a degree sign
half diminished well we can't do that
because it's not a seventh chord so if I
wanted a seventh chord let's say a major
seventh
we put major seventh
if we wanted a dominant seventh we just
put a seven because that's the default
when you think of sevenths it's
typically the dominant seventh so we
don't have to put Dom every single time
so that means so far we learned that hmm
we can ignore everything and just make
it major we can augment it we can
diminish it we can make it minor with
lowercase M we can make it a dominant
seventh we can make it a a major seventh
we can make it AC seventh augmented or
maybe you'd probably be probably be seen
as c7 I'm not too sure it doesn't matter
and then we can also have c7 diminished
for c7 half diminished so forth so
that's basically ways to represent
different chords and I just saw that
establish that so will you actually know
how chords are properly written and when
what chords are meant to be played at
the proper times so yeah that's all I'm
gonna go over for this video and the
next video I'll be going over something
probably not as cool because I like
chords but that's okay so I'll see you
then and subscribe
