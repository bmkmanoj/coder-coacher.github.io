be discussing using outer joins when
there are three or more tables we will
be discussing the example using three
tables but you can basically apply it to
any example as long as you understand
the concepts I really recommend that you
watch the video about using inner joins
when there are three or more tables
because the concepts are going to be
basically the same except different
results will be returned so for this the
best way to think about it is let's say
we have three tables ignore these two
right now we have a user comment and
video table so basically it's a system
where you can comment on videos each
video that does get a comment will be in
this table and every user that posts a
column will also be in this table
connected with that video right what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use a left
outer join on this side and a right
outer join on the side and we would just
see what those results are like alright
so first thing is first let's join the
user and comment table that's the best
way to think about is to imagine these
two tables being joined here to make a
new temporary join table and then
imagine this new temporary table being
joined with the third table to give a
final result join table so if we do a
left outer join here every single user
is going to be brought down to this
table in the situation of a left outer
join it will only take the comments that
have users because there has to be an
association of the user ID in both
tables for that but it's likely that
every comment is going to have an
Associated user because that that user
ID column will likely be set to not null
that way you don't have comments that
aren't posted by anybody because that
would be weird
so this will also return all comments
okay now that we have that new table you
see we basically just took everything
from up here let's imagine taking this
and joining it with the videos and we're
going to use a right outer join so
this is going to be another joint for
right outer join we are going to take
all of the videos and bring them down
here that's basically how right outer
joins work they will automatically take
every single row from the right table
and then we're going to take any row in
this table that has an association with
the video table so that means the
comments will have to have a video which
all of them will all right so what what
will be removed here well some of the
users will be removed the reason that is
is because some of the users aren't
going to be in the comment table and if
they're not in the comment table they
can't have an association with the video
table so think about the join statements
here will likely have something where
it's like a user ID over here is equal
to the user ID over here and then we'll
have it to where it's then we'll have it
to where it's a video idea over here and
that's equal to a video idea over here
so when we grab all of these we have all
the users and all the comments because
all the users will have a user ID and we
don't have to have those users in the
comment table because it's a left outer
join which automatically takes all of
the users all the comments will be
returned because every comment will have
an Associated user but once we get over
here it gets a little different now it's
about the video not the user so we're
going to take all of the comments that
have a video ID and all the videos that
have a video ID because it's a right
outer join we're going to take all the
videos whether or not they have a video
ID in the comment table so the first
thing take all the videos we're also
going to take all of the comments we're
only going to take some users the reason
that is is because if a user let's give
some example data let's
we have a user over here with the ID of
seven and he he doesn't leave a come but
because we do a left outer join he comes
down here anyway so now he's in this new
generated table well he has a user ID
but does he have a video ID in the
comment table to be associated with the
video ID in the video table no he does
not so he wouldn't make it on past this
stage and he wouldn't be in this final
outer table as joined table so the final
result is going to be all videos all
comments and some users that's just an
example of using right and left outer
joins when there's three tables you
could do the same thing with inner joins
so if you didn't inner join it's only
going to take the users who have
comments so I mean you can basically
apply the same example to a lot of disks
of different situations to get the
results you want as long as you
understand how left join works how right
join works and how an inner join works
you can get essentially everything you
really need to get the only one we
haven't really discussed is the full
outer join which you might need
sometimes and that's a little different
so we'll be talking about that soon so
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
in the next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
