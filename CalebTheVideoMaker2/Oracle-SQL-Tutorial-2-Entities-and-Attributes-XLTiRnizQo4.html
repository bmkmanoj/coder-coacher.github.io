making videos for like 10 minutes today
I already started making one and I
forgot to press record luckily I got it
this time
so hey okay it's working
sorry so this video we're going to be
talking about basic basic basic basic
design methods or starting information
whatever you want to call it we're going
to be talking about entities attributes
these are very very important in
databases and I highly recommend you
really understand the fundamentals
before you start diving into database
programming now database design is a
huge concept I actually have look like
70 YouTube videos over the topic a whole
series every database design that's like
50 videos so it can get very complex and
in-depth but you don't really need all
of the information you can start off
with just a little bit a few things and
start designing your own databases and
the best place to start ever spend any
entities attributes now if you think I'm
an entity you might think it's some like
mystical creature or something I don't
know but just think of an entity as
something let's use a blow-up mattress
for example all right so I got a blow-up
mattress all right that's the blow-up
mattress now this is an example of an
entity let's just worry about entities
I'm going to get rid of a trip
attributes right now there's two really
classifications right
we have generic and then specific
generic and specific describe how
specific were being when we're talking
about an air mattress right we could be
talking about a very very specific air
mattress with the serial number of like
101 to 5 or whatever that is very
specific because we're talking about a
specific air mattress right we could
also be very generic
and we could just be talking about air
mattresses in general so it doesn't
really matter which air mattress in fact
we could have multiple air mattresses no
one looks pretty hard got a saggy one
you know there's all kinds of air
mattresses one for everybody's likings
of air mattresses this is very generic
this is generic because we're not being
specific on this specific air mattress
we're not talking about one individual
air mattress so that's the difference
between generic and specific generic is
just a classification of something
specific is a specific example of that
something let's talk about puppies so
got a puppy here this puppy his name is
swag now I answer the question is this
specific or generic five four three two
one it is specific that's because we're
talking about a specific dog because his
name is swag dog now what about this all
right here's another dog which kind of
looks like some weird puzzle piece with
like a hand I don't know this is this is
just dogs we're using this picture to
represent dogs in general no specific
kind just dogs it's that specific or
generic I hope you guys guessed that one
its generic especific and generic let's
move on to attributes and then we'll
discuss why all this is important so
let's move on attributes
there's also generic and specific
attributes so what is an attribute an
attribute describes something so a
generic attribute
a generic attribute describes a generic
entity such as dogs a specific attribute
describes a specific entity specific
describe specificity so generic again
dogs specific swag dog which is a
specific dog now what do you mean by
describe I heard you say that I searched
her herd you're asking me that question
earlier so I'm going to answer that what
do you mean by describing a generic
entity well if you think of an attribute
of somebody or something or a dog it
describes that thing so I could be like
wow this dog swag dog see how fast I can
draw a dog Oh dog this swag dog let's
describe him well he's ugly sorry buddy
and he's about 25 pounds and he is poor
buddy all right that is example of
specific attributes now let's talk about
generic attributes we have a dog all
right it doesn't really matter what kind
of dog oh this is just a classification
of dogs in general we're just using this
picture to represent dogs let's describe
the entities of dogs they might have a
name their weight maybe their height
right that's polite and their color so
these are generic attributes they are
basically groups of possibilities name
it could be swag dog it could be puppy
it could be bubbles it could be other
weird names humans give dogs height it
could be 5 foot 6 foot 80 foot you know
it ducks
I like big dogs color could be blue
green rainbow indigo violet charcoal
onyx clear those are generic attribute
groups so what's this kind of its kind
of make a chart here just trying to just
try to make it clear in your mind
now get my eraser let's give a generic
and then let's give a specific example
matching that generic which would be is
specific so don't get confused just
follow me let's use humans right so we
got person
very generic that's an entity it's a
type of entity that's another way entity
type person
all right person has a name you know
maybe a phone number there from the
modern world you know they might have a
height
I still not sure if I spelled out right
but high they might have a height they
might have an age no no even better
birthday and yeah so forth these are
just generic attribute basically
categories now we have this person let's
draw a picture just to represent him
he's flying through the sky with a cape
all right this guy's name is Superman
phone number is
so this is basically the same pattern
we're going to do for every single table
here we have the entity type here we
have the specific entity here we have
the attribute types here if we have
specific attributes now if we wanted to
add another person in here we could put
Batman oh and then the I can't think of
anybody else so you guys hopefully that
makes things clear entities attributes
specific in generic that's pretty
important so hopefully that was helpful
and hopefully it clears up how to make
tables in the best possible way Pisan
