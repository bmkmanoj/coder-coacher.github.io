going to do is add a column to our
already defined data table members so
here is our you can select your database
here it's under Jim and then if you
select the table here it'll name all the
columns so here are all the columns we
have and here's the primary key and what
I want to do is to follow a proper
normalization and change name to
first-name lastname so this is done with
an alter command so you click SQL appear
at the top and we're going to type in
alter because that's the type command
type now what are we altering we're
altering the table now what you need to
tell you need to tell it what table to
alter because Jim could have more than
one table it could have members it could
have fans it could have cool stuff you
know stuff like that so we're going to
say we're going to alter the members
table and the next part of it is a sub
to the alter so we're going to add and
then we're going to type in the column
name which will be first-name now this
is the basic what we need to type for
the alter command but if you remember
when we made columns before you have to
put more than just the column name but
if you remember let's say name it was
varchar' 60 not null so it allowed for
up to 60 characters and it had to have a
value well now that we have first-name
lastname it's gotten it's not going to
need to be as big because I can't think
of anybody who has a first name of 60
characters maybe there's somebody I
don't know so I'm going to allow 30
characters no no let's make that's why
and then we're also going to put not
null because we want everybody to have
an entry into the database so here is
the basic syntax right here and if you
click go oh what's wrong
let's see mmm I should have noticed this
I put first name 20 but it should be
first name varchar' 20 make sure you
just make sure you don't do simple
mistakes like that and just read over it
because I can't believe I just did that
but um yeah we named the data type which
is far jar 20 and then I say it's not
mold then when you click go you can see
it did something because there's no
error so after you go to members you can
see I added a as name and first name so
let's go back to that SQL and we're
going to do that again so oops alter
table members add first name party
didn't last bar char I'm going to make
this one 30 no I need to really get my
shift in caps log figured out so don't
keep type in an upper and lower case
when I shouldn't be alright so here's
the command for this enter go and now
you go back to members and we have first
name and then we have a last name now
the next thing to do as you can see we
have first name we have last name but we
also have name up here if we already
have these down here we're not going to
need another column for that information
so what we need to do is click SQL and
we're going to do something very similar
it was alter table I put the table name
members and remember we had add call we
add we had the term add now we're going
to put drop which basically just means
delete drops it from the day
and then we put what to drop and we put
name and then click go and click ok and
something happened let's go to members
and you can see there is no longer a
name call and as you can see this really
isn't that hard it's just English you
just have to know what to type so at
first you might not memorize everything
and know what to do but when you work
with it everything starts to fit
together and it's like it's like it's
not even like another language it's like
English and it's pretty easy actually so
if you're confused just stick with it
and don't give up because I swear it
will work and if you're just having
struggles just try putting everything in
English because I mean all we did was
alter and we altered something so
basically our intentions was to change
something then we had to type in the
database up the table which was members
and then we had to type in what we
wanted to do to it at first we wanted to
add something and then the next thing we
want to do is drop something so we added
first name we added last name and then
we dropped name that simple as that
that's all we had to do and that's all
I'm going to say in this video and and
in the next video I will be talking
about something really cool so I'll see
you then thanks subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
