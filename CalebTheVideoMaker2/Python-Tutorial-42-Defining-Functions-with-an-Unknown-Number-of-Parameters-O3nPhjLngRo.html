Python tutorial series you've gotten
pretty far hopefully everything is going
fantastic so in this video I wanted to
talk about creating functions where you
don't necessarily know how many
parameters you're going to be given so
in the last video for some reason I was
talking about my carrot chop my karate
chop we're going just to recreate that
so yeah you have to spell it carrier it
won't work I'm kidding it'll work but I
mean yeah you get the point so we're
just going to put who we want to karate
chop here so we'll just give that
variable dname whoo let me put a colon
and then what we do this is called a
block of code that is going to be
executed
all right so or the body of the function
basically so we're going to do is we're
just going to print do actually let's
let's make this better that's all yeah
well that's that's pretty much all do
yeah a lot of work for this example now
we're going to call that and we'll give
it the value if I can get it working
we'll give it Jameson and then let's run
it it prints out who we want to karate
chop now what if we wanted to say
something as well we could say within
this function we could say print
now you see here's a problem we're
seeing using single quotes on the
outside and this requires a single quote
so the best way to fix this is to just
use double quotes on the outside or
escape it which we talked about that a
long time ago so we can print I'm a
pound yeah then we use modulus s or % s
% and then whoo this is the syntax to
insert the value of a variable within a
string all right now let's try it I just
get rid of this one save it run it and
it says I'm Epona Jameson now what if we
want to say we wanted to say I'm upon
you Jameson I'm upon you whoever I'm
upon you Billy I'm a pony and jacob i'm
upon yo Hong Kong all right we're gonna
do it so we can do however many we want
and the way we do this is we put
asterisks capital 8 right beside - whoo
all right so that means we can use lists
or we can give them a list of items and
we'll return it as a tuple which is
basically a list that can't be changed
or a tuple however you wanna pronounce
it I don't care
let's see if this affected anything when
we run it you can see it still works so
what we can do now is we can let's try
giving it multiple values
now let's run it and you see oh it gives
us an error how can we fix this well you
see we're using who inappropriately this
is not going to allow us to do this so
we need to do is use a for-loop because
that will allow us to get every single
value of who so for we need astute
makeup of random variable for X and who
print I'm upon you now let's try it oops
this should be indented sorry about that
save that run it all right now let's
look at it what we need to do is we need
to change alright so let's try printing
this with multiple values ctrl s f5 to
run you can see it gives us an error
that's because not all the arguments
converted during string formatting
basically that means this right here is
not able to print this correctly because
this is not a single variable so the way
we could fix this is we can use a for
loop so what to do this we say by the
way this doesn't need to be indented
twice it's just a single indent there
listens we're going to use a for loop we
can put for and then we can indent the
print within the for so for X in to
which X is just a random variable you
can name it whatever you want it's just
going to refer to each iteration of each
person in whoo so at Jameson Johnson and
Abe Lincoln so now for everyone in who
we want to be we want to do this so now
it's going to replace this right here
with X to the first time would be
Jameson then Johnson then Abe Lincoln
let's save it and then run it upon you
Jameson own pony Johnson I don't
you Abe Lincoln you see how it works so
in summary basically we're defining a
function ignore this line for a while
just put that down there
keep it simple we're defining a function
now this little asterisks is telling us
that it's going to be multiple items and
basically a Python sees this as a double
so if you want to see that in action we
could say print whoo if I can type it
out right save run and you can see it
prints it out like this but anyways let
me get rid of that now all of the values
we give it james and johnson abe lincoln
in our case it gets assigned to the
variable who so who is a tuple with
three values now for X that means every
single value within who we want to print
i'm upon you and then replace it with
that value so it's going to i tr8 three
times because there's three items within
who that's how the tupple is set up then
it prints that and that's what the
function does it it doesn't do that yet
until we actually call it so for example
if i get rid of this completely
obviously it's not going to do anything
because we are not using that code let's
try again let's uh we can actually
change the values so we could say take
Eve
dinosaur and let's go the llama key all
right now let's try it run it and you
can see I'm Pony okay kakie I'm a pony
dinosaur I'm a pony ax llama king so
functions are just super awesome because
they allow you to repeat code like this
we if we want to do this for like we did
it up here with these three people and
then we did it down here for these three
people if we never used a function we've
had to write this for both sets of those
people and it's just so much easier and
this is a very simple function functions
can get pretty intense so this is just a
way of how you can have multiple values
within your function so hopefully I'm
sorry yeah basically multiple values
within the parameters of your function
so what we give in the parentheses so
basically that's about it be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video if you have any questions or
comments or concerns or anything like
that leave me a comment and unless
you're Claire don't do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
