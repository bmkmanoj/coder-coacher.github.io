and this course will be about Oracle
database so if you don't know anything
about Oracle database that's perfectly
cool because we're going to explain it
this is a beginner style course I'm
gonna take kind of slow but we're also
going to go in a lot of depth if any of
you have ever seen any of my other
videos you kind of know my style of
teaching so I'm going to keep it the
same now just to kind of start off what
makes kind of explain Oracle database is
a database right there's all kinds of
different databases you might have heard
of MySQL SQL Server MongoDB there's all
kinds of different databases the one we
are going to be using Oracle database
now Oracle database is known as an
enterprise database whereas this MySQL
is something that's another database
that's open-source it's not an
enterprise that they might have
enterprise versions or something but
anyways there are free versions so
that's probably what I'm going to be
using so feel free to join right in with
that because I know a lot of you don't
want to pay for the software when you're
just learning it or something like that
yeah so let's get started if I already
lost you on what I was talking about
with databases and don't worry here's
where it starts fresh okay
so what is a database a database is
designed it's basically a program that's
designed to store a bunch of information
or data so database stores data so data
goes inside of the database if that
makes any sense
well what's data well think of data very
broadly it's nothing too specific it can
be anything that you need to store for
later use for example usually databases
are used for businesses so a business
will need to store data so they can
analyze that data and make business
decisions right so if they're like
making it gets our restaurant and
they're making two kinds of hamburgers
we got hamburger with extra tomatoes and
then a hammer
with no tomatoes I don't know stupid
example but basically they want to know
which one sells better so they can
advertise it on television or whatever
they're advertising on well then they
can analyze that data and make a
decision based upon that data it's kind
of just kind of like uh like analytics
or statistics if base it's basically
like 80% of the people that come into
the store buy the tomato hamburger why
would they advertise the one without the
tomatoes when it's only a small fraction
of their sales and no one values them so
they would choose the hamburger with
tomatoes right so that's an example we
could store the data in that situation
would be the sales and we would store
information about those sales such as
when when the sales occurred how many
who bought it what the price was and so
forth and then we can put all that data
together and get a final summation of
what the sales are like and you can make
business decisions off of that data now
that's just one use for a database
there's others a very common uses for
websites they store all of your
information in a database any kind of
program that program or website that you
put information in and it saves it and
then you X out of it and then open it up
at a later date that is stored in
something 98% of the time it's a
database you can store information and
other things such as a spreadsheet
there's comma separated values just
notepads you could use a notepad I made
an application once where I had to take
a URL and I didn't want to create a
whole database for it so all I did was
just make a little URL dot txt or
whatever and then I just copy the first
law
of that which had the URL on there so if
I needed to change the URL I could just
open that text file and change it so
that's an example how I use notepad
comma separated value that's pretty
self-explanatory by the name in a
spreadsheet
well spreadsheets are kind of like a
very simplified version of databases and
you'll see why pretty soon but I'm sure
a lot of you have worked with
spreadsheets spreadsheets have you know
like a table like look with columns and
rows these are columns and this is a row
well the database is visually
represented the same way in a database
this would be known as a table we got
the the columns this way and the rows
this way that's going a little I just
want to give you some a taste of like
what we'll be working with but we're
gonna try and think of it a little more
conceptually first just so you guys can
get a better idea of how we store data
what kind of data we want to store so
that way you don't get confused on if we
should store it this way or that way or
what so let's try to do that now so if
you guys are wondering why you would
want to use a database when you can use
something like a spreadsheet or just a
notepad or a comma separated value or
anything like that why would you want to
use a database well there are some
really good reasons but I also want you
guys to understand there's not always a
reason to use a database for example
what I talked about earlier how I made
an application I needed to pull a URL
it's the only thing I needed so I can
just make a text file 50 times easier in
my opinion so there's not always a
really good reason to use a database but
oftentimes there are if you have to
analyze data store a lot of information
and so forth you might want to look into
a database by now right
so I'm just going to go over a couple of
examples how a database is better than
for example a spreadsheet it's worse
though because it's more complex it's
harder to learn and you can you can um
mess things up if you don't know what
you're doing whereas a spreadsheet
it's kind of like go grandma can do it
maybe I don't know so what are the
benefits of a database well if you think
of spreadsheet you have all or nothing
so we got a spreadsheet right we got our
columns in our rows and we can put
information in that right well what if I
want this row this column right here
mean which has people's social security
number I want that to be completely
private I don't want no one to see it
and then I'm going to share it out to
all my employees well that's not really
gonna work out too well because the
whole spreadsheet is at hole right
another issue there there's not good
support for multiple people working on
the spreadsheet at once now there are
some solutions that help with that such
as Google Google Drive where you can use
spreadsheets with multiple people but in
general databases can support multiple
users with multiple different rules so
this person can do two can do this with
these this information but this person
he's not allowed to do that that's
off-limits to him so there's multiple
different things you can do with the
database different rule sets so you can
set kind of like standards all right so
like basic user administrator super
administrator you know what I mean
whereas a spreadsheet it's you're a
little bit less flexible with that
another good thing is like if you think
of spreadsheets you usually store all
the information and one spreadsheet so
let's say we've got people's information
about themselves so you have their name
their address and their phone but what
if you only want the phone number and
their name so you can go through and
call them well in a database that's
really easy you can just select certain
pieces of information whereas on a
spreadsheet we might have name address
and phone and if we wanted to take this
address and hide it that's not super
easy but with the database that's a
piece of cake with the database there's
higher security the data is protected
better than a spreadsheet
and it's less likely to be hacked into
or destroyed maliciously so there's
higher security also on top of that
there's usually better recovery options
if something was to go wrong such as the
power went out or your computer exploded
that's all I'm going to explain for this
video next video we'll be discussing
basic design methods for databases and
then a few laters few videos down the
road we're going to be installing Oracle
database and be showing you around a
little bit on that
then we'll teach up here program on
there I'll be sweet so be sure to
subscribe also support me on patreon
patreon place where you can support me
month to month I just got a patreon
patron for 10 bucks a month which is
awesome so Chad Leung be sure to send me
your shirt size cuz you never did so you
want a shirt but I have no idea what
size you wear but thank you alright
peace
yeah
were you recording I was sorry I'm gonna
fix it soon as I tried a lot Hulk give
me a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
