we will be talking about adding and
multiplying lists and you're probably
like well that doesn't even make sense
well yeah you're kind of right but we're
gonna do it anyways right alright so I
know let's begin
so let's first make a list let's think
of a list of a birthday wish list like
everything I want for my birthday
alright so in order to do that we're
just gonna make a new list so birthday
and we'll just leave it at birthday and
then we said it we assign it values so
to do this we just give it cube
I mean brackets whatever and then we
just let's say I want five things from
birthday right and let's say these
things are a new guitar case and a a DVD
series and then Adobe Premiere and then
some swag I'm kidding that's dumb
let's go with a new clock and some yo-yo
all right so now this is our new
birthday wish right and we can print out
the birthday wish just like this and it
tells us what is in our birthday wish
now what if we wanted to add things like
combined two lists into one list so
let's say we have a Christmas list
so Christmas and I just want to put a
few things within our Christmas list so
let's give it let's assign just two
items the first one is going to be a new
pair of socks and then some shorts
because I like clothes for Christmas
school yeah there we go so now we have
two lists birthday and Christmas now we
can print both of these we can print
birthday which we did up here over in
Moscow oh we did up here and then we can
print Christmas like this and it tells
us what's in our list now what if we
wanted to combine this list well we
could go print birthday plus Christmas
see what I'm saying and now it's going
to combine these it's going to put these
all in one generated list we actually
didn't create a new list we just
generated a new view of these lists put
together we wanted to actually create a
new list what we can do is we could say
a new list let's say it's items and then
what we do is we assign it birthday plus
Christmas now we have a new list items
with these two lists combined into one
so it no longer points back to these
lists but it's just this entire list in
itself this list has this value right
here so when we print it print items it
lists all of these items but it's
important to understand that it's not
dynamically generating these items from
these two lists it's a new list in
itself so if I change birthday to where
I get rid of a new guitar case well then
items doesn't change because it's
already its own list I'll show you this
lets go delete birthday and then within
these brackets we could say the index 0
right and now we can print birthday
and you can see it got rid of a new
guitar case now we look back at items up
here and we say it's birthday plus
Christmas
we changed birthday so does that mean it
goes back and changes the values of
items or as items already set in stone
its own list well let's find out print
items and you can see that a new guitar
case is still there so when we went one
up here when we added these together and
created a new list this items list isn't
is a list in itself and does know it no
longer points to these two lists
hopefully that makes sense basically
it's its own list it doesn't have to
always get the values from birthday and
Christmas so now when the lists birthday
or Christmas change items is not
affected so now we learned in review we
learned how to let's scroll up to the
top we learn how to create a list and
how to print this list and then we
learned how to combine two lists like
this with the concat kind catenation
is what's called so I kind of stuttered
there concatenation or just combining
the list when we use print we're
generating a new list from both of these
lists when we actually assign these
values to items another list
well then items is a new list in itself
so when we print items we get the
original values of birthday and
Christmas but if we if we went back and
we printed birthday plus Christmas I'll
show you well now a new guitar case is
no longer there because we're generating
a new list at the moment of typing this
now another thing you can do that might
be useful let's say I wanted to print
Christmas but I wanted every item in
there twice for example well then we can
also multiply lists and you can see we
got
a new pair of socks shorts and new pair
of socks and shorts now I'm not sure how
practical that is in everyday
application and to be honest there's a
whole bunch of other things you can do
with adding lists together and it just
kind of depends on what you need to do
at the time of your program so yeah
that's the the introduction to adding
lists together and multiplying lists
obviously so thank you for watching and
