everybody welcome back to your music
theory stuff and in this video I'll be
talking about cleft still surprisingly I
know but whatever um last video we
talked about the tenor clef and how it
compared to the alto clef well now I'm
going to be explaining why they use the
same sign so if you remember it looked
like this sort of kind of and this
points to middle seat see now I've kind
of deceived you this entire time but I'm
sorry hopefully you don't hold that
against me well this isn't really called
either the outdoor tenor cliff this is
called the sea cliff so the proper term
for this is sea cliff why did I call it
Alto or tenor that depended on where I
assigned it on the staff let me give you
a good example here we had three cleft
signs different like signs that aren't
they're all unique so we had this one we
had this one and then we had this one
sort of like that it's hard to draw but
that's okay if you remember I said this
one assigns G this one assigns F and
this one assigns middle C guess i'll add
an arrow in there too this is actually
the name of these cliffs so this is not
the treble clef this is the G clef this
is the F cliff and this is the sea cliff
you can actually move these around to
assign whatever line of the staff to you
can assign it the G like let's say we
have a staff here but typically this one
assigns G right to the second line from
the bottom let's see if you can zoom in
here tap it would typically sign G right
here well if I actually took this and
scooted it up
kind of like that close enough that is
actually assigning G right here now so
this is no longer the treble clef it's
something else makes sense so what this
means is the name we give it the g f or
c clef the name is what note we are
assigning then the other thing known as
the tessitura get into that real soon is
what we call it Earl I should say the
range from which we're playing so if the
second line from the bottom is assigned
G that means that means then we have the
treble clef or so forth or whatever
whatever it is so that means we only
have so many unique ways to assign the
lines and spaces right because we can
only have there's only a b c d e f g
eight musical letters five lines there's
only so many possibilities so with this
i'm going to be explaining how we can
move these around let's say we have a
treble clef staff here
that means jeez right here right middle
C right here
gee okay then we have a a let's say sea
cliff or I can't draw that so difficult
out in out in there we go now this
assigns middle C right there so what if
we scoot this let's say down will it
become something new it's no longer this
the alto clef becomes something else
what if we continue to do that until the
sea is here and then here and then here
I'm here and in here and then finally
middle C is down here we would have to
move this whole thing it's really far
down but then middle C wouldn't be here
it would be here and that is the same
thing as this up here because if middle
C is here that means this is no longer
middle C and this is G so that means if
we have a staff I'm going to clear this
off make a new one and we have that seek
left thing all the way down here that
assigns middle see right here this is
known as the treble clef and now this is
also known as the treble clef that's
because we're assigning these lines all
have the same state notes see for this
one e g b or d f c/e G B D F it's
exactly the same just with a different
clef sign so that's the idea is that we
can move these notes around but there's
only so many possibilities so we only
need three cleft sign
and we can move them around so in quick
review we have to see the g and the f
sign the terms a treble bass alto and
tenor are all just examples of how we
assign the line certain letters these
are known as Tessa Taurus I'm not sure
to spell it so I'm not going to try but
that's what we will be getting into next
so hopefully that'll make sense and if
it doesn't once you learn about these
it's going to start to make more sense
so I will see you in the next video
