series of her sequel server I'm Caleb
from Caleb the video maker - and this
video is going to start our discussion
on data integrity now I know we've been
going over tons of conceptual stuff but
I see this as all foundational to
creating data bases so instead of diving
in and coding stuff if we take a step
back focus on the concepts when we go
and code stuff everything is going to be
a lot smoother a lot more fun and just
all together better so that's why I
focus so much on this stuff and trust me
data integrity is one of the most
important things in our database what is
data integrity data integrity is
something we strive for we want to have
data integrity data integrity is
essentially a word that means our data
is correct up to date as possible not
conflicting no duplicates and is
describing what we think it's describing
now we categorize data integrity into
three categories that's just to make it
a little bit easier to think about
the first is entity integrity the second
is referential integrity and the third
is domain integrity I'm going to take
one video to discuss each one of those
and that will give you a good foundation
of everything regarding integrity so
let's start with entity integrity now
before we dive into all the depths of
entity integrity let's first focus on
what is our goal when we store data and
that goal is to follow the rule of one
what you may also hear this as Adam a
city or things being atomic and
essentially everything is supposed to
describe one thing even if we have a
table called books this here even though
it's plural is describing one type of
thing this is known as the entity type
we wouldn't want this table to describe
books and CDs that would be breaking our
rule of 1 so that's the first thing we
want to do get rid of anything that's
breaking the rule of 1 if you want to
store CDs that's fine just put it in a
different table but in general if we get
more specific it's a little bit easier
to work with the data because we know
all the day
is describing books now each row
describes one individual book each
column describes one thing about that
book in addition to that we should only
have one record per book so over here is
my beautifully designed book and we want
to store that in our books table the
first thing would probably have an ID
maybe a name an author anyways you can
store any book in here the thing that's
important is that we only have one row
to describe that individual book now you
also have to consider is this table
describing individual books like books
at a library for example or is it
describing individual books that have
been created or published for example if
we had two of these books would they
both be in put it into the table or
would it just be in put it into the
table once because it's both the same
book that's kind of a design concept
you're going to have to wrap your brain
around and it's not a huge issue in this
video because we're just starting with
the basics but let's just say every
single book gets a row so we can put
this book right here this works out
great because we have this ID but let's
say we got rid of that ID we might have
a table and it'll have a a title author
and ice bein and this is a very simply
design often you would take the authors
and put them into their own table but
this is like a very simple example and
you have this book in here twice right
well since it's the same book the data
is going to be exactly the same so that
brings up the question do we have one
book in the table twice or do we have
two books that are different both in
there one time it's kind of a confusing
question but it's important to
understand why we are asking that if we
had to ask that with real data we would
be in a situation where we do not have
good data integrity because we don't
know what this data is describing is
this describing one book or two books no
that's where the primary key comes in
the day so if we add a column on to this
and we label it as primary key that is
going to enforce every single road to be
unique and when we have a primary key we
should be able to expect that every
single row is talking about a new book
the reason the primary key is so helpful
is because it's both unique and not null
why is it important that it's unique and
not null it's because that is what is
required to force every road to be
unique so entity integrity revolves
around primary keys that's what it's
about to get into the integrity you need
to make sure every table has a primary
key now if you don't know what to use as
a primary key just create one say
whatever the table is called let's say
books ID so if you're trying to store
books give it an ID of books I need boom
that simple now that's an example of a
surrogate key surrogate means computer
generated no real-world meaning this
book might have an ID of nine but that
means absolutely nothing in the real
world it's not related to the ISBN it's
not related to anything it's just a
computer generated number for the sake
of the database only that's in contrast
to a natural key a natural key is
something that has real-world meaning
for example this library might give
every book they ever get a code and they
could use that as the natural key the
only things that are very important is
that the key is unique not null and in
addition to this it never changes I mean
think about it if we had this book with
the idea of eight and then one day it
changed to nine or ten is it a new book
or is it the same book with a new ID
that's confusing that throws our
integrity into question so you got to
make sure all of these three things are
met when you're using a primary key and
if you're using a surrogate primary key
it's super easy natural Keys can change
so it's a little confusing natural Keys
are more likely to change because they
have real-world meaning but they should
still never change if they are labeled a
primary key so
Chak so yeah guys I know all that was
kind of confusing spit messy but that's
because database design is a messy
confusing topic there's a lot of
questions you have to ask yourself a lot
of things to consider and there's just a
lot of questions you don't think about
until you start designing a database
that's why I've been focusing so heavily
on data integrity so you guys understand
and when we start creating databases I
can just create them and I don't have to
explain every single thing like oh what
the heck is this foreign key why are we
labeling this unique and not null why is
this primary key why is there three
tables and all of that stuff so this is
like the foundation don't neglect it
it's important and it's going to help
you in your database career so thanks
guys as always click subscribe click
