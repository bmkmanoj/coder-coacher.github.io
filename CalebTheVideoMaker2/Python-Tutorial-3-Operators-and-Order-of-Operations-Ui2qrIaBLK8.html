have a strong feeling that this video is
not going to work out because I have the
hiccups ah but we will give it a shot I
am guessing that most of you are
familiar with basic math max although we
will be talking about what are known as
oh oh my goodness
medical operators I am probably spelling
that wrong
all right I am back I think my hiccups
are officially gone I have been waiting
for like 10 to 20 minutes
and yes I spelled operators correctly
boom so I should not have pressed enter
because that is not a command but I'm
just putting that there for your
information that we're going over
mathematical operators so an operator is
basically something that does an
operation on something else don't think
of it too complex just just think of
here are the the main operators can they
put the minus 1 over here so these are
the four basic mathematical operators
I'm sure you have seen these this is the
addition sign the subtraction operator
addition operator subtraction operator
division operator and the multiplication
multiplication operator this is a
forward slash on your keyboard this is
an asterisk so the location of this one
that is a right beside the shift key the
left the right shift and this is a
capital 8 alright so you can use these
to work with numbers so we can do stuff
like 6 plus 6 press ENTER and we get a
value back we go 12 divided by 12 we get
1 now I do want to say that programming
languages do not work so well with
decimals and we can explain why in
future videos or you can see some of my
binary videos if you really want to know
the reason behind this but try if we
tried something like this
100 times 1.1 we would expect 110 but
instead we get 110 point zero zero zero
zero zero one and that that's usually
not that big of a problem
although do keep that in mind that it
may skew results slightly so yeah I
think you understand all of the the
operators so 5 + 5 5 - 5 5 / 5 + 5 x 5
we can also use multiple operators in
one statement 5 divided by 5 times 5 5 +
9 4 + 7 and so Chloe
I haven't even alright see ya we can
make it like 5 + 5 + 5 - 8 - 7 times 8
and so forth another thing you can
probably notice from this is that up
here I was using spaces between the
operators and the numbers and then down
here I wasn't as you can see it's
obviously optional because it works both
ways although I do recommend you use
spaces because it allows us to see
things very clearly this up here is more
clear than this down here now there's
another thing you need to take in
consideration into consideration and
that is the order of operations so what
are the order of operations
well that is basically the order in
which Python does mathematics for
example if we have this this one right
here well looking at it we have addition
we have subtraction and multiplication
well the order of operations will tell
us that multiplication will be done
first seven times eight negative seven
times eight and then the addition to the
right to the left so yeah basically the
order of operations
it's the priority of the operations and
it goes first we have
multiplication and division and then we
have addition and subtraction and
they're done in groups from right to
left so let me just illustrate this if
we have five plus five sorry and then we
divide that by two well this is an
example of where order of operations
matter because we can see that there's a
division and addition so the division is
going to be done first so that means
five divided by two gives us
pull a two point five and then five plus
two point five seven point five it does
not add five plus five to give us ten
and then divide that by two that is
incorrect so we need to follow the order
of operations now if we have an instance
like this five plus seven minus eight
well it's just going from left to right
whichever one comes first that's because
the plus and the minus have the same
priority now when we have huge
mathematical equations if can sometimes
get confusing so what we do is we can
force certain priority by using
parentheses so parentheses allow us to
force priority
so we could say five plus five and then
we could divide that by two sorry my
keyboard is really low it's kind of hard
to look at the screen and type at the
same time but anyways here you can see
that we're adding five together five
plus five this will give us ten and then
we're dividing that answer by two it
should give us five so basically the
parentheses are always done in groups
first so the parentheses are done first
and these can actually be nested so we
could have five
plus two times three and then close the
first nest and then we can multiply that
by two minus two all right so let's try
to figure this out so basically we go
into the deepest nested parentheses
first because that's the one that's
going to be done first so 2 times 3 will
give us 6 here I'll just write this out
so oops 2 times 3 equals 6 and then the
next thing that'll be done is we're
going to add 5 to that so we're going to
add 5 to that so 6 plus 5 which will
give us 11 and then we multiply that by
2 minus 2 well 2 minus 2 because it's in
parentheses is done first and that gives
us 0 so 11 times 0 is 0 and we could we
can illustrate that in a second here
they go done next line enter and you can
see the result is 0 so that's the basics
of mathematical operators in Python
thank you for watching and I will see
you in the next video be sure to
