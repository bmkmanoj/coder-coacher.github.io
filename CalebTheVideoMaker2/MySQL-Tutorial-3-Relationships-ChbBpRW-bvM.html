your head around but this is just some
of the fundamental things you need to
know before starting building databases
so if this is all little too much at
once don't worry about it
you will understand it what I'm going
over now is called relations there are
three types all right I'm down
one-to-one one-to-many and many-to-many
so for example for one-to-one I'll use
the social security number because it's
the best example out there I can have
one social security number and my social
security number can have one person me
unless there's a duplicate which it
would don't get into that one two social
security number goes to one person just
like that that's a one moment
relationship one social security number
isn't going to go to ten people then you
would then what's the point
classroom let's say there's one teacher
and you're not allowed to have two
teachers it's just the rule so classroom
has one teacher now the teacher can
teach one classroom but it can also
teach another classroom because he
probably has okay like a biology teacher
might have biology and then advanced
biology but each classroom can only have
one teacher that's a one-to-many
so many many classes but only one
teacher so you can't have another
teacher over here oh I think I'll teach
this class because that's a violation
because then it's not a one-to-one or
one-to-many then it becomes a
many-to-many which is what we'll be
going over next many-to-many is pretty
simple basically many too many so I can
have one favorite book and that and that
book can be favorited by a lot of people
or a better example would be I can own
more than one bike and a bike can be
owned by more than one person because I
can share my bike with my brother that's
a many-to-many relationship now with
databases you want to avoid these
no don't do many too many because it
makes so much data and it's unorganized
what you want to do is change that to
two one-to-many relationships so many to
many breaks out to one to many and then
another one breaks out to this and how
this works it'd be like this over here
we have the people and over here we have
the bikes and now these are assigned
something to keep them separated from
each other and I'll talk about the next
it's caught a key ah and then in here
basically you'd assign a bike to a
person so the first person owns the
first bike and the first person owns the
second bike now the second person
actually owns like one two also I should
say because you can see two loans number
one and one owns number one that is how
you design a many-to-many relationship
in a database now for a one-to-many
relationship here is how you would make
it you only need two tables so over here
we have the classes and over here we
have the professors let's say ones named
Jim cuz I like elephant or and then we
have one named John I like both those
names then over here we have chemistry
it can be taught by the first professor
Jim and class chemistry I'm not gonna
write that out and then second class is
taught by John and that's math now you
can see Jim can actually teach another
class by just listing him again and he
also teaches English what you see if you
were to put a you can't have a class be
taught won't buy more than one teacher
because there's only one entry spot the
professor for English it's either one or
two you can't put one entity so that is
how you make a one-to-many relationship
I hope that was helpful and when we
learn about what they call keys it'll
really clear things up so stay tuned
