I am going to be introducing you to
Camtasia Camtasia is an awesome screen
recording and video editing program I'm
going to introduce you to the user
interface and some of the awesome
features within this powerful program by
the end of this video you should be able
to create a pretty decent video using
just the tools of Camtasia let's get
started first things first you will want
to travel to the Camtasia website which
is right here now if that changes for
some reason you're probably just
searching on Google or on the Internet
and you can probably find it now when
you get here you'll notice that it says
buy so yeah the program actually does
cost money but if you want to give it a
couple tries before you actually invest
any money you can go for a free trial
free trial is basically the same thing
as the real deal except it goes away
after 30 days you may also be able to
get some discounts if you come down here
and look at in the classroom or at the
workplace that may allow you to get
discounts on the product so let's get
started once you download the free trial
or buy it you're going to get an
installation which mine's right here but
you can also find it wherever you
downloaded it - such as the desktop so
I'm going to open that and I'm just
gonna guide you through the general
installation prod sorry the general
installation process you're going to
want to click run and just wait for word
this to load next and you're going to
want to read this there's a lot lots of
good stuff here yeah
really entertaining next now you have
the option of using the free trial or
you can put your key in that's only if
you buy it of course though I have a key
so I'm going to pause it and put that in
now once you put that in you're just
going to want to click Next and
obviously there is a little button that
said if you forgot if you don't know
where to find your product key you can
click that if you need help figuring
that out anyways once you're here it'll
tell you where you're installing the
folder and then you're going to want to
click Next and you have the couple
options whether you want to create a
shortcut or start it after installation
I'm just gonna select all those you know
and click Next now we wait
for it to install all right so yeah
let's do that
when you're waiting you may get a window
pop up that is asking for your
permission to install the programming
and you can't see it on here because it
it's blocking out my recorder but you
will want to click yes it says user
account control now we'll start it'll
start installing the program once that
finishes it'll just come up with the
finished screen and you won't want to
click finish of course all right
congratulations on your purchase of
Camtasia Studio
you can register if you want but I don't
really want to do that okay I'm just
gonna X out of that okay we're gonna
open this now this pops up this beast
this is probably the most useful thing
on here and you can see this is where
you edit your videos down here we have
the timeline here we have the media that
we've used to create all of this stuff
on the timeline and here we have the
preview so it has a little video on here
for you to preview just to see what you
can do and you can mess around with
stuff you can see we got all kinds of
settings and stuff down here which we're
not really gonna get into that right now
well I want to show you guys is this
record the screen button click that this
is what it will look like now this is a
super useful tool the Select area that
is the portion of the screen that you
want to record the recorded inputs are
what we get when we record so we can
have a webcam or audio which obviously
we don't we don't need to do either of
these because I'm already talking so I'm
just gonna kind of illustrate it this is
the audio bar which kind of gives you an
idea of how loud you were talking you
can see as I talk louder it goes red as
I talk quiet it goes lower so you can
set a custom you can click this little
arrow to get some of the presets the
wide screens which is probably what
you're going to use and then we got some
more information down here or what you
can do is you can click select
and you can drag it to fit your
preferences now I want to mention one
other thing is that in the Camtasia
Editor what you can do is you can
actually zoom in and zoom out your files
so that way if you record closer in you
can blow it up to take up the full
screen or if you record the full screen
you can zoom in for that whatever area
where you're recording to take up the
full stream so I often do is I like to
record in 720 so let me illustrate that
you can record fullscreen it works
exactly the same way the reason I record
720 is simply because it's a smaller
video size and I can record more so now
when you click record it's gonna give
you countdown now it's starting to
record and as we do things it'll work on
there you can click stop whenever you're
done or pause we're going to stop it for
now
create there and you can see there's my
video file now what you want to do it
you will want to click save and edit now
here's where the videos are saved a
default you can make it videos or
whatever you can go to your settings and
change all that we're not really gonna
get into that today so I'm just gonna
make it first save now this will
automatically drag that and put it
within Camtasia Studio editor right so
here we have the video recording and
then we have system audio which system
audio that is anything that your
computer makes as a sound whether it's
like barrel alright any any time your
computer will make a sound that's where
the audio will come up and you can see
it's completely empty so we just get rid
of that here we have a file with the
video and the audio if you look here we
have the preview of what the video
actually looked like down here we have a
preview of the audio and you see we can
drag along and see how the video changes
now if you want to separate those I
believe you can do that so all you can
do is you can go separate video and
audio and now we have separated
audio and video so if I just wanted the
video I could delete the audio for
example or vice versa but I don't really
need to do either of that so I'm just
gonna go back anytime you mess up and it
undo right that's what you do
now this is where the magic happens we
have this video file and as you guys
probably realized earlier the audio is
way too loud so what I'm gonna do I'm
going to edit the audio what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna go volume down because
that will bring it a little little lower
and it's really not that low because I'd
you can see there's some clipping here
which is where it's a too loud for the
microphone but that's fine for now I
just don't want to blow blow your guys's
ears up while recording that so I can
actually just silence it there we go now
we can do some edits so if you want to
cut the video let's say I wanted to stop
after I place that what I can do is I
can go to my tools down here and I can
use the split tool and I want to select
the track the video file I'm working on
and then I will want to click split and
it split up into two separate files now
these are all one file but in our
timeline there are two separate things
so if we go to our clip bin we can see
we only have one actual file which is
first dot rec this timeline is editing
this file but the original is not
changed that's what's awesome about this
you're not losing any data you can save
it so you don't lose something and save
project and make it awesome or whatever
and that's going to save it but it's not
going to produce your project which
we'll talk about that in a minute and
let's say I want to get rid of the
second file here you can come here and
just click right-click and click delete
or press the delete button now we have
this first file awesome right I know
this is like really stupid editing it's
not something you're going to do
practically but you can easily apply
this to a real video so now what we can
do is we can edit how far we're zoomed
in
within our screen so you can see you can
do this you don't want to drag your file
like this because that offsets the whole
video unless that's something you want
to do practically but you probably want
to keep this centered like this and then
you will probably want to use zoom and
pan and at that point that's when you
can select you want to zoom in like this
and you can kind of drag around here so
now this is what the whole video is
going to look like
you see we zoomed in and did that but
what if you want to do some kind of
transition to where you start zoomed out
but then you zoom in so you can see
we're fully zoomed out right now and
just zoom back out well if you do it
somewhere in the middle like let's say
right here what we can do is we can take
these bars zoom in as far as we want
pretty darn far right and you can see
down here on our timeline we have this
little blue line well that's telling us
that is how long it's gonna take to zoom
in and it will zoom in over that time
period you see so as we go back it's
starting to zoom out and when we play it
forward this is what it looks like
pretty amazing right now if you want to
change how fast it does that you can
grab this little dot and you can change
the start time or you can do it the
other way around and spring back the end
time so that way it'll just zoom in
sooner so now it's really fast which
kind of hurts your eyes so you probably
want to drag that out pretty darn far so
now it's pretty smooth you see that
guy's great that's the main thing now if
you want to keep keep it there for a
couple of seconds and then you want to
zoom back out well then you just drag
out to wherever you want it to zoom back
out and that's what you do over here on
our zoom and pan you're right
so you just drag it out and you can see
when I click right here there's a yellow
line that appears right here what that
means is that it's lined up with the
side of the recording if I'm going any
farther
well that black over there is not
actually part of the record
I know it's hard to tell because my
screen is black I know it's pretty
inconvenient but it when I stretch out
here I'm going past the actual recording
so I want to keep it there probably
maybe maybe you want to go out but I
don't in this case and I just want to
zoom out if you want to get the full
screen you can drag to the corner and
drag it to the other corner there you go
so now what it looks like is this it's
gonna be a little crazy I know and it's
kind of rough on her eyes so what we can
do is we can drag the start time of this
one up whoops and then grab it up
farther and that way it'll proto freeze
for a second before zooms out yep and
now you can see how it kind of froze
there I still think it's kind of rough
on the eyes it's too jumpy cause people
get sick and ill get seasick video sick
so I'm going to spread that out even
slower so that's a little more smooth
could still use some improvement but
that's fine all right so we're getting
pretty far you get the idea of cuts and
edits now what if you want to record
something else let's let's see alright
let's find let's get a good video of me
teaching you how to I don't know let's
just wing it
alright we'll get up the cam video
recorder which is this right here we can
lower the video and let's get let's get
a full-screen let's go ten a that's
full-screen HD obviously if you have a
different size to monitor that will
might not fit perfectly mind if it's
perfectly because my screen resolution
is set to 1080 so if you want to fix
that what you can do is you can lower
this go right click screen resolution
and I have two monitors both at 1920 by
1080 so if you want to change that you
can do this you might need a certain
monitor to get up to nine twenty by ten
eighty or you might need to install
certain display drivers et Cie but we're
not gonna get into all that gain off
topic
where were we no we were we were
recording this right so let's bring the
recorder back over here and let's record
scrolling through this page and
exploring the website so we're gonna
click record hey guys welcome to this
video in this video we're going to look
at the products of TechSmith so we got
Snagit I don't need that screencast
Camtasia Studio lalalalala Wow
camstudio Camtasia Studio and Camtasia
for Mac oh wow look how pretty this
website is oh okay well that's all I
have to say in this video so nice
talking to you guys and at this point I
would normally use a shortcut to stop
the recording but you know my shortcuts
aren't working so I'm just gonna stop it
right now and then I'm gonna click save
and edit I'm gonna click km Beija that's
my file name you know bring it up in
here and you can see it overlays it on
top right after our our first video so
now I have one video over here and then
we have the second video over here now
this is the cool thing about Camtasia
Studio you have layers so you can see we
have track 1 track 2 well you can do is
you click this little plus and you can
add new tracks so I can actually bring
this up here above our other track now
this you were like wow why is this
useful well if you want to show two
things at once you're capable of doing
that so now they're overlaid I can drag
one off to the side drag one over here
and you can see me shrink this a bit
you can see like an example of what you
can do with Camtasia Studio so you just
line that up here now you have two
videos playing at one time which is
that's sort of how people do things like
have a webcam on top of their video or
anything like that so what else we can
do is we can modify the zoom on this
thing my clicking zoom and pan and you
know you can zoom in on that so forth
whatever you want to do so yeah it's a
really creative thing it's you know you
can do all kinds of weird stuff there's
also all kinds of other cool stuff you
can do like call-outs which yeah you can
do like whatever you want you can type
on there whatever but you know I don't
really do much of that let's see what
else you do we can more you can do
captions which are very useful so I
could be like hey in this video we going
on the chillin and the game - yeah okay
I went off screens but yeah you get the
idea
so yeah that's another cool thing you
can do and you can set the times and
it'll play on top of our video then once
you're finally done you want to save the
project obviously because you don't want
to lose that you want to keep all your
videos on here one other thing obviously
you can see these things these are the
transition times the fade in fade outs
which you can change right here
subtle that'll change how long it takes
for it to show up all right back to else
and what you want to do it save it and
then you'll want to click produce and
share and there's a whole bunch of
options and I don't mean to get
overwhelmed because I'm gonna help you
through this if you're making YouTube
videos of course you can share it to
YouTube but the biggest downside to that
at least I believe so I dunno I think it
saves it to your hard drive I just think
it uploads it directly to YouTube I'm
not entirely sure on that I generally
don't do that because I like to just
save to my hard drive and then upload
that to whatever I want so I always go
custom production settings
next now I always use Windows Movie
video media video sorry next and it just
says that the captions lose their closed
captioning capabilities so what that
means in this example is that they just
bid they basically just become a text on
the screen and they're not standardized
captions which you can find a different
format if you want to utilize the
captions for Camtasia or if you just
want to use them for text or whatever
that's fine too this is what I'm gonna
use but you can of course use other
different or other different things if
you really want now when I click here as
I always click best quality and file
size recommended next and then what I'm
going to do is custom width I always
publish in 1280 by 720 or 1920 by 1080
maintaining the aspect ratio means
you're going to keep it in this case 16
by 9 but you will always want to publish
with the same file that you started with
so for example when you drag a file in
here it's going to ask you like let's
say okay let's drag a file in here okay
Camtasia one right here up here in this
corner you see it's 1280 by 720 this is
important you will want to publish in
the same file dimensions here you'll
want to publish in the same ones that
are listed here so in this case it's
1280 by 720 if I want to publish in 1920
by 1080 I can put that and you can see
there's a problem because my screen
became smaller well how can we fix that
it's really easy let's drag this up here
lined up with the corners whoops
drag this from down here
boom you got a use turned a 720 video to
a 1080 video now when we produce in
gypsies what did i do what did I do now
when we produce and share we can go to
you know custom windows movie video you
can use whatever format you want I'm
just trying to keep it simple for you
now this is going to turn out right
which is good next here's some other
options you can embed it into HTML which
will which you can do you can mess
around with all of that I personally do
not do any of this any real work that I
do is always in editing I don't do much
of this production wizard stuff but you
can try it if you like it and try a
watermark if you're into that I
personally don't like them because I
just think they cover up the video and
drive you crazy just give it a shot mess
around with it I think will be fun this
is what's important this is the actual
final video name so I could be like
Camtasia tutorial 406 6504 all right and
I'd be like hey and then this is the
file destination where you're going to
find that video yeah you can organize
production files into subfolders what
that's going to do is it's going to take
the video file put it within a folder of
that title so that way if you are
publishing and other stuff like HTML
it's going to group it all in one folder
since I generally just have one video
file and they keep them all that way I
don't I don't put them in subfolders
because really my videos folder just
looks like this video titles
really organized I know but whatever
then this will make it pop up when it's
done publishing and yeah so yeah that's
pretty good and then you just click
finish and then you wait for it to
render so that is basically a pretty big
summary of Camtasia
sorry if i ramble Danny sorry if I
forgot anything super important or sorry
if I was wrong on anything if you have
any questions comments concerns leave a
comment one thing I do want to mention
with
I go is that the biggest downside to
Camtasia in my opinion is that it can
take a really long time to create videos
waiting for them to save and then
process and then publish it can take a
really long time good thing though is
that when you're working with the
editing software it doesn't skip a lot
it works very smoothly turns out good
the videos turn out great so I
personally think it's worth it so yeah
that's all I have to say thank you guys
for watching and then when this video is
done you can just go to the production
folder and you can do whatever you want
upload it to Facebook put on on YouTube
or Twitter or whatever you do it's all
yours alright thank you guys for
watching I'll see you in the next video
