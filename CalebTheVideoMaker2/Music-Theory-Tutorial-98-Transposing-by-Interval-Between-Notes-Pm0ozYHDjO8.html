about transposing by intervals from the
note to note so for example let's say we
have a melody and it goes from C to G
sharp to down to F sharp so down to F
sharp this one goes up to G sharp and
then from F sharp we go down to D which
goes down to C so here is our melody we
just created so what is the interval
from from these to these so I know from
C to G is a perfect fifth so if we add
one extra to it it becomes an Augmented
fifth so the interval between this would
be a five the interval between G sharp
to F sharp it goes down to half steps in
think yeah so this would be a perfect
second I mean so major second because
there's no perfect seconds now we have F
sharp to D it goes down to D so from D
to F sharp it goes D d sharp F F sharp
that's three steps that would be an
Augmented third I mean oh it's a second
because we're only going to scale
degrees augmented second because that's
three half steps and a perfect second
has two so augment that becomes three so
an Augmented second has three half steps
do you see going down to C that's two
half steps so that is a perfect second
major second gosh dang it why don't keep
saying perfect second there's no such
thing
so major second so here is our intervals
between the specific notes now we can
recreate this by starting on any note we
want so let's start on E
and I can't remember if we were going up
or down dang it I think we went up up
and up in Augmented fifth I'm going to
test has
eight half steps in it so e to F F to F
sharp F sharp to G G sharp G &amp;amp; G sharp
sorry G sharp to a 8 a sharp a sharp to
be so I think it's to be let me double
check that on keyboard because I was a
lot to think about so here we are we
start on e we go up eight half steps 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8
sorry it's on C I was off 1 screwed up
somewhere so that is our interval of our
Augmented fifth now from C we go a major
2nd well that's the D because there's
always what's going on we're going down
a major 2nd so we go see down to C flat
down to be so beef now we're going an
Augmented 2nd downward I think I'm not
sure if we went down and up so I'm just
going down hopefully that's okay with
you guys so a major second or
long-winded second has three half steps
so that would be going from B to a with
three half steps so I'd be a flat I'll
show you that here's bean
one two three a flat down a major second
from a flat would be G flat how do I
know that well the interval is a second
which means we cover two notes a and G
now we know it's a major second which
has two half steps we go a flat to a and
then a to a flat a flat is it yeah um
what no a flat a flat to G sorry about
that why does it keep getting dark it's
making me me it's making me mad
so then G to G flat that is an example
of transposing by intervals between the
notes so this is our new melody and it
will just sound either higher pitched or
lower pitched depending on which way you
go basically you can recreate this on
any note so if we wanted to put on
e-flat well then this becomes C flat
this will become B flat this will become
a notice we cannot be a it'll be um a
double flat what should basically just
be G and then G double flat which would
be F now the reason to put double flats
is because remember they were seconds
which means we have to cover two notes A
to G for example a G two notes now if we
wanted to actually recreate it without
having to be all technical we could just
say G and no one's gonna care but this
is music theory we have to be specific
so this would be F but that's not right
technically but who really cares but um
yeah these technically should be a
double flat and G
double flat but when you're playing on a
piano it'd be easier to replace these in
your head because it just makes more
sense
so that is transposing by intervals
that's why intervals are important so
that's not the only reason there's tons
reasons so in the next video we'll be
going over something new called
articulation see that
