tutorial this video I wanted to talk a
little bit more about string indexing
although this time I'm not going to be
telling you how to return a single
character such as printing just this
letter or just this letter I'm going to
be talking about printing a range so it
could be like print these four letters
or so forth so it's very simple to do
this the way we do this is first let's
create a variable we could say yo a sign
of devalue lemonade I'll just keep
lemonade for this video since I already
have this little picture made lemonade
alright now when we want to print an
individual character we can just be like
let's say we want to print the e and the
indexes start zero one so E is one we're
gonna say print one this should print
back and bring back E now what if we
wanted to print a range what we do is we
use a colon after the first letter or a
number sorry so let me just bring this
down here what we can do is we could say
print sorry about that little beep if
you're that just editing some videos
right now so what we do is one colon and
then we put a second number two so let's
see what this does you see it prints one
letter back so the way this works is the
first number is where you start the
second number is where you stop so if we
increase the second number to three
you would see it prints two letters let
me explain looking at the indexes here
and get a a little pencil we start at
one in this example so index 0 index 1
this is where we're starting and then we
go to index 3 so this is 2 3 you see and
it gets the range e through em that's
why I printed back e em but for the
previous example this one right here you
can see it printed only one character
let me explain that one well this is
index 0 is an X 1 so this is where we're
starting
and we want to go to index 2 we're
stopping here and it prints everything
in that range this is why you get one
character so that's why I like the index
is between concept because if you are
working where you think of characters
you think we're gonna stop it index
character with you index 2 0 1 2 you
would think it would include the M but
it actually doesn't so that's why I like
using the in between characters index
concept but if you prefer to use
characters you just have to think it
goes up to this index but it does not
include it so I'd be like 0 1 2 I'm
sorry 0 1 2 3 and it's stopped before
you reach 3 so that's just one little
thing to think about so that's sort of
how slicing strings works now we can we
can try it again let's let's try another
one just to explain this again let's
start at 4 and let's go to negative 1
and it printed net now let's figure this
one out so the first one we start at
index 4 so we got index 0 1 2 3 4 so
here's where we're starting and then we
go up to negative 1 so we have 0
negative 1 and it prints this range so
n/a D that is kind of how it works so
the negative indexes are probably more
useful for really long strings like
let's say you wanted to get all of the
characters starting at index of 30 and
then you wanted to stop 10 characters
before the last character like 4
characters for like yeah you go I'm
saying so that's just a little example
hopefully that was useful and if you
have any questions just leave me a
comment but actually I think I'm I think
i'ma go and I'll just hold off for the
next video so oh yeah see you guys in
