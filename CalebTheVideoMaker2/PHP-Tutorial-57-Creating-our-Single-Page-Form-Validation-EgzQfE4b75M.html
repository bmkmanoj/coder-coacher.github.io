video we are going to be implementing
our one-page or single page form
validation so just ignore this header
here i don't i don't think we're going
to need that so as we as we look at this
we have the the first the HTML page it's
a dot PHP because we have these includes
down here and then we have our PHP to
handle the form oh the first thing I
wanted to mention is um I made a mistake
in the last video I forgot to put echo
here so we will want to do that and save
that all right next thing is what we
need to do is since this is all going to
be put into one page we need to create
the if statement and I'm going to bring
all these back to the beginning of the
page because this is unnecessary alright
alright so there we go that's better and
what we want to do is I want to create
the if statement and we can open our PHP
to probably be helpful and then we can
close that PHP after the if statement
and then if server request method is
equal to post then we're going to do our
form validation now there's another
important thing since this is all
handled on one page we got to make sure
our HTML is not sent somewhere else so
as you can see here we have the form
action to send it to handle dot PHP that
is not what we want to do we want to
make it newsletter dot PHP because now
it's going to send the HTML to the same
form which will then go through and
reach the if statement alright so now we
can take our PHP and what we're going to
do is we're just going to copy it all
just like this
control C for copy ctrl V for paste all
right and now what we can do is we can
go to localhost and go to our newsletter
page all right now there is all right so
I forgot to put the underscore here
let's try it now refresh named Caleb
mail submit bro and then it will display
our stuff and then redisplay the form
now if we're given if we don't put
something in it'll still give us an
error and it has a link to go back to
the original page this link is no longer
necessary because it goes to the same
page so what we're going to do is we're
going to delete that so there we go now
we can save it refresh try given an
error and we can just say uh fill out
the form again so that is how single
page form validation works we have an if
statement and then within our if
statement we have all of our PHP code to
validate these stuff and we did this in
the previous video I mean it's just
basic validation it will get more
intense as we go on but for basic
validation we can put that within an if
statement then outside of our if
statement we can put our PHP just make I
mean our HTML just be sure to send it to
the same page newsletter PHP alright so
that's all I really have to say it for
this video please be sure to check out
the next one and be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
