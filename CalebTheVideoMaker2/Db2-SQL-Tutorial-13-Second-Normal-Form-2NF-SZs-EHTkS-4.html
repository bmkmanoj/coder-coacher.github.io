a couple of videos ago I discussed many
to many relationships and how they need
an intermediary table the example I gave
was users listing things they were
interested in so we had a table like
this and these are both foreign keys
referencing another table
and you're probably wondering why I'm
going all over this well this is where
you're going to run into second normal
form problems it's when you have
something known as a composite primary
key now a composite primary key the word
composite is just a fancy word for
humans to use but the database doesn't
actually use that word so just know that
when I say composite that's not a
keyword okay it's just just a word to
describe the type of primary key and
that type of primary key is the
combination of multiple primary keys or
just columns so for example we can make
the combination of these be the primary
key and the way that works is that the
user ID it can have repeating values all
at once because you know primary keys
you're not supposed to have repeating
values but this here is actually a
foreign key and foreign keys allow
repeating values because you can have
multiple references to the same primary
key and this down here is a foreign key
as well so we can have multiple interest
ID in the table the trick though is that
you have to keep the combination of a
user ID in the interest IDE unique so if
we write out this beta we might have a 1
+ 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 for example so these
both reference 1 into these both
reference one entity these both
reference wanted to devious and these
both reference one entity
so there's repeating data in both
columns but the thing is the combination
is never repeated once we have 1 1 you
can't repeat that once you have 1 2 you
can't repeat that so that is how a
composite primary key works and when you
define a composite primary key in db2
you're going to put that at the bottom
to create table statement as if it was
another column but it's not so it would
look like this this comma here is
telling db2 that we're going to have two
columns in our primary key this has to
be done at the table level so that means
you're going to have your other columns
up here we haven't done a ton of SQL in
these videos but I did put a lot of
examples on my website so make sure you
check that out the link is going to be
in the description and it'll update
continually so if you go there and
you're finding not a ton of content will
always check back regularly because I'm
always updating it with new content all
right I'm getting a little off-topic
though we were talking about second
normal form second normal form deals
with something called partial
dependencies to think back to the
one-to-one relationships video and the
other relationships videos we talked
about attributes depending on an entity
they describe an entity well the same
thing comes up here when we're talking
about partial dependencies we're talking
about things describing the primary key
but only part of the primary key so if
that doesn't make any sense at all
that's okay essentially imagine we have
another column in here but that column
only really describes the interest
section and not the user ID it only
describes part of that primary key so
let's say these interests have
categories we could say in here interest
category and when we do this we
introduce a partial dependency in our
database because if you think about this
the user really doesn't matter at all in
this situation let's say we go in here
and change the interest now from C++
programming to acrylic painting for
example well the interest category might
change from computer science to art so
there's definitely a dependency on this
interest ID but not the user ID how do
you fix this though we've recognized we
have a partial dependency the way we fix
it is that we break off into another
table if we don't already have one in
this situation we probably do and that's
going to be the interest table this
category here
needs to be moved into this table and
just get that out of the middle table
you'll you don't need that here and the
intermediary table it doesn't belong so
we fixed our problem here now this
interest is going to have a category
which you know that could be referenced
from another table like a category table
if we really wanted so what kind of
columns can we put in this table legally
only columns that depend on both of the
primary key pieces so for example if you
recorded when this association between a
user and an interest was started so for
example you join the website two weeks
later you say hey I'm interested in
computer science well then it puts a
timestamp saying oh this guy became
interested in computer science at this
time well that's actually relevant to
both the user and the interest because
it's recording
when a user became interested in
something so anytime you have something
that relates to both of these and
wouldn't really make sense in the user
table and what it really makes sense in
the interest table you can put it in
here as a column inside of the
intermediary table between the
many-to-many relationship so I know this
is kind of super complex second normal
form is one of the hardest normal forms
especially because it really doesn't
come up a whole lot only when you have
many to many relationships and you're
dealing with storing things in the
intermediary table if you want to be on
the safe side just try not to design
your tables to where you have extra
columns in an intermediary table and
there you don't have a problem anymore
but then that means you can't store
anything about this primary key so you
know you got it you got a balance once
you figure it out then you can go in
here put columns in here make sure that
your data is structured correctly so
thanks guys if you have any questions
please leave a comment and be sure to
check out the description I have links
for downloading db2 and checking out my
website db2 has been a good database to
me so I would encourage you to try it
out and apply what I'm talking about
here to your database in db2 thanks guys
and I'll see you in the next video peace
