Python tutorial series I believe we are
on video 10 so great job if you made it
this far you've made it 10 videos in and
I sure hope that you're learning a lot
and as always if you have questions
leave me a comment and I'll do my best
to explain things alright so this video
I still want to continue my topic of
lists although I want to talk about
selecting a range of values rather than
just just two so let's let's try some
things and just see if they work what we
could do is we could try printing chores
too and we could try printing shores 3
which I don't even know this is gonna
work enough and we can see that there is
an error so let's try a comma so now we
have chores too which would be 1 0 1 2
do my homework and then we have chores 3
so we can select individual indexes like
that just putting a comma there let's
try it again so let's make it say clean
the room eat some fog so that would be
zero so we want to select these zero
with index the index with the values 0
however you want to say it 0 1 2 3 4 5
so we have to change this to 5 and then
we can press Enter clean the room eat
some fog so we did it correctly now what
if I want to do something such as
selecting a range of values rather than
selecting every single one that we want
well we can actually do this I'll show
you how right now print and then within
here we say ok we print shores because
obviously that's the list that we're
printing from what range do we want to
print let's just say from 1 to 4 the
colon is set is basically a way to say
- so one - for the range it's saying
everywhere from one to four we press
ENTER and we will see what we have we
have go shopping do my homework recycle
so we can see that it starts on one go
shopping because this is 0 this is 1 and
then it has do my homework - and then it
has recycle 3 but it doesn't have eat
some food that's because it's saying
stop before we get to 4 so this is
include this is exclusive because it
does not include the final value so the
first number the first index is included
the second index is not included so now
let's let's try to figure out how we
would select do my homework all the way
up to eat some fog well we have 0 1 2 so
we need to start on two so let's just
type this up real quick so we can work
our way there so we know we need to
start on 2 and we're not sure about the
next number so 0 1 2 and we want 3 4 &amp;amp; 5
so we can't just put 5 here because
remember it's exclusive it doesn't
include the one we stopped on so this is
going to stop I eat some food
we want it to stop on eat some fog so in
order to do that we must go one step
farther and make this 2 to 6 that's
saying start at 2 and stop before you
get to 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 all don't go on so
that is how we would select that range
of values so hopefully that was useful
and that may come in handy in the future
some other things I just wanted to
mention that strings are not the only
things that we can store and lists we
can also store numbers so we could say
just numbers for example and we could
make this a list but you can make it
five three seven we don't have to put
quotes because they are not strengths
they are numbers we could save that as
that oops I didn't mean to put that
there
but anyways uh what we can do now is we
can print that sorry and it gives us the
entire list we can also take a specific
value from this so we could say print
the value that has the index of two
which would be the third one at seven
correct all right so that's just some
other things another one last thing is
that you can actually mix numbers and
strings so we could say we can make a
variable my favorite things and we
assign it a list
my first favorite thing is bright
morning sunshine
my second favorite thing is the letter
the number 73
my third favorite thing is the smell of
nail polish remover and then my next
favorite thing is 43 and then my next
favorite thing is five or six and then
my next favorite thing is cool so now we
can okay I messed ok so I forgot a comma
here so let me just fix that real quick
it's a be sure to put a comma after each
and individual one so now we can print
that out
well there you go all right so that's
all I have to say in this video thank
you for watching and be sure to
