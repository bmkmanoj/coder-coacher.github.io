youtubes how you guys do in this video
we are going to be talking about date
date time and time so these are three
data types that MySQL has to store dates
and times yeah I know as you can tell by
SQL likes to really you know separate
things out make a lot of extra data
types for us simple-minded who like
complexity right I'm kidding with joke
anywho there are three data types used
to do basically the same thing so we
have day time date and time and the
difference between these are very
obscure I'm just playing this obviously
okay so let's start with daytime date
time is separated into date and time
which are essentially the same as these
data types so you can store two in one
using date/time now there's something
particularly special about labeling a
column one of these data types and that
is that MySQL can work with that data
especially it knows that it's working
with a date you could in theory not use
these data types for example you can
have a bar chart column within here you
can say something like that and this
works fine that's one way you can store
dates but overall it's just pretty
craptastic you need I need to like
become a little bit more professional
here this is a very unprofessional
approach to do anything of course I'm
sure there are certain situations when
you will want to store a date as just a
sequence of characters in a string but
in general you are going to want to use
a data type like date/time date or time
there's also timestamp which we'll be
getting into that in an upcoming video
so if you have a column that is of one
of these data types how do you give it
the data is it date a number or is it a
string well we just discussed that it
wasn't a string it works a little
differently so how do you do it well you
actually pass it as a string so you
quote it when you give it data now what
goes in this
has to do with conventions so as we've
discussed conventions are just and
agreed upon something that everyone uses
just to make life easier so for example
if I give you something like this and I
say it's a time well you would say yeah
the time is 6:30 and you know what that
means you automatically know that 6:00
well this is how it works in the USA it
works differently elsewhere I apologize
I am uninformed anyways this is the hour
and this is the mist the colon here is
just convention we decided hey let's put
a colon here if we could just put
someone else you know we could have said
6 - 30 or 6-pound 30 is a convention
well MySQL has its own way of
representing dates and times and we need
to become familiar with how MySQL does
that or else we might think something
else for example someone who doesn't
know this convention might look at this
so the bad maple hook-up there's like
this it's the 12th hour of the day and
it's the 6 minute and then it's all
confusing so let's learn how MySQL
represents base and time first let's
discuss dates I will give you the way
MySQL stores them and then I'll show you
some common ways that we as human beings
Express dates so this is an example of a
date that we could pass to MySQL and
it's very clear from this example which
one is the year obviously that one
because it has four numbers but here is
where ambiguity shows up which one of
these is talking about the month and
which one's talking about the day you
can buy this example figure it out
because 22 only makes sense in the
context of it being a day so in summary
this is the year this is the month and
this is the day this is in contrast to
some ways we express dates as humans
some people would represent this this
others would represent it like this some
people would represent it like this so
you can see it's very important to
understand what is what when we are
working with dates now MySQL can be a
little bit lenient in how you give it a
date and we'll be discussing that in a
future video but for now understand
this is the standard format for a date
now let's move on to the time this is an
example of a time where 22 is the hour
54 is a minutes and 30 is the second and
you can see that the delimiter or the
separator is different
we have colons for the time and hyphens
for the date now the hour this way look
interesting to some of you this is in 24
hour time or as some people would say
military time so if you're not used to
that you can take 22 subtract 12 and we
figure out that it's 10 so this will be
the equivalent to 10:54 p.m. now a cool
thing with MySQL is that we can actually
have fractional seconds so we can put a
period right here and add fractions up
to 6 decimals which I believe would be
microseconds but it's not very often I
worked with time that small so in
general I don't really need any of this
data and I don't really worry a whole
lot about it
but this is something that can set my
SQL apart from some other database
management systems now in order to do
this when you specify the data type you
have to give it some kind of precision
in parentheses so for example we would
say time 6 which would allow up to 6
decimal places here what less you could
do something like 3 which would limit
you to just that many now let's say we
have a column that is of a data type 8
time and we'll say precision of 6 how do
we pass data into this so let's go
through a very concrete example of what
we would give it everything is going to
be inside of a quote when we start with
the date now after the date we put a
space and we start with the time and
then after the time we can put a period
for fractional seconds and there you go
that is an example of a date/time value
that is all I have for this video
although I do have more to say about
date time and date time and also some of
the other data types we're going to come
across so please stick with the series
