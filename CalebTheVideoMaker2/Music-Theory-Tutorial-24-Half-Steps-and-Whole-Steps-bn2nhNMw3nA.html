series so far and they're learning some
things now we're going to be getting
into what's called half steps and whole
steps to terms you need to learn so now
as you can see I wrote these out here
there is also two more names for them
half steps can be referred to as
semitones whole steps can be referred to
as toes so what these are is a way to
count your movements on piano or steps
in pitch so if we move from AC
up to a c-sharp right here that's called
a semitone so the movement from C to
c-sharp
would be a semitone C sharp to D would
be a semitone d schat d to d sharp
semitone
so basically or half steps think of
steps as movement so C the C sharp is
one semitone or half-step whatever you
want to call it now this is very
important because we can alter our
sounds of intervals by the amount of
half steps they're better in them
let me zoom out some here for example
let me show you a good example this if
we have C up to see
it's an octave which if you remember
from the scale degrees is 8 c d e f g a
b c that's 8 and we can count both of
those C's because they're they're not
the same see there are two different
seas so let's say this is C 3 and this
is C for now there's 12 half steps of
that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
it's an 8 now what if we go C to c-sharp
Oh sounds different but the scale
degrees is still 8 because we remember I
said ignore the sharps and flats so this
is c d e f g a b c d ABC still although
there's a sharpener huh that means it
sounds different
so there's actually 13 half steps in
this example and remember half steps are
movement so if we go from C to C the
same C it's not a half step you didn't
go anywhere but C to C sharp is 1 now C
sharp can the other C sharp is 12 so 1
plus 12 13 you get what I'm saying it's
still an octave it's still called an
octave but there's something different
about it there's 13 half steps rather
than 12 to show this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13
so what is a whole step
while whole step is basically two half
steps
that is a whole step one half step
another half step which two half steps
equals one whole step or tone whatever
you want to call it so now that you know
this this is very very very important so
when we're counting scale degrees I want
you to notice something when we're
counting scale degrees we count where we
start when we count half steps or whole
steps
we do not so so this is for scale degree
also known as interval size or for our
cases called we called interval size and
then for this this is called
half steps and whole steps and whole
steps so we do not count where we start
that's the main difference that throws
everybody off so when you're counting
c2g I know it's a fifth with seven half
steps because if we were to count where
we started one two okay one two three
four five six seven eight we'd get eight
cuz that's a G that's wrong we do not
count where we start but I'll try and
get too hyped up I just gotta make sure
you guys understands quite important
so now that you know that we're counting
scale degrees we do not count where we
start I mean we counter with our you
guys all of counting scale degrees we
count where we start one two three four
five
it's 1/5 how many have steps in it one
because it's movement so from here to
here is a half step 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 half
steps in it 5th from C to G that is so
what did you learn
scale degrees interval size we should
call it interval size we count where we
start and half steps we do not count
where we start so that's what I want you
to get from this video and in the next
video we're going to put some of this
stuff to use which will help drill it in
your brain and yeah so subscribe and
I'll thank you for watching and I'll see
you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
