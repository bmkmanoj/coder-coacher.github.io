five video database design primer ready
to have your brain exploded for the
second time today let's get started so
I'm going to try to take it just a
little slower than in blast video but
this is going to be about database
integrity and I talked about this a
little bit in the last video and this
camera just looks a little too close so
I'm just going to back it up a little
bit so in the last video we discussed
database integrity just a little bit but
in this video I want to go in much more
depth so let's talk about integrity
database integrity is a thing we try to
have in our database basically it
protects our database from breaking
having incorrect data and so forth so to
make the whole concept easier and easier
to discuss they break it up into three
categories so the first one is entity
integrity second one is referential
integrity and the third one is domain
integrity now before we discuss the
three categories of integrity I want to
discuss one thing you should always try
to do when you're building a database
always try to make things built off of
singularity rather than plural arity
down like so let me just that made no
sense so let me just kind of describe it
if you have a table you have a table
name so let's say it's user 3 users and
you probably wonder what will whoa that
is not singular that's plural yeah it's
right it is it is plural
but the thing it's talking about is one
individual thing its users that is one
thing it's not users and customers it's
not users and professors or whatever
it's just users so this talks about one
thing so the primary goal is to make
everything
so if you're wondering what atomic means
think of an atom a long time ago when we
were not able to split an atom well that
basically described what we were trying
to do with the database where we have
chunks of information that aren't meant
to be split so you can't break this
table up into anything more you can't
break it up if it was like it was like
users plus some customers well you could
split it have users and customers state
will have two separate tables that would
be not that would not be atomic but
since we have just users it does make
sense it's atomic it's only one thing
it's a basically just a general specific
it's basically just a general entity and
then within here we're going to have
specific users so that's one thing you
need to know when we're making databases
so when we have columns we make the
columns title be about one specific
thing so phone number a first name last
name we generally want them to be things
that are atomic for example and address
that's usually more not so atomic
because if you think of address you
actually have a city and you're a city a
state a street address you might have an
apartment number
those are multiple things within that
one column and we want to avoid that so
that's the very first thing now when
we're discussing entity integrity that
means everything needs a primary key the
primary key is used to keep everything
unique so you have basically an ID which
is a type of primary key that's known as
a surrogate key we talked a little bit
about that in the last video surrogate
keys are just random numbers that are
generated by the database to have no
real-world value if you do pick a
natural key you want your natural key to
be something that doesn't change so the
primary key doesn't change and then we
have a couple other rules well for one
no if you remember from the last video
null means the lack of a value so there
is no value there so you can't have a
primary key that doesn't have a value if
the email is the primary key every
single person or every single account is
going to need in key mail the third
thing is that it should be unique
you shouldn't have two entities with the
same primary key if we have a guy here
and a guy here and this guy's ID is 106
and this guy's ID is 106 the database
will assume that these are both the same
people and that's not the case because
there's two of them
so these are known as constraints
it's basically setting rules for the
database that's saying don't be null or
everybody has to be unique and that's
just some examples there's more
constraints you could add for example
there are referential constraints which
is what we'll be discussing now
referential constraints connects tables
so when you have two tables when we have
two tables and there's some kind of
connection we'll have a primary key in
this table a primary key in this table
and then one of the tables will
reference the other table so if this is
my users and comments well the comments
is going to reference this table so
we'll have a foreign key that references
that primary key to say that this
comment was posted by this user and
that's all done using the primary key
that's the connection now if they want
referential integrity we have to protect
that using constraints constraints are
basically rules that don't let you do
certain things to destroy the database
so for example if we did not have
constraints and we had this foreign key
connection well then we can make it to
where if we delete this person
he's awful there and this comment still
exists that doesn't make sense because
comet can't exist without somebody
posting it so then we're gonna have all
these comments like wow and it's gonna
be bye no we don't want to see these
kinds of things on a website or
application because that's not good at
all because you don't know who said it
this is bad so that's referential
integrity the final one is domain
integrity domain integrity is basically
giving a list of possible options for
columns in a table so if you think of a
table we could have a table for the
users just like this table up here but
I'm just going to draw a more room and
I'm just going to list the columns this
way so don't think of these as rows or
just listing what the columns will be so
the table is a user's table and we might
have a u.s. our underscore then user
underscore ID underscore pk so basically
that long nonsense is a prefix of user
table the user ID and then it's the
primary key that's one column we might
have then we might have the name
user name if you wanted you could break
name up into first-name lastname so that
would be more atomic if that's something
you would like to do user password so
these are just some examples of columns
that you could have and if you notice I
did this a little differently because
normally I'll draw a table out like this
and put the columns up here and then
rows across this way
well this design is actually pretty
common so basically we're just setting
all the rules of what the the rows are
going to have but we don't actually
write them in this is known as basically
an entity relationship diagram
so that's e r D and - the relationship
diagram and you'll see these connected
to other tables so you might see
something like this and you'll see big
charts where it'll have the table and
the columns for that table and different
types of relationships between tables
that's an entity relationship diagram
but in this situation we're going to
implement domain integrity by preventing
certain entries into these columns for
example the username we can make we can
make domain integrity by saying that
everybody's name should be characters it
shouldn't be a data type that is not a
character so if if we wanted to do that
we would give it the data type of
strength for example when we when we
make it a string it's not going to allow
people to put the data type that's
numbers or the data type of dates or the
data type of true and false it might be
able to store those values if you don't
put enough constraint for example it can
be a string but that string might say
true whereas when it's in when it's in
quotes running out of space here what
it's in quotes it's
as a string and we'll get more into the
specific types of datatypes really soon
but for now just no string is with like
the quotes but this is very well could
also be true without the quotes and if
that's the case then this is not
referring to a string but this is a
boolean a boolean which is either true
or false so that's what I'm saying you
want to make sure it's the right type
you don't want to allow number data
types or boolean you want it to be
string a couple other things you can do
is you can say how many characters you
want it to be and so forth so for an
email you should be able to check like
well as at least three characters or
whatever the shortest email length is
you can try and go in more depth to make
regular expressions with software to
check your email you want to add domain
constraints that prevent people from
putting garbage in your database and
making your database all messed up you
can also do conditional statements to
test data so you can say if the sex that
the person enters is either M or F then
insert it but if it's something else
like I like cats well you don't want to
put that in there so you can say well
don't insert it that's an example of
just some different types of integrity
that you can put in your database you're
a dork so yeah guys that's all I have to
say about integrity so thanks for
watching and I'll catch you guys in the
next video
peace and be sure to subscribe and cool
