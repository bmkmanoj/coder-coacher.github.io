hopefully not because as soon as you
finish the last video you should have
found this one if you did well then your
loss missed out because I actually did
something really cool but you missed it
because you were too slow so I guess
we'll just move on to the boring stuff
we're gone I'm going to go over what's
called a dotted note and this will look
like this we have yeah if I have a
quarter note I know my markers are
getting worse and worse but I'm snowed
in I already said that I think and then
I added taunt to it it's going to add
one half of this note to it so that'd be
the equivalent of a quarter note plus an
eighth note oh that's a sixteenth so now
rather than it being worth 1/4 of a
measure it is worth three eighths so
that's cool the dotted notes are
actually quite common you will see them
probably so let me give you some more
examples if we have a half note which is
represented with a it looks like a
coordinate but there's it's not filled
in with a dot it's usually worth two out
of four quarter notes but now it's going
to be worth three out of four yes oh
because yes it's usually worth two out
of four and now it's going to be worth
three out of four now the reason we
didn't have to change the denominator
like we did with the quarter note which
is 1/4 to 3/8 was because this is
actually 1/2 you see what I'm saying so
this is basically if we did it with the
quarter note we would have two two
eighths plus an eighth note
hopefully that makes a little bit of
sense okay but basically if we have a
dotted half note it becomes three beats
rather than two it takes the next
smallest division and adds one to it so
if we have a dotted quarter note it
becomes three eighths if we have a
dotted eighth note it guess what it's
going to become three sixteenths if we
have a dotted sixteenth note what do you
think it will become three
thirty-seconds what does this mean so
yeah that is one way to can think of it
just as adding one of the lower notes to
it but you could also think of it as
let's say we have a quarter note which
is equal to one-fourth we can add a dot
to it which will give it half little
multiply its value x 10.5 and give it a
half of an extra value so if the value
of it is one-fourth it will become one
point five out of four which is easily
represented as three out of eight which
we can get that by doubling each of
these by two one point five times two is
equal to three four is equal to eight
so rather than Consent thinking of it as
three eighths you can think of it as a
quarter note plus an eighth note the
same duration as three eighth notes so
either one if you consider it three
eighth notes or if you consider it a
quarter note plus an eighth note they're
both the same concept same thing see it
that is what a dotted note is like
so what if we have we're counting bar
lines or whatever like we did in the
last video if we have a dotted
quarter-note
plus an eighth note so how many beats is
it's worth well we know it's going to be
2 because this is 1.5 and this is 0.5
just another way to think of it is this
is 3/8 and this is 1 which becomes 4
eighths yeah
which is 2 which is 1 2 beats out of the
total 4 which is kind of confusing it
the answers 2 beats but out of the
entire measure its 2/4 of a measure so
yeah let's try it with a oh no what
about a whole new well it's actually
going to become I don't know how to draw
it it would be the equivalent of oh no
plus a half note so this is a whole note
it would be the equivalent whole note
plus a half note or 6 beats which is the
same thing as 6 out of the four beats of
each measure so and be six fourths of a
measure or one and a half measures makes
sense hopefully and the next video I'll
be going over double-dog notes which are
even cooler so I'll see you then thank
