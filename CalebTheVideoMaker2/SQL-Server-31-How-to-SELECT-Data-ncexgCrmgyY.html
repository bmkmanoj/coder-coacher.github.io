maker - this video we're going to be
talking about the select statement this
is one of the key statements in SQL so
you want to pay attention the way it
works is very simple all you have to do
is say select and then what you do is
say the columns you want to select that
ultimately depends on what table you're
going to select from but let's select
from our animals table so let's go over
to our object Explorer and expand that
table to see what we got in there
subscribe
tables animals we can look at the
columns here we will start simple and
we'll build our way up so I'm going to
select the ID name species ID and the
contact email and then say from and say
what table you want to select this from
animals let's run this and see if it
works
great it works you can see it returns
all of the data that we want to see from
this table as you can see the syntax is
really not that hard but there's
actually some things we can do to make
it simpler
the first thing rather than going into
our object Explorer to see what kind of
columns we have in there what we can do
is we can prefects each column with the
table and it will tell us what columns
are available here I'll show you what I
mean let me erase this we can say
animals dot and here are all of the
columns that are available to us so this
makes it super easy for us the way you
want to do it is ultimately up to you
but I'm just going to show you that this
does work and then let's run that and
you can see it works exactly the same in
this situation we are selecting every
single column there's actually an easier
way to tell a sequel server we want
everything and that's to replace all of
these columns with an asterisk and you
can see it works just like normal
additionally you can put expressions in
your select statement so let's undo that
and I'll show you what I mean so let's
say instead of having the contact email
followed by the name and two separate
columns we wanted to put that in one for
easier reading or something like that
what we can do is literally just put
plus signs to what do what's known as
concatenating so we can take animals dot
contact email plus animals dot name and
this is going to be returned as one
column that's because there's no commas
to separate the columns additionally
though we are going to want to put a
quote in here with a space maybe
and then another Plus that way it just
looks a little prettier for us let's try
this and there you go you can see that
it says Sally at caleb curry calm -
Sally
so that is your introduction to the
Select statement hopefully that was nice
and juicy oh goodness
