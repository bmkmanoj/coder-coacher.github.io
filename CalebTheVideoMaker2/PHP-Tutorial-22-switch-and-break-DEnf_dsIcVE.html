I want to talk about the switch
statement now for those of you who are
new programmers this is probably a new
one to you and it may be a little
confusing at first but it's very similar
to the if else--if so don't freak out
and hyperventilate or anything because
everything is going to be alright
now what what this is used for its to up
test the value of a variable so
oftentimes the values of variables are
user-submitted so the programmer are not
but the programmers are not going to
know at the time of the creation so
rather than saying hello calif they're
going to say something like hello name
because they don't know for sure if your
name's Caleb so a lot of this is user
submitted and oftentimes we are going to
need to test the values within that user
submitted and variable values to see if
certain calculations added up and so
forth so let me give you a real life
example by real life I mean pretend I'm
programming in real life not like a real
usage so here we have two doors into
this room if your name is Caleb you can
get in or if your name is Austin so
here's the secret room and if you're
anyone else you don't get access so we
are going to use a switch statement
that's going to test the value of name
now if the value of name is Caleb you
get into the secret room if the name is
Austin you get into the secret room but
if your name is Billy
well you don't you don't get into secret
room sorry about that
that's a silly example of how a case can
work basically we're just I mean a
switch can work we're just going to test
each of these cases and see if they have
access
to the room now let me show you this in
real PHP code now because it's a little
more complex I wrote it out beforehand
nice and simple so it's easy to read
this is what it looks like
don't freak out nothing crazy I'm gonna
break this down very simple all right so
let's make sure you can see everything
all right here we go oh I made a huge
mess name here is a variable that we
assigned the value Caleb and we started
a switch and we're testing the value of
a name each one of these cases are sort
of like this the doors into the secret
room so we have a case here and I have a
case here I forgot something too so we
add it real quick now each case has a
possible value for um the switch so
Caleb if it's Caleb if the value of name
is Caleb we're going to echo welcome
Caleb and then if it's case where it's
Austin we're going to echo welcome
Austin and if it's default well
basically that means well you don't get
access so we echo you don't have access
we also see this term break well that's
there because it's to say okay let's say
my name is Caleb and I do have access
well then there's no need to test the
rest of this so we're going to break out
of the program right then right after
this break so no need to test any of
this other crap because we already know
we have access we don't need to see if
my name is Austin
that's another short circuit example so
how exactly do we set this up we put the
switch keyword switch just like if and
then within parentheses we put the
variable name we're testing and then we
have curly braces which covers
everything nothing yeah there it's all
the way down there so here's the curly
braces that close everything and then we
have a paste and a value and then a
colon that tells what we do when that
case is successful so a colon not a
semicolon the Kulin two dots and then
what happens and then we break and just
so you understand the break all it's
saying is don't go past this point it
breaks out of the program and then if
this is not a success it goes to the
next possible case and it says for
Austin if it is Austin echoes welcome
Austin breaks out of the program then we
have a default which if you don't have
access it will go to the default so
hopefully that makes good sense the
reason we have a break on the default is
because we can actually move the default
up to the top if we wanted and because
right now it's the end of the program so
don't really need it but if we moved it
to the top we wouldn't want it to keep
testing and so forth another reason we
have the break is if this break wasn't
here if I erase this break well then the
switch statement is going to you run all
commands until the end of the curly
braces so we're going to get welcome
caleb and welcome austin which is not
going that's not what we want so we have
to be sure to leave the break in there
it's very important alright so hopefully
that explains the basics of case
statements let me switch statements I'm
sorry
switch statements with multiple cases
you can have more than one
case gonna have hundreds of cases if you
want
so just to do this with chalk I'm gonna
look at this so I don't mess up anything
we had a variable oh we had a variable
name and it had caleb then where we
start to switch and within the
parenthesis we have the variable or
testing and then after that we open the
curly braces close the curly braces and
we have a case which is one possibility
and then the value of what the name can
be so and then a colon and then the echo
what will happen or do whatever we want
with the code really you can have and
then we break so that is the basis of
making a switch then if you wanted
another case you can just add another
case and so forth until you don't run
out of options until you run out of
options and then you can make a default
if you want so yeah that is the basis of
the case the switch so hopefully that
was helpful
my throat feels like it's going to
explode so be sure to always make sure
you have the break when it's necessary
and you can use this to test other
things it doesn't just have to be all
the value of a variable so it could say
you can use it for a lot of different
things so thank you for watching and be
