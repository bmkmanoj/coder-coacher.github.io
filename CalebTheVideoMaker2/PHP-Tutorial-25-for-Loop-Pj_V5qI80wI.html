talk about the for loop now this one is
probably the most confusing of them all
so if you have no experience with four
loops just stick with it don't freak out
buckle up for them just kidding it's not
going to be too bad
basically to make a four loop we keyword
four and then within parentheses we give
it three parameters parameters basically
just what you put in the parentheses and
we always put expressions so for example
in an if in an if statement we could say
if the variable X is less than or equal
to five this whole thing right here this
is known as an expression and we'll be
getting to more specific definitions of
expression and all that those technical
terms soon but this right here is the
expression and because we put it within
the parentheses it's known as a
parameter anyways we put in three
parameters the first one we can define a
variable so let's use the variable I and
we can define it we can give it a value
of one and then we put a semicolon okay
now we give it the second expression
which is a test just like in an if
statement we test it if it's true so
basically I'm going to be writing this
out and then I'll be explaining as I go
so here's our second expression and I
put a semicolon and we give it a third
expression
so here's our final thing here and we
have curly braces we're just going to
echo the value of I all right so let me
explain this now as you can see we have
three things each one separated by
semicolon so this one semicolon this one
semicolon this one just in case you
can't read my handwriting variable I has
the value one variable I less than or
equal to five variable I incremented one
so how does this work well when we first
run this test it's going to echo the
value of I five times it's basically
going to count one two three four five
four loops are a way to repeat loops a
specific amount of times so we give it a
value one and because we wanted to do it
five times we say well less than or
equal to 5 which five is equal to five
and then each loop we increment I so it
counts one two three four five hopefully
that makes sense so when we first start
this the first expression the first
primer we put in is going to be R and so
now on the variable I has the value 1 so
I'm just gonna write that down here
variable I has the value 1 that's the
only time that expression is going to be
used so that parameter is now over with
all right now the next one this is a
test for true or false tone which I
don't think it's worth but anyways is
the variable I less than or equal to 5
if it is the echo or whatever we tell
this code is going to be ran and yes it
is less than five so it's going to echo
the value of I which is going to print
one cool and once it echoes this it's
going to do the third parameter which is
I plus plus or incrementing I and if you
don't remember that from previous videos
it's going to add 1 to the value of I
because I has the value 1 now it's going
to have the value 2 so now what is the
variable eyes value less than or equal
to 5 yes it is so it's going to echo I 2
and then it's going to increment by 2 3
okay now is I less than or equal to 5
yes it is so it's going to echo I write
3 and then it's going to increment I to
a 4
all right now is I less than or equal to
5 yes it is so it's going to echo I and
then it's going go what you write for
print 4 of the screen and then it's
going to increment I to 5 now is value
of I less than or equal to 5 yes it's
equal to 5 so that still runs us true
it's going to echo I read 5 and then
it's going to increment I to 6
all right now is it is I less than or
equal to 5
no it's not so is this going to be
printed no it's not because none of
those happened
we don't increment it either and then we
go on in the program so that is the
basics of the for loop and although I
made it pretty complicated and walk
through each step basically that's going
to do this it's going to do it's going
to assign
assign a value to I that's the very
first thing it does then it's going to
test that value against a certain
condition the one we used was is it less
than or equal to five so it's going to
testify is less than or equal to five
and that's true so it's going to echo
oops and then it's going to increment
and just so we know where we're at
echoes one now it doesn't have to assign
this anymore because that's the only
time it's going to do that one it's
going to test it is I less than or equal
to five
yes which means we echo and inker two
and then so after it after this step
right here it's echoed two and the value
of I is 3 so echo 2 and now we change
the value of I 2 3 can we test it less
than or equal to 5 yes
so we echo it and go to the value 3
because we changed it increment it is
the value of I less than or equal to 5
yes it is so we echo it or and the
increment is the value of I less than or
equal to 5 yes it is
so we echo it 5 and the increment is the
value of I less than or equal to 5
no it's not so then that is the end of
the program now there is ways you can
change this loop to do other sorts of
things this is the most basic way to use
it and this is probably the most common
way just to do certain thing a certain
number of times you can also omit
certain expressions or certain
parameters that we give it to make an
infinite infinite loop or anything like
that which you can look in the PHP
manual if you want more specifics or you
might be getting into that in future
videos so that's all I really wanted to
say
video hopefully that was clear I know it
was a little more complex but I tried to
explain it in a simple manner and if
it's not crystal clear yet that's okay I
understand I'm a horrible teacher it's
fine but you should still subscribe
