video maker - in the previous video I
talked about scientific notation and how
to hard-code those values but this video
I wanted to talk about how do we get
these values from the user and how do we
output in scientific notation
essentially I want to explore some of
the different ways we can format our
data so to begin there are some format
characters also known as conversion
characters that we need to learn so for
example this percent I is one conversion
character but there are many more that
we can use so let's learn those first
let's go down here and make a list the
first one which we have already learned
about is percent F and this is for
decimal notation decimal notation is
like this nothing fancy about it the
next one you're going to want to know is
percent e this is used for scientific
notation lastly we have percent G and
this one allows the computer to decide
how does it decide though well it
depends on the size of the exponent if
the exponent is less than negative 4 it
will put it in scientific notation or if
the exponent is greater than 5 otherwise
it will use decimal notation to learn
these let's take our number up here and
output it using all three of the
conversion characters so let's go up
here to our printf statement and you can
see here we are using the I for integers
but let's convert that to a double and
now let's output this as f e and % g
it's kind of confusing looking but
essentially we're putting the F on one
line the e on the next line and then the
G on the last line and we are going to
need to throw in this dogs three times
now let's run this
alright now you can see what our output
looks like speaking of dogs mine is
being very obnoxious
the first one is decimal notation the
second one is exponential notation and
then the third one the computer decides
and it says hey I think it would look
better without the exponent if this
exponent was a 6 this would output a
little bit differently let's show that
let's change this to a 6
and there you go now you can see it's
using scientific notation now the plus
here that's kind of redundant it's kind
of like putting a plus before a number
in math if you don't put it there it's
just assumed negatives on the other hand
are required now let's talk about taking
input let's go back to our code let's
get rid of this outdated comment and
we'll add a prompt here we will declare
the dogs variable but we're not going to
initialize it we are going to get the
value from a scanf now scanning in
floating-point values is a little bit
different we actually need to use
percent LF that is how we scan in a
double the variable we want to store
that value in is dogs now the good part
is that this format character can
actually be used to read scientific
notation and decimal notation so we
don't have to memorize all the different
options of LF L II and LG we can just
use LF for everything let's give this a
try and see if it works as we expect it
to
let's save compile and run how many dogs
do you have I would say I have about
65,000 300 dogs and the output seems to
be correct let's try again
yep seems to be working and now let's
try to give an input in scientific
notation so you can see in this
situation even though we gave our number
and scientific notation it can still be
outputted in all three different ways
that goes to show that the LF conversion
character can be used for both
scientific and decimal notation one
thing you got to pay special attention
to is that for scanf you have to use the
l when we have a double for printf you
just use f by itself you don't need the
l and the reason behind that is kind of
confusing and gets into a lot of
advanced details but essentially as i
mentioned before if we pass in a float
to the printf function
it gets promoted to a double but scanf
on the other hand works a little bit
differently because we are using this
address of operator the data type of
dogs does not get changed if it were to
be a float and because of that we have
to have two conversion characters one
for double and one for float
and if that doesn't make perfect sense
don't worry about it by the end of the
series I'm sure you will understand that
