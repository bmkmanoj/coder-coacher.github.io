going to go over the octal numbering
system if it's helpful please be sure to
subscribe and like this video
so octal so far we have gone over the
numbering systems binary and hexadecimal
we've also gone over decimal which is
just normal
counting intense which you do every day
so binary has a base of two hexadecimal
has a face of sixteen well octal has a
base of eight what this means is that
there is eight different symbols that we
can use for binary there's two different
symbols hexadecimal there's sixteen just
to illustrate this for binary you have a
0 and a 1 that means it's a base 2
because you have one symbol two symbols
hexadecimal is 0 through F which if you
don't really know what that means
go check out my hexadecimal video walk
toll on the other hand though is a BIOS
edit not binary is a system with the
base 8 that means we get the range 0 to
7 so the complete octal dictionary or
numbering system contains the the
numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 and if we were
to count these we would get 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 or opt and so op means I can Opticon
or octopus or October which is the 10th
month of the year that's confusing
anyways oslo has of eight so base eight
and octal is mainly used to count binary
in groups of three so this is an example
which we could use to convert to octal
so octal and hexadecimal
it's basically a friendly version of
binary that humans can understand easier
because if you have a long chain of
binary it gets pretty confusing so let
me just illustrate something so here's
some binary and it's not that long but
if you went on forever and get really
confusing but if we're using the octal
system we could break this up into
groups of three and we could say this is
a number and this is a number and what
I'm going to do next is show you how to
know what number this would be and then
we can easily convert to binary from
octal all right to do this basically we
just convert binary into decimal or
octal we stop at seven so basically we
make groups of three and binary and then
we just count in binary if you don't
understand how to do this
check out my introduction to binary
video
so here are all the possibilities that
we can cover using an octal system and
we can easily convert these into octal
so the middle is going to be our octal
so this will be 0 this will be 1 this
will be 2 this will be 3 so before this
would be 5 this will be 6 and this would
be 7 so if we have a binary string like
let's say it's this well we could break
this up into groups of 3 and now we have
this number and we have this number well
use 0 1 1 0 1 1 this will be 3 1 1 1
that would be 7 so we can represent this
using 37 and often since you don't know
if this is octal or decimal you will
have something to illustrate that it is
octal such as Oh at the beginning or a
cue or something like that so that just
kind of depends on the program or what
situation you're using it in but if you
used 37 people would think oh that's
decimal what it's actually not it's
audible so now we can practice this with
a longer string of binary so let's make
it pretty long so we have this huge
strand of binary and what we can do is
first break this up into groups of 3
so now we have these nice easy to easy
read groups of 3 101 5 101 501 Oh which
is 2 1 1 1 7 o 1 o 2 1 1 o is 600 1 is 1
so now we can illustrate this with this
with the octal 5 5 2 7 2 6 1 it's a
little longer than hexadecimal but it's
still more convenient than looking at
this huge strand of binary so if we are
not looking at binary and just looking
at the normal numbering system here is
how binary works you would start out
with zero and one flips up here and then
you go to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then you're
going to go to that so basically it
jumps from 7 to 8 I know it's a little
confusing because you're missing 8 9 8
and 9 but because it's a base a system
we can't use those extra symbols so this
is actually 8 this is 9 and so forth
so each column or as three four five six
seven eight total possibilities and then
we add another digit and we keep going
so when you have a long strand of octal
it's not the same as decimal so for
example if we have 107 this we can
figure out what it is in decimal by
using a conversion so basically we take
seven times eight to the zeroth power
and basically this is saying we're in
base eight and we're not two tens place
so it's at zero so 7 times zero 8 to the
zero is going to be said pretty simple
0 times 8 to the first power is going to
be zero because any time anything times
zero is zero next we have 1 times 8 to
the second power equals question mark
well 1 times anything is itself so 8
times 8 to the second power is 8 times 8
or 64 we add these together and we get
71 so in decimal this is what we have in
decimal these represent the same number
so this is decimal this is optical so
you can see it's kind of confusing at
first if you're not used to different
numbering systems but if you illustrate
that this is octal by putting some kind
of sign before it to say okay guys this
is an octal number people are going to
know that oh it's a little bigger than
what the actual number is so if you
watched my hexadecimal video you would
know that hexadecimal has a range from 0
to F with a total of 16 different
possibilities without going to the next
placeholder that means we can actually
cover more using the hexadecimal system
rather than the octal system when it
comes to binary with
so if we have a octal over here and
hexadecimal over here octal can go in
groups of three but hexadecimal can go
in groups of four now there's a lot of
good reasons to use hexadecimal and
there's not so many for octal so this is
because bytes the default size is eight
so you have eight bits in a byte what
that means is if you have a strand of
binary like this this is considered one
fight a byte contains eight bits each
one of these is a bit you can represent
four bits using a hexadecimal number so
you can break this up into groups of
four and say oh this is a number and
this is a number and I still have a
chart here using hexadecimal oh 1 100 1
100 is 6 1 1 1 0 is e so you can
represent this strand of binary 0 1 101
1 1 0 just using 6 E and you can
illustrate that if hexadecimal using an
O and an X or something like that well
as for octal if we have the same thing
in binary we would have to break this up
into groups of 3 which causes a slight
problem
so a break the first thing off into 3
the next thing off into 3 and then we
can just group them like this but you
see this one is 3 this one is 3 but this
one only has 2 so what we'd have we will
whoa sorry I stuttered there what we
would have to do is take the next bit of
the next byte or something like that
which gets confusing so if we're working
with a byte size of 8 you almost always
use
hexadecimal to represent binary because
this is not practical because you eight
is not divisible by three in there for
you get three six with a left remainder
of two so if the byte size is nine or
six or something besides eight then
octal is the way to go
another use is if you're using a byte
size that is divisible by three such as
a 12 bit machine or a 24 bit or a 36 fit
machine that that way it's divisible by
three even if the byte size is still
eight so yeah those that's a couple of
problems with the octal system but it is
still used that's why I'm teaching it
for an example it is often used for the
UNIX file permissions so if you want to
learn about that just look up UNIX file
permissions using octal and it's very
simple to understand um and you also
have some unique uses within some
programming languages and so forth like
that so it is important to know just
know that representing binary it's
usually hexadecimal because it's in
groups of four and computers are often
multiples of two so you get like a
16-bit for example well that's four
eight twelve sixteen easy to use for
hexadecimal whereas a just octal you
can't really do a three six nine twelve
fifteen if you're counting in threes so
that's a problem so yeah that is the
basics of octal hopefully it was helpful
if you didn't really get anything from
this just know that it is a base of
eight it's often used for the UNIX file
permissions and yeah that's about it
basically just try to compare the the
octal to the hexadecimal to binary and
the decimal number
systems and you'll get a general idea of
how they all work hopefully that was
helpful if you have any questions please
