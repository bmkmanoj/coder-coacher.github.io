microphone so be sure to tell me what
you think it's too loud or too quiet or
anything like that because I can always
try and get a different one I'm just
borrowing this if for a couple months
and I'll be showing you how to install
xampp to use my PHP myadmin so this is a
good time to advertise my youtube
channel that's a good Channel
look at that picture awkward so just
search xampp and it's Apache friends org
/e n /x a.m. PP HTML here is the URL now
from here you want to pick your
operating system I'm running Windows if
you have like an Apple computer you'll
use this Linux and ya hit point so I'll
click Windows then what I want to do is
under download click xampp
and then I'll install I'll click the
Installer not the zip or the 7-zip but
the Installer you should bring this page
up and wait a couple seconds right here
and now it should start downloading it
may pop up and ask you if you want to
download it or open it or save it or
anything like that I just save it right
now you just wait for this and I'll be
back in a second once that is done
downloading it'll appear in your
downloads folder so to get to that you
can just click your computer name right
here Caleb and then downloads it should
be right there double click that and a
pop-up may ask you if you're sure just
click yes and then you want to select
your language I'm English so yes I'll
click that and just ignore that click OK
next this is pretty simple now here's
where you want to choose where do you
want to install it and I'm actually not
going to install it in the default but
if you don't really know what you're
doing or anything just install it there
here's my active partition of my hard
drive so that's where I will install it
so yours may be C : xampp
what everyone to call it doesn't really
matter and I'll select install these and
I'll install it you just wait for this
alright it's done installing and at some
point in the installation a black box
may come up saying some stuff and just
just let it do its thing you want to
click finish
yeah like this and just wait for it wait
for it there we go
great now click ok and yes this will
open the control panel excite of all
this crab alright now here you want to
have these three running well you don't
need this one running but you want to
have this running and then from a web
browser let me bring this over here you
will want to travel to at the top type
in localhost that's just LOC al H OS T
it'll bring you up to this page now this
is where you want to be and you'll
select your language I speak English and
you'll come to this page this is
basically the home page where everything
is located and on the side you'll want
to click or is it at PHP myadmin
under tools I'll bring it to this page
and holy crap it's in German what are we
going to do well under this I don't know
how to pronounce that you want to select
the language and click English if you
speak English I'm guessing you do
because you're listening to me and I
speak English but right so then from
here you have installed everything you
need to do and then what you'll do from
here is you can use SQL commands from
this box right here you can view your
databases these are the ones default
databases and bunch of other cool stuff
may want to look down and here at this
information here is your PHP myadmin
version and a bunch of other cool
information you can export your
databases from this page and you can
import databases from this page here's
some character sets if you need to look
at those which we haven't really talked
about those yet but we will and here the
available engines which we're going to
talk about those either here's are just
a bunch of stuff you don't really need
to worry about all this here's how to
get to the home page
let you bring you back to the main page
we started from and under settings you
can change a lot of the extra
information that's all I'm going to be
talking about in this series and next
not series sorry in this video and the
next one is going to be sweet so catch
you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
