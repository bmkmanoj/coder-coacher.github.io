basics of a concept and then we're going
to get into it farther down into the
series so I'm going to go over the
concept of time time you've probably
like well that has nothing to do with
music
hopefully not like that because it's
actually very important everything has
to be consistent and sound rhythmic to a
specific time so time is just a word to
describe the feel the beat of the music
we can't just play anything okay let me
let me teach let me show you what I mean
I'm gonna play a song here I'm gonna
play in time and then I'm gonna play out
of time
whoops
kind of messed it up but that's okay now
that is all in time there's consistent
rhythm if I get rid of the whole concept
of time it's
pretty sweet I know so time is very
important and it gives us the beat of
the music we can hear a lot of different
terms to describe the concept of time we
will get the term beat tempo
sometimes even though tempo is the speed
of the time if that makes any sense we
can have we're gonna have the second one
is a faster tempo we can have rhythm
which I don't know how to spell that I
don't know what time is just a concept
you need to be familiar with because it
keeps everything in time you know I
don't know nobody has time for that when
we are counting time we have to keep it
consistent or we can change it but
everybody has to know what's going on
because if we have a band we have a
guitarist I can't draw a guitar
that's my guitar we have a drum set or
keys or whatever give the keys bass drum
Tom's snare drum a hi-hat and then we
have keyboard then we might have a
singer which will have a microphone now
if this one's the drum set which usually
keeps time as tempos and this one's
tempo is what's going to sound
absolutely horrible so we have to keep
this one in time with this one in time
with this one in time with this one in
time with this one this one this one
this one this one this one this one this
one this one this one this one this one
this one this one they all have to be on
a consistent time scale in order to
sound together because if this one
finished the song in a minute and this
one finished the song in two minutes
it's going to sound not so good so
that's the basics of time and the next
video we're going to be talking about
something even awesomer
so yeah subscribe whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
