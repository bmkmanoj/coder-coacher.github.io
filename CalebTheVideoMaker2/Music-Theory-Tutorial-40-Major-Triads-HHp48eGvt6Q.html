going over now now if you remember we
had a root the third and the fifth
I can't stand squeaky markers oh my gosh
let's go calm down this will consist of
the unison note a major third and a
perfect fifth but anyways I personally
like what's called relative measurement
we can have the root with a major third
on top of it and then from that major
third we can have a minor third on top
of that because a major third has four
half steps minor third has three four
plus three equals seven which is the
same thing as a perfect fifth so
basically what I'm trying to say is we
can go from C up to E which is a major
third plus a minor third which is G
that's a minor third from E
one two three go what I'm saying that's
relative measurement rather than
absolute which I personally per for that
prefer that so that's what I'll be
explaining but I'll try to explain the
other stuff too so this is the formation
of a major triad we get root plus major
third plus minor third no matter where
you start we start on D major third oh
that's supposed to be minor third
Clevedon minor third we start on D major
third up from that is F sharp minor
third would be a DFA
D F sharp Bosch say sorry because a
major third from D is f sharp not that
if we put F and B a minor third and be
something different which will get in
that soon
so this is the basic formation from of a
major triad so let's plop out my piano
and I'll show you some cool stuff real
quick before I go into my next video if
we start on C now if perf a major third
has four half steps one two three four
sounds nuts now we add a minor third one
two three we get a major triad so
beautiful this is try it on beat one two
three four one two three
sweet let's try out e one two three four
one two three let's try on F one two
three four one two three FAC let's try
on G already know it 100 all but one two
three four one two three G major scam
hope you know choose your skip G major
triad now from a 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 AC sharp
e now for B this one's weird 1 2 3 4 1 2
3 it's the only major triad starting on
the white keys that uses to Bucky so
let's try it on the Black Keys no C
sharp 1 2 3 4
one two three sooo upset oh that one's
different the means of doing some wrong
one two three four there we go this one
that one sounds right one two three four
one two three hopefully you can see all
this I'm gonna feel really stupid
uploading it but I'm pretty sure you get
the point
so if we were to start on this one this
would be addy sharps major chord proper
way to play I think would be like this
so yeah that's all and gap headphones on
I just move to your other side of your
head but now I'm back on the other side
Oh what does this mean whoa this is so
cool alright well I'll see you guys
later thank you for watching and be sure

this is my piano bye
