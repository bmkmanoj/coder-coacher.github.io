the video maker - and in this video
we're going to do some awesome stuff but
first I wanted to tell you a cool way to
clear this screen alright so as you can
see we have all this junk and the best
way to do this let me shrink this down
some oh there's a spider hanging from
the wall okay I think we're good where
was I
okay so anyways if you ever get
frustrated just because the screens a
mess and you have all these errors and
it just frustrates you well I'm gonna
show you how to quickly clear that this
is just kind of a little fix just to
kind of make things more clear so what
we can do is we can use the print
function so I know I don't really
explain much about functions but the
print function is just going to display
data right below once we press ENTER and
one things we can display is called the
new line and it looks like that and when
we press ENTER it literally just creates
a new line so it echoed one I mean sorry
it printed one line on the screen well
we can take that same concept and we can
multiply it by let's say we can multiply
by 40 and then when we press Enter boom
we still have our old data it just
dragged us down to where we don't have
to see all this garbage
another solution of course is to just X
out of it and then reopen it although
that may cause you to lose a lot of your
work so that might not be the best
solution another solution that you can
do is you can create your own function
which I know this is like way more
advanced than we should be going but
this is just an example of what you can
do so we can call the print function and
then we can go back and type in we want
to print a new line and we'll just print
that 60 times and then we can press
ENTER twice
so we go back to typing and then we can
call that function
this and boom it brings us down sixty
lines so that's just an example of ways
you can clear the screen so now whenever
I'm I'm frustrated because I got all
these errors I can just be like CLS for
a clear screen oops I mean to put that
plus there CLS boom clean as clean all
right now on to the actual topic of this
video and that would be variables so
what is a variable it's something that
temporarily host stores or holds a value
I'm sure you've worked with variables in
math maybe such as algebra like X - well
what is X equal that's what you have to
figure out well in Python it's pretty
simple we just give a variable a name
that's how we create one and then we
assign it a value so such as we can make
a variable subscribe back and that's
literally now our variable name and then
we use what's known as the assignment
operator so just like the mathematical
operators did something with numbers the
assignment operator does something with
variables and values it assigns a value
to a variable so the the whatever we put
after this assignment operator is what
the value of the variable subscribe'
will be so we can make it a number and
then we can see that value by using the
print function we can print the variable
subscribe we don't need to use quotes or
anything because it's just it's now
pretty much an item in our program so we
can just use it like that print
subscribe if we did something like this
well now it literally prints the text
subscribe and that's not what we want to
do we want to print the value of the
variable subscribe so that's why we do
not use quotes now we can also assign a
string value so we could do this
subscribe is now has the value right now
please and then we can we can go
oops no don't don't fret I'm sorry that
was my bad
we can go print subscribe and I'm sorry
I meant to change the quotes there so we
can take out these quotes because we
don't want to print a string and it
literally prints right now please the
text right now please another thing we
can do is we can have a different
variable so we could have the variable
just might as well advertise this whole
time you know click like has the value
if you like the video now we can print
that by the way I'm scrolling back or my
commands by pressing Alt P and then we
can just put print click like and you
can see it gives us the value if you
like this video or if you like the video
now what happens if we assign the value
of a variable another variable like this
what if we do subscribe has the value
click like
then we print
subscribe yeah they don't post they say
print subscribe you can see that the old
value of subscribe was right now please
once we assigned it to click like it
took the value of click like which was
if you liked the video so now subscribe
and click like both have the same values
makes sense
oops so let's let's try something new
let's let's change the value of click
like and we're just going to make it
equal to 5 and then we print subscribe
and you can see that the value of
subscribe did not change so that means
they are two separate things here let me
let me illustrate this in paint now you
can see we basically made a copy of the
variable but they're still two separate
they're not both pointing to the same
value we have subscribe here and then we
have click like here so that means when
we change click like to something else
such as a 5 just the value 5 well now
subscribe stay the same because it's
it's a one-time kind of thing so
hopefully that wasn't too confusing
probably but anyways that's how you
create variables and then we can do
things with this variable such as do
mess so let's say we have a job and we
get paid ten dollars every hour ok so we
can make variable our pay equal 10 I'm
sorry not equal we can assign the value
10 probably shouldn't say equal because
it's technically not an equal sign it's
an assignment operator so then we can
say a bonus
of 100 then we can say hoursworked equal
as assign the value 20 so it's basically
saying we've worked 20 hours we get paid
ten dollars an hour and we have a bonus
of 100 hundred dollars so to do math
this we could say hours worked
multiplied by our pay plus the bonus and
we get the final value 300 so yeah
that's all I really have to say so thank
you for watching and I will see you guys
