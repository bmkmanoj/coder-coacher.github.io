killed video maker - and I hope you guys
are enjoying the series so far if you've
made it this far you're probably either
a really enjoying it and learning a ton
or B you're a total geek and if that's
the case right on okay I'll stop wasting
your time let's get started we are going
to be discussing the modulus operator
okay so I told you that the result of
this expression is going to be 1 but did
you figure out why
well the modulus operator actually gives
you the remainder and this is for
integers so the best way to see this is
to use a really good illustration one of
my faves imagine you have a pizza with
five slices and you want to share the
pizza with your pet rat pepperjack well
you give a piece to pepper jack a piece
to you a piece to pepper jack and then
another piece to you now you have one
left over so let's change this code to
illustrate our illustration a little bit
clear we're gonna say we have int
pieces of pizza and that's going to be
five and then we'll have number of
eaters that's going to be two you know
you and your pet pepper jack now we are
going to have int leftover and this also
assumes you can't split a piece of pizza
in half that would just you know mess up
all the dimensions and who knows what
would happen so what we need to do is
take pizzas of pizza take the modulus of
that and we'll put numbers of eaters
oops it should be a number of eaters and
the real reason you can't split the
piece of pizza in half is not because of
some weird dimension John gauze is
kidding the real reason is because it's
an integer and integers cannot be split
in half or they are no longer integers
so imagine if you take the piece of
pizza and you rip it in half it just
melts into this goop and it's no longer
pizza anymore oh man my illustrations
are always really really weird and awful
sometimes but that's okay I like them
whenever we are using the modulus
operator we have to be working with
integers if we are working with doubles
for
example well there would never be a
remainder that's because if you took 5.0
and divided by 2.0 the result was going
to be 2.5 and the remainder is going to
be 0 the modulus operator literally is
useless when it comes to floating point
numbers so you can only use it with
integers let's print out the leftovers
and see just to make sure I'm not lying
to you guys we'll save this compile and
run and the output is 1 what are some
other cool things we can use this
modulus operator for at first glance it
seems kind of weird and say when would
we ever use this stupid thing well
there's actually one really good example
which whether this is a good example or
not is ultimately up to you but you can
use the modulus operator to figure out
whether something is even or odd for
example if you have a number such as 17
and you take the modulus of it with 2
the output will be 1 and this has to do
with the definition of an odd number an
odd number is 2 times any number plus 1
let me make these comments so they're
not all colorful now you don't have to
memorize the definition of an odd number
but you can think about it the reason we
have one left over is because we're
dividing by 2 the opposite of
multiplying is division so if we take
the modulus and there's a leftover of 1
we have this plus 1 this is in contrast
to an even number which is something
like 2 times any number by itself just
like that so if you take an even number
such as 18 use the modulus with 2 the
result is going to be 0 so later when we
talk about conditionals you can check to
see whether a number is odd or even
using the modulus operator and if I
totally lost you with these comments
that's okay just ignore me so yeah guys
those are the arithmetic operators these
are all binary operators meaning they
work with two operands see up here we
have the operator and the operands are
pieces of pizza and number of eaters in
the next video we are going to learn a
unary operator so
I'm really looking forward to that be
sure to check it out and be sure to
subscribe thank you
you know time is so much more valuable
than stuff like think about it if this
laptop got stolen after I recorded all
100 of these I think I'd rather pay for
a new laptop and get my videos back then
get a free laptop and remake the videos
you know what I mean oh it's still
recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
