python tutorial series and in this video
I'm going to be talking a little bit
more about string slicing and indexing
so how can we begin well the very first
thing I want to do in this video is
explain a little bit of what we talked
about in the last video well first
things first we had a variable yo we
assigned it the value lemonade so now I
have that variable and we printed that
variable by putting it within print now
when it comes to indexing we can print
individual indexes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
well when we're talking about ranges we
use colons
so what we do is we use brackets we
learned about this in the previous
videos if you have no idea what I'm
talking about so 1 3 like this so what
it's going to do is print from index 1
to index 3 0 1 2 3 so it prints EEM you
can see the character at index 3 which
would be 0 because go 0 1 2 3 the
character at index 3 is not included it
stops at the line before the actual
character at index 3 that's something
important to consider so if you want to
print the character at index 3 you would
have to put a 4 there so if you're
counting 0 1 2 3 just think that it
stops at the login you see well what we
can also do is we can print in opposite
order so what we can do is we can print
entire strings in reverse order and the
way to do that is we just use print and
then we put the variable just like that
and then we go
we put colon colon negative 1 now let me
explain this when we don't put anything
between here these colons just like we
did up here Python just assumes that we
want the entire string so what this is
basically saying is saying I don't
really want to start it anywhere
specific let's just start at
beginning oh I don't want to end
anywhere specific let's just end at the
ending so when we leave these two colons
here and we don't put any values here
it's basically just saying return or
print the entire string this negative
one tells us to print it in the reverse
order so we get EDA no Mel instead of
lemonade now what if we wanted to print
just a range we're not gonna put it in
reverse order let's print let's let's do
this we're going to print yo and the
range I want to print is from index 2 to
6 now before I print this I want you to
predict pause it and predict which
characters it's going to return and if
you need a hint just remember it starts
at index 2 and ends before the character
at index 6 so it ends on the line you
figure it out well let's figure it out 0
1 2 so it's going to start right right
here 3 4 5 6 it's going to stop right
here so when you look at this we're
talking index numbers we have 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5
if we go one more we have 6 but we're
not including 6 because we stopped at 6
on the line that's the second number is
telling us to print everything up to the
character at index 6 but not including
index 6 D is the index 6 because it goes
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 if we had the character
included it would include D but we're
stopping before the character which is
why we get Mona now let's press ENTER
and see how this works you can see it
returned Mona now what if we wanted to
take this string and print it in the
reverse order well now we have to say we
want to start here and go all the way up
to here
well that means our index is the order
of these are going to be reversed as
well because we're starting on the
opposite side so this the number we're
starting on is higher than the index of
the number we're stopping on now what we
don't want to do is we don't want to
include right I'm gonna put it in
different color to know that we don't
want to include it we have the index is
zero and then one that's a little
crowded here and then up here we have
six and then seven so just so you can
visualize it we want to get this range
if we were to flip it so we want it to
go this way we're basically going to say
we want to start at index five because
we don't want to include the character
at index six so we need to do is we need
to start at character five give this
good straight draw oops I'm gonna get a
straight line tool actually Carolina
work fine so we want to start at
character five and we want to go and we
want to stop before character at index
one you see so in order to do that we
would need to use whoops where's my line
you look back alright we need to go all
we need to go this range and we don't
want to include character one and we
don't want to include character six well
in order to do that we would need to we
would need the colons to be like this
five one so let's explain why we are
starting at the character of five and
we're stopping before the character that
has the index of one so it's a little
confusing this direction because if we
say okay start at five you would think
okay we're going to start at character
five zero one two three four five
Hey okay that works and then we're going
to go to character one okay here's one
and we get e but we actually don't want
e it's a little little confusing because
we have to think of the characters five
four three two and then stop before
character one may erase these little
green dots here kind of bugging me all
right so let's try this out we're going
to have five one and then we're going to
print that in reverse order and we get a
No
so the easiest way to think of this is
that we take the normal string indexes
so two two six and we just subtract one
and then flip them so if we wanted to
print from from 2 up to character to
number six we would stop right here zero
one two three four five six now we just
take those we take index 2 and 6 we
subtract one from each of them so we get
one and five and then we flip them to
get 5 : one that's the easiest way to
think about this so I know this video is
like super long and it probably made
like absolutely no sense but let's try
it let's try another example because I
just I think I just confused you guys
even more so let's try it again let's
say we want to print Iman add in reverse
order
well we can think of it first in normal
order so what range do we need we need
to start right here and we need to stop
before E so we get zero one two three
four five six seven so we get one two
seven
so we get Iman that now if we want to
reverse this what we do is the first
thing we do is we we can subtract one so
we have zero and then six and then you
just flip them so we get six to zero and
we we show that in reverse order
oops my bad I forgot a yeah bracket here
and we get dananddana de Nome that's how
I guess that would be pronounced so hey
guys try not to think too much on the
whole confusing index garbage the
easiest way to do this is just to follow
this little pattern six zero is
basically this flipped around and
subtracted one from each number really
simple and all the index stuff that I
was explaining in the beginning of this
video I think I was just a little bit
too confusing so yeah guys thank you for
watching and hopefully I can explain
things just a tad bit more clear in the
next video so thank you for watching
I'll see you guys in the next video be
