python tutorial series this video I
wanted to talk about comparison
operators so we learned a little bit
about operators in previous videos such
as five plus five well this little plus
sign that is an operator it does
operations on data it's sort of like a
doctor it does operations well it's okay
it's not really like a doctor but you
know what I mean so basically plus sign
is not the only operator that we have we
also have the assignment operator such
as when we make variables this right
here is the assignment operator well we
have what are known as comparison
operators such as 5 is less than let's
go 6 this this is a comparison operator
specifically the les van comparison
operator now the values that these
return our only true or false these are
the only two possibilities now we have
other comparison operators not just
greater than or equal or greater than or
less than so this is this is less than
which we just did we also have the
greater than sign now I want to teach
you some more comparison operators now
this can get a little confusing if
you're new to this but just stick with
it and it will make sense as you go on
in time so the first one that I want to
talk about is the equal to operator now
this one is probably the most confusing
basically we have the assignment
operators such as assigning a variable
this right here is known as the
assignment operator and since that is
used as the assignment operator we have
to use five equal equal which is the
equals to comparison operator so 5 is
equal to 5 true we can't just go like
this that's because that's like trying
to say five is a variable and we're
assigning the value 5 to the variable 5
which makes absolutely no sense so in
order for this to work you see if we do
this it gives an error in order for this
to work we have to use the assignment
operator now the other one is basically
just the opposite and if we had like an
if statement and we had if 5 is equal to
50 5 is equal to 5 we want it to say
true let's see what happens true well we
can do the same exact opposite by
putting an exclamation mark instead of
the first equal sign so now it's saying
if 5 is not equal to 5 print true and
that's false so it won't do anything but
if we wanted to let's say if 5 is not
equal to 6 which it's not this will
return true I know it's kind of like
backwards yet to flip-flop things but
basically we ask the question is this
true five is not equal 6 that is true
therefore it prints true so that is
another operator the other two main ones
that I want to explain are the less than
or equal to and the greater than or
equal to so we have 5 is less than five
or six for example but weak what if we
put 5 is less than five will get false
but if we use this
now we have five is less than or equal
to well I don't want to I don't want you
to think of these as two separate
operators don't think less than and then
equal to that's because this is the
assignment operator as we learned before
so you need to think of this as an
entire whole less than or equal to less
than or equal to 5 is less than or equal
to 5 true 5 is less than or equal to 3
false because that doesn't make sense
you can also do it the other way around
5 is greater than or equal to 3 that
returns true so in conclusion here are
all of your operators we have the the
key equals 2 or is equals to operator we
have the not equal to operator we have
the less than we have the greater than
we have the less than or equal to and
then we have the greater than or equal
to you can use these within your if
statements now let's just think of a
little example to see the results for
all of these let's say we have two
variables one or two numbers one is a
five and the other is ten when we run it
with this 5 is equal to 10 we get false
5 is not equal to 10 we get true this
will always be the opposite to this
pretty much 5 is less than 10 true 5 is
greater than 10 true 5 is less than or
equal to 10 true 5 is greater than or
equal to 10 false so that is the results
of all those now if we had another
example let's say one let's go five and
five
five and five are our equals so this
would return true this would return
false this is return false this would
return false this would return true and
this would return true so that's just
some examples of using these operators
and you can use all of these within your
if statement to get whatever kind of
results that you desire so thank you for
watching and in the next video we will
be talking about some more awesome stuff
