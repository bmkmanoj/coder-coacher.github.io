this videos gonna be talking about inner
joins
so I'm alright down on the board to see
people can see it yeah that's an inner
join
ok so way and energy the way an inner
join works is it's going to take one
table and another table and then
wherever there is rows from this table
in this table that are connected it's
going to present them in a new
generating table so let's just break
this down and see how it works let's go
with an example right cuz you gotta use
examples we're gonna have a customer
table we're also going to have a card
table so think of like a bank for
example you're going to have customer
table where you're going to put all your
customers in there and then you have a
card table where you're going to put
every single card that's been given out
or will be given out to people who have
credit cards or you could make to where
you came to include debit cards in there
but we'll just worry about credit cards
for now
so basically we're going to draw this
out and we're not going to have it
required that a card has a customer or
customer as a card so neither of these
columns are going to be labeled as not
null so basically the card does not need
to have a customer and a customer does
not need to have a card so we have one
table over here and another table over
here and generally this would be
designed as a one-to-many relationship
because one person can have many cards
and usually one card is owned by one
person you could design it as a
many-to-many relationship where you can
join on a card or multiple people can
own a card but yeah you can modify the
examples as needed so let's say this is
the customer
estimation and this is the card table
now we want to have something like of
course we have an ID for the customers
we're going to the customer ID you know
their first name last name their address
their date of birth all their personal
information that we need further data
for the bank that's where that's going
to go over here we're going down the
card ID and then we're also going to
have a customer ID because this is a
one-to-many relationship we have the
child and the parent if this is a
one-to-one relationship we could have it
to where there is also a card ID in the
customer table if we wanted but I'm not
going to do that and we can get into one
to one relationship design best
practices in another video but for now
the custom ID is going to reference this
customer ID and here we can also have
more information about the car we could
have the the total amount or the limit
max amount I guess I can say max amount
all you can have monthly bill and
because this is a really simplified
example we don't really have to worry
about other tables such as you know
bills and invoices I mean and all that
other junk we're just keeping it simpler
and let's say this is how we structured
our database and we want to make it more
user friendly with a join to where we
join information across the table
because we don't want to have to have
the customer ID for the car so we create
a joint and we make this new generate a
table I don't know why I made this like
circle but
and within here we could say we could
say it's the car customer for example it
doesn't really matter what we give the
title of the actual table what we're
going to do in here is look we decide
which columns we want to take well first
thing we always start with the ID
because that's how things are going to
be joined and we don't necessarily have
to return that ID within our table but
we need to think about it because that's
how we connect the tables so generally
the ID is just for the databases sake
it's usually not something you use
outside of the database it doesn't have
any real-world value so we usually don't
need to record it in the join for a view
to application or whatever we're using
this for now for the database
administrator and you want some more
presentable tables like this but you
want to keep the IDS in there that's
fine too
but we're not going to we're not going
to return the customer ID there's no
need to it's just a number but since
it's in both tables if we did join it
down here it would only be in one column
so we would have you know cups diet
customer ID and that's going to take the
combination of these we're going to
customer ID like let's say 62 and then
card ID be like seven and then customer
ID 62 and Carter D 8 so that's kind of
how that would work but we're not going
to return those so what we're going to
do is we're going to return just the
first name last name and we're also
going to return do let's add another
column amount paid so basically that's
saying like how far they paid off their
credit card bill let's say you borrowed
ten thousand and you
Oh 6000 you've paid back 4000 so far
just to see how far people are getting
to paying off their bills and like I
said this is very simplified example you
could make it to where it gets a
percentage and you could have more
tables for bills and invoices and all
that junk but just so you guys
understand the join concept it works the
same for basically any columns you use
so within here we could have a first
name last name and the amount paid these
are our columns within our table I'm
just going to open this up so we can
write some and we could say that we have
individual people we could say Caleb and
then his amount paid on one of his cards
is 2,200 and we also have Caleb curry
and the amount paid is 720 and if you
wanted you could go in and edit to join
added max amount so that's basically
Earlham we could have a column on here
such as amount owed and we could have
that in here too and that would
basically say how much they paid out of
how much so look like then here we got
amount owed like 3000 which is basically
saying 2200 out of 3,000 if you wanted
to do that you could do that but for
simplicity sake let's keep it like this
and then we could have Jimmy John and
the amount paid could be 2800 and so
forth you can make more rows if you
wanted now you're wondering okay what's
an inner join we talked about that
earlier
well basically an inner join is going to
take only the rows that either a card
has a customer and a customer has a car
where they intersect so this new table
is joined table
is going to eliminate any customers that
do not have a card and it's also going
to eliminate any cards that do not have
a customer so I'm going to graces I'm
just going to draw a little illustration
to show you how this works now you can
find more pictures like this online
which I'll link to in the description if
I can remember think of it like this
here is the left table which was the
customer and here is the card table and
this part in the middle this is kind of
like the join table or where they
intersect so here are the customers that
have a card and here are the cards that
have a customer so within here this is
going to contain all of the rows that
have a customer that also owns a card or
a card and is owned by a customer so if
you have a card with no customer it'll
stay out of the end result and if you
have a customer with no card it'll stay
out of the end result so this is what
you can think of it as all of these
things within this part of the Venn
diagram or whatever that's going to be
returned now there's different kinds of
joints where it'll only wear it will
only return for example this side or
this side but that's where we're going
to be getting in in future videos so if
you want to do a left join or if you
want to love joining going here or right
join and go over here but an inner join
is just the intersection of both of the
tables I just have it I just like wiping
it off with my hands and then my hands
are like dark green so I'm trying to be
a little more civilized you know so how
do you do this well it's done within a
select statement because remember we are
in we're using
data manipulation language which is done
through selects so it would be something
like this now to warn you um the syntax
is going to vary a lot from relational
database management system from
relational database management system
but the concept stays the same so you
just gotta replace a couple things
insert a couple things boom bada bang
you got a new joint so we're going to
say select and then whatever comes after
the select I'm going to sweep this over
some everything that comes after the
select is going to be the columns that
we want in the joined generated table so
in the last example we had first name
and then we also had the last name and
we also had what was it amount paid
shadow number but something like that so
that's going to be the columns we want
returned then we are going to say what
table are we getting these columns from
so we do from and then we say okay well
you may be wondering well there's
multiple tables so how do we know which
one we're going to use where we're going
to put the left one first which and our
drawing we had the user or the customer
and then we had the card so we're going
to put from customer and then you're
going to do a join and join the other
table to the customer so we're going to
say enter join and then you're going to
say the other table which was card now
what you're going to do is say how are
these tables connected so the way we
have them connected or the way we want
to join these tables is by the foreign
key connecting to the primary key and
the way you signify that and syntax
would be but this little statement here
on which is basically saying what are we
joining it by and you're going to say
customer dot customer ID and what's that
what that dot is is basically saying the
first part of this is the table the
second part is the column the reason we
have to do that is because both tables
have a customer ID and then you're just
going to connect that to the other table
by saying equals car dot customer ID now
that's basically all you have to do for
this it's going to connect if you look
at the syntax it's going to connect and
get a different marker here colors makes
things so useful right I use black okay
we got the customer joined with the card
those are the tables and then we're
going to say what columns want to return
in the new join and that's first name
last name and amount paid and then we
have said how they're related that's the
customer ID of the customer table is
equal to the customer ID of the card
table and that's how you get your joined
results at the end result would of
course look like this and you're going
to have first name last name and then a
mount okay there you go so that is how
an inner join works the next thing we're
going to be Tom God has left joins and
right joins and all the other cool kinds
of joins main thing though don't worry
too much about the syntax if it's
overwhelming just worry about the
concept understand that if you do an
inner join it's going to exclude all of
the rows from either the left or the
right table that are in both tables it
has to be in both tables in order for it
to work that's the most important thing
to understand
it comes to these joints because if you
understand that all you got to do
literally it's lookup let's say you're
using MySQL just look up my skew L
syntax inner join and then you're going
to get a little syntax code replace the
columns they gave you with the columns
e1 and the tables with the tables that
you want it's really simple so you don't
really need to like yeah obviously you
should learn this in the long run but if
you're new to this don't worry about
diving in studying that for 20 years
worry about the concepts because once
you get the concepts it's easier to pick
up on this junk so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
