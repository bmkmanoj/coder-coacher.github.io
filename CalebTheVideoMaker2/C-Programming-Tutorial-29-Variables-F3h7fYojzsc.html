this is Caleb from Caleb the video maker
do this video we're going to be
discussing now I know we've discussed it
already but variables and the reason I
wanted to make a video dedicated to
variables is because there's some more
information I needed to give you that
being said I'll try not to be redundant
so this video might be a little bit
short variables variables are used to
temporarily store some value so think of
them as a box so you can put stuff in
like a number for example one thing I
wanted to make sure we have clear is the
difference between declaring a variable
and initializing variables declaring is
when you say hey this variable exists
such as this
initializing is when we assign a value
to that variable using x equals
something
this here is known as the assignment
operator so you can literally think of
it as assigning the value five to the
variable X that would be the equivalent
of putting a value into the box you can
declare and initialize a variable in one
step like this this is the Declaration
and this is the initialization with the
assignment operator now you always want
to make sure to initialize a variable
before you try outputting it or using
that variable in some kind of math
expression or something like that if you
don't believe that this is important try
outputting an uninitialized variable so
you can see here we are outputting X and
a newline but if we never initialize
this give this a try and see what
happens you'll quickly find out that
uninitialized variables basically just
output garbage and that is not the kind
of thing we want showing up in our
application so make sure you always
always always remember to initialize
your variable if possible initialize it
at the same time as declaring it like we
did up here that way you don't forget to
do it now the next thing I want to talk
to you about is naming variables as
programmers we are given the privilege
to name our own variables I know it's
crazy I don't know why anyone would
trust us to do something that requires
so much responsibility
thankfully they created certain rules so
we don't make some stupid dumb variable
names the first thing that you need to
know are what characters are allowed
Onix so yeah anyways you're allowed to
use all letters numbers and underscores
these are the allowed characters in our
variable names and these are considered
different that's because variable names
are case sensitive
that means tacos tacos and tacos are all
different but they all taste great even
though you're allowed to make all these
tacos I would highly not recommend it
because that's gonna be way too many
tacos we don't want to talk those going
to waste no but in reality if you have
two variables with the same name but
different capitalization you're probably
gonna get confused unless there is some
kind of known convention like oh if it
starts with a lowercase letter it means
something and it starts with an
uppercase letter it means something else
then you might be able to distinguish
but in general I would try to just stick
with one once you're starting out and
even if you're super advanced to
programming just because it can
introduce confusion if you do need to
use the name twice you might want to
consider adding an underscore before it
like this now there is kind of a more
clear distinction between these two
variables take note that the only symbol
we're allowed to use is the underscore
you might get by with using other
symbols such as the dollar sign or
something but the chances are it's not
Universal and you should just never use
any other symbols besides the underscore
you can start a variable with an
underscore or a letter but you can't
start a variable with a number it's just
not gonna work why I don't know now when
it comes to what you should name your
variables you want to keep a balance on
length and description so you want it to
be short in length but I guess you could
say long in description if that makes
any sense at all so I'm going to give
you some variable names and I want you
to decide are they good variable names
or are they bad variable names the first
one I'm out
yeah I would say bad it doesn't say what
the amount is of amount of cookies and
not of donuts amount of I don't know
amount sold that's a little better
I would say that's probably okay what
about this
AMT sold I personally avoid doing this
because I think over time the meaning of
shortened words is lost or diminished so
you'll go back and you'll have a bunch
of variables like LS w and j p.m. and
you don't remember what any of them mean
and it makes your code harder to read
all you have to do is put three extra
letters and you can put the whole word I
would say no but you'll get some
different opinions on that one what
about this one the number of cars sold
the underscores are perfectly acceptable
some people prefer that naming
convention over using capital letters or
camel casing but I generally would say
this is a bad variable name it's too
long it's too easy to misspell to
improve this you could just get rid of
useless words you're never going to meet
the and even this number of is kind of
redundant that's because you can figure
that out from the data type if we have
int cars sold that makes just as much
sense as the number of cars sold and
it's way easier to type too okay so this
video might have been a little bit
longer than I assumed but I think I gave
you guys a lot of useful information I
personally would try to make some
variable names and try to make some
incorrect variable names and see what
the compiler likes and dislikes all that
good stuff so thanks for watching if you
found this video useful please click
subscribe and as always I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
