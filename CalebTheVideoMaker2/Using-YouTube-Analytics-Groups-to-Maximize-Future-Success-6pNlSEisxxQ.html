and this video i want to talk about
analytic groups in YouTube analytics so
um for those of you who create YouTube
content the analytics are very important
they are the metrics or the graphs and
all the charts that tell you how your
videos are being viewed how how much
time is being spent on them how many
subscribers you gain from them how much
money you're making what countries view
your videos the most traffic sources and
there's a ton of other information that
is accessed that you can see through
analytics so the first thing when you go
to analytics it will tell you your
monthly on average your monthly views
minutes watched earnings likes dislikes
common shares favorites and subscribers
so this is basically in the last period
so from the day that the last analytic
update in this case december seven all
the way back to november eight so about
30 days it'll tell you how many views
and all that you've received well this
is important so you can tell if you're
growing or if you're not growing and
you'll see these green arrows or red
arrows which will tell you if you're
either growing or not growing so if you
can see my views twenty-three percent
increase compared to the previous period
and a period is just a period of 30 days
you're not supposed to define words with
the death of the word in death anyways a
period is the 30 days before the current
30 days you're looking at so from
october nine to november seventh i
received twenty three percent less views
than i have from november eighth to
December seventh so let me just write
some numbers down it's important to look
at these so yeah going to get my
whiteboard out there we have 19 668 so
just to make it easy we're going to use
20,000 so this this is the number of
views that I've received
this month all right now if you look at
my total views lifetime views that's
19,500 I'm sorry 190 5100 well just make
math easy we're going to use 200,000 so
this is sort of like saying in the last
period I've received ten percent of all
of my views and I know these aren't
completely accurate because I've changed
the numbers well when you're using
analytic groups you can tell what series
or what types of videos help contribute
to your total amount of views your
estimated earnings and estimated minutes
watching all of all of that stuff so to
look at your groups there's a group spot
up here where we can browse all groups
and I've already created groups i'm
going to show you how it works so one of
my rather successful series is my
database design series and it will tell
you the performance of the series in the
last 30 days so you can see most of my
stuff is going down i'm not receiving as
month as many views this period as i did
last period but that's okay that can
happen naturally so for this this video
series I've earned 3215 video views so
this is for this specific period out of
a total of two thousand so if we get a
calculator out
see if I can do this right 20,000 would
be a note via the other way around so 3
to 15 / 20 thousand you can say it's
sixteen percent of my monthly views and
you can also tell from how you can see
group size 25 that means there's 25
videos within this group and then you
can further multiply this person it
multiply this by 100 to make it a
percent and then you can divide that by
25 and you can say that each video is
point six four percent of my total
monthly views or an easier way to look
at this is you take your total views for
this series divide that by 25 and you'll
see that on average each video gets 128
views per month each video in that
series so 25 well that's pretty good now
I can look at my other groups and I'm
going to look at my PHP series give it
some time to load okay as you can see
the views are going up everything is
going up so this one is on the uprising
but overall it is not performing as well
as my database design series you can see
it has a thousand eight hundred and
ninety-three views and we can tell the
percentage of that if we want but i'm
just going to just figure out how many
views each video receives so to do that
1893 / group size 39 each video receives
approximately 48 views per month so
that's good and so you can tell on
average my database design is over tilt
over twice as successful as my PHP
series now you do have to keep in mind
that my PHP series is rather new I just
started uploading these videos last
month or so
so this one the top one that is may have
more recognition but over time you can
take these numbers too so let's say this
is a year from now this is the same
results we get well then I know oh ok
this series is in higher demand which
was the database design just put double
D anyways you can say that it's in
higher demand compared to my PHP series
so this can help guide the future of
your video series or what content you
produce I state my self in face so that
way you know ok I want to get more views
or I want to get more likes or whatever
you can figure out what type of video
series is going to be the best for you
so let me show you another one of my
most successful mysql so this series has
a total of i'm just going to write this
so here I'm scary sees 9000 camera a
little more 9000 um 128 and then to
figure out how much each video makes we
can take that number 9128 and divide
that by group size 67 and you can say
each video has a hundred and thirty-six
views per month so that is that's that's
my most successful series so that way I
know alright databasing in mysql are in
high demand compared to PHP or even
worse HTML and CSS so if i look at that
series which I did very quickly I mean
I'm sure I could make a better one if I
want to do this one is quite less
success
and I'm like dying of thirst right now
see the load here and apparently it does
not want to load but anyways I get on
average eight hundred views a month from
this series with a total of fifty five
videos so the average viewing is like
very low per video so i understand that
okay database programming is in more
demand than HTML and CSS and i'm
guessing that's because database design
is a more advanced topic a lot of people
can go on youtube and create HTML and
CSS tutorials but not nearly as many
people can go on there and create a
complete database design series because
it's more complicated less people know
how to do it and it takes more effort so
yes the HTML series was easier for
waiting for me to create i created in a
few days well the database design series
brought me more feedback likes views and
so forth now another thing you can do
with this is once you figure out your
series are separate I mean once you
separate out your series you can
calculate from your total views and how
much money you make on average how many
dollars or how much money each video can
bring you so you know what videos are
successful for bringing money so I know
just because you have a lot of views in
a series does not mean that it's going
to bring you a lot of money so let me
say a music theory for example it brings
me decent amount of views like almost
3,000 a month but the amount of money it
brings me per month is substantially
lower than my database design series
that's because the database design is a
higher more valuable marketing area for
advertisers people pay more to advertise
databasing content rather than what
people pay
to post music content some people pay
for advertising they're going to be
paying more for databases
computer-related server-side garbage
versus music theory that why that's what
that's how I know that if I want to make
more money I'm going to figure out which
series has the highest RPM which is
right four thousand and then i'm going
to create more of that content and see
how it goes so in order to create a
group we can go to create video group
and i'll just say i'll just give you an
example i just made a few videos over
the logitech c920 and what i'm going to
do is search c920 actually they're all
right there at the top so let me just
let me retry this group create video
group
alright so now i can add my logitech
c920 videos and then i'll go over here
into the group there's five videos for
some ways then there's six over here I
don't know anyways we click save and
since these are new they're not gonna
have a ton of views obviously but I can
see you have received 145 years and now
for future reference I can figure out
all did people like this type of content
if so make more if so if not don't make
more so yeah you can use this to help
guide the future of your business and
then you can compare this stuff to your
overall rating seems click analytics
it's going to give you the overview of
everything so yeah thank you for
watching hopefully that was helpful in
some way possibly probably not but yeah
thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
