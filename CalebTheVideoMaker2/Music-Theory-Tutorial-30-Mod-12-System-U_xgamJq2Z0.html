will be talking about a new way to
calculate intervals it's called the mod
12 system it's not nearly as popular but
you may run into it so I'll write that
out for you actually this marker is too
thin you can't even see what's going on
mod 12 system I think that's what it's
called and what this will do basically
I'll sign each half step an interval
rather than interval quality and
interval size it'll just combine it
together so if we start at sea and play
see the interval is a unison the
interval size is not dependent on where
you start it's just the same concepts
d2f this would be 0 1 2 3 so this is a
third there's something great about this
but there's also some downsides for one
you want to ever really will hear many
people use it but there is a good thing
there's no been harm our in harmonic
interval sizes for example we used to
have where we could have perfect fifth
is equal to something else and so forth
but now a perfect fifth is now known as
a seventh so from C to G that's the only
name you can call it is seventh you
can't call it a minor aether whatever I
just made that up but it's just it's
just what it is so basically this is
just a system of labeling each half step
way eraser here Dada da-da-da-da-da-da a
zero all the way up to an octave at 12
which is kind of cool because if you
remember I perfect eighth or a perfect
octave had 12 half step so that's
basically same concept just gets rid of
all of the name
games for the interval qualities so yeah
you should familiarize yourself it's
called the mod 12 not sure of that wall
street they're not ' I don't know why
call it a pulse for you oh what's that
called hyphen mod 12 system should
familiarize yourself at and then there's
also the other thing we are learning is
interval size and quality which gives us
augmented diminish perfect major minor
so those are the types of interval
systems we need to familiarize ourselves
with with we will be using the intervals
rather than the mod 12 system or the mod
12 method but either one work fine for
you it depends on what you like so yeah
if you want to learn more about this
just research it on the web and in the
next video I will be speaking of
something new so yeah I'm glad we
finally got through the interval stuff
and now we're going to move on something
awesome because everything's also in
music theory right it is so yeah the
interval size is not dependent on where
you start it's just the same concepts
d2f this would be 0 1 2 3 so this is a
third there's something great about this
but there's also some downsides for one
you whatever you won't hear many people
use it but there is a good thing there's
no in harm are in harmonic interval
sizes for example we used to have where
we could have perfect fifth is equal to

perfect fifth is now known as a seventh
so from C to G that's the only name you
can call it is seventh you can't call it
a minor aether of whatever I just made
that up but it's just a just what it is
so basically this is just a system of
labeling each half step is we're racing
here just after da da da da time as zero
all the way up to an octave at 12 which
is kind of cool because if you remember
I perfect eighth or a perfect octave had
12 half step so that's basically same
concept just gets rid of all of the
names for the interval qualities so yeah

just research it on the web and in the
next video I will be speaking of
something new so yeah I'm glad we
finally got through the interval stuff
and now we're going to move on something
awesome because everything's awesome and
we use a theory right it is so yeah
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video bye I changed my mind all
right so in the next video we are going
to be practicing with some more
intervals and learning to familiarize
yourself with a couple of them to better
project our I was the horse word I could
use to increase our music theory skills
with intervals and then we'll be
learning about flipping them which is a
cool concept so that's what we'll be
going over so thank you subscribe and
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
