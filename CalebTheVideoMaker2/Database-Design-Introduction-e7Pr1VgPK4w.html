of you who do not know me my name is
caleb from caleb d video maker 2 and
killer comm so i'm sure most of you are
asking oh what is this video about what
is this a new series or something
alright well yeah actually it is I
decided to start a new series over
database design so I did a a design
series a while ago it's my first video
series here on youtube I was about 25
videos long and then I went on to make a
67 part video series over MySQL and I
did a couple other ones I have over 100
databasing videos and I wanted to I
wanted to try and tackle this again to
try to make it better explain things
better and also bring you to a new level
of skill so what what level of
difficulty is this course going to be
it's going to be a for beginners
although the destination is going to be
much higher than the destination of my
first series my first database design
series which by the way if you want to
check that out if you're completely new
to things I will link to that in the
description but that series was for
absolute beginners no experience
whatsoever this series I'm still going
to be treating everyone as if they're
beginners working their way up although
it may be just a tad bit more advanced
so if necessary you can check out that
series and if you want to know how to
implement your database design into a
database check out my MySQL series both
will be linked in the description below
but as for the series I am going to be
talking about all the topics within my
first database design series and
specifically for relational databases so
a relational database is just it
separates everything into separate
tables so MySQL is an example of a
relational database most most database
design is used for relational databases
because it's a big process so why do you
want to use a series well if you are
let's say you're just bored like which I
don't even know why you're here but if
that's the case this series will be
awesome because databasing design is fun
database designer should set
and it's going to be interesting it's
kind of like a puzzle which I know some
of you hate puzzles but they'll be fun
struts me yeah guys it'd be sweet
alright so the second thing is if you're
just in general IT or computer science
well knowing database will set you apart
from a lot of people because a lot of
people blow it off like it's not that
big of a deal when in reality most
platforms programs applications rely on
a back-end database that's how we store
information in this world everything we
do is powered by a database so it's
important that you know how to properly
implement database concepts designs to
know how to properly structure data so
that way you get the best optimized
database that will set you apart from
the rest of the IT team or the rest of
your classmates it will give you the
skills needed to get that job or
whatever you want to do with it also if
you're just a business person or you
have your own project
and you need to learn how to build a
website or you need a database to store
all the information you're using this
series will be helpful third thing is if
you are interested in being a database
administrator which is where you want to
do databasing for living well then this
series is going to be like heaven
because everything in the series you're
going to need to know and you'll need to
know more than that but this series will
be the start of a lot right so from
there what was I gonna say oh sure
anyways um basically database design is
the fundamentals of databases you should
know how to properly structure data this
series is not going to be very specific
on a specific database management system
so this isn't like MySQL database design
this isn't like Oracle this is an SQL
server
this isn't whatever else you use this is
going to be general database design so
then you can take these skills and apply
them to any of the databases that you
are working on that or relational which
I mean through this series you hope
you'll really
understand what that means you don't get
that alright so I don't want to ramble
on but I do just want to explain some
things about what the series will
consist of basically we'll start
explaining the database concepts using
this suite legit new chalkboard which is
awesome yeah got it a yard sale for like
it was like 15 bucks and I bargained it
down to 10 it's awesome except doesn't
have a stand
seriously I'm like balancing it on a
bunch of books right now anyways what
was I saying alright so so the first
part is going to be a lot of the
concepts on the chalkboard and I'm not
going to like write tons of scripts on
here so don't worry it's not going to be
confusing to where you can't see the
code on a screen because in reality a
lot of database design is not done on a
computer first first you have to think
about it and then you kind of just draw
your plans whether it be in your head or
on a document or if you use a database
design program I use a chalkboard
because I can easily draw up concepts
thoughts way the way data is connected
and all that so a lot of these
databasing videos they're going to be on
this chalkboard because that's all you
really need we're not we're not
programming a database we're designing a
database and designing is art you draw
it you design it after we go through a
lot of the concepts is when we will be
going into specific examples where we
will be going on the computer using a
design program to teach how to put that
in a computer program for a visual
schema of your database so I'm not sure
what program we'll use maybe item MySQL
workbench but whatever it is a lot of
the programs will be universal no matter
what relational database management
system you use so a lot of the concepts
from this video will be useful no matter
what you will be using for your database
so not only will you get the concepts
out here on this chalkboard but you will
get real practical use
of programs on the computer where you
will get your training so we have
education computer training basically
the whole series where we're on the
chalkboard you can kind of just watch
whichever video you need if necessary I
do recommend you watch all the way from
the beginning to the end but if you just
need to know about like primary keys or
candidate keys or whatever it is you can
just check out that video now when we go
on to the computer screen that's when
we'll be kind of going through practical
examples and it's kind of confusing to
jump in right in the middle so if you
want to just uh if you want to watch the
on screen videos I'd recommend you start
from the very first onscreen video and
they'll all kind of be in a row so yeah
this series compared to the last will
have more content a better content more
in-depth content better explain content
I've taken a lot of the suggestions from
my previous series implemented them into
this series and it's going to be awesome
from this series once you understand the
database concepts is when you apply it
to a specific database management system
so I made a series over MySQL that is a
relational database management system
that's how we create our database that's
how we manage it well a lot of the
design concepts I apply to that and then
when I program with MySQL I understand
what I'm doing it's a lot better so
after the series um a lot of these stuff
in this series will be kind of almost
like the design concepts will be useful
but once we get into the very specific
differences between relational database
management systems it's going to be a
lot of conceptual stuff because I can't
really implement every single relational
database management system in this
series because it'd be like a million
videos long so it's more important to
get the ideas and the concepts behind
why we do things and then you can apply
those to whatever relational database
management system there is rather than
learning oh my SQL database design you
just learn database design in general
you can apply that anywhere if you want
more complementary material check out my
website Caleb curry comm and then go
forward slash blogs is the current URL
I'll put that link in the description as
well that is going to have blogs that
actually has this content in textual
pictorial form where you can you know
like read it and stuff if that's what
you're into which why would you read it
when you can watch it I'm just good if
you want to read it go check that out
the other thing is I really really
really appreciate it if you subscribe to
my youtube channel and as you go through
this series click like on my videos when
you get to the first video be sure to
share that to your friends to get more
views and feedback for me to improve
upon further so yeah I don't really have
much else to say except for the fact
that the series is going to be a blast
and I'm excited like super excited
especially this is awesome a chalkboard
like seriously it's awesome alright see
ya starting in video 1 I'm not going to
be explaining a whole bunch of the
background crap that's why I just made
this introduction video that way those
of you who care can watch in those of
you who don't care I don't have to watch
so video 1 we're just going to kind of
jump right into things and from there
it's just going to try and keep it
simple stupid and make things easy to
understand and I'm going to try to make
things as correct as possible if you
have any questions just leave a comment
on the video if you have any suggestions
leave a comment on the video and if you
liked the video click like and subscribe
that's all that I ask of you and share
with your friends so yeah thanks once
again it's Caleb that's my name so for
future reference I'm probably going to
say that in every single video because I
don't know it's kind of habit now hey
what's up it's Caleb alright so yeah I
will see you guys in the next video
peace
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
