tutorial and in this video I will be
speaking of the tools of Adobe Audition
so you can find your tools up at your
top tool bar here which you can actually
if you don't like where it's located or
you want it a floating tab you can drag
it and place it other places or leave it
as a floating tab by placing it where
there's no other boxes so here's where
all your tools can be located I'm going
to place that back up at the top because
that is how I like it
so now the very first tool is the select
move tool my bad so you can shortcut
this by pressing V and what this will do
is it'll allow you to move files around
just by clicking you see so that's what
that does now the next tool is the razor
blade selecting tool so this will cut
files so let's say hmm I think a good
cut can be here so now if I go back to
my select tool I can actually separate
these two files you see so that's pretty
cool I'm going to undo that by pressing
ctrl Z so that is the razor select tool
the next tool is the slip tool you can
get that by pressing Y what this will do
this will allow you to easily shorten
and lengthen certain files so I have a
file here and when I I can go hover over
the left and right to shrinking or
lengthen it as you can see well I can
also drag what part of the file is being
played so for example I cut out here
then I get my razor blade tool cut out
this much right here and then I drag
this down here and I realize hmm I
probably should have cut it a little bit
earlier what I can do is get this tool
which is the slip tool I need to learn
the shortcuts for these and just drag it
over a bit so now you can see it changed
what part of the selected file so if I
play manage to increase your okay yeah I
mean you probably didn't understand that
at all but that's okay so that's what
that tool does and the last is the time
selection tool and what this will do is
select a specific portion
of your multitrack so I can select like
this right here you see and I can play
it by clicking play or pressing space it
look the video maker I hope I have
managed to your head about cool stuff so
now that'll play that and then once you
get to the end it should repeat boom
goes back to the beginning so those are
the tools up here then I'm also going to
go over the zoom tools so the very first
thing is this little bar up here this
will allow you to view the entire
session how long it is so if I drag a
file down here you can see it moved up
here so I'm gonna drag that back and I'm
going to teach you some about these zoom
tools so the very first one is you can
see that each one of these you can
actually resize them by dragging along
these black bars not here it won't work
here has to be here
so that's what that does now so if
you're working on something and then you
don't really need it you can kind of
just like shrink it like that you see
and then if I'm working on this main
project I'll make this one bigger by
pulling it down so that's pretty cool
and you can also shrink them all or make
them bigger spy clicking these two
buttons so if I want a bigger I can zoom
in this way
pulling them smaller I can zoom out this
way with these two buttons now if I want
to view a larger portion of my
multitrack I can take part of this
yellow bar and scroll it to one side or
I can also use these tools right here
this will make it zoom out and this will
zoom in so if I needed a Sumerian I
individual this is like each of the
44100 is one of these dots represents
one of those 44,000 so that's pretty
cool so I'm gonna zoom back out and
actually the next tool this will zoom
out for you to see the whole area so
bang that's everything I have that's
cool so now when I have a selection
let's say I select this the next tool
will repre
manipulate this by if I want to zoom in
and the start I can use this tool which
I haven't even been saying the names
at any point I just like to call it the
toll that start zooming into the start
point because that's easier to remember
or I can zoom in to the end point so if
I swap this is the end point this is a
start point so if i zoom out oops
you can see my entire thing so if i zoom
into the start point it goes this way
but if i zoom into the end point goes
this way and this way this way so this
this uh the last tool zoom to selection
will actually take my selected part and
blow it up to take up the whole screen
so BAM this this is all I had selected
so as you can see if i zoom out it'll
show you the rest of the file now let's
click the wrong one you can also use
control and scroll and that will make
the entire multitrack zoomed in or
zoomed out and you can also hold alt
which will increase the size of each
track so yeah that's cool that's really
cool so yeah the next video I will be
speaking of something probably known as
boring so yeah subscribe and I'll catch
you later
peace out my friends and family ah just
kidding my family and friends don't
