over two terms diatonic and chromatic I
may have gone over these I don't really
remember so we're gonna learn them again
diatonic and chromatic what is the
difference between these two and what
are they well when we have a scale such
as the major scale the notes within the
scale are said to be diatonic so this
would be in the scale notes outside of
the scale are said to be chromatic not
in the scale so what would this be well
if we have a major scale such as a major
scale we would have e f g a b c d e we
would have a F sharp C sharp G sharp and
a D sure that is the major scale if you
don't understand how to figure this out
go back to my major scales video or
search there on the web if you didn't
understand those ones because I'm not
gonna go over it again so uh now the
diatonic these are all of the diatonic
notes these ones right here e D sharp C
sharp B a G sharp F sharp and E so what
if we have an e sharp this note is said
to be chromatic because it's not within
the scale and now how the way you can
remember these terms
well chromatic anyways chroma means
color such as I think I have said that's
now that I've mentioned this like chroma
keying in video making like green
screens so chroma just remember color
let's start with the C so flat color I
mean it adds extra flavor to your it's
not just boring old notes within the
scale you're adding something new you're
adding a little bit more color something
like that just study em memorize them so
B sharp
also known as C
is not within this scale so what about a
flat well that's actually g-sharp so the
note a flat is not within the scale but
the pitch that's played is within the
scale sounds a little bit of confusing
one but anyways that is the basis of
diatonic verse chromatic notes and
that's a laugh for this short video and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
