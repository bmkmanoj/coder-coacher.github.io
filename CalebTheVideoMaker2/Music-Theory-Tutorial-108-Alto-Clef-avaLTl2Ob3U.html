going to be learning something new here
but I want to relate back to something
else we have already learned so when
we're writing music we have what's
called a cleft sign we have learnt
learned to one looks like this sorta and
that's affordable drawing but it looks
like that sort of that is the treble
clef or what we've learned so far is
known as the trouble is whoopsies now we
also have the bass clef which looks like
this right pretty cool curves around and
when we're on a staff this thing the
treble clef points to the G so here's a
G with the triple cliff that's where it
loops around I don't know I kind of
altered that drawing myself but it
points this little loop right here
points to the G now the other one bass
clef points to the F and the dot of it
points to the f we have two other little
dots which don't really count towards
pointing anything unless you wanted
whatever this points to this right here
which is the F great big dogs fight
animals F for fighting the other one
which treble clef was every good boy
deserves fudge every good is the G so
now when we put these two together we
had the grand staff we had the treble
clef over in this corner then in this
corner we had to face clothed put them
together I'm thinking about drawing my
staff's in a different marker because it
drains the marker so quickly and then
it's not as bright you see and I like
the red because it's really bright and
contrasting and you can see it so I
don't know me but anyways when we have
this the way they overlap is right here
middle C so somebody some genius thought
what if I want to get right in between
these two now we're going to put see in
the middle well we get what's called the
treble clef not the treble clef that's a
treble clef alto clef boom now this
thing looks really freaky you may or may
not have seen it yet the alto clef puts
middle C right here now how do we know
that well the way it's drawn points to
middle C it looks like this and go back
to black since around no staff here well
first we draw this thick line at the
start of the staff maybe a little too
thick but then we draw a little thin
line right after it now the way we'd
roll it is we put two little dots right
here and we curl it up past here boom
that is essentially a el alto clef so
they thicken this up here so you can see
real nice so this points to middle C as
you can see it closes as you can see man
I love it it closes around the sea
almost like the sea is going between
these two little lines here so basically
we just have a little dot loop dot loop
spike out spike in spike a spike in
that's what it looks like now if you're
writing a song and the treble clef is a
little too high and the bass clefs a
little too low you can use the alto clef
now middle C is right here that means up
here's blower treble clef and up here is
higher base
so now the range is adjusted to fit the
test shura which we'll get into that so
yes that is the outdoor cliff into the
next video we'll be going over something
even awesomer see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
