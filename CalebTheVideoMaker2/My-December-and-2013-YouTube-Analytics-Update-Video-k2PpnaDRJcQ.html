name is Caleb from Caleb the video maker
to this is going to be a quick 2013 and
December overview and I'm just going to
be telling you what's new with this
channel stuff like that so I wanted to
have the opportunity to share some of my
analytics with my viewers so I'm going
to be doing that in this video so
basically I started this I started
making these videos in a 2012 I think
yeah 2012 and then 2013 was much much
much more productive so yeah I'm going
to be sharing all of this stuff and so
far things are going pretty good I got
2535 subscribers 207,000 total views and
that's pretty good I mean I've been
going a while but I mean it is a work in
progress and by next year it's going to
be much higher than that so yeah we'll
see all right so let's do a quick review
of december i uploaded a ton of video
done of videos this month not as not as
much as i would have liked to but i'm
off of I'm on a break with school so I
have a lot more time so I've been
studying a lot and making a lot more
content I received up to from November
25th to December 24th so not quite all
of December but I wanted to have some
opportunities for people to watch this
in the summer i received 20 2632 views
which is a 25-point fifty-eight percent
increase from the month before that the
last period so that's 22,000 views
that's that's pretty good I'd like to
see that get higher I am I am excited
about that it's definitely rising a
twenty-five percent increase is a lot
75,000 minutes watched that's a 29-point
ninety-seven percent increase since the
last month 367 likes on all my
videos that's a five-point sixteen
percent increase and 127 comments that's
actually a negative eighteen point
fifty-nine percent decrease although I
don't really I don't really watch how
many comments like it I just answer them
I got six shares 18 favorites and what
number I'm really focusing on right now
is a 227 subscribers in this past month
that is a two point twenty five percent
increase which is good I'm not
complaining although six days ago that
number was 264 in that period so it is
it's not that I'm decreasing in the
amount of subscribers I'm getting I'm
just not getting as many as I was so
yeah I have decreased up what I'm saying
is I have decreased on how many I'm
getting but that 264 was kind of just a
jump more than anything so uh overall
the amount of subscribers i'm getting a
month is going up it's just a little
wavy like this hopefully that makes good
sense so yeah i was excited to get that
over 250 so i'm going to try and
continue to earn more subscribers as for
video series I've did I've done a bunch
I did database design in 2012 I did my
SQL partly in 2012 and 2013 I think and
then I did PHP right now there's a
couple other video series out there that
I made but I'm not really too focused on
them these are my main three that I
really focus on right now so in 2013 I'm
sorry into in December database design
received 3282 views 21 subscribers gain
from that this month 27 likes and 8580
nine minutes watched so that is pretty
decent portion of my views a little more
than ten percent so that's pretty good
it's 25 part video series mysql on the
other hand
has received eight thousand eight
hundred and twenty three views which is
a lot 31,000 minutes watched 117 likes
and 28 subscribers so MySQL is
definitely a lot better at getting likes
than the database design database design
got 27 mysql got 117 it's crazy PHP 2132
views it's kind of new so it's still
it's still building up their 7700
minutes watched 36 likes and 29
subscribers so as I think that most of
my most of my subscribers come from
series i have received 155 subscribers
through all my videos so there's two
ways to subscribe you can subscribe
through my channel or you could
subscribe on a video page well all of
the subscriptions on the video page sum
up to 150 578 of those subscribers are
from these three series so that's a huge
portion of my video subscribers so as I
try to get more subscribers I do realize
that series are the way to go the
average view duration is three minutes
and 21 seconds and that does sound kind
of weak but you do have to realize
that's a forty percent of my total
average view length so that means uh
let's say my videos on average or ten
minutes long and people watched three
minutes that's going to be a 30-percent
well mines forty percent which is
actually pretty good I think that's gone
down a bit because I've been releasing
longer content and as you release longer
content people tend to X out of the
video sooner which lowers your
percentage of videos watched so shorter
videos get increased the percentage
longer videos increase the total mu
duration average so yeah hopefully that
makes sense 78.1 percent of my viewers
are male 22% female now as for the
entire year of 2013
I have received 176,000 views 5548
thousand minutes watched 3046 likes 67
shares 167 favorites in 2047 subscribers
so that's an average of fourteen
thousand six hundred views a month and
an average of 170 subscribers a month so
if you take those numbers and can
compare them to what I'm getting in
December the average views was fourteen
thousand six hundred well I've received
twenty two thousand six hundred so I am
above my average which means I am
generally increasing from what I was
doing throughout the year my average of
170 subscribers is now beat in December
by 227 so it is going up stats aren't
horribly impressive but for kind of to
start now it's pretty good and yeah so I
want to look into the future what I
could get as time goes on in 2014 I
think I'd be really awesome to reach
10,000 subscribers that that would mean
I would need to gain 7469 subscribers or
an average of 622 a month which is way
larger than 1 i'm getting right now but
from the amount of improvement i've seen
in 2013 I think in 2014 10,000 isn't
achievable but it's an achievable goal
but i would have to work pretty hard for
it so yeah for those of you are watching
and you haven't subscribed I definitely
encourage you to do that because that is
going to help build my channel and so
forth 622 a month that's like three
times what I'm getting right now almost
so it's like two and a half times as
much so definitely a lot to improve
their so i'm not sure if 10,000 will
happen but i guess i'll have to see that
is my goal for 2014
and also I want genuine subscribers so I
don't I don't try to trick people into
subscribing or convince them like oh
yeah I'll answer your comments if you
subscribe no it's it's genuine
subscription so if you want to subscribe
subscribe if you don't want to subscribe
I'm not forcing you to subscribe because
I don't want 10,000 subscribers at 5,000
of them were forced or tricked or
convinced to subscribe when and then
they never watch my content I want
genuine subscribers so I do encourage
people to subscribe but I'm not begging
people I just mentioned it every video
no big deal I know you guys don't I
don't really show gets a whole lot on my
website yet I do want to improve upon
that website in 2014 as always I am
always looking forward provement because
that's what's important it's kind of
weak right now I'm just kind of doing as
a part-time thing but I get on average
523 views a month that was December I
didn't really look in the year because
at one point I was getting like ten Musa
month so 523 views a month as of
December statuses stats 354 unique
viewers so out of the 523 354 work
different people 1101 page visits so
when you go to my website and you click
on multiple pages there's a total of a
thousand one hundred page visits the
average view duration is 16 minutes and
58 seconds which is insane so hoping to
keep that that duration up I like that I
mean I I think it'll go down as I get
more views but that's impressive so
those stats are kind of crappy pretty
lame but as 2014 comes around yeah could
be make some blogs and whatnot you can
check out my blogs it's Caleb curry calm
forward slash blogs I post random
computer stuff on there pretty much
whatever on
case you guys haven't realized i posted
what I want on here I'm not following
any strict rules on my on my own owner
so if I upload something that's
different than what I upload I don't
really mind my websites just focused for
uploading content it is sort of
programming based so I have my videos on
there I have computer videos technology
videos computer science videos but not
so many blogs i have like 10 or so
published someone's over hacking a
couple are over YouTube tips and a
couple are over like technology and so
forth actually I have to hacking low so
yeah if you guys like hacking go check
those out I have one on viewing saved
passwords and then I have one on the
beginning introduction of SQL SQL
injections of a cross-site scripting so
I drew a blank there so yeah that is the
sum of december and 2014 13 so I'm not
sure how many videos I've uploaded but
definitely a lot when 2014 comes around
I will try to upload sort of these
update videos either monthly or
quarterly to explain how i'm improving
so you guys can see as my goals be
achieved I think reaching a million
subscribe button off subscribers million
views would be definitely pretty awesome
I have 207 right now thousand views so
if i could multiply that by 5 by 2014 I
think it's possible to if I can keep
making content definitely when summer
comes around oh yeah it's going to be
like videos every second of the day well
not really but you know I'm saying
so I'm not really sure what else have to
say just be sure to you you can follow
my social networks if you want I don't
use them very actively I just on time
and I'm too much effort so I just I
mainly focus on my youtube content so
yeah but you can follow those out of
Twitter it's Caleb curry at a Facebook
account Caleb the video maker um what
else check out my google plus content
let's connect to my youtube account so
just go to my YouTube clown count click
google plus they're all connected to my
google youtube account actually so
you're good my channel there's a banner
there's little social network buttons
click those follow them all and if you
don't see anything go to my about me and
i'll have my links there if you want to
find my website stuff like that i also
encourage you to comment on my videos
and let me know what you like to see
what i should create and as i go on the
stuff is always going to chime always
going to try to improve I'm not a genius
so I do have to learn a lot of stuff
yeah so just keep in mind as I make
these series I'm usually learning this
stuff myself I mean I learn it well
enough so I can teach it but I don't
have like years and years of experience
like i wish i'm only 19 actually I'm
only 18 I cannot think today oh yeah so
