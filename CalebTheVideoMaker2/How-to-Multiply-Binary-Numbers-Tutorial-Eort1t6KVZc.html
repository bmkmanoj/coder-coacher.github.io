is Caleb from Caleb the video maker in
this video I'll be teaching you how to
multiply binary it's very simple for
those of you who don't know me if you
like this video you find it useful
please be sure to click subscribe and
share it to all of your friends or
whoever so yeah let's get started
alright so first for prereq with
what the okay got it all right
so prerequisites you need to understand
the basics of binary but I mean it's not
like you don't have to go study it for
like 20 years so I'll just explain it
right now you need to understand the
place values when you have so let's say
you have the number let's say 1 for once
well each place value it just multiplies
by 2 so you start with 1 2 4 8 you have
this together you get 8 plus 4 12 plus 2
14 plus 1 15 this is how you represent
15 so if you have something like this
well you know that's 16 because it's one
more than this so me I just basic place
values of binary if you don't understand
that and you want to get more into that
go check out my introduction to binary
video you also need to understand a
little bit about adding binary so for
example if you have to add this well you
need to know that when you add when you
add this you have 1 0 like that's basic
math and binary so basically I'll teach
you all that real super quick but I'm
not going to go super in-depth if you
have 0 plus 0 you get 0 you write a 0 if
you have 0 plus 1 or 1 plus 0 you have
you write a 1 we have 1 get 1 plus 1
what you do is you write a 0 and you
carry 1 so I mean if you when we get
math you'll understand caring is when
you take it up to the next placement
well let's find that later if you have a
1 plus 1 plus 1 then you have 2
right a 1 and then you carry is up yeah
you carry a 1 finally if you have 1 plus
1 plus 1 plus 1 what you want to do is
you carry two ones and write a zero so
yeah which basically you write a zero
and then you carry two once that's
that's basically all you ever need to
know for adding a binary and we'll be
explaining that once we have to do that
one with our math problem
so let's first see how we do math and
decimal and it converts to binary almost
exactly so binary
I mean I'm decimal let's multiply 10
times 10 it's very simple basically you
just take the I think it's the
multiplicand I think is what's called I
don't know take that multiply it by each
digit in the multiplier and you get zero
times zero zero zero times 1 0 then for
the next placement you have to move
everything over a place marker so you
add a 0 1 times 0 0 1 times 1 1 then you
just add this is where we have to learn
how to add for the binary so 0 plus 0 0
0 plus 0 0 1 is a 1 so our final answer
is 100 so what we have is 10 plus 10 or
sorry 10 times 10 equals 100 this isn't
decimal well the same exact concept
applies to vining and you you don't get
the same result but you do it the same
way so now if we're in binary what we
have is a we have 2 times 2 equals 4 you
see that it's the same you do everything
the same as normal mathematics which is
really awesome it's very simple so here
let me try another example just to show
you the process rose
and see what it was all right let's go
one 101 times 0 0 1 alright so for our
sake we can figure out what these are
just to make sure we got it right we got
1 plus 2 so this is going to be 3 now
you got 1 plus 4 plus 8 so 8 plus 4 is
12 plus 1 is 13 so this is 13 in decimal
this is 3 in decimal so our final answer
should be 39 so what we should have is
39 at the end let's try multiplying this
we start here 1 times 1 1 1 times 0 0 1
times 1 1 1 times 1 its 1 all right then
we go to the next one we add a 0 because
we always have to go up a placement for
each time for each decimal we go over a
a place marker so 1 times 1 1 1 times 0
0 1 times 1 1 I'm just kind of got
thrown off there 1 times 1 is 1 so here
is what we have then we just have to add
this together 1 plus 1 is 1 1 I'm sorry
1 plus 0 is 1 1 plus 0 is 1 1 plus 0 is
1 now when you have two ones remember
you have to carry one and write a 0 so 0
1 do the same thing here drop 0 carry 1
well so this is our final answer
now our we can figure out if this is
right to see if it's 39 we have 1 plus 2
plus 4
no wait no 16 plus 32 so have 32 plus 4
that be 36 plus 2 38 plus 1 39 so this
is in fact the correct answer to this
problem so now let's take a look at this
just so we can simplify even farther
we're always multiplying by 1 what that
means is we're always just going to be
copying the multiplier down here you can
see we have the segment here and the
segment here we're always multiplying by
1 so we're never going to get a number
large like that unless we carry a 1 as
we did here
I mean think of it like logically if you
multiply the 1 you're not going to get
more somehow like if you have three
girlfriends and you multiply each one by
one you're still going to have three
girlfriends which makes no sense and
your wife's probably not gonna be too
happy but I don't even know what anyways
you always copy that you're always
copying this down so let's try a more
complex example 2 this will be our final
example and we'll illustrate at this
point but right before I do that real
quick I'll just show you this again 1
times this we just copy down here this
just goes down here then we add a 0 and
then we just move it down here we have 1
0 1 1 add those together and we finish
the problem and boom we're done pretty
simple all right let's try a really more
complex answer your question let's go
with wrote this one Val right 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 this is what we are multiplying
this is really simple like I said when
we multiply the one we just copy this
and move it down so 1 0 1 0 1
okay and then we just Adam add a place
value because we're going up to the twos
place copy it one zero one zero one now
we're just going up to the fours place 1
0 1 0 1 1 eights place 1 0 1 0 1 1
well it's like that simple and then we
have to do is add these together it's
like so easy if you like really think
about it like how it works rather than
just mindlessly following directions
then you can figure this out like really
easily because all we have to do is copy
this number and then like match it up
with the place value to get for each one
of the ones in the multiplicand or
whatever it's called so simple
sorry if I'm acting weird I'm past my
bedtime all right so then we just add
these up one one plus three zeroes
obviously 1 + 3 0 is 1 1 plus 1 well we
have to carry one write a 0 1 2 3
so now we can carry a 1 write a 1 1 2 3
so we carry 1 write a 1 1 2 3 4 all
right so we've have 4 what we do is we
write a 0 and we carry two ones so 1 2 3
4 now what we do is we write a 0 and
carry to 1 so 1 2 3 4
once again write a 0 carry two ones one
two three carry a 1 and write a one so
like I said you have to be able to do
the mathematic the addition and I did do
an addition video over binary - if you
want to check that out but before you
just check out what I told you at the
beginning of this video is probably way
simpler this is our final answer and if
you want you can really go figure it out
if that's correct you know I think I
have to answer
yeah 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah so that's the answer that is how
you multiply binary you have any
questions Oh another thing another
simple way to do it is just take this
value and figure out what this value is
all right let's just make it easier
let's say we have this well we can
figure this out real easy we have 1 plus
4 so 5 5 let's roll this and then we
have 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 8 plus 4
this is a 15 so yea 15 so then we just
multiply the decimal version because
we're all used to multiplying in decimal
hopefully so that's 15 30 45 60 75 or an
easier way to think of that is a 150
would be times 10 and you have half of
that or 75 because you've multiplied by
5 what yeah that's all topic so yeah
that's that's another easy way to do it
is just convert it to decimal and then
once you have 75 you can figure out the
binary representation of 75 so those are
the best ways to do multiplication in
binary hopefully that was helpful and if
you have any questions please leave a
comment send me Facebook message or yeah
that's about it be sure to subscribe
