are going to be installing signal are
but first you're going to need to
download Visual Studio this is the IDE
that we're going to be using to write
all of our code now you didn't just go
to visual studio comm and then download
community which is a free version that
I'll be using and if you have a future
version the chances are most of the
stuff is going to be pretty similar so
once you got that you can just open it
and it'll look something like this over
here on the left you can click new
project and select asp.net web
application and give you some super
creative name now this create directory
for a solution will put all of your
stuff in one folder and I always check
that to keep things organized once you
got that done you can select MVC under
asp.net 4.5 - templates that is what we
will be using and yeah alright so it's
loaded it'll look something like this
and now what I want to do is just teach
you a couple things that you can put in
the back of your mind so you can use it
throughout this course because it's
gonna make your life a whole lot easier
the very first thing is this quick
launch up here in this corner in here
you can type whatever you want and
visual studio will just help you out so
let's say you screw everything up and
you exit out of some stuff and you don't
matter get it back well now you can just
go up here and search reset and I'll say
window reset window layout but guess and
boom there you go next the solution
Explorer this is where all of our
content is you can see we have our
project here and above that we have our
solution the solution is basically a
container that can store multiple
projects but we only have one here so
yeah now within here you can see this
references this is basically everything
our project depends on and if you look
through here you're probably wondering
where is signal are I don't see it in
there well that's what we're going to be
doing in this video because signal R is
not installed by default so to do that
you can go up to this quick launch and
you can search console and this will
bring up the package manager console now
this is where we can install signal R so
to do that what you need to type in is
install - package micro soft dot asp net
dot signal our and I just want to show
you over here in the solution Explorer
I'm gonna pin it click on this little
button when I press enter on here it
just added some new signal our stuff
over here so now we actually have our
package installed and now we just need
to do some configuration so we need to
tell our project that we want to use
signal are not to do that you go to the
start up CS file and if you're a
beginner you probably don't know much
about middleware and I'll be talking
about it all in a future video but it
has to do with this Owen thing up here
at the top we're basically just saying
hey we want to use signal are so to do
this all you got to do is type app dot
map and you can see we get some options
this little pop-up is known as
intellisense and it's going to tell us
what we could use in this situation now
the one we want to use is this map
signal are right here and then just put
an open and close parenthesis now it's
basically configured that's all we got
to do for that so we just X out of that
file and we could actually X out of all
these files we don't need any of them
but there's a couple scripts we're going
to have to add to our project to do that
you're going to want to go to this views
folder and open it up and in here
there's a shared folder open that up and
in there there's a layout an underscore
layout CSS HTML file this is known as a
razor file which is going to combine
c-sharp and HTML this is basically our
layout for a website it's going to have
our menus and our footer and all that
good stuff well if you scroll down to
the bottom here you can see this
rendering section the scripts dot render
well this is a concept known as bundling
bundling is where we basically put a
bunch of files and send them down to the
client in one request rather than make
happen to make the client make multiple
requests now we're going to add a couple
scripts in here so to do that you just
put script and you can close it and you
can see visual studio will automatically
put the closing tag so that's awesome
now it's in the first one just put
source equals tilde and a little
squiggly and then you're going to want
to put mmm
scripts and then click jQuery dot Sigma
lar / - 2 dot 2.0 and there's two
options here you can use either one but
the men one is a smaller file size so it
takes up less when you send it to the
client so that's what I always use and
we're going to need one more script in
here so we can just go to the new line
and type out script source equals tilde
slash signal R / j s now you might have
noticed that when we type that out
nothing popped up for us to click that's
because this script doesn't actually
exist right now there's no signal our
folder this script is going to be
generated for us so that's part of the
magic of signal R so now that you have
your scripts configured you are ready to
create your first hub and we'll be doing
that in the next video thanks guys
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
