over cross-site scripting this is a
hacking method this is an introduction
so I'm not necessarily going to be
telling you what you need to do in order
to do this hack I'm basically going to
be telling you how it works why it works
and how it's done in general terms so
after this video you will have a general
understanding of cross-site scripting or
X SS for short and I'm not saying you'll
necessarily know how to do it yourself
but you'll easily be able to figure that
out after this video so cross-site
scripting by the way if this video is
helpful be sure to subscribe and like
this video
cross-site scripting is basically a
general hacking method used on websites
it's based off the principle that you
can hide scripts behind URLs and
webpages so URL that is what you type in
to go to a web page so this is an
example so Uniform Resource locator
basically just the web site you can hide
scripts behind URLs and you can also
hide scripts on webpages using a script
tag so you put script tag on a web page
it's not going to show up with on the
web page because script tags are hidden
in the source code so they're still on
the web page you just can't view them so
JavaScript you're not going to see the
JavaScript code when you go to a web
page it's going to be hidden although it
can still be executed so that is the
basic principle of how cross-site
scripting works having people run these
scripts which then does something to
their computer or to their accounts so
forth cross-site scripting is one of the
most common hacking
that's if not the most common along with
SQL injections and brute-force attacks
so since it's pretty common it's
important that you know about cross-site
scripting basically the scripts that are
used are known as client-side and
basically that means they are scripts
that are sent to the computer so if you
have let's say this is a web application
you have what's known as well that was
really bad the back end and the front
end or server side and client side all
right so when a person views a web page
so let's say this right here is your web
page you have foxes and so forth that
you can submit and websites and pictures
that you can view all on the front end
the back end is the actual server
content that is used to make this web
page work so if you put something in a
text box like your user name this gets
sent to the server side which is then
stored in a database or something does
something with it doesn't really matter
if you're working with an SQL injection
that is attacking feed back end by
getting false information submitted into
the database a a client-side attack
changes the front-end to put malicious
code on the actual person's computer
rather than on the server this crop
across site scripting can also be used
to put this client-side code on the
server so every single time someone
views this web page that malicious code
is sent to every single user who views
that page so the actual code being you
is client-side an example is JavaScript
so you would make a client-side script
using JavaScript that's just an example
of a client-side scripting code
programming language is whatever others
other kinds but you a PHP for example
this is a server-side language so what
we just talked about how cross-site
scripting can be used by putting it on
the server so let's say this is the
cross-site script and every single time
someone views the web page it gets sent
to that user this is known as a
server-side cross-site scripting
if it's just placed on the clients side
and then that page is sent to somebody
specifically that's known as a Dom
attack which don't worry if you don't
know what that means basically the Dom
is the actual page being viewed do M I
don't really know if it's pronounced Dom
or not but yeah those are two general
classifications of cross-site scripting
and we'll be getting through that more
in just a minute
but other than that you can group
cross-site scripting into two major
groups first one is non persistent the
second is persistent and now I'm going
to be talking about both of these in
depth so first let's look at the non
persistent all right so non persistent
attacks an example of this would be
searching something in a search engine
but instead of searching a normal term
you search a code that is going to do
something maliciously like hack into
your account or whatever it is well if
the search engine repeats back what you
say
such as if you search hey my name is
Caleb on Google it's going to say search
results for hey my name is Google so I
mean hey my name is Caleb so Google
sanitizes this information that means
that if you try to put something
malicious in there it's not going to
come back on the webpage which can then
be sent to other people so if a website
fails to sanitize I don't notice fault
I'm going to try if it failed to
sanitize data that is sent into their
page and then reap redisplayed then you
have a cross-site scripting
vulnerability so let's just say Google
did not have their input sanitized so
you could put whatever you wanted search
it and it would come up as a script so
if you searched some site some sort of
script well then you would have a Google
search result which would then redisplay
that script on the page that link could
be sent to someone else and then when
they open that page that script would be
executed and so forth that is a
cross-site scripting vulnerability so
you can have these scripts be ran
through other web pages that redisplay
your information your script that you
put into the fields or you can have a
custom made URL which has the script
within the URL so you can execute
JavaScript through the URL through the
search bar at the top the UM not the
search bar but the address bar and then
if you have that link sent to someone
else who then clicks on that link and
the code is executed well then you have
performed a successful cross-site
scripting attack technically uh you
would have to for cross-site scripting
it would be using a safe looking website
so if you send someone a Google link
a Google link well they're not going to
be like huh I wonder if that's malicious
because it's actually from Google so a
cross-site scripting attack the main
goal is to get this malicious code on
another safe website so if I
successfully put a malicious code on
Facebook for example using a search
result I send that link and people see
you Oh facebook.com dah dah dah dah dah
dah dah well they're not going to be
confused and say oh that's a malicious
that's a malicious URL so that would be
an example of a cross-site scripting
attack and if necessary uh if the co if
the URL does look malicious well then
the attacker can then encode it into
hexadecimal or hide it behind HTML on
another webpage so if you're actually
using a friendly website and you get
that malicious code on there well then
that's good
well I mean if you're hacking of course
if if you're not if you're getting
hacked it's bad um or if you're just
using your own custom URL then you can
encode that you like if you have your
script within your URL you can encode
that into hexadecimal and have that sent
to another person which can then type
that link or click that link which will
execute the code so that is an example
of a non-persistent it's a one-time
thing the database so we'll go back to
our little box here this is the server
side this is the client side the
non-persistent is only going to modify
the client side information nothing is
being sent to a database which then gets
constantly sent to other people so
that's the difference between non
persistent and persistent so a
persistent attack that is where the
actual database or the server side is
infiltrated that script is then given to
the actual web server
which then unknowingly sends that script
to all kinds of other people so the
classic example of this is a social
network so if you have a page if your
profile picture and your name and you
have a status like what you're doing and
then oftentimes you'll have an
information box about you so you can say
oh this is the about me well you can be
like I like music but then when you're
editing this page you can secretly hide
a script within this about me because
it's within a script tag it's not going
to be displayed to other people because
script tags are hidden otherwise all
your JavaScript code for example would
be viewed by everyone when really you
just want the web website to be
displayed and if you really want to know
the script you can check the source code
but basically you hide this script
behind this page and then this is saved
on the server so all this information is
given to the server and if they fail to
sanitize it they're going to okay it's
good information now
when Billy or Bob or whoever goes to
this web page this profile this script
can either be through a link or a hidden
on the web pet web page will be executed
which will then affect Bob and then so
forth now there's a a type of cross-site
scripting so if the actual script
affects all of the users the same so we
start with the hacker so let's say I'm
the hacker Caleb and Bob views my web
page and three people view Bob's web
page or my profile well if I'm able if
if I can get Bob to fall for this trick
and fall for our maliciously use
the persistent attack on the database
here's what it's going to look like the
database sends this script pushes it on
my profile every time someone views my
profile well ball views my profile well
now not only is my page infected well
Bob's page can be infected if that's so
wish by the hacker and then everyone who
falls for on Bob's page also gets
infected and we get this worm which
spreads throughout the social network
and pretty much affects everyone because
everyone gets affected by viewing pages
this process where the actual script is
sent to other accounts and spreads is
known as a self propagating script so
that's this is probably the most deadly
version because it affects everyone so
so far we had persistent non-persistent
and the self-propagating persistent so
basically the non-persistent did not
affect the server the persistent
actually modified server content by
saving it through that about me box
which is then sent to other people which
retrieve information from the server by
going to that person's profile
well self-propagating basically spreads
that throughout the non-persistent which
only affects this one that one's the
most common the persistent actually
affects the database that one's not
nearly as common but it's much more
deadly because the actual server is
giving out this script freely and they
don't even realize it until they get
reports of the happening alright now
that you know the basics of cross-site
scripting I'm going to be telling you
the most practical use for this
cross-site scripting attack the most
common use for cross-site scripting
attack is to steal
a session alright so in order to
understand this you need to understand
the basics of how web pages work and
specifically like accounts and stuff so
when you go to this web page and you
click on something or you do something
it makes a request to the server so here
you have your web page and here you have
the server okay now if you log in you
have your into your account and then you
want to view profiles or change your
settings or upload something every
single time you do that you're making a
request to the server now in order to
make web applications easier they make
it so you don't have to log in each
action you stay logged in even though
you're making all these requests as your
account the way this works is using
what's known as a session so the
sessions are held on the server and
basically it just says alright this
person has access to the website these
are then sent to the session is sent to
the client and they're sent as let's
known as a cookie so if you you I'm sure
you've probably heard of internet
cookies we're not talking about actual
cookies although they'll be pretty cool
the session content is stored within the
cookie so that's just basically saying
okay this person has access to this
stuff and that way you don't have to
load all the same stuff over and over
again you have the cookie to do that to
say that it yeah you get that one
this is a very basic explanation of how
sessions and cookies work and you can go
into a lot more detail but that's all
I'm really going into for now well once
this client gets the cookie or the file
this file or the cookie has what's
as a session ID so this cookie as a
session ID and the session ID basically
says okay this is that person so let's
you say you sign up as field well you
get it you get this cookie which has
your session ID which grants you access
as Caleb
well the main practical use for a
cross-site scripting attack is to steal
this session ID from somebody else that
way you can do actions as that account
all right so let's say we have another
client down here alright and we're just
going to restart so now all you got to
think about is you have two people the
top one is the hacker it's just a normal
user this person is the admin or the
administrator of the website this this
server hands out the sessions to these
people who are both signed in well this
hacker you can do some sort of
cross-site scripting to get the session
ID of the administrator and send it to
the server to do things as an
administrator or to get administrator
privileges even though typically he
wouldn't be able to do that so if the
administrator has the ability to add or
delete accounts or ban people well if
the session is taken from the
administrator by the hacker well then
that hacker has the ability to delete
people from their servers and so forth
so it's very dangerous another use is
let's say this is just another user and
all you have all your public information
available so your name and your profile
picture but behind this you have private
information such as your credit card so
if this is a shopping website such as
Amazon or something which I don't know
if it
work on Amazon I'm sure they have pretty
high security but if this is a beginner
website that doesn't know much about um
marketing I mean no marketing e-commerce
well they are at risk of cross-site
scripting to begin with if they're not
really good at what they're doing so
they need to be very careful because if
this hacker is able to take this session
from this user instead of the user
getting the session ID this hacker gets
the session ID and only the user can
view the credit card which should never
happen anyways but this is a bad design
website so only the user can view the
credit card but if the hacker gains that
session ID it can request that
information from the server as the user
even though it's not the user and then
this hacker gets access to the credit
card number that is that's an example of
stealing a session ID from another user
all right now that you know the basics
of cross-site scripting and what it's
used for we're going to be talking a
little bit about prevention but this
video is not going to cover that a whole
lot so basically there is no real sure
way to prevent it because there's lots
of ways it can be done but there is ways
you can protect against it and obviously
the more you protect against it the more
complicated the code gets to prevent it
and the more work has to be done so
obviously you've probably heard about
when it comes to security the more
secure you are the less functional
things get cross-site scripting is
pretty essential though so I don't
recommend making your website more
functional too to make it more
functional and then allow these
vulnerabilities to be made so I always
recommend best possible protection
against hacking just you don't want to
get hacked so one of the main ways to
prevent
is to don't make enemies because if you
make enemies people are going to try and
do this to your website more commonly
but I mean you can still be done don't
be too paranoid about it though not
everyone in the entire world is trying
to hack your website I mean some people
may be but you don't know that for sure
the there so basically there's no sure
way one of the common ways is to convert
HTML into the HTML entities so basically
this is the same thing as this so
basically this is going to print out
this on the web page but it's not going
to have the functionality as putting
this would do so you have basic for
example PHP tags which will get this
done HTML entities as long there's a
function to remove tags completely and
basically the more security you have the
less functional things become so that's
just one of the basic ways it can be
done
check out there's a prevention manual on
Olaf I think it's called lookup a wasp
XSS prevention manual and that will tell
you some of the ways that you can
prevent cross-site scripting another
great thing to remember is don't rely on
your coding skills too much so some of
you who have followed me you'll know
that I think I think that if you're
prideful you are more susceptible to
mistakes and hacking and so forth so
don't think your website has the best
code ever and it's unbreachable the
Titanic wasn't supposed to sink so if
your codes not supposed to get hacked it
probably will so don't have that mindset
that it won't get hacked go out of your
way
to figure out how you can rent prevent
XSS cross-site scripting
and you may need to use some forms of
plugins or frameworks and so forth to
get that done in a better way so yeah
this is the basics of prevention so the
main one is stripping tags from HTML so
people can't hide script tags like it if
this doesn't work all the people are
going to have a harder different part
time cross-site scripting your webpage
and other things keep backups of your
webpage so if you do have a script on
your web page that's being sent to other
people that would be a persistent attack
you don't want to always have that on
there so you want to either find it
erase it or more safely back up the core
code to a previous state that's not
going to ruin your web pages and so
forth so yeah keep regular backups
always check for cross-site scripting
and ask people to report problems or
hacking attempts if necessary so I do
recommend a report option so those are
the basics of cross-site scripting and
now I'm just going to do a quick review
of everything that we have learned so in
review cross-site scripting is getting a
malicious code piece onto a website or
within a URL or so forth this will often
be done on trusted websites that have an
XSS vulnerability so if I can get a
malicious code onto a Facebook page or
something and other people view that
that's an example of cross-site
scripting and that's dangerous for
Facebook and all the people using
Facebook so the two main forms we talked
about so we're on persistent and
persistent
a non-persistent thing is going to be a
one-time thing that affects the stuff
here's your webpage this is the server
this is the client-side basically back
and front end the non-persistent is
going to affect the front end by either
having a search result submit that code
or a way to have that displayed on the
temporary client-side code the HTML the
JavaScript all the client-side code by
affecting that temporarily will have a
non persistent attack a persistent
attack actually affects database
information such as an about me on a
website if you can hide code in that
about me which other people are going to
view that's an example of a persistent
attack we also define these as this side
would be server and this side would be a
dawn attack do M so those are the basic
types of cross-site scripting a common
use of cross-site scripting is to steal
your session ID which will be sent
within a cookie so the session is stored
on the server which then gets sent to
the client the client has a cookie which
basically says all right this cookie is
connected to this session and it has a
session ID well if a hacker is able to
steal the session ID of another person
he can make requests to the server as
this person so we can figure out their
personal information and so forth um if
you make whoa whoa drop my trouble chalk
eraser so if you make a cross-site
scripting attack to where anyone
infected also puts that code on their
page or does something with that code
automatically using that script well
then you make a self-propagating code
attack so if it's self propagating that
means you have one person effect one
person or two people and then these
people also put that
code which this guy created on their
profile so this guy has this code the
little circles the code and when they
get affected by this code they don't
know this but they're also putting that
code in their profile and their profile
and each one of these people infect
people and you basically get this thing
which spreads around the social network
like wildfire because anyone viewing
these profiles gets affected and then
sooner or later over half the people on
the entire network are infected and it's
impossible to get away from the thing
but without just not using era was
looking for my eraser and it's all the
way over there because it flew so yeah
those as for prevention are the best way
to prevent it is to follow that
prevention guide and be careful on what
you allow people to submit Oh another
thing on prevention is to use I think
it's called white listing rather than
black listing so basically if you have a
form on a website
so where you submit stuff so let's say
this is a commons page which is going to
be displayed on your website you have
your name
you have your email and then you have
the actual comment well to check if this
content is correct you'll look at it and
say oh well this doesn't have any
malicious code so it must be good it
doesn't it doesn't I it's not in the
form of an email so it must be good well
that that would be black listing because
you're looking at all of the things that
it's not the better way to do it is to
look at all of the things that it is so
you would say okay is this in the form
of a name if it is it's good then this
email
don't check if it's not in the form of
something else check if it's in the form
of an email if it is it's good
as for the body don't check for oh yeah
you should check for HTML tags and all
this stuff too but make sure that the
comment has genuine information about
your website or a basically
look for things that make this what it
is not what it's not and if that doesn't
make sense don't worry about it's not
that big of a deal but that's it that's
another example of prevention a most
common way is to strip certain HTML tags
and change them into what's known as the
HTML and entity which a the other one I
used earlier I can never get this right
was this which is the HTML entity for
less than so that is the basics of
cross-site scripting hopefully that
video was helpful if you have any
questions please leave a comment and if
if you would like to help me please be
sure to subscribe to my channel and send
this to all your hacking friends or
whatever so yeah thank you for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
