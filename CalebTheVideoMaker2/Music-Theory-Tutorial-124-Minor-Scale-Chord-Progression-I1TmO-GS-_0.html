about minor scale chord progression so
typically we can do it in a major scale
in fact I don't even think I have done
in a minor scale yet and my hair looks
funky hmm it doesn't look as sexy as
usual that's odd
so anyways if we're in a minor scale
we're starting on a minor no a minor
scale for example AC e that is a minor
so basically we're going to build off
the a minor scale a minor scale is
conveniently all white notes show you
here
that's the a minor scale so you got a uh
well that's actually I changed from one
let's first create a C major chord
progression we have C major D minor E
minor F major G major a minor and then G
I mean B diminished
so that would be diminished now this is
the chord progression I'm trying to
drill in your brain for like the past
six thousand videos however long the
series is I don't even know
so anyways now what about a minor skip
focus what about a minor scales chord
progression well if you remember a minor
scale is relative to a major scale as it
uses the same notes for example the a
scale minor scale
uses all white keys conveniently enough
c-major uses all white keys this means
they are relative and to figure this out
we take the sixth of the scale degree
what does that mean well I'll show you
what that means
we got a C one two three four
whoa five six a so that tells us that a
is the relative minor which is because
they both use the same piece so that's
like starting right here one two three
four five six so this is in this case of
the a minor so let's continue the chord
progression once we reach the diminished
it repeats back to the beginning so we
get minor diminished major minor minor
major major I think that's right so what
would this be we would for starting on a
we would have a minor B diminished then
we would have C major honestly didn't
see make more sense C major D minor this
would be e minor oh I keep making
mistakes D minor E minor F major and G
major my battery's low oh no I might be
leaving soon but it's just starting on a
different one so we still have minor
diminished major minor minor major major
we're just starting on the minor so now
we have this
basically we're just taking this moving
it over here and starting from there
reach back to the beginning same as I
said earlier the first one always points
to the fourth and fifth that's what we
used to be major I'm sorry F major and G
major</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
