video I wanted to talk about a new
database design program website that I
found I literally just found it like 15
minutes ago so don't judge me if I know
like nothing about it but anyways I just
want to share it because I thought it'd
be really useful for a lot of you guys
alright so it's called Verta bellow I
think it's pronounced that I'm not
entirely sure the ER ta be elo comm and
what you can do is you can try it now
for free once you get there you don't
have to create an account or anything
but I already creating accounts really
easy so I'm just gonna log in and when
you first get there the cool thing about
this is you're not just limited to a
MySQL for example like when I did my
MySQL workbench see error video you can
do all these different relational or
these all these different database
management systems oh there is one thing
though they do have free accounts and
then they have paid accounts so for
example will form ask from SQL if you
want to create a table from SQL you have
to be either professional or enterprise
account so the free the free accounts
you can have up to three models right
now and 20 tables per model so I can
just I'll just show you it's like okay
so subscribe int int and then we'll just
start with an empty diagram so nothing
already created alright so this is what
it looks like it's a lot of stuff at
once but it's pretty simple over here on
the Left we have the model structure
which tells us everything we have our
tables our references and then over here
on the right we have all of our
information about our stuff in our
database so we can first things first we
can click add new table boom right there
we can move it around and then over here
on the information we have a new table
that we can change the settings so for
example user ID and then I you can play
the description here if you really want
to do okay my bad that'd be the table so
you'd want that to a user and then we
can add a column make it user ID
and primarykey I know we could go into
more detail but I mean it's fine how it
is now but if you want you can have it
like set specifically the storage method
and then you can comment on it or
anything like that but I'm just gonna
leave how it is and I'm gonna add
another column just make it user name
and we'll just make that like let's see
bar char let's go for tea that's pretty
big but it work so that's this example
of what we can do and then we can create
another table and in here we'll just let
us say this is a table that needs a
foreign key to the user ID and what we
can do is we can just say add a column
just make it user ID oh another thing
real quick before I do this if you
create if you create a relationship
before you have a column it'll it'll
automatically create that column for you
which can be good or bad in some
instances but see here we assign me do
that so here we have it created user
user ID which I mean I I like to name
them the same thing but that will be
foreign key pointing back to user ID
it's a one-to-many relationship so
that's one thing you can do and then
over here on our model structure we have
our tables and let's see we also have
our references so if we click on
references it'll bring that up and it'll
give us extra information so user ID
from the user table is the primary key
user ID from table 2 is the foreign key
and then we can say if that's able to be
null or not
so yeah that's some things you can do
you can also do some database just in
general modification which I'm trying to
figure out how I had to do that it's the
way I look around real quick
well if you want to change like the
engine for a user for the specific day
where you can do that and you can
basically you can decide if you want to
set that or not and then um what you can
do is you can leave this model and it'll
be saved and it's online so you can
access it anywhere which I just think is
like super awesome so you can reopen it
and it picks up right where you left off
you have to worry about losing your data
from a crash or anything like that so
here we can get some model details and
if you want to delete the model you can
do that and you can also do other things
like generate an image or clone it or
view the diagram you can also go to
additional properties and this will give
us the defaults for everything within
this model so if you want by default the
table engine to be in ODB for example
then you could do that and then you can
save that and that's what it will be
whenever you create a new table so you
go back to your models you can open that
or you if you want you could preview
that and see what that looks like so
this is a preview where you don't really
get to edit anything but here you can
view all of the information and you can
also go back to the diagram which allows
you to edit it so yeah I think that's
pretty awesome another cool thing is it
has a magic of some integration with
scouting so you can have additional SQL
scripts and you can have SQL previews
telling you the structure yeah so yeah
that's just an example so this would be
the SQL used to create this table which
can help you learn SQL if you're weak at
it or you can just use it for simplicity
sake so you have to type roll up
yourself you can also do some other
things generate SQL scripts you audio I
haven't really looked at any of that but
I'm sure you can do some cool stuff for
some pictures or XML so yeah that's all
I really have to say about this I want
you guys to go check it out and let me
know what you think if it's useful yeah
and there's also like you
invite people if you really want and get
some some money but I mean he really
cares you have to invite him by email
but yeah if you want to look into that
you can go to invite people and you can
put their email here and a little
message and basically you get like if
you invite someone and they become a
professional realtor enterprise account
you get 50 bonus points and basically
every 100 bonus points is the equivalent
to a hundred dollars so I mean it's not
bad if you're good at inviting people
when they buy stuff so yeah another cool
thing they have problems down here so
you can figure out how to fix that stuff
so like obviously this table should have
a primary key which it doesn't right now
and then this one you should change
default table name because table two is
a pretty stupid name so yeah that's it
that's just an example oh that's that's
kind of weird the many-to-many something
that goes house weird I mean one too
many all right well yeah that's allowed
to say so thank you for watching and let
me know what you think and let me know
if you'd like any more videos over any
kind of videos because I'm open to
anything
alright so catch you later and be sure
to subscribe like seriously come on guys
to subscribe please how many times I
have to ask you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
