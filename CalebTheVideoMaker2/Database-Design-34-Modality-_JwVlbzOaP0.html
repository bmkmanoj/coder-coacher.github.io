database design series I just dropped my
chalk in this video we're going to be
talking about modality which is
basically a continuation of the last
video so be sure to watch that you
haven't seen that already so a lot of
these design concepts you've already
learned from previous videos in this
series but now I'm talking about the
technical terms for drawing them out
when we're actually drawing our database
because we can think about our database
all we want but it's not really going to
be effective until we actually draw it
out so we can see how things are worked
or connected and then we can program it
from there so yeah first I'd like to
explain the concepts then I like to
explain design concepts and then I like
to explain actually turning that into a
database which we're not going to be
covering much in this video because this
is database design but yeah I have a
MySQL tutorial series if you're
interested in that and we might be doing
some more after this one so let's get
let's get started because it's already
been a minute medalie
is basically whether or not the child is
a required chart that the relationship
is required we talked about that when we
talked about the column characteristic
um not null so think of it like this we
have a credit card company we have a
table for the card holder and then we
have a table for the card obviously the
card holder the ID for the card holder
the person who owns the card or buys the
card from the credit card company
they're going to have an ID and that's
going to be a not null column meaning it
has to have a value that is obvious
because it's going to be the primary key
surrogate primary key and it has to have
a value so we have like this guy and he
has an ID of seven we have another guy
with the ID of 12 and then 368 and so
forth those are ID sizi card
that is going to have a column which is
a foreign key referencing the cardholder
because the card is the child in this
relationship so the cardholder has the
primary key you see that down there as
you can card is going to have a foreign
key which connects to these so this is
going to be a foreign key meaning these
are the people that own the certain card
so we have a card with the ID of 12 we
have a card with the idea of 48 I'm just
making up numbers right here in the card
with the ID of 98 we have a card of the
ID of 112 well they each have an owner
you see this is the owner and this is a
foreign key which references the primary
key so 7 this card is going to be owned
by that person
7 this card is going to be owned by that
person 7 this card is going to be owned
by that person so all these 3 cars are
owned by that person 368 that's going to
be owned by somebody else now if we gave
this column right here the foreign key
the basically the cardholder column
because it's a child if we gave it the
column characteristic not null it would
be required that every single row has an
owner that means we can't have a card in
here that is either not activated and
doesn't have an owner or we can't have a
card in there that is not being
currently possessed by a cardholder
because you think you get a credit card
somebody owns that credit card but when
you first make a credit card or
something or if you Rebecca if if you
get rid of the credit card or something
it might be a credit card that currently
does not have an owner does that make
sense so basically just a credit card
that's not being actively used or as a
disabled or something like that and does
not have a card border well if we wanted
us to if we wanted this database to be
able to store cards that don't have
owners we would not want the not null
characteristic because that's going to
provide
so that's kind of how that works so if
we take that off then we could have a
card down here with the ID of 101 that
doesn't have a car down well I know
we've already explained this all but now
let's talk about design so let's just
make this simple and pay attention to
the say say one cart well this obviously
is going we're going to talk about a a
one-to-many relationship meaning one
cardholder owns many cards and we're
also going to be talking about a
one-to-one relationship meaning one card
owner owns one card if we want to do a
many-to-many we just need an
intermediary table the same concept kind
of applies but we don't necessarily have
to go through that just break it into a
one-to-many to do one-to-many
relationships all right so let's try
this so we have over here we have the
table that's going to be the card owner
over here we have the table for the
cards and there's a relationship between
these two that's a really big gap but
whatever so let's start over here we can
say one card water because that's what
we're just going to say one card order
for each time let me bring this in so
they can actually see one card water can
have one card so what we just did is
cardinality we talked about this in the
last video now let's do another example
what's do the same thing you'll see why
in a second
let's do another example and then
finally one more example run out of room
here so we have the basic relationships
now we can add one more thing to say if
it's notable or not
notable basically does the child this is
the child which is the card we're asking
does it does the foreign key column have
the not null characteristic that's so we
have the possible relationships one to
one oops one to many
now what we're going to do is we're able
to add the modality in and the way we do
that is we add either a little circle or
a little dash or you can think of it as
a 0 or a 1 which actually will make
sense and we'll see why in a second 0 or
a 1 so over here we have the card holder
1 card holder for all these examples and
then over here we have the card a 0
means the column does not have the not
null characteristic meaning it accepts
no value so this is saying it can accept
no value so we have a one-to-one
relationship that's the maximum the card
order can have up to one card but it's
not required so 0 or 1 cards 1 or 1
cards 0 at least 0 cards because you
have up to many or at least one card so
this means not no not no now when we
design this we're talking generally from
table to table so we would have card
water
and then carve and why do I have to say
that basically because if we have it if
we have a zero here that means there's
not necessarily going to be relationship
between a certain row so when we're
talking about rows we might not actually
draw a relationship between certain rows
when we draw relationships we talk from
table to table and those relationships
explain what rows can have relationships
with different rows so in this example
let's just focus on the top one just to
make it easier we would draw this within
our database application you would say
we have the table card order and then
that has some kind of relationship with
the table card now we could say one card
order can have 0 up to 1 relationships
with one individual card so we have a
card holder with the ID of 7 and then we
have an ID a card with the ID of 68
owned by the card holder 7 so that
points back and that's acceptable we
could also have a card we could have a
card 69 and we could have a person 8 and
we could say oh it doesn't have an owner
that's fine we could have another card
70 and it can have the owner 8 which
points back to 8 and then we can have
another person which would be 87 we
could have a card we could have a card
on 63 which Lee has the owner of 87 and
that points back to the owner 87 so
that's how those relationships work now
that first this can be kind of confusing
so just practice make sure you fully
understand how each one works just
review we could have
four possibilities we could have can we
put that one up there makes more sense
one cardholder can have zero or one card
one card holder can have one only one
card because you can have one the least
and then up to one and then you have one
card holder zero or more and then one
card holder one or more these two are
required meaning every single child has
to have an owner or every single card
has seven owner every single child has
to have a parent so FLE that'll makes
good sense
I've have any questions believe please
leave me a comment and I will see you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
