four different ways signal are makes
real-time applications I want to talk
about why we should use signal are
instead of just picking one of the lists
now if you didn't see the last video the
way signal R works is it picks one of
four of the most popular technologies
used to make real-time apps we have
WebSockets event source forever frame
and long pooling you guys are testing my
memory here now why not just use
WebSockets directly instead of using
signal art why do we need to add an
extra layer of complication to make it
work well there's a lot of great reasons
and that's what we're going to be
discussing here well the first reason I
have is that when you create an app
using signal are all of the four
different technologies that we talked
about are implemented that means you
really only need to understand one and
you get the power of four versus
learning just one of the four well if
for some reason that one doesn't work
you have to go to a different one so
that's why I think signal R is great
because you only have to learn one way
and it'll figure out the rest another
reason is that if like WebSockets gets a
new feature or is updated a little bit
well if your applications programmed and
WebSockets you might have to go and
change some things or whatever like that
but if you're using signal are all those
changes are going to be combined into
the the usage of signal art you know you
don't have to worry about each little
technology changing because signal R is
going to deal with that and make your
application work the same way with the
code you already have you understand I'm
saying like if you've implemented signal
art and all the technologies change as
long as you're using signal our signal
art is going to give you the right
results it's great right the next reason
is that signal R is an abstraction now
what is an abstraction an abstraction is
basically a simplified way to work with
something think of like a computer to
use a computer you don't have to
understand electricity you
have to understand binary or computer
programming all you got to know how to
do is plug it in and turn the on button
press it not turn it and let's lets you
have a turnable on button that'd be kind
of cool that's an abstraction if you
want the more detailed stuff if you want
to get into circuitry you can you just
gotta open the tower and dig around but
you don't have to that's an abstraction
signal art works the same way and that
you don't need to understand how it's
working you just do it it separates us
from the lower-level junk so here's a
layer right and let's say farther down
is closer to binary binary is like the
lowest you can get like zero one zero
one one zero one which if you want to
learn that stuff I have videos over it
the farther up higher level is more like
HTML and CSS and somewhere in the middle
you might have like c-sharp and then C
there's different layers of how low
level something is well signal R is
higher up meaning we don't need to
understand any of this lower stuff we
just make a signal R function or method
or whatever and it works that's why it's
cool the next reason I got is that
signal R is more cross compatible by
that I mean it works in more browsers
and it also works on other things such
as phone apps it's not always just for
websites you can create a back-end that
will feed your website and your phone
app and you only have one back-end
that's why it's cool it's not as easy to
do that kind of stuff with WebSockets
and all those other technologies lastly
it's easy that's the best reason you can
seriously pick up this and make some
cool apps in just a few days like it's
easy so that's all I got for this video
I'll see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
