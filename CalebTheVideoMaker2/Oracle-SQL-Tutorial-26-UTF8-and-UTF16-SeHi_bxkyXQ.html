Caleb's video make it to this video we
are going to be talking about utf-8 and
utf-16 for the oracle unicode character
sets now these are examples of encoding
there are multiple options for unicode
character sets when it comes to the
encoding z' these are just two of them
there are a couple of other ones but
these are two of the most commonly used
ones especially when it comes to Oracle
database another very first one I'm
going to be talking about is utf-8 which
is an example of a variable length
encoding what this means is that when we
are determining how much room a
character takes up on a computer it
depends on what character it is an
individual character at minimum will
take up one byte i--but is the smallest
thing a computer can store and a byte is
eight of those now some characters are
going to take up one byte that's because
we can only store so many characters and
eight bits after that the characters are
going to take up two bytes which means
it takes 16 bits to express that
character and so forth so it's going to
go to three bits when it runs out of
room for that and then four bits so they
give like a 30-second crash course on
storage a bit has two states you could
say on or off and some people will say 1
or 0 so if you have 8 bits you'd have
something like this you can say 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 T and then this can be interpreted
as some character now if you want to
know how much storage that really is you
can compare it to some storage sizes you
know of so for example a thousand and
twenty four fights is one kilobyte 1024
kilobytes is one megabyte a thousand and
24 megabytes is 1 gigabyte 1024
gigabytes is one terabyte a thousand and
24 terabytes is one petabyte so when you
buy a one terabyte hard drive you can
store a crap-ton of bytes that being
said when you have a string it can store
a lot of characters you could put
thousands of characters within a quote
and that can actually add up to a a lot
of space when we're talking about
millions of rows that means optimizing
storage when it comes to strings is
pretty important not so important when
you're working with a small database but
when your work
with huge databases the difference
between one byte per character can make
a ton of difference and what I mean by
one byte per character is that some
encoding will always take two bytes per
character in that situation even if you
have a character where UTF would only
use one byte it's going to use two bytes
so imagine something like this it might
not be exactly like that but essentially
we have 16 bytes but only eight of those
are being used and it's a waste of space
now if you think back to when we created
a table and we had datatypes we did
something like this and then inside of
parentheses we put 50 char the reason we
put char here is a little bit more clear
now that we've talked about encoding
that's because some characters could
take four bytes for example so if you're
expecting something like 50 characters
but each character takes one to four
bytes you're not going to get 50
characters in some situations some
situations you may if all of the
characters only take a one byte so for
example if you're using English the
chances are you're getting 50 bytes but
the chances are that's still going to be
50 characters but if you're storing an
Asian language the data is not going to
take up one byte per character and
you're not going to get 50 characters
out of this other database management
systems will always default to
characters so for example in my SQL you
could say something like this and in
this situation I'm not specifying char
that's because by default this is 50
characters but Oracle is different in
that you can specify char to force 50
characters that's because the default
here is actually bytes okay so moving on
to utf-16 now utf-16 is also a variable
length encoding the difference here is
that it's variable between 2 or 4 bytes
that means if we're storing a character
like a it's still going to take us 2
bytes even if that's not needed so
utf-16 can take up a lot more stores
when we are working with English that
being said these do not line up exactly
the same and in fact utf-8 will usually
take 3 bytes for Asian characters
whereas utf-16
we'll take two bites for Asian
characters so if you're working with a
lot of Asian characters utf-16 might
actually save you space so it really
depends on your situation so that's a
perk for utf-16 but utf-8 is what's
known as a superset of ascii and what
that means is if this was utf-8 ASCII is
right here if you're working with an
application that's using ASCII and you
want to convert it to unicode utf-8 is
going to be your best bet because the
characters of ascii directly correlate
to the characters of utf-8 but utf-16
works better with Java programming and
microsoft.net so which one are you
supposed to use well you just have to
weigh the pros and cons and think about
what situation you're using it for and
that'll help you make a decision if
you're just working with small
applications generally it doesn't really
matter that much because the size
differences are small unless you're
dealing with a whole whole whole lot of
text data so yeah guys that's all I have
to say about unicode for right now
hopefully that was helpful and in the
next video we are going to be talking
about char and n char and now that we
know all this crap it'll be a little bit
easier to discuss the differences so
thank you so much everyone I really
appreciate you guys watching my videos
