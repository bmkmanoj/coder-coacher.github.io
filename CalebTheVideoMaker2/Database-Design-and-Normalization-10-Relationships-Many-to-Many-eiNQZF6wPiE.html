housed on the table for authors okay now
we have a book called physics master in
physics mastering physics could have
been written by let's say Jim and Joe
Jim could have wrote mastering physics
so good Joe
cuz they could have work together it
made a team work and split the income
block of all that stuff now we have
another book over here
mastery apology yeah that's it
biology so Jim could have written two
books I mean an author isn't limited to
only writing one book in their lifetime
that would be ridiculous so Jim can
write more than one book and a book can
be written by more than one person that
is a many-to-many think of it like this
mastering books could have gone to Jim
or Joe these guys could have worked
together to both both of them so that is
many-to-many because Jim could have also
worked on mastering biology by himself
it's a many-to-many the thing about many
to many relationships is you want to
avoid them when designing a database
because many to many relationships can
make a ton of redundant useless
confusing information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
