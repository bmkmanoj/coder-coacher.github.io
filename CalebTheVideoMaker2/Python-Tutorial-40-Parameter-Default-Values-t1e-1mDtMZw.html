video I'm going to be telling you how to
make default values for functions so
what that means is that for a certain
parameter if if a person uses this
function or calls this function and does
not provide a value then it will go to a
default value so a long time ago we made
a little tip calculator like if you go
out to eat and you want to tip like 15%
well I'm going to be replicating that
but I'm going to be giving some default
values for the tip a default value an
awesome just it's just one value so to
do this we can just go def tip so we're
defining a function and we named it tip
you can name it whatever you like but
I'm gonna name a tip and then we we
label our two variables so we have tip
meal and then tip all right and then we
return and what are we going to return
we're going to return the tip value so
in order to figure that out we take the
meal we multiply it whoops by and then
you put this in parenthesis tip divided
by 100 that will make tip divided by 100
first before it's multiplied by meal so
let's just see how this would work let's
say I provided 10 for the meal and then
15 or like 10 for the meal and 10 for
the tip well 10 for the tip like 10%
divided by 100 would be 0.1 and then 10
times point 1 is 1 so it would be a $1
tip that's how this mathematical thing
works math net math and problem works
all right so then what we can do is we
can print oops sorry I can't type
gosh nascent typing lessons my keyboard
is like really low it's like down by my
waist under a desk could I stand when I
record these so it's like really
confusing but anyways we can print and
then what we can print is the function
tip and we can give it a value
such as ten and then we could say tip is
ten save that run it and you can see we
have a $1 tip now what if we try it
again with ten rather than ten we're
going to give a 30% tip f5 to run that
and it gives us three dollars so let's
try it with a $100 meal should be thirty
dollars you see now what we can do is
provide a default value because if you
see if I forget to give the tip here and
say it and save it and run it you see it
gives me an error well some people might
just want to automatically always use
like 20% as their tip no matter what and
they don't have to put that in every
single time so when you're defining the
function you can put tip and then assign
it the value whatever you want it to be
now what we can do is we can print tip
100 and that's going to give us 20% of
120 bucks ok well that's cool but now
since we have a default what if we
wanted to actually change it back to
like 15 well thankfully we can actually
override it well simply by putting
whatever numbers we want if we wanted to
give 30% instead run that you can see it
increases the value so this this
assignment only takes effect it's only
going to be this number is only going to
be used if we do not assign a value
ourself so if we wanted we could assign
a value a default value for the meal
let's just say 50 so now what I can do
is I can just print within here I can
just print a tip like that save that and
run that and you can see it prints ten
dollars twenty percent of fifty dollars
so that is how that works now there's a
couple things to realize we can do other
things like what if what if
what if we only wanted to provide a tip
value what we could do is within calling
this function we could say tip has the
value 600 so we're giving 600 percent of
our meal well that's a $300 tip because
600 percent of $50 is 300 the reason we
had to use this tip is it has the sorry
the reason we had to use tip and the
assignment operator 600 is because if we
didn't it would assume that the meal
price is 600 if we just do this well
it's going to give that front value to
the first parameter within the function
definition so if we just wanted a meal
of $60 and a tip of $20 here's how we
would do that and you can see it works
perfectly fine but if we want to assign
a value to a specific parameter what we
have to do is we have to apply that now
I know it's probably a bad idea to use
tip as the function name and for the
variable but basically this would be
this is this is the variable with the
2-piece now so now you can clearly see
tip with two peas is the value in tip
with the one beet is the actual function
so we call tip and then we assign a
value to the variable tip tip huh all
right so that's just the basics of
assigning default values to functions
this can be very useful if you have like
a lot of parameters with a bunch of
stuff that most people aren't going to
use unless they really need it you can
assign a default such as true or one or
a hundred or whatever it is and that's
going to make a lot of your programs run
more smoothly so like you don't have to
define every single little detail of
every single function because functions
can get pretty complex but you don't
always want them to have to be complex
with default values you can have a we
could have a function that can function
as a very simple function or as a very
complex function
it works like a complex function but if
you only give it a couple values well
then it will just give you default
values and use those instead or like if
you wanted to store data for example and
one of your attributes I'm sorry one of
your parameters was like a fax number
well not everyone has a fax number so
someone could leave that blank and it
could default to no Sat a no fax number
no sax number yeah all right guys thank
you for watching hopefully this video
was useful and I'll see you all in the
next video thank you guys so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
