oracle SQL tutorial series the last
video we talked about constraints and I
kind of gave you the simplified easy
version and only takes a couple keywords
but it has its downsides one of the
biggest downsides is that with that
method you can't name your constraints
and a lot of people like to name their
constraints that way they can refer to
them by name so that's one goal of this
video the other goal is just kind of
think through the different ways of
creating constraints because when you
make them it seems like there's so many
different ways to do it I'm going to
piece it out very simple so that way you
can know exactly what the different
options are yeah just got a $5 donation
Veronica you are very sweet I really
appreciate it
we are going to start with a create
table statement that looks a little
something like this
so we have a table users and has a
column user ID and a data type of number
now this doesn't actually have any
constraints here but we want to create a
primary key so the way you did that in
the previous videos is you just add the
keyword right after primary key pretty
simple so this is what it would look
like now if you want to name the
constraint you have to type two extra
words I know it's crazy I can't believe
they're asking that much of us so within
here you're going to write constrain and
then you're going to give it a name so
it'll look a little something like this
and we'll give it a name of users
underscore PK for primary key and I'm
just going to continue this line on the
next line yes guys I know my handwriting
has not gotten any better over the
course of these years probably never
will be so as you can see it's basically
the exact same thing except it's totally
different you have these two new words
here constraint and then the title or
the the name of the constraint so far
we've learned two different ways to make
constraints these were both made at the
column level that means right after the
column and we had two different
possibilities one named and one
unmade the other possibility is actually
not at the column level it's at the
table level and what that means is we
basically take this entire constraint
and put it in the table as if it was its
own column now it's not actually its own
column
but syntactically that's the way it
looks like we put user ID number comma
and then we put the constraint on a new
line so you can say that is created at
the table level I really recommend you
take a look at this and memorize it so
that way you can kind of understand
three main different ways of creating
constraints from simple to complex this
is the easiest unnamed then this is
medium and then table level is the most
complex but a lot of people like to do
it at the table level so it really just
depends on what you prefer and if you
work for a company what they prefer so
to do this it's really simple all you
got to do is take the command you have
bring it you I mean you don't have to
bring it down to the next line
theoretically we could just put a comma
here since whitespace doesn't really
matter and then put parentheses after it
and you have to say what column you want
this primary key to be on because we
moved it down to the table level it's no
longer associated with one column so we
have to tell it so that way it knows
because we can't just say hey make a
primary key and it's just supposed to
know which column we want it to be on so
this is how you do it with a primary key
with different constraints is going to
be slightly different but you guys get
the big picture of how there's mainly
three different ways you can do things
so that's it guys we've broken through
the conceptual gap that's needed to
really write good constraints in the
next video we are going to make a named
constraint for our user table that's
going to be sweet so we're going to get
some more programming experience or
databasing experience whatever you want
to call it and that's going to be fun so
if you really enjoy the series please go
on to the next video click like
subscribe share it with your friends and
all that good stuff thanks guys really
appreciate it and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
