believe this is your seventh PHP
tutorial I believe yeah I'm pretty sure
so in this video I want to talk about
variables so in any programming language
I mean there might be one out there that
doesn't I'm sure there is but almost any
programming language you're ever going
to use will have variables they're very
common very important you will use them
a lot so what is a variable well a
variable temporarily or I guess you'd
say stores and temporary value so for
example in math you may have math math
classes where they'll be like x equals
five and you can figure that out from an
equation like 2x well that's 2 times X
or if you put 5 in for X you get 2 times
5 the answer is 10 and you can do that
backwards to try and figure out the
variable so I'm sure some of you have
done that that's a variable it just
stores a temporary value by temporary I
mean you can update it you can change it
and so forth as the program develops
well why are variables important well
you could always just be like echo yo um
okay a little bit onto our website well
unfortunately not everybody is named
Caleb actually that'd be kind of weird
so fortunately not everybody's named
Caleb so you're not going to know ahead
of time what this person's name is going
to be in this program so at the variable
instead you can do something like yo
name and we'll get into naming variables
in a second well now this is going to
take name figure out what it is and
because the value of name
caleb in this case it's going to say yo
Caleb but this this can change it could
be Alex and then well now you don't have
to change any of your code it all stays
the same in the program still works so
it makes things easier for the
programmers and it allows us to make
dynamic websites that change using
variables basically when we don't know
the value of something it can also be
used to shorthand things so for example
I could assign multiple names and
combine them together into one variable
and then use small blog go you can do a
lot of stuff for the variables so how do
we name variables well I'm sure you
guessed you can't just use any name in
the entire world so you have to follow a
set of rules so if you want to figure
out if you can use a certain variable
name all you have to do is just take
this equation here alright so you figure
out a variable name you like right and
then you subtract the spaces I'm kidding
guys that's hilarious okay anyway we
have a few big basic rules we start with
a dollar sign don't know why but it's
cool then you can have numbers letters
and underscores and you can have them
pretty much in any order although you
can't start with a number I think you
have to start with either a letter or an
underscore one of the most important
things though is that variables are
what's known as case-sensitive
this means a is not equal to lowercase a
there are different letters in PHP s
mind so this is this is very important
so if we have two variables by say name
well guess what that's different than
nave so if you're having errors in your
program search the program press ctrl F
type in some variable names and see if
you have two different ones that are
miss capitalize because if I reference
this that that doesn't okay so like
let's say somebody puts a value in Caleb
for this one and then I echo this one
well guess what it doesn't have a value
it doesn't work out right so you got to
make sure you don't screw that up make
sure you're always using consistent
names and we actually have consistent
patterns and it's all lowercase that's
what's the typical and if there's a
space in the word but the variable name
we use an underscore so I could use
first-name and this is not going to work
because we must start it with a dollar
sign so this is a valid variable in jobs
not JavaScript PHP gosh I'm trying to
teach too many things at once so that's
cool all so what else we can learn how
to define variables well to do that we
just say the variable name
and we set it equal to something so
variable name that's that's what you
change so another example would be Yolo
oh so that's another variable so you can
change that and then you can just assign
it something all right so what what does
the assignment consists of well it
consists of an equal sign this right
here is known as the assignment off
riddle ah yeah I think it's ER operates
or oh my goodness why am I so stupid I
can't spell I just I just can't
so assignment operator it's not saying
the equivalent of so it's different than
that so basically five equals five
that's incorrect this is the assignment
operator that's like trying to say five
has the value of five and we're trying
to use this as a variable well that's
that's not a variable so that's not
correct
so that's known as the assignment
operator then we have the value so we
could have main here's the variable name
here's the assignment operator and then
we have the value Yolo
well you know I'm saying that I hate
that word but anyways this is our value
and in some some programming languages
for those of you who are experienced you
may have had to had you may have had to
say what data type it is such as int but
PHP doesn't require you to do that
don't break I was broke my brand-new
chalk I would cry and you can change the
route
so there's another few things when
assigning that you can be aware of you
can use single quotes so I could be like
yo equals hey as you can see this is are
both double quotes but I could have also
done hey
and I could have done within quotes I
put a number five and then without
quotes I could have put a number so
here's a number without quotes here's
the number with quotes those are
essentially different one is a number
and the other is a string so this and
this are two different things to PHP and
they will be treated differently so we
can't confuse those make sure you got
that one understood and that one
understood and we'll be learning more
about that once we get into different
types of data types like int or string
or numbers or arrays those are known as
data types and if you don't know much
about those don't worry about it school
so yeah I think that I think that's I
think that's all I got to say so yes
please subscribe i'm support me and
whatnot and I will support you so see
you in the next video thank you and
