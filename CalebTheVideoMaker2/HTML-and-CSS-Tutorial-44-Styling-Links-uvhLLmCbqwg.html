your series this video we're going to be
talking about styling links so the first
thing we're going to do is create an
unordered list where we can put some
links in it so I'm going to put this at
the very beginning of our div here div
long so to do this it's very simple
hopefully you remember we create
unordered list tags like this just get
some extra space and then within here we
can make list items and the list item
and then within the list item we make a
anchor tag and looks like this so this
is our setup duplicate that for four
times or so and then within the a anchor
tags is the text so home page we can say
videos blog posts guide on how to be
Studley handsome as Caleb yeah that's
not gonna happen no I'm just kidding
alright that's a little too long so
guide handsome as Caleb yeah handsome
Caleb there we go handsome Caleb alright
so now we can also add a little CSS I'm
not going to use a whole lot and now I'm
just gonna do something new we can
affect the list items and we can put a
display equals inline which is going to
put them in a across the border at the
top and I guess took that like adding 10
pixels yeah that looks pretty good and
then I could say padding left equals
zero pixels let's just go all the way
around set top zero pixels right zero
pixels
and right would be ten pixels and then
bottom zero pixels five pixels here and
zero pixels so that's what we get so
here is our page as you can see I mean
it's just basic I'm not trying to blow
anybody's mind with all my awesome
skills because if AB you case it
wouldn't be working font size equals 30
pixels there we go so now we have a
basic link system which obviously I
don't work right now but I want to
recognize we could put pretty much
anything here to a link so say that so
that's an unvisited link obviously it's
not going to take us anywhere special it
probably won't even work yeah see
thankfully it didn't work be like some
weird virus website so it's just for yep
let's as you can see just gonna stop
talking now I'm going to add random
links here basically places we've been
within so now they're all blue right so
when you click on them you've visited
that page and they don't take us
anywhere because we didn't configure
them to take us to a proper website so
they're always going to be blue makes
sense so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a website that you can
actually visit youtube.com forward slash
okay like your tool all right so now
videos there we go just a little slow
it's okay oh my gosh look at that
awesome video right there there it is 53
views that's actually pretty good
refresh so now videos is purple-ish so
yeah that is the basic of making links
but I still want to do a little bit more
we can change our links by axe by
referencing the links in our CSS so what
tag would it be obviously
going to be the anchor tech because
that's how I create a link so to do that
okay then little curly braces and then
there's as we talked about before
there's four options there's normal
visited and then hover which we have
actually haven't even talked about hover
and active actives when you click it so
normals blue visit it as purple and
active is red so let's let's uh let's go
yeah let's go to do this we could say I
think I'm not sure how I want to style
these style these we have to do
something special it's called a pseudo
element so don't freak out but it's
simple a colon and then we can type what
we want to affect so visited now we're
affecting the visited we could say color
then we could say FFF number sign so
that's white so when we visit it it
disappears we could lower that so we
could say hey now I got this light blue
let's go eight seven seven so that's a
light green and then if we want to make
it a little darker we could either lower
these so like this
five five just forgot the point so
that's a darker green or I can make this
nine nine five to see good point we're
just changing the color of this so we
can create all four of these so we can
create in a normal a visited we already
have that one a active and a cover we're
going to change the color of all of
these just to keep it simple but you can
use all the other tags you would
normally use so you can increase the
text size or make them do fancy things
when it's normal I want it to be blue so
just like it is I like the blue when
it's active which one you're hovering
over it I want it to be
color equals cyan when you hover over it
I want it to be color equals red always
remember to put the end-goal semicolon
save it and so now this is what we get
we hover over it turns red when we act
when we click when it's active well
that's not working right now so I must
have did something wrong but active is
when you click on it hey there we go so
for some reason it's active funky well
we could probably because of the hover
if I get rid of the hover and save it
and refresh it when I click it it turns
blue so for some reason the hover is
messing that up all right so that that's
just an example of some of the things
you can do we can change all of these so
we could say font size equals 40 pixels
so when you visit it all right let me
think let me go back alright just to
correct a few mistakes
it's not a normal should be a link so
that's when it's normal but yeah it
worked fine how it was and I don't know
how to get the font size working so we
have it up here which is overridden by
this stuff down you here you set up a
base down here
all right gas so we have the visited
then we have link and reactive now I
want to say a little bit about the font
size here this is not going to work
because this is within the list item
font size 30
so that's affected here 70 pixels so now
that's like that oops so yeah that's all
I really have to say about styling links
you can do a lot with it and I shall see
you in the next video so be sure to
