is I'm cleaning up this mess because I
can't even read half this stuff
it's huge mess so yeah that's what I'll
do now alright it's a lot cleaner now by
clean I mean just shove everything in
the corner sort of like how I clean my
room
but yeah hello so next obviously I'm
gonna fix this cuz I don't like it you
can see if these IDs are not at the top
and that just bugs me so I'm gonna do
that and boom now we're consistent next
thing favourite book that is actually
going to be a foreign key related to all
this book and from information over here
so let's do that now first it said - it
ain't so favourite book just type it in
it'll pop to it
we set the standard book ID foreign keys
Mian capitalizes I don't like that
this goes to books which is right there
and then we select it favor book ID
which goes to the book ID just like that
now you can see these are connected and
I'm going to go over my columns and I'm
going to drag that to the top up here
okay so we're getting a little farther
now I'm going to look through this and
see what you need to do just wait just
go through each column and see what's
wrong
school ID major ID minor D those are all
correct because we just went through
this best friend's first name best
friend's last name those are atomic
nothing to it
hair color that's good dog's name
birthday now birthday that could be
broken up into like birthday year
birthday birth month but I'm not going
to do that because I think that's stupid
dog's name that could be an issue
because a person could have more than
one dog and also I mean a dog name could
be used millions of times but see I
don't figure that the dog name will be
repeated a lot of times so I don't see
it necessary to make a whole nother
table listing all the possible dog's
names
I actually feel that's a waste and if a
person needs to add more than one dog
well I'd say it too bad and change this
so you can only insert one dog I don't
know if that's selfish but if you want
to make it so you can do that then you
just need to make a new table listing
the best friends and then the best
friends dogs and also you can do it for
the students too so you could have the
dogs table tied to the best friends and
the students so but that's not what I'm
doing
one of your dogs names that will solve a
lot of effort and time and for this
college
I don't feel they need to know more than
one dog's name and I'm going to do the
same thing over here yeah
more dogs names
now that that's done I'll continue what
I was doing all these IDs those are
correct
first-name lastname that's fine birthday
fine hair color that's good one of your
dog's name that's correct
relationship status you could make a
table with all the possible relationship
statuses but there's really only like a
few I mean like you know I'm saying so
making a whole nother table I feel it's
a waste and that's normalizing too far
and will actually lower the quality of
your database now next thing a
top-selling car that that's that's where
when you just fix something because
that's a third normal form violation and
the reason for that is this is not
related to the student ID this is non
reliant this is also a second normal
form okay let me explain the top-selling
car as a second normal form violation
the year of sales is a third normal form
violation that is because top-selling
car is not reliant on student ID and
year of sales is reliant on top-selling
car so that's how that works so what you
need to do is create a new table and
insert these into that and oh would you
look at that I already did it
how convenient so here's what we have
now and we list all the top selling cars
information and know what we do is just
get rid of it in here because it's not
related at all
and boom that's what we have now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
