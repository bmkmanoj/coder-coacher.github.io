be about embellishing and chord
substitution so it's also going to be a
lot of review as you can see there's a
lot of stuff here that we have already
talked about and I'm going to be talking
about all of these again and put it into
this context of embellishing and chord
substitutions so what's embellishing
embellishing is making something more
attractive by designing it or adding
more to it so basically in music
embellishing is messing with the notes
in courts such as altered chords and
extended cords and cords substitution to
make the music more entertaining so as
well so the first thing we can do is
chord extensions and but I didn't write
that down because I forgot so now that I
said it I might as well put that out
there to make chords more entertaining
you can make chord extensions so the
first thing we do harmonize the major
scale we get major minor minor major
major minor diminished then from there
we can mess with notes and change things
a bit so the first thing we can do is
give a seventh chord such as a g7 to a
see now I'm going to be explaining why
this works so good let me get my other
whiteboard yeah now I can see real good
all right sweet so now we have lots of
room so we have C E and G and then we
have G D G B D F sharp ok so this would
be the tonic this would be a g7 I'll
take out the sharp because it's g7 dome
and its 7th non-major so sorry about
that should caught that myself but it's
ok so why does this pull back to hear
well if we look here we have an e in an
F this is a diminished second which has
one half step
and one half step causes lots of
dissonance so it's a really unpleasant
sound for these two notes but we also
have all these good sounding notes so it
doesn't sound horrible so this adds this
tension so once we get rid of this this
tension it goes back to the normal and
sounds really good with a ceg so that is
how the g's on the dominant 7th chord
works with a seventh that contrasts with
the third in the tonic hopefully that
makes sense so maybe move this back the
side so the next thing we have here
slash chords we learned about that that
is putting a note in the base compound
chords playing two chords at once now we
can get into diatonic chords
substitution which we haven't really
talked about that's where we can take
the cord and replace it with a cord a
third up or down so seven a minor we
could have a minor eyes maybe we could
move it up to a C minor or anything like
that just move it up a third or down a
third so damn third would be 8 a-2 g2f
so yeah another thing we can do is take
a minor chord such as a minor might as
well cut that there and make it diminish
so we get a diminished as to make it
more minor that adds more flavor and let
little more tension so instead of make
an a minor make it a diminished the
other thing we do is for 7th chords we
can move it a diminished a third below
it so for example we could have a G g7
the third below it would be G a G F
oh I'm sorry yeah a third above it oops
I was like this isn't going to work g7
to be diminished if you remember a long
time ago when we talked about court
families these things have a law in
common because this has a G B and D this
has a B and addie as well so these two
have a lot in common so you can replace
some of that as well as other examples
just taking a seventh and moving it a
third above and replacing with that now
another thing finally is a a fifth chord
can be replaced with a fourth chord so G
can be replaced with F because F also
pulls back to the tonic if you wanna
learn about that see my video / court
leading I think I just did it before
this one the fourth pulls to the fifth
or the tonic or any a couple other
chords so a weaker cadence goes from the
4th to the tonic a strong cadence goes
from the 5th to the tonic so if you want
a week or cadence so it not as much
tension go from the 4th to the tonic
rather than from the 5th to the tonic
that's the difference f2c rather than G
to C yeah I didn't think you can figure
out what I'm trying to write here
anymore so just lalalalalala yes I so as
you can see not really so yeah that's
pretty much all i have to say about
embellishing and chords substitution
crammed a lot of information in this
video is pretty action-packed so if you
have any questions hit me up on my
facebook account you just become a fan
or whatever i don't think they call it
that now so follow me on facebook i
guess and you want a personal updates
follow me on twitter and yeah be sure to
