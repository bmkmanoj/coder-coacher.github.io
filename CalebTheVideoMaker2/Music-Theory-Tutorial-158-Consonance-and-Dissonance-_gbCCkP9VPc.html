welcome to my music theory video the
universal language oh yeah 50 that was a
stupid idea anyways in this video I'm
going to be talking about two things in
music you should know about consonance
and dissonance consonants is the idea of
something that sounds good or pleasing
to the ear or something being resolved
dissonance is this tension that wants to
resolve into consonants so let me write
those two terms out because they're
highly important it's cold back to my
red marker when a part of a song is
consonants it sounds like one piece of
music almost but when you're with
dissonance it sounds almost like to
varying fighting pieces for example I
can play AC along with AC let's say this
is on piano this this one's on guitar
well they're both the same pitch so
they're going to have consonants ok but
what if I move this one up to a C sharp
well another like so close together but
they're just a just a tad off now it's
it's almost like is it C or is it C
sharp well yeah doesn't sound good I'll
play it here listen here's 2 c's
now here's the sea and AC sharp
when you have when you have a C in a
c-sharp it sounds like two things
fighting when you have to seize it just
sounds like a sea or one thing so that's
one way you can remember it so if we go
back to the concept of frequency masking
on the wire road OT frequency masky this
is the idea that our ears are bad
hearing multiple pitches so if we have a
c1 c2 c3 and c4 our ears will hear it as
a really big seat just like by that's a
lot of feed but even though it's hard to
hear multiple pitches when there's
attention it you can still kind of hear
that there's not a resolved feeling so
this so the idea is with consonants
frequency masking makes it sound like
one piece all working together for good
dissonance on the other hand will make
it sound like the frequency there's
something within it causing it to sound
bad let's go to the piano let's learn
some stuff here here I have a see let's
go oh that's cool see
sounds like one piece
you maybe it would hear the individual
sounds but together it all sounds
together but when i add a c-sharp
you
it causes dissonance same so this is the
idea of augmented chords they sound bad
that's a major chord
you're the bad sound within it that's
that's dissonance sweet so when you have
one of these bad chords you can resolve
it by moving this augmented interval
down
I hope that helped illustrate the
concept because you could hear it and
see it and we're talking about two
pitches we have what's called the
frequency ratio we talked about this for
example an octave c1 to c2 is a one to
two ratio now typically not always
typically the lower the ratio the better
sounding or the more consonants the
interval has so we'll actually be
talking about that a bit more with major
chords and stuff in the next video so i
will see you then and subscribe and
follow me on twitter guys it's a good
idea i mean seriously who would who else
goes through their entire lives teaching
random things on their whiteboard and
their mom's basement come on guys what's
not to love I mean just look at my cute
face okay this is getting weird I'm
gonna leave now oh and by cute base I
mean incredibly handsome not cute come
on gosh although my hair cut does look
kind of stupid ah I don't like my hair
right now but it'll grow on me
