tutorial and in this video I'm going to
be talking about storage engines now I'm
going to be talking very briefly so I'm
actually not going to get super in-depth
so if you need more you I'm a mate I may
release something in the future or you
can just search the internet the
interwebs
but anyways uh basically storage engine
is how MySQL deals with the data you put
into it and it's just basically how it
stores it so we're my choco I lose like
every time um here's very to cook two
most common storage engines so here are
the two most common ones and I'm not
going to be explaining how they work for
one I don't really know and I haven't
really started into that but I'm going
to be explaining when to use which and
why so when your hat when you have a
database you're going to do stuff with
your data such as transactions and such
so um basically what you need to do with
your data decides which one of these you
should use for example if you remember
in the last video we did like and not
like and that is a type of that's a good
way to find your data well there's
another type of searching it's called
full text search so that's I'll write
that out this is more like a Google
search like you don't have to define
stuff like that such as this or this so
if you need to use a full text search
and we'll be getting into this more in
the future you need to use this
pronounced my I Sam storage engine and
this is because this this storage engine
does not support it
now this nodb on the other hand supports
transactions and what a transaction is
and we'll get into this future videos
basically if you need something to make
sure it's completed so let's say we have
a query where we take 500 dollars from
somebody's account and then we add 500
dollars somebody's account sort of like
transferring money in a
system it's a good that's a good example
now what if you take it to 500 from
somebody's and then your computer
crashes and it screws everything up and
now you don't know whose money's who and
what's going on well if you have a
transaction it will it won't save
anything unless the transaction is
completed so it will be like start
transaction minus 500 plus 500 and then
the transaction is over that's an
example of transaction and only this one
nodb supports transactions the last
thing I wanted to go over on the in this
video is foreign key restraints and I'll
write that out now what foreign key
restraints are is a way to make sure
your database is constructed safely so
there's not redundant data and this this
means if you delete a prop for and key I
mean a primary key and the foreign key
is tied to that primary key either it
will give you an error or it won't let
you it depends on the settings you make
it so basically you have two tables and
there's some sort of connection with the
primary or foreign key and you have
foreign key restraints on it won't let
you mess up your database structure so
let's say I get rid of this table and
then this this table over here says a
person with ID seven bought something
and then there's no person with ID seven
well that's that's not good so if you
need foreign key restraints then you
need to go within NO DB now which one
should you use just in general if you
don't need if you're not sure well if
you need transactions I just go with
this otherwise I got this but it doesn't
really matter unless you I mean just
study how it works with your data and
you'll figure out which one is best for
what you need to do and so if I need a
foreign key restraint then I know to use
this one
finding a transaction I know
this one I need full text I need I know
I need to use this one and there's also
some other types of storage engines and
also differences between all of them so
these are the most two basic ones most
common and these are the two I'll be
showing you so thanks for watching in
the next video I'll be teaching you how
to choose your database engine and how
to alter it so I'll see you there
thanks subscribe well you don't have to
subscribe but pretty cool hope soo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
