tutorial man that's really far so in
this video I want to talk all by the way
my batteries are almost dead but I'm
making this anyways so if I end in the
middle of a sentence
that's probably why all right so we're
going to be talking about what's known
as stick 4 so what are sticky forms so
what a sticky form is is when you submit
your form and let's say you get an error
right and you have to fill out the form
again well the way we have our scripts
set up in the last video is if you get
an error all of the form values are
empty and you have to type in everything
back in again well if we use what's
known as sticky forms then only us all
of the original values are going to stay
within the form elements so if you have
a name Caleb and then an email and you
leave it blank and then you submit it
well it's going to say it's gonna take
you to the new page and say try again
and what it's going to do is it's going
to have your name and the same value you
put in as the email which is nothing and
that's going to offer the option to
submit again that is the idea of a
sticky form now the way this works is we
take advantage of the HTML form would be
value property so when you have a a
element you have a property known as the
value such as submit you can do is you
can take advantage of this and put this
as a PHP see my camera just died thanks
to my pretty craptastic batteries
anyways oh we can put what's in here
is a reference to the values we put in
to the form alright so how can we do
that we can actually use echo right and
then what we want to do is we want to
test if the values are set so we said if
is set and then within here we say post
now let's say this this thing is named
name right name so if is set and then
within these curly braces we could say
I'm sorry I guess it would be if it's
that host name if that's true then we
would echo out host name just like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
