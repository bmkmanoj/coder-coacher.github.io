we talked about the concept of the
concert pitch and in the real world not
all instruments are tuned the same so
that means we're going to have to alter
different notes so it sounds good
together so for example some trumpets
are tuned to b-flat that means they're C
sounds like it b-flat
so in order for their C and in order for
them to sound like a see they're
actually going to have to play a D
because they're whole-step whole-step
lower than what it's actually written so
if it's written a d lowered whole step
we get C so how it would be written
properly on on and staff you know let's
cut this in half let's say this is piano
this is trumpet the composer would write
the piano on C he would also write the
trumpet part on dual and when when the
instructor says let's play concert C
they're telling the trumpet player to
play ad instead of a seat that is so it
sounds like a see that's what concert C
means all right well unfortunately if
not not all instruments are tuned to
b-flat there's all kinds of different
tools so I'm going to be going over two
more that are very common first let me
write out the pitches here we've got C
they go down a half step we got B B flat
a a flat G G flat F E and then e flat so
the one we learned so far is 'if B flat
tuning so that's a one whole step lower
but there's also some one F and E flat
I'm I forgot to write the flat sign so
let me just fix this here and guess F e
and E flat we also have a lot to F and E
flat so as you can see this is a larger
gap so they're going to have to change
even more let's figure out the intervals
for these the first one first we figure
out the interval size
see to be that's you can still count
intervals backwards or we could go B to
C it doesn't really matter it's a second
because we're covering two notes how
many half steps C to B B to B flat two
half steps so a major second if you
don't understand that go check out my
intervals video near to the beginning of
the series because it'll cover all of
that very simply and it'll make a lot of
sense so let's check out C to F well how
many notes recover f G a B C that's a
fifth how many half steps one two three
four five six seven
we covered seven half steps that
qualifies this as a perfect fifth and
finally the last one sees kind of sloppy
so um how many notes are covering e f g
a b c 6 how many half steps 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 so we have 9 half steps on a 6
that qualifies this as a major sixth so
this is a major second lower with 2 half
steps this is a perfect fifth with 7
half steps this is a major sixth with 9
half steps so this means this is how
much the instruments are going to have
to raise their pitch in order for to
sound like the concert pitch so for a
concert C that means the B flat
instrument is going to have to raise it
one major second or a whole step two
half steps equals a whole step so they'd
actually be playing ad perfect fifth
raising it from the see that actually be
AG so they'd be playing a G major sixth
they'd be playing an A so as you can see
it's very complicated so that's why we
needed the concept of concert pitch
so the composers are supposed to fix
this on the music so if we have a staff
here and originally we have a C major
scale C D F G a B C now if they want it
to be in concert see that markers not
very good you piece of crap
I don't know I was probably gonna use
that later
oh well Shh felt on my desk let's go
let's go blue concert C for a trumpet
player would look like this d basically
we're just going to play one note higher
than all of these and also something
else so that's not it wait I'm down
swissbear oh space close enough we also
are in a new scale because we go from C
major scale to D that's to keep the
space inconsistent so we have to add F
sharp and AC sharp so now this is in
concert C you can do the same thing with
the other tuning systems it's just you
have to raise it even higher so for
example C if we're using a F tuning we
would have to play it in the G scale so
there C becomes G C sharp becomes G
sharp and so forth they have to do that
to sound the same so that's pretty much
everything you'll need to know about
transposing I mean yeah
concert pitch transposing the certain
instruments that aren't the same into
the appropriate scale so they do sound
the same so just remember the F you have
to raise it seven half steps to e-flat
instruments you have to raise it nine
and of course the b-flat you have to
raise
- so that's pretty much all so if you
would like to support me be sure to
subscribe to my channel and check out my
appropriate social networks they're
probably in the description if you're
watching this on YouTube here and be
sure to like this and share it with a
friend so I think that's all I have to
talk about right now so I will see you
in the next video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
