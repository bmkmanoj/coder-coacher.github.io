video maker to this video we are going
to continue our discussion on boolean
data this file here is the file we ended
with in the previous video so if you
have no idea what's going on here go
check out the previous video if you
understand all of this you're good
the problem that we're having is not
that our code doesn't work but that it's
not very clear the underscore capital B
is kind of confusing and the fact that
we're using 9001 I don't really like
that and that's what I'm going to change
in this video there's actually a really
easy way to do this but we are going to
have to include another file so go up to
the top and go into insert mode and type
in include standard bull dot H this
allows us to use new keywords for our
boolean data so no longer are we going
to have to use this underscore bool here
instead we can just use a lowercase bool
which makes a lot more sense because if
you think of the other data types
they're all lowercase int float double
char now bool is not the odd one out
additionally we're no longer going to
use a number here but instead we are
going to use the keyword either true or
false
so let's set this to false yes I
exercise since last video one thing you
need to notice though is that false is
not in quotes it's just a key word don't
quote it this is not the same thing
the way this thing actually works is no
different than underscore capital bool
it just makes it easier to work with
in fact the values stored are still 0 or
1 so we should be able to run this just
the same let's write it and we'll
compile and output it and the output is
0 because I set it to false but we can
do more with this for example if you
come down here you can put something
like this where in quotes we are going
to output an integer and then go to a
new line and the integer we want to
output is actually caleb is fat plus 10
and that seems really really odd but
what I just want to show to you is that
there is a direct correlation between
this and a number false is zero true is
one when would you actually do this I'm
not too sure but just follow along let's
save this and run it and you can see
down at the bottom of outputs 10 just to
show that it's working let's set it to
true and make sure the output is 11 so
when I change this to true caleb is fat
now has the value 1 so when we get down
here it should be 1 plus 10 which equals
11 so let's try it and you can see the
output is 11 if you're wondering where
the extra space is coming from it's
right here now there's not a format
character to print out the word true or
false but later on when we start talking
about conditionals
there are ways where we could output
caleb is fat or Caleb is not fat
depending on the value of the variable
but for now this is very good and I
think this gets the point across of how
boolean data works and how to use it in
your program so hopefully that was

as those 2 things very much help my
channel thank you guys and I'll see you
in the next video where we will be
talking about something new</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
