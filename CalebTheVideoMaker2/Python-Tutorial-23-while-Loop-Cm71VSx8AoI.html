tutorial series in this video I will be
talking about a new loop called the
while loop so the while loop will
continue to do something until a certain
condition is met so we give it a
condition that has to me so let's think
of a real world example all right while
I'm a loser I will create videos in my
mom's basement right now once I become
not a loser I no longer have to create
those videos so me creating videos is
dependent upon me being a loser so while
I'm a loser I create videos but once I'm
not a loser I no longer have to create
videos so basically i'll be making
videos for a long long long long time
alright hopefully that kind of made
things pretty clear but probably not
let's let's try it in Python now first
let's define a variable let's say we
have a score right and like for a game
like we're making a game or something
and let's just have the score be 0 okay
and then we create a while loop so while
score is less than 100 and let's just
say you need 100 points in order to get
like an upgrade all right it's a very
simple example but whatever and then we
put a colon and then we have it do
something well we could say by the way
just again it doesn't really matter if
you single or double quotes I've been
using them interchangeably all
throughout this series you should
probably do it consistently but you know
I'm just teaching so whatever once I
make a program i will do that
consistently all right print let's say
you do not have enough points now if I
and if I started this program now well
we'd have a problem because it's going
to check the score and it will print you
do not have enough points because your
score is zero and then it will check the
score and no print you do not have
enough points because the score is zero
and it's going to do that forever
because score does not
increase by itself so in order to fix
this we have to have score do something
so for this example we'll just to make
it easy we could say score and we could
say score and assign it the value score
plus 1 so the way this works is it takes
the original value of score right here 0
adds one to it and then it takes that
new number which would be one in this
case and it takes the whole thing and
assigns it to the new variable so so
let's start and we'll just explain sort
of how this will go through it it looks
at score actually let's just start from
the wall so a test to see if score is
under 100 well score is zero so yes so
it's going to print you do not have
enough points and then it's going to
give you you us a free one so now it
takes the value of score zero and
replaces it with zero plus one so now we
have one then it goes back to the while
loop and it says while score is less
than 100 well the new value of score is
one so it's going to print you do not
have enough points here is a free point
now it's going to take one and replace
it with one plus one and then it's going
to be two and then I'll say while score
is less than 100 it is your you don't
have enough points here's a free point
so too is replaced with two plus one or
three and it's going to repeat this
forever and ever until score is greater
is no longer less than 100 so let's try
it you can see it printed out a whole
ton of free mess-free point messages so
that is how the while loop works and
just to see it a little bit more clearly
how this works let's try it again I'll
bring this down and I want it to print
out score so that way we can kind of see
how it works
all right we might need to change the
value of score in a second so you see
nothing happened because score from this
one is already at 100 so let's reassign
the value zero school all right let's go
all right let's look at the top it's
going to take a while scroll scroll
Scroll scroll Scroll scroll skull skull
skull skull skull skull skull skull
skull okay so you do not have enough
points here is a free point and it tells
us our original point value it make more
sense if this game first so let's say
let's bring us down here and let's say
your score is then we say % s and then
we say % and then we say what variable
we want to display score so hopefully
this works out I'm probably messed it up
whatever let's try it so now let's try
this again I'm just going to run this
all right and a real quick let me
reassign the value of score 20 and then
I'll run this again so now score is at
zero and what we're going to do is we're
having a while loop check it we're going
to print the original score and then
we're going to give us a say that we're
going to give a free point and then we
give that free point
all rights go to the top here probably
shouldn't done like 10 or something but
you know that'd be boring so your score
is zero you do not have enough points
here is a free point your score is one
you do not have enough points here's a
free point and it goes on and does this
over and over and over and over and over
and over and over and over and over and
over and over and over and over now / no
/ no over and over and over and over and
over and over again until we reach 99
and then it says you do not have enough
points here is a free point that causes
our points to go to 100 and then it no
longer goes on because we have enough
points so real quick I want to look look
at this while loop one more time and
just get some final thoughts so I'm
going to bring this down here one thing
that is important to realize is the
location what like the location of the
addition the free point and also the
comparison that we're requiring we're
requiring it that that it's less than
100 in order for you to get the error
message that you do not have enough
points so if we put this up here if we
put score equals square plus one up here
well now it's going to say score is 99
or score yeah here let's just watch it
will show you I'll show you what I mean
it's going to add one to our score
before it prints it out and therefore
it'll say your score is 100 you do not
have enough points which is it is not
true so let me reassign the value of
score 20 so that way we just reset
everything and then let's print this and
you can see it says your score is 100
you do not have enough points here is a
free point now this is wrong because we
end with the same result either way the
score ends at 100 the only problem is
with that this this most recent for loop
is that it adds say I'm i watch it adds
one before it prints this so once the
while loop is
tested and it realizes that score is not
100 it does all of this code so when we
get down here you do not have enough
points that points back to this not this
so we realize that it checks to see if
it's under 100 it's currently let's say
it's 99 yes it's less than 100 then it
adds one to make it 100 and then it
tells us our score a hundred and then it
says you do not have enough points even
though it would make more sense if we
put that down here score both score plus
one and then got rid of it up here that
way it doesn't tell us our score before
it doesn't tell us the score that is
already updated now it's going to tell
us your score before it's updated and it
will be more accurate sorry about that
so now that is how it works so yeah
sorry about the super long video
hopefully it was helpful though and if
you have any questions just be sure to
leave me a comment and also be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
