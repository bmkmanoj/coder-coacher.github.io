be a longer one because we're going over
in a very intermediate advanced topic
its advanced for beginners but once you
get to hang it's pretty easy so don't
freak out don't cry we'll all be good
it's called the circle of fifths and I'm
not going to draw a circle yet but we'll
get there basically this shows how every
scale has a pattern to figure out the
sharps and flats for example we just had
the a major scale which had three sharps
in it we know that the G scale has one
sharp F sharp the C major scale doesn't
though because it's all white keys
remember so how can we figure inside
without going and try in every single
scale well actually we're going to
figure out how to do that by figuring
out the scales so let me open up my
keyboard close this so it doesn't dry
out da da da da da da da da da we're
going to organize pitches five fifths
perfect fifths we have a seat si si si
perf perfect fifth has seven half steps
one two three four five six seven right
there seven it gives us a G so I'm going
to just basically go through the shut up
i'm going to go through the keyboard and
put the fifths it so we have C which
goes to G and then from a G
one two three four five six seven gives
us at d so she goes to D D 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
gives us an a hey ok you can go let down
a little bit most a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 e e
okay sighs ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 gives a B
go down a couple walked is B 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 f sharp not f this gives us an F sharp
now f sharp 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 C sharp now
let's go the other direction starting at
sea again see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 we have F F
natural not sharp not flat now f 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 which is B flat E flat
b-flat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 which gives us e so
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 sorry i thought it was
wrong so i redid it i started on the
wrong key it's actually flat E flat E
flat where we're starting now taking a
fifth down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a flat 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 D flat D flat one whoops so here's
D flat one two three four five six seven
we get G flat if we look at these scales
the scales of these um fifths apart from
each other there's going to be a cool
pattern so the c major scale i'm going
to get my keyboard here
starting on C see here's the C major
scale there's no sharps and no flats so
we can say this one has zero sharps or
zero flats let's try a G Major scale do
you remember the pattern is whole whole
half whole whole whole half go go half
go go go half one sharp one now let's
try d whole whole half oops 00 half pull
pull pull ash to see the pattern here
that's me opal that's me Oh Boeing you
alright so let's draw a well we actually
remember because on our last video we
had an a major key net key signatures so
that's three and I know personally that
personally that ease for bees 5 f sharp
is six and C sharp is seven so if seven
of the notes are flatted in the key
signature we know it is AC sharp now
let's go the other direction we're
starting at sea which has zero we go
back to F here's F see it Oh whole half
oh oh oh half there's one and it's a
flat so the this direction they're all
flat one two three four five six seven
so conveniently see has 0 C has 0 C
sharp has seven C flat has seven so
basically every time you go up a fifth
you add a sharp to the key signature and
this is just by random chance it's
incredible it's like it's like I don't
know it's mathematically correct I like
it but on every time we go up a fifth we
add one
arp to the key signature every time we
go down we had a flat so what exactly
are the notes that are being sharp or
flat flat it oh okay talk today really
can't I messed up so much time so many
times so much time I've messed up so
many times on my speech i cants talk'st</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
