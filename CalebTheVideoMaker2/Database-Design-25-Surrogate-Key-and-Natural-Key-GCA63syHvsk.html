database design series this video we're
going to be talking about surrogate and
natural keys all right let me write that
out yeah sir I think I'm falling sorry
Bella sir get and then we have a natural
all right so we talked about primary
keys in the last video that's as far as
we'll get for defining a key these are
categories of primary keys so we define
a primary key and then this is kind of
like a descriptive term we don't have to
define in our database surrogate primary
key or natural primary key this is more
for database design to know like the
difference between types of keys
hopefully that makes clear sense and if
not just stick with me okay so up up to
like all these key videos i've been
doing i've been using natural keys let's
define a natural key first it's very
natural definition it's something that's
naturally in the table something you
naturally want to store when you have a
user's table you naturally want to store
the user name and the email those can be
used as natural keys because they fit
all the requirements for a primary key
and it's already in there you don't have
to make up something you don't have to
think of a column to add just for the
sake of having a key we want to be able
to have a key for every single table but
sometimes the natural key is not very
obvious or not so natural so we want to
try find a natural key when we're using
a natural keys generally when you create
a database so let's say this huge box is
our database within this database we
have a bunch of tables and then within
each table we have a bunch of columns
and rows
see I'm saying these are all connected
in some funky way with relationships
well when we define a database typically
I mean maybe not always we want to try
to either always use natural peace or
always use surrogate keys which are just
made up keys we don't want to kind of
flip flop switches I can't think of any
other words because we want to try keep
it consistent otherwise people using the
database they can be confused is this a
natural key or is this a surrogate key
is this something that actually has
real-world value or is it just a made-up
number so let's say we are using natural
Keys there are a couple problems with
natural keys and this video will be
explaining the difference between these
two and then the next video we'll be
talking about pros and cons of each
basically so natural Keys are what's
naturally already in the table something
we wanted to store to begin with right
the thing is they have real-world value
so your database might adapt and the
meaning of your keys kind of adapt to
which once again I'll explain that all
on the next video surrogate keys they
are a column that's just added to your
database no matter what even if you have
a good natural key because remember you
want to either use all natural or all
surrogate usually so if I decide to use
surrogate Keys I'm going to give an ID
to every single row within every single
table so we have let's say we have a a
user table and then we have a sale table
and then we have a comment table what we
do is we give every single table an ID
column so we have a user ID column in
the set end user table we have a sale ID
column in the sale table we have a
comment ID in the comment table so now
when we have like let's look at the
common table and if we have the comments
we're going to have a column we're going
to have a column for the comment ID and
then we'll need a reference
to the user that posted the comments so
we'll have the user ID as a foreign key
which points back to the user table so
that's kind of how that works now we
just have random numbers the ID is just
a big number that has a feature known as
auto increment that means every single
time you make a new row within this
table it's going to raise the ID by one
then when you like it delete columns or
something and you have gaps within your
numbers it doesn't really matter because
the number has no real world
significance typically surrogate keys
are kept completely private no one knows
the surrogate key except for the people
working with the database you're not
told your surrogate key so if I create
an account on a website and then I put
my username and my password and then I
go to like I sign up register and do my
email junk and then I sign in and go to
my user settings it's not going to be
like user ID equals 45 or whatever it's
going to be private the reason for that
is is because the world doesn't have I
mean the world the number doesn't have
real world meaning therefore it's
private to the database only if I
started giving that number out to
everybody who has one of these IDs or or
something like that or if I started
putting it on sales reports
well then I'm giving that number real
meaning in the world and it's starting
to become a natural key
so hopefully that kind of makes sense
natural is something that's already in
the database surrogate is something we
just add the thing that's kind of cool
about surrogate is if you're struggling
to find a really good natural key you
can always use a surrogate key the
problem with that is you always want to
try to be able to naturally make
everything unique like in a user table
we have a user name that's going to keep
things unique so even if we use a
surrogate key
we can still index this username and
that can be used sorta as if we assign
it as a natural key the only thing is
we're making connections between tables
using the surrogate key so for this
table we could have a user ID and then
we could have a user name for just an
example the user ID would be the
surrogate key this would not be the
natural key because we can only have one
primary key and the primary key is going
to be the type surrogate so the user ID
is a surrogate key random number
generated number the user name we can
index it and use it like a natural key
with when we search the database and
everything but we're not going to use it
to make connections between tables and
references with foreign keys so
hopefully that makes things pretty clear
next video I'll be talking about pros
and cons of which one you want to use
okay so cool catch you guys in the next
