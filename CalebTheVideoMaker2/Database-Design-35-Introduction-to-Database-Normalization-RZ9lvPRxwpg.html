yes I know it is way past the deadline
for me to get my luscious mane trimmed I
know you guys all love it but I'm just
going to keep it for a while so I know
it doesn't look too bad but I mean it
really is bad I mean if I can pull my
hair past my lips that's kind of bad but
anyways this video is going to be pretty
simple I just want to introduce a topic
so in the next three or so videos when
we go over it it's going to be like kind
of not all new to you you'll kind of
have an idea of what's going on so we're
going over what's known as normalization
so normalization is a process where we
go through our our database plan that we
have and we start correcting things that
may cause data integrity problems or
just repeating data et Cie etc whatever
you want to say the normal forms are
basically like a checklist that you're
going to follow and when you get to the
end you'll have a pretty good design
database so yeah there's three main
forms and these are named very
conveniently I have to admit first
normal form second normal form and guess
what the third one is yeah you guessed
it third normal frame I'm kidding it's
form huh that'd be weird though alright
so got first normal form second or form
third normal form these are the three
steps of normalization for databases now
if you really really really want to get
into database design you just like man I
love this stuff I gotta get more well
there's tons of more steps you can add
and make things all complicated if you
really want but for our practical
purposes these are the only three that
you're going to really really need I
don't know there's like a glare right
here because these lights and I know I'm
just working on it so give me a couple
videos and I'll try to work on my
lighting a bit but for now personal form
second normal form third normal form why
do we have these well it's because we
want a systematic way to follow to a
Purdue
and normalized or a good structure
database alright there's a couple things
you should know when it comes to
normalization we still have to talk
about the idea of things being atomic we
want everything to be atomic you also
have to kind of think about data
depending on other data so if you think
of Y let's say a primary key yeah
six oh eight just a number that could
refer to anything that could be a person
an order and event whatever it is it's
just a primary key and that also is
going to have different columns in the
table which have different attributes
about whatever this thing is so let's
say it's a person and we have a column
for the name and let's say this dude's
name is Caleb what a dumb name right
this depends upon the primary key so
what I mean by that is if we change the
primary key we're going to also change
the person right so let's say we have
609 well this is going to be a
completely different person right
because they're two separate entities
this one's referring some guy over here
and this one is referring to some guy
over here two separate entities you can
also think all by the way that that
processor of that thin this is called
dependency so the next three videos
we'll be going over the first normal
form second normal form and the third
normal form the other main thing is that
these are kind of comprehensive I guess
you could say so what that means is once
you have a first normal form now you can
go on to the second normal form but you
can't go jump in right here you have to
have it in first normal form before you
can get in the second normal form
same thing for second normal form into
the third normal form so that means if
you have a database that is in third
normal form it is also in second normal
form and in first normal form so again
all this technical and terms and junk
so if it's freaking you out don't worry
it's really simple gotta get my my hair
out of my face all right well basically
it's just it's some list of steps a list
of things to do and basically you can't
do this step two until you do step one
so this year second normal form that's
step two can't do this until you do that
so you gotta go through the process and
then once you're at their normal form
things are good to go see yeah that's
really all I have to say peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
