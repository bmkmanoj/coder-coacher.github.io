tutorial I believe this video I wanted
to talk about a part of the server
superglobal array so the main purpose of
this video is to teach you how to use
same page form validation what that
means is when we were working with forms
before we had HTML page we had a PHP
page we took these HTML values and sent
them to a PHP page to evaluate them that
was then displayed to the user the
results of that evaluation well well
this video is going to be teaching is
how to do that all within one page and
there's an important key pair value of
server that we need to focus on so
that's a string request method this is
the key and what it's going to do is
it's going to point to the what method
it was used from the request so if you
learn from the previous video request
can contain both post and it contained
again when we're talking about forms
here so this let's say the form uses the
post method the value is going to be
post all right so we can use that to do
a little test basically when we have the
form displayed so here's our form and a
little submit button when we submit this
VAT this form a value whatever the form
submission is so this says method equals
post
well that means it's going to assign the
value post to this key of this array so
that means this array contains the key
request method and it points to the
value post so we can turn this into a
test and we can say oh well if if this
has the value post that means the form
has been submitted right so let's just
do a little if statement in pure English
so basically if within this if we're
going to see the request has post value
so that's a little test if that's true
whatever we put within these code will
execute so if it has the value post we
want the form to be validated and then
we can take our original HTML put it
outside of this if statement and now PHP
is going to look at this and it's going
to display the HTML form and if we ever
submit the form the request request
method now has the value post which
means we validate the form so it's a
test if we didn't submit it this is not
going to be executed if we did submit it
it will be executed now there is a
downside to this because no matter what
the HTML will be redisplayed so PHP
looks at this and they display the HTML
and then if it gets the value post the
form is validated and it will say oh
congratulation you are now
congratulations you're now a registered
user and then it will display the
HTML again on the next page so there are
ways to get around that but for these
videos right now we will not be doing
that
and in upcoming videos we will be
explaining how to only have the HTML be
displayed on the first time or if there
is an error so for example you say
register and it gives you the boxes to
put your information in and then you
click register and it says error please
try again with a colon and then it
Reedus plays the form but if it's
successful we just wanted to say success
and not we're not redisplay the form
well there are ways we can do that but
for now we're just teaching the basics
of same page form validation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
