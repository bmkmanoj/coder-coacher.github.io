cover something I already covered a
little bit but I'm gonna go in a little
bit more detail so a while ago I did an
altar command and we're going to go into
more that so I'm in the gym database
click SQL and it basically just looks
like this altar and then basically you
put the table alter table members and
then after this you can put a bunch of
commands to alter something about this
table so for example we can rename it so
rename and then to rename to and then
say let's say we want it to be fans just
like that and click go and now we don't
have a members table we have a fans
table so anybody who's a fan of the gym
is now in the fans table that's a good
altar command well I don't really like
that so take that back so to take it
back alter table fans and rename to
members click go and there we go that's
back to normal and another cool one is
we can add a column to it so add a what
should we add we're going to add a
favorite food column I know that's
ridiculous and it will be a March are 50
Oh No what'd I do wrong oh my bad
alter table members see I was using the
old query and I forgot to change fan the
members click go and there we go now if
I good at the members we can see we have
a new call on favor food and none of
these have entries because they weren't
originally entered with the fair food
call all right so now I'm going to be
teaching you about modifying it so we do
the same thing as always alter table
members and then what we can do is say
modify and remember favorite food we can
change that to March our let's say 150
and this will update it and we can click
go and we can see updates so we go back
to the members and you it doesn't really
look like anything here look at the good
SQL click show columns for all members
lowercase this click go
and we can see favorite food it's null
because we had regionally had it not
null and then we changed it because we
updated it and we didn't say not know
so we said alter table members modify
favorite food and then we said varchar'
150 and then we did not put not null
that means somebody can enter into the
database nothing and it will accept the
value without giving any errors alright
but I don't really see why we need a
fair food in here so I'm gonna put
something more reasonable for this kind
of database so SQL ok so from the SQL
box we can say alter table
members and then what we can do is say
change and what this is going to do is
change a columns name so I put the first
the old name - the new name so what
Colin while we're changing or changing
favorite food I really need to work on
my spelling and then we're going to
change this to something more reasonable
like favorite animal that was obviously
a joke but it wasn't very funny and
let's make this bar chart and then click
go boom and then you can see if we
remember stable it is now favorite
animal and also if we go back you can
see on the side over here favorite
animal and the very last thing I'm going
to teach you is I actually already
taught you it once but alter table
members drop call favorite animal this
is basically just going to delete this
column right here because it's
completely useless so that when you need
to do that you just make a drop after an
alter so go and this will pop up asking
if you really want to do that and yes I
do because it's dumb so it's no longer
there and those are some alter commands
you can look them up online if you need
some other stuff but those are most of
them that you may need thank you and
subscribe goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
