be really awesome it's going to be a
continuation on methods although this
time we're going to be working with
lists lists I always struggled like
saying that I don't know why but anyways
anyways we're going to be going through
some of the most common and most useful
methods for lists so first we have to
start by of course making a list so I
want to make a list for a secret
language right I'll just make it s l for
short secret language and here is the
syntax to make a list then everything
within this list gets quotes right place
you got this little this much so far
we'll just give it like five items and
we'll just put some random crap in here
take it right now we do your mama got
swag left over right glove that's the
question guys that is the question bird
alright so here's our list right now the
first method I want to talk about is
append and we actually use this a while
ago when we were working with lists so
you probably recognize it maybe
hopefully this is the this is the method
so we were actually using a method
before I even really explained what a
method really was so basically the way
this works is you say what we want to do
do our verb on and then what the verb is
so basically what we want dang it my
stupid furnace turned on I gotta go turn
that crap off alright I'm back and I
have no idea where I stopped but anyways
this is what we want to do this is what
we want to do it on so we want to append
to the secret list and then whatever's
in the parenthesis is what we want to
append so this is the object this is the
verb and this is the parameters or the
arguments of what we're going to append
so we could put on let's say just like
sorry gotta go say this random yeah
alright and then what we can do is guess
SL here's just to see if at work we
could print it we don't have to use
print we just type it out but this work
so now when we look at it we see we have
here at the end so that is how a pen
works
another cool method is count so the way
this one works is just like this and
then within here you put a item and then
it will count how many times it is in
the list so I can be like take it right
now and it should return one because
there's one of them in the list if this
was in the list multiple times this
number would be not one but something
else yeah obviously
alright so another cool one is um it's
called extend and in order to use this
we're going to need another list so
let's make a list
we'll make it legit because all my lists
are legit I'm legit you're legit we're
all legit everyone's legit and within
legit is going to be PI and pizza and
it's gonna be one it's not gonna be two
separate items and then we got let's
actually add something to that so let's
go legit append and let's let's append
let's go
grape juice okay so now we have the list
of Pi and pizza and grape juice so now
what we can do is we can go secret list
dot extend and then within parentheses
we can put the list that we want to
extend on to secret list so let's go
legit so what basically what this did is
it took this legit list and it combined
it with the secret list so secret list
now has a couple more things it has pie
and pizza and grape juice and you can
see if we type legit that one stays the
same it did not change so basically we
just took legit and we added it on to
secret list pretty cool and alright
all right so now what else I guess we
could go with hmm index so index is
going to tell us a location of a certain
word or item so I could be like index of
your mom I've got swag and it's gonna
tell me - and if we look at that
0 1 2 it is correct so that is a good
thing all right so you guys are probably
understanding how methods kind of work
now you see you just put what we want to
do this is the method itself this is
what we're doing it on and most methods
require arguments that are given to it
so let's go another one let's use insert
this one actually requires two arguments
so let's right here let's put secret
list period insert and within here we
are going to give it a index number and
then we're going to give it what we want
to put into the list so we're inserting
let's put no no no we're going to insert
nonono within secret list at index two
so if you figure out where that would be
looking up here would be 0 1 2 so it
should be like right here let's try it
and then it doesn't return anything so
what we can do is we can put secret
lists to see what where it is so now
let's take it right now
so we do no no no so it actually did
work which is awesome all right so now I
want to teach another one which is pump
and what that's gonna do is it's gonna
take off the last list item so let's do
it
good Seeger list dot pop and you can
tell it you can see that it returns it
so you might want to ask like oh well
did it actually alter the original or
let's find out
see your list you can see that grape
juice is no longer on there so it
actually returned it
and it altered the original so this is
not one of those that we're going to
have to be like like that or something
ridiculous so if we did that it would
change things drastically so what we do
is we just put that and it's good to go
and um so yeah I think that's about it
let's go I got a couple more here yeah
let's see we got removed
so what remove is you can put a specific
one so I can be like move sui do and
then I can print it and you can see that
s we do is no longer there
I don't know the cool one is reverse
which is pretty self-explanatory it just
reverses everything so now pie and pizza
goes to the first part this goes second
this goes third this goes forth dah dah
dah dah dah dah
so what was at the beginning at the
first time is now at the end it was at
the end of verse times now at the
beginning and the absolute last I'm
gonna show you is SL sort so this SL is
just the name of our list it could be
whatever and what this does is it sorts
the list items alphabetically so let's
print it out so n th okay you might be
like whoa what the heck those aren't in
alphabetical order but you see our
capital letters have priority so you can
see these both start with capitals so
they start first envy comes before n
comes before T and then once we get to
the lowercase h ILP why that makes
perfect sense so that's how these sort
works a lot of these I mean a lot of
these things can also work for lists
with numbers so like I could be like num
ba and assign it D values
6:43 seven that number that number that
number that number of that number that
number let's try it and then we can
print out number and that's what it is
and then what we can do is we can go
numb about sort and then print out
number and you can see negative 2 3 6 7
7 43 3000 9000 so it actually works for
numbers 2 so hopefully this video was
helpful hopefully it wasn't too long too
and I kind of talked about a whole bunch
of things but all of these are going to
be super useful for you and your
programming so just write these down or
memorize them or what and then when you
need them you can use them thanks for
