seven I believe in your database
clustering series this video we are
going to be setting a password list SSH
so I change the background so it be a
little bit easier to tell the difference
between the different virtual machines
so this one with the logo of several
nines well that one is obviously going
to be the one that has the cluster
control on it these two over here these
are just the Masters so we have master
one and master two the thing that we
want to accomplish is make sure that
this computer can communicate with all
of the other computers to begin that
process open up a terminal and type in
ifconfig now in here look for the second
network card and you can see that
there's this address this is the
machines IP address let's do this on all
the machines to see what IPS are
assigned to which virtual machines so go
over here open that up and repeat the
process you can see that master one ends
in one zero two and master two ends in
one zero three now from the cluster
control computer there's some commands
that we need to run to connect to the
other machines the command that we are
interested in is SSH - keygen when you
press ENTER you can just press ENTER a
couple times for all of the questions
and you'll get this fancy looking
picture this is going to create some
files inside of a hidden folder so if
you type in LS - a and input dot SSH
this is going to show all of the files
inside of this hidden SSH folder and you
can see there's this ID RSA and then
this IDRs a pub the first one is a
private key that you're going to have on
this machine and then there's the public
key that you're going to put on the
other machines that when you try to
connect to them both of these files are
used to see if there is a connection
that is allowed so what we need to do is
we need to take this file and put it on
the other two machines and there's
actually a command that allows you to do
this very easily so that command is SSH
- copy - ID and then you just put the IP
address of the other machines so if we
go back you can see it's ten seven one
three four one zero two so we can step
it in you want to say yes
and then type in the password for the
other machine and it works now when we
set up this machine and cloned it it
actually did something very convenient
for us it made sure that all of the
usernames and passwords were the same
and that's actually needed for cluster
control you're going to have to have one
user that has a certain password and
that users going to have to be on all of
the different machines so we kind of
cheated and just cloned the machines
entirely but if you're working in a
production environment where you already
have these installed you're going to
need to make that user that's on all of
them so we put that public key on master
1 but now we need to do it on master 2
so we just go back and put a 1 of 3 yes
and then password there you go
now this part's a little weird but you
got to make sure you remember to do this
cluster control is actually going to
need to have password list ssh to the
machine that it's on so what that means
is we need to do it again but use the IP
address of this machine which was 1 0 1
yes and a password there you go now to
verify that these works you can put SSH
and then type in the IP address so for
example in this situation we are going
to be SSA Qing into this same machine it
ran and you can see nothing really
happened there's some output but the
title here is exactly the same that
makes sense though because we're
actually on the same machine we just
can't really tell because the username
is exactly the same and it's actually
the same for all of these if you look
you can see this guy has the same
username as this guy so when you're
actually doing SSH yourself it can be a
little bit confusing but that's ok
because we don't really have to worry
about that all we needed to see is that
we get some kind of output here so to
escape this what we do is hold ctrl and
press D and you can see it close the
connection now let's try it again with
master 1 we get that output so now in
this situation when we do command such
as LS we're actually displaying the
files that are on this machine so SSH
just allows
is to connect to that machine and work
with it as if we were using that machine
directly so let's close out of that one
and try the other master 103 and you can
see it works as well so make sure you
close out of that so you're working with
the right computer and now we are
working with the machine that has
cluster control on it so the way we just
set up this SSH is called password list
SSH
you can see when we typed in SSH and put
in IP address it did not ask us for a
password this is exactly what is need
for cluster control so we got everything
set up and in the next video we're
actually going to install cluster
control so thank you guys if you've
enjoyed this video please click like and
as always please subscribe and share
this video with your friends I'll see
you all in the next video and I think
it's going to be a lot of fun so please
check it out and as always peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
