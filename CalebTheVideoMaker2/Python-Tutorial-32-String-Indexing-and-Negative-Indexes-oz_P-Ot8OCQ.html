torrid tutorial man I can't even talk
and this video I wanted to talk about
string indexing so I don't know if you
guys have been watching this whole
series from the beginning or if you just
kind of jump in wherever you want but
earlier in the series we talked about
list indexing where each item within a
list was assigned a specific number to
that item
now with strings the same thing works
with characters so we can take
individual characters within a string so
I'm going to illustrate this first let's
create a variable we'll just make call
it yo and we'll assign it the value
lemonade so now we have this and if we
want to print it we can just go yo print
yo now I want you to think of the
indexes for this here I brought over
paint just to make things a little
bigger and clear now how do the indexes
work well it starts a 0 on the left so
this need a select tool this character 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 and then finally 7 so the
way we can basically print an individual
character for that what we can do is we
can go and then right after the variable
put bracket sort of how we used with
lists we put these brackets and we say
the index number that we want to print
so if I put one issued printing of the
ladder with index 1 which was e because
L is 0 E is 1 and so forth so let's try
it and you see it prints e we can also
print 7 which will print the last e
because 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 now what I want
you to understand is I want you to think
of index a little bit differently than
you have been instead of thinking of abs
like characters try to think of them as
spaces between the characters and the
reason why is I'll show you it'll make a
lot of sense here I'll let me figure out
let's
let's get a straight line tool and then
let's get a new color let's go thread so
what I'm going to do is put these lines
between these characters and think of
these as your index points okay so now
when we're talking index numbers the
first red line is zero the second red
line is one the third red line is two
and so forth so we still have 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 red lines put the first one as we
mentioned earlier starts as 0 so the
final number we get is 7 because the
index numbers go to 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and
the why the reason why I want I'm
mentioning this to you is because I
think it makes things a lot more clear
because you think this is before a
letter this index is before a letter
that's why it's 0 we haven't hat we
haven't reached any letters yet and then
as we pass L it goes to 1 so when we do
something such as print yo 0 like this
well what it's going to do is it's going
to print one individual character
starving at index 0 so it starts here
and then it goes one character over and
prints everything within that range so
all we get is the letter L you see I
just think that makes things a lot more
clear rather than thinking the first
character is 0 which just confuses me
and probably millions of other people so
if you think of it this way now and it
says print 0 it's basically saying I'm
going to print one character start
starting at the index 0 so the index 0
covers this much range all right so that
is a really cool way to think about it
another thing that's cool is Python is
we can use a negative
indexes so what I can do is rather than
having you know zero through seven this
direction we can have indexes going the
other direction so for this we have a
and index right here and it goes
backwards so this now this one whoopsies
this red line is 0 this is negative 1
negative 2 negative 3 negative 4
negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 and
negative 8 the way this works is when we
print an individual index let's say we
print index 3 what uh how the way Python
does this is it I'm sorry negative 3
let's say we print negative 3 the way
Python does this is it first finds the
index so this is 0 this is negative 1
negative 2 and then negative 3 and just
like in when we had a positive indexes
it goes 1 character so this will be
negative index 3 and now I want to print
this out just to illustrate that so we
should get a so print yo and what we're
going to do is print a negative 3 hey so
yeah you can see this would be negative
3 the best way to familiarize yourself
with the way this works is just to have
consistent practice with it because when
you're first starting out it can be a
little confusing you might get one less
character or you might get the wrong
character so forth but just just
continue to think that the numbers I'm
sorry the indexes are between the
letters and they always go one this
direction so that would be if we're
counting what let's try to figure out
what index this letter would be well we
could go this way left to right which if
that's the case it would be 0 to 1
one two so this will be index 2 or 0 1 2
if we think of it the other way it'd be
0 2 negative 1 negative 2 negative 3
negative 4 negative 5 negative 6 so what
we can do is see me well we can do here
is we can just see that we could say
print so we could print it from the
front
0 1 2 should get em or we can print it
the other way 0 negative 1 negative 2
negative 3 negative 4 negative 5
negative 6 oh it worked all right great
so hopefully that helped you understand
index is just a little bit more in the
same concept applies to like lists and
stuff so if you are confused with list
items and indexes just apply this to
that information and work pretty much
the same exact way I don't think I'm
gonna make a whole another video over
that though because it'll just be
repeating myself so thank you for
watching be sure to subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
