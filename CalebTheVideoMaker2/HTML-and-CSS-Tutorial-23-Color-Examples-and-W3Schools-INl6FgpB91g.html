beautiful world of ours
I am glad to see you have came back to
learn some more HTML and CSS I'm
guessing that's what you're doing if not
I don't know what you're doing but I
have no clue why you would even be
watching this if you weren't intending
to learn HTML or CSS but anyways let's
get started because I'm not going to
waste all your time all right so in this
video I'm going to be giving you an
example with color so last video we
talked about this right here with this
declaration turning the paragraphs color
blue refresh it looks the same because I
didn't change anything so all the
paragraphs texts are blue so we look
back here paragraph here Jim Larry Billy
Joe Swanson saved 84 cats from a
semi-truck that burst in a million a
million noble is it makes sense
exploding Dynamite's on pizza then we
have out fondo the mysterion cow killer
killed 39 hamsters yesterday for show
that is one delicious paragraph so those
are our paragraphs well we can actually
change the color to a lot of different
options as you can see whitespace does
not really matter in HTS I mean agency
CSS I mean know what HS is so uh yeah
just so you know it doesn't really
matter a Q Mike that's that's gonna
affect it because it needs to see color
as a whole but between specific things
it's not going to matter
alright so colors there's like a million
and a lot of the times when working with
CSS it's very convenient to just look up
a reference and rather than memorizing
everything
for example w3schools comm has a lot of
great references most people don't like
using it for like instructional manual
or whatever but it's great for
references I think so I like it I use it
whatever if you don't like it that's
okay so let's take a look at these
colors as you can see it has a huge list
of color names and a bunch of other
stuff that we're going to ones now so be
like all kinds of crazy stuff so I could
be like corn fat
cornflower blue I need to know what that
is let's figure it out
cornflower blue well that is a nice blue
I like that blue so that is an example
of just different colors you can use so
there there's a lot and lots and lots
and lots of properties and selectors and
values and a total of declarations is
just a huge number for example you could
have color with every single possibility
here so there's a lot of stuff don't
expect to memorize at all like you may
just one day need a certain color sandy
brown for example but unfortunately I
think learning the names is kind of dumb
so if you like the names I'm sorry well
I'm actually going to be going with red
green and blue codes to create custom
colors that oh that's really pretty that
we can pretty much make anything we want
so I don't really know what else to talk
about I don't know ramble on but three
main ways to make colors are the color
name hexadecimal I mean yeah hexadecimal
and red green and blue values which we
will be going over that in the next
video as well as hexadecimals in the
following video to understand exactly
how they work so look and just look at
these colors so yeah that is a lot of
stuff but this website is great for
referencing stuff for example I can just
search something alright let's search
search selectors
see and it just comes up right away and
when then we can uh view the different
selectors and all kinds of stuff so
that's great
this website is great for referencing so
that's all I have to say in this video
and in the next video we will be going
over something new so I will see you
that be sure to subscribe if you want to
support my youtube channel or if you're
viewing this somewhere else support me
and whatever way you can thank you and
have a nice day see you in the next
video and by the way just past 12 12
p.m. 12 a.m. I mean 11:59 p.m. so yet it
is now officially the next day so now
officially tomorrow which is actually
today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
