caleb the video maker and in this video
i'm going to be unboxing the logitech
c920 from B&amp;amp;H video it's a logitech
camera but i didn't buy from logitech
from launch detectives a hundred dollars
I gotta here for like 75 so yeah saving
some money alright so let's get started
alright so first things first gotta open
the box so hey let me get my knife here
alright i'm kidding i'm not gonna open
the box with a machete that's ridiculous
alright let's just open this box this
thing in here pretty good me a knife's
are useless alrighty here we go it's
finally open okay as you can see it
comes with many pieces of bubble wrap so
that's definitely worth the price
definitely a good investment I'll be
using those later for sure we got some
receipt here and within this box we have
a card which just advertises some other
stuff that they have on their on their
website and then finally we have the
actual logitech camera box so it comes
in a plastic sleeve be using that too so
saving all those materials and this is
what the box looks like
you
alright now we're going to open this so
yeah let's do that try and keep the Box
somewhat nice I hate destroying boxes so
let me just cut this tape here so here's
the box we toss that aside there it's
nothing else in there so it's all within
here and once again we can look back got
some chords just pull these two pieces
apart if I can I don't know there we go
there we go and plastic more junk
plastic we got the actual owners manual
right here which all open that and show
you real super quick all right so we
have a important information packet with
tons of information that's probably not
that important and then a set-up guide
which which has beautiful
black-and-white pictures for for all of
you fans out there who want to set up
your camera whoo sweet now for the best
part of all we can look at this piece of
paper okay napkin so here's the actual
web cam has a pretty long core to forget
what how long it was sure it says on
their website but I don't know
as this piece of plastic around here
which I'm sure you can take off so I'm
going to do that now as soon as I figure
out how
peels all the way around and then pull
this little piece out
this other little piece on the side you
can bend this open and there is another
piece of plastic which you can take off
so yeah this is what it looks like and
I'm gonna try putting it on tripod to
show you what that's like so here we
have this cute little tripod thing and
this can be screwed into here so it's
pretty self-explanatory thank you there
we go it's working there we go and from
here the camera can bend like this it's
pretty much all the movement it gets
this thing goes from here to about there
so it does not get a large range of
motion this piece down here can bend
from here all the way up to here so you
can pretty much get anywhere in front of
it the only thing is if you need to
rotate it you're going to have to turn
the whole thing this piece itself does
not rotate so this is the final product
and yeah so thanks for watching and I
will be sure to give a test video for
you guys to watch and I will see you in
the next video so be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
