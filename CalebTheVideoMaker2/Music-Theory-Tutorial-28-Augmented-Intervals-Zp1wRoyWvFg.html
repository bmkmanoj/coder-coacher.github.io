about a fourth interval that we will be
learning and it is called augmented
augmented it is represented with the
capital a now this is very similar to
the diminished but in a different kind
of way the diminished takes all the
lowest intervals with four minor and
perfect because perfect can only be
lowered any and then it lowered them
again
well augmented will take the highest
intervals and raise them for example
perfect in major it's going to take the
perfect in major intervals and increase
them a half step to create augmented
right right here we have a zero steps
and we increase it to one to create an
Augmented interval two increases the
three augmented and rule 4 to 5 5 to 6 7
8 9 to 10 11 to 12 12 to 13 that is the
basis of augmented intervals augmented
intervals are the creepiest of them all
they just kind of mess with your brain
and they kind of make things kind of
creepy kind of make things creepy here
so we have a sounds next 12 half steps
so C to C is an octave now what if we
increase this to an Augmented which has
13 cells like you're gonna get murdered
but anyways it resolves at the interval
sorry octave it's like resolved bad guy
comes to hero comes and then he kills
you
that's the basis of augmented intervals
and there's not really much more to it
so I guess I'm just gonna review what an
Augmented interval is well we take a
perfect or major or major a perfect
imperfect major major perfect
remember perfect made you major perfect
perfect major major perfect that's the
interval sizes for the one through eight
now we take those increase them a
half-step so instead of a perfect third
I mean a major third having four half
steps they don't have five it's actually
sounds kind of nice so yeah now when we
usually they'll sound bad for the
perfect for example and a unison
as an argument in unison and for a
perfect fifth perfect for you can hear
the difference let's change the sound of
it
see so save for an octave I just doesn't
sound frightening when it's on birthday
when it's on an a-sharp which has 13
half steps from the other day here it
doesn't really sound like it resolves
but if we press both A's this sounds
almost like OneNote
feeler is being resolved
it's resolved
so I think augmented intervals are
really cool that makes some really cool
sound effects like oh yeah I hope you
can get some information from this to
where you can actually have some fun on
instrument that's I really recommend
learning an instrument because I don't
learn this stuff to know it or teach it
I learned it to use it on a guitar piano
or vocals or I don't know anything
really so I don't want to encourage you
to go pick up an instrument and learn it
unless you want to but I do think this
will help you most and you'll learn it
the best if you are applying it to an
instrument if you don't know what
instrument try a piano because it's
visually easy to see the music theory on
it whereas a guitar it's kind of you
don't see the black keys you just see
frets up the board or like a trumpet you
only see like a trumpet and buttons
three of them so in the next video I'll
be going over all of this and some other
stuff so yeah see you there and
subscribe
