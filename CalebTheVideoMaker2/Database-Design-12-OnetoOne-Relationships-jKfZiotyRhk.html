video this one will be over one-to-one
relationships so a one-to-one
relationship basically just means that
one entity has a connection with one
other entity and that's all they can
have I like to think of a marriage so we
have a husband and wife this is a
one-to-one relationship because a
husband can have one wife and that wife
could have one husband the husband can't
have multiple wives and the wife the
wife can't have multiple husbands it's
one-to-one because one entity is limited
to one other entity this entity is also
limited to one other entity it's a
one-to-one relationship so another
example of a one-to-one relationship
would be a social security number all
right so a social security number in
America is basically just a unique
number every citizen is given there are
I think there's occasional repeats
although generally you think of a Social
Security number as being unique to one
person so we define it as a one-to-one
relationship even if there's
possibilities of being repeated data one
person only has one Social Security
number
generally that social security number is
only supposed to have one person so we
have a a person and then we have a
social security number one person has
one social security number one social
security number is assigned to one
person if you want to draw out your
relationships you can say person has
one Social Security number Social
Security number a sign I'm sorry yeah
okay so assigned to one person so a
person is assigned a social security
number
social security number is assigned to
one person we would not even though
there's a possibility that the social
security number might be repeated we
want to design it this way because
that's like saying the social security
number is supposed to be signed assigned
to multiple people it's not supposed to
it's supposed to be unique for the
person so we designed as a one-to-one
relationship we're going to be talking
about am it I want a many relationship
in the next video and then a
many-to-many relationship and after that
we'll be talking about how we design
this within a database how do we
structure our tables so this video is
just going to be talking about the
concept which we just did so that's
really all I have to say and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
