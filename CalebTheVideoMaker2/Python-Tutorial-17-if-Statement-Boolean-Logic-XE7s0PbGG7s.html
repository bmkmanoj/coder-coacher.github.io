continuation on how the if-statement
works now this video will be talking
about the concepts of logic or boolean
so that's and basically what that means
is true or false the only two options so
when we have a question the answer is
either true or false and if this concept
is new to you don't freak out don't
don't quit don't explode this will be
simple when you think of a comparison
question 5 is less than 7
well this this is the less than sign and
it's basically saying 5 is less than 7
the way I always remembered it in grade
school was like a little alligator think
of this as an alligator mouth the
alligator always wants to eat the bigger
number so 7 it is the greater than 5 or
you can think of the smaller and 5 is
less than 7
so yeah 5 is less than 7 or 5 is greater
than 7 that's that's basically a
comparison operator which we will be
talking about in a really soon upcoming
video so if we want this to be true
we would have to say 5 is less than 7
and that makes sense because it is see
it returns true now if we put 7 is less
than 5 well you can see that the
alligator is eating the smaller one so
that that doesn't make sense so this
will return false so 7 is less than 5
that's false so you can see there only
two possibilities are true or false now
the same concept works for if questions
so if we say if statement sorry if 5 is
less than 7
we wanted to say let's say if five is
less than seven we wanted to print true
so now this is asking if five is less
than seven so it's going to run this and
if it returns true which it will because
it is less than seven we want it to
print this is true so let's try it
oops I don't mean to put that three and
let's try it again
so we have press ENTER and it returns
this is true so basically it's a
question on whether or not this is true
so we learned that the only two
possibilities are true or false so the
if statement questions if it's true if
it's true it does something if it's not
true it doesn't do something so if five
is less than seven if this is true we
want it to print this is true I know I'm
just repeating what I just said I'm just
explaining how it works it tests if this
is true or not and when we press ENTER
if it's true it is true and it runs the
code now what if it's false let's try it
let's copy this down here and let's say
if five is greater than seven it tests
this to see if it's true if it's false
it doesn't do anything see nothing
happened now with the else statement the
else statement will say if it's false we
want it to do something else
so now if five is greater than seven
which five is not greater than seven we
know it's false and this should be
printed let's try it and it printed this
is false so we were correct now this
process applies the same when we use
variables so in the previous video here
me make some more our age is equal to or
a husband sixteen I should say now when
we say if age is greater than nineteen
we want it to say you are in your 20s or
above I'm sorry so now it's going to
test this to see if it's true if age is
greater than 19 well when we insert the
value 1616 is greater than nineteen that
comes back false so therefore we need to
it's not going to do anything you see
now if we add the else statement which
is what we need to do we could say
I'm not calling you guys old if you're
over 19 I'm just just making an example
now it tests this to see if it's true
age is greater than 19 it returns false
so it goes to the else and it prints you
are young so basically that is how the
if statement works it's a true or false
so hopefully that was helpful and in the
next video we will be talking more about
comparisons so be sure to stick around
and I will see you then be sure to
