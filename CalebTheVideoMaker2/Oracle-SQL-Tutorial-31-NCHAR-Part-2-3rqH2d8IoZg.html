Caleb the video maker to welcome back to
your oracle SQL tutorial series and I
know I'm overdue for a haircut but
you're just gonna have to deal with it
for a little while now so this video is
going to be a continuation of the end
char datatype that's because I just had
a couple few more little things that I
wanted to explain before we move on to
the next datatypes the first thing is
that when you declare an int char for
example an char 50 this is always going
to be talking about characters that
means the char and byte keywords do not
apply for this datatype now we've
mentioned that the in char data type
uses unicode but remember that oracle
has multiple unicode character sets so
what character scent does inshaa use
that is a very good question and I'm
gonna answer it
so when you declare a database you give
it a character set and what's known as a
national character set the national
character set defines what character set
all of the n data types are but
fortunately for me as the teacher
there's only two options and those
options are a l16 utf-16 and utf-32 it's
one of these do you want to use well I'm
actually not gonna go in a whole lot of
detail with that that's because if you
want to know all of the details you can
go to the Oracle Docs page and find tons
of articles on globalization of your
software I will tell you though that
this one is the default and usually the
default is the default for a reason it's
because it's the one you're going to
want to use most of the time now in a
previous video I mentioned that the char
and n char data types are sometimes not
recommended for use why is that and the
reason is for example char it's actually
just stored as a bar chart too with
padding there's not an underlying
difference differentiating char from
varchar' besides the fact that if you
make a char all of the things are going
to be the same length so what I mean is
that the varchar' column is not going to
take up extra space or be slower and
because of that it's not very beneficial
to use the char datatypes and the same
thing works for the N char datatypes
now I also mentioned that the end
types so that includes n char and n VAR
char two are sometimes not recommended
and that's just because some software
systems do not work with them quite as
well but a good situation when you would
want to use the N char to column is if
your database is of some character set
other than Unicode and you have to store
Unicode characters somewhere in your
database in that situation that's
exactly what the n VAR char two column
would be used for but the char and n
char data types they are not really
recommended or needed for any really
good reason and now before you get mad
for me wasting your time teaching about
these useless data types you have to
realize that most of this information is
foundational for the varchar' 2 and n
VAR char two data types so that's really
all I gotta say about char and in char
hopefully the last few videos have been
helpful in the next video we'll be
moving on to something new so thanks
guys for sticking with it and I'll see
you in the next video and as always
