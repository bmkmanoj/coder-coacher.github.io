maker to this video we are going to be
talking about the insert statement so
this is a very good milestone in SQL
we've talked about all the create table
garbage and now we're moving on to
putting data into those tables now what
are we going to do with all this junk
though we want to keep that so what I
want to do is save it as a script so you
can click file and save it I obviously
already saved it as animal dating site
which that works fine for me now I'm
going to actually create a new script by
clicking new query and then I'm going to
save that this will allow us to have a
level of separation from the stuff we
used to create the tables and then the
stuff we use to insert data into those
tables so the insert statement as you
may have guessed it starts with insert
and then we have to say into and then
put the table we want to insert data
into now before I start typing stuff in
here we need to figure out what table is
the most parent of them all so let's go
back to our create table statements you
can see in here we are creating the
species table first that's because the
other tables are going to reference this
table it works the same way with rows we
need to create the parent rows before we
create the child rows so let's go back
to our insert statement and then we are
going to say species because that is the
table we need to start with the next
thing you do is use the values keyword
and then in parentheses you pass in
values this is going to require you to
know what columns are in this table so
the easiest way to do that if you do not
have this available is to go into your
object Explorer and then find that table
species and then click columns we have
an ID species and a friendly name int
varchar' and bar char so let's put some
data in there let's go with one this and
then the friendly name which will be
bunny notice that we separate each value
by commas here's a comma and here's a
comma so just like when we create tables
we separate columns by commas the same
thing happens when we are inserting data
so to go over these this is the ID this
is the genus
and this is the species and this is the
friendly name now you might look at this
and say this is a violation of things
being atomic that's because we are
storing the genus and the species inside
a one-column
but you know Yolo oh great excuse just
just don't say that if you're at a job
they ask you why you did something
please don't say Yolo anyways let's
insert this but wait I wanted to show
you something you could actually get rid
of this one here and that's because that
is the identity column and it will know
that we want to automatically generate a
value for that row so let's run this
thing one rows affected is the response
so now we can go into object Explorer
find that species table and then we can
right-click it you can see that there's
two options select top 1,000 rows and
edit top 200 rows so you can click
either one and you can see the data pops
up and it automatically generated an ID
for us which is one so that's pretty
cool now let's go back to our query and
we will end that with a semicolon and
now this is the perfect time to show you
how foreign Keys help protect our
integrity let's try inserting data into
the animals table in certain animals
values and once again we don't need the
ID but we do need to know what columns
go here so let's go to our object
Explorer click animals columns we need
an ID skip that one we need the name the
species ID and the contact email if you
want you can dock this so that way you
can see it as you're working so let's go
through these first one is ID which we
can skip the next is the name which we
will say is sali
then we will give it a species ID which
we will say is 2 and then finally a
contact email which is going to be this
now note string start and end with a
single quote and numbers do not have
quotes let's run this little section and
see what happens and you can see here
there is an error the foreign key
protects us from inserting invalid data
you can also see here that the
constraint name shows up that is why
some people like to name their
constraints so when an error is thrown
they
exactly where to look so a lesson you
can learn from this is to always use
foreign keys now what if we want to
insert two values at one time let's say
we want to insert two animals into this
table let's try that but first I'm going
to correct this ID so it'll actually let
us insert some data but the way you do
it is just put a comma after this and
then you can put more data in another
set of parentheses so I'm going to break
this down to the next line just so it's
a little easier to read we will say
Franklin and maybe someday we can add a
ID for turtles but for now we'll just
use a rabbit there we go
now we should be able to insert both of
these values at one time let's execute
this make sure it works two rows
affected so you can see that they were
actually both inserted and the way you
can see this is by right clicking the
animals table and clicking edit top 200
rows you can see here we have Sally and
Franklin and the IDS were automatically
generated
note that the ID of one is not in here
it's perfectly okay to have missing
numbers for the IDS or for them to be
out of order as long as they're all
unique so that is all for the insert
statement if you want one last look at
it here it is nice and beautiful so
thanks guys for watching in the next
video we will be talking about something
even cooler so thanks guys I will see
