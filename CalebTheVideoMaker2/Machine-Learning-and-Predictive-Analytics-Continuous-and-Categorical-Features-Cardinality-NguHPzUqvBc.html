some of the machine learning concepts we
are going to specifically talk about
cardinality in this video now
cardinality is a number that actually
tells a lot of information it is the
total options for a particular feature
and two different kind of ways to
measure it one is total possible options
and then one is total options that you
have in your data set so the easiest one
to start with is let's talk about
something that is binary right so if
something is binary this means it's in
two states so the cardinality of this
would be two an example of this is sex
so sex could be male or female this is
binary because there's only two options
now if we are counting the cardinality
of a particular feature in our data set
and everybody's a male well we would say
that this feature has a cardinality of
one and it's no longer binary and that's
because every single row has that value
so you can kind of think of the other
value not existing if that makes any
sense probably not but it kind of makes
sense because if you think about it if
all of the people in our data set are
males then there's no females in our
reality that we're making with our data
set sometimes things aren't binary
though and they have more options so for
example if we had information about
where someone lives one of the features
could be their state and this would have
the cardinality of 50 but you know if we
took all of the people and no one lived
in to Hawaii for example well then our
cardinality for our data set would be 49
for that particular feature so you can
see that this one is like the total
possible values and this one is the
actual amount represented in our data
set and this is the one that we are
going to care about sometimes it's not
that sim
you don't have a very small number those
features are generally known as
continuous features well we had before
where there's a few number of options
those are known as categorical so all
features can fit within one of these
groups either categorical or continuous
an example of a continuous feature may
be something like
salary for salary someone might earn 65
100 another person might earn 65 101 and
it gets to the point where the number of
instances or rows is very similar to the
cardinality of salary so for example we
might have 50 thousand rows and
everyone's earnings for like the last
year there might be forty two on one
hundred and eighty two different values
in that data set so you can see that the
number of different values is extremely
high oh shoot I totally forgot to turn
my blazingly bright light bulbs on oh
wow that looks so much about the same
hopefully this video helped you
understand the difference between
categorical and continuous features this
is going to come up again in the future
right now it seems like Oh what does
this have to do with anything but trust
me it will make sense once we start
talking about algorithms the cardinality
is going to have a huge impact so thank
you for watching in the next video we're
going to be talking about something
called Binnie so please be sure to check
it out and be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
