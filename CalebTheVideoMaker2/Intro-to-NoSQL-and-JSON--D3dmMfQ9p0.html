video maker to this video I'm going to
be talking about the fast track
conference that I spoke at the other
week I'm going to go over some of the
things I learned and also I'm going to
actually give a little lesson over the
presentation I did but I'm going to go
in as much depth as I feel necessary
well this conference it was about beta
it was called fast track your data
hosted by IBM and one of the things that
was continually brought up throughout
this conference was that the idea of
unlocking your data or getting access to
more data that comes through your
company and essentially what that means
is a company has access to a lot of data
going in and going out and all that can
get stored in databases but then almost
all of it gets archived and is never
used for actual business decisions so
the goal of this conference was to teach
business people and also developers and
software people how to take more data
from every day and use that to make
business decisions so one of the keynote
speakers Hilary Mason she was talking
about big data briefly so the term big
data I'm probably going to slaughter her
definition but I think essentially what
she was saying is big data is getting
all your data in one location so you can
run queries on that data and when you
can do that you can run analytics
analytics allow us to make good business
decisions so that was the goal of the
conference now other than that there was
a lot on analytics and machine learning
machine learning is when you teach a
computer how to analyze analytics and
then teach the computer to either do
things with that data or tell you things
to do with that data it basically gives
the computer a new layer of intellect if
you want to think about it that way so
the trip was fun I learned a whole lot
unfortunately on my way there I my
flight was canceled so I was like an
hour and a half late and I was supposed
to be there like a day or
and on my way home I missed a connection
flight so traveling with a little
stressful but besides being a grouchy
restless zombie the whole time it was
great my segment was talking about db2
which is the IBM database and also I
figured out has been rebranded to
lowercase B so db2 like that and
specifically I was talking about non
structured data I was only on stage for
a couple minutes so I didn't have a
whole lot of time to go in real depth so
the point of this video is to basically
turn this into a class on what non
structured data is why it's helpful and
how to use that inside of a db2 database
so let's get started hopefully you enjoy
so to begin it's important to understand
the difference between structured and
non structured data so structured data
is what we are so used to this is based
off of the relational model and we talk
about a relation we are talking about a
table so relation is just a fancy word
that means table and the table is broken
up into columns and rows so it looks
something like this and up at the top we
put the columns of the data we want to
store so every column will have sort of
like a column header so we can have this
for like a users table we can have a
name or a first name and then we could
have a last name and then maybe an email
and this is essentially the blueprint
for the structure of our data every
single instance of that blueprint has to
follow this structure an instance is put
inside of a row so our first user would
go here
that is an instance of our structure for
this table and every single row has to
follow that structure but what if some
punk comes in here and he's like hey I'm
going to like put data in here that
doesn't quite fit so someone comes in
here and tries to put some more data in
here so it follows the structure of the
table so far but then he goes in here
and you want to put in some extra data
and he put the phone number in there you
can see now that this data no longer
fits the structure of our table and this
is the problem and you're not going to
be able to insert that data in order to
fix this you need to issue an alter
statement and this is like the prime
evil of all SQL statements because it's
just for one it's computationally
expensive imagine having like millions
of rows and then you want to alter the
structure of the data that's a bad idea
additionally it can leave you with null
which is basically the absence of values
and generally these are frowned upon
it's if you can avoid them it's usually
best so let's say we alter this table
and we go up here and we add a column
for the phone
well the issue now is that these old
rows like this one up here it doesn't
have a phone number so it's just going
to be replaced with no so now we're
going to have a null for every single
row except that new one that has extra
data so that's just really really bad
and the reality is sometimes we don't
know what the structure of the data is
going to be or if the structure of the
data regularly changes then having these
structured tables is just like really
bad idea
so that's where non structured data
comes out so non structured data you're
allowed to have basically any structure
for a specific piece of data so this row
can have three columns essentially but
this row could have four columns and
that's okay
and that'll be more concrete once we go
into actually doing this in the database
which I'll do in just a couple minutes
but for now just try to think about this
essentially what non structured data
allows us to do
is extend a road to have extra data or
shrink a road to have less data without
having to change the general structure
of our data that make sense kind of a
little bit well one of the ways to
represent non structured data is with
JSON
now there's also XML but xml's like
barely crappy so for a JSON is basically
a standard so as long as the way we
interchange data follows a standard then
it's much easier to communicate between
systems and as a developer you don't
have to worry so much about the data
structure all you got to really think
about is hey is this JSON oh it is
awesome I can use that data or hey is
this JSON oh no it's not well then got
in my life so what we're going to do is
we are going to represent some data with
JSON and then we are going to insert
that into a db2 database now in db2
database actually supports both
structured or relational data and non
structured or non-relational data so you
can kind of use those terms
interchangeably relational is a
structured data and then non-structured
you could say non-relational and
basically i just means it doesn't follow
a table structure now no unstructured
data is kind of grouped into an
overarching term no SQL which I believe
stands for not only structured query
language but kind of getting off topic
there so let's just move on to the
actual demo where I'm going to show you
guys what I showed everyone at the
conference but now that we have this to
preface it it'll make a lot more sense
so let's get started with that
all right so I'm on my desktop and
before I go in start programming and
doing stuff in db2 I wanted to talk
briefly about what JSON is good for well
it's kind of like the language used to
talk between two applications so if you
have one application and you want it to
talk to another app
location you can often use JSON as the
language that they both understand and
they can talk back and forth through
what is known as an API which stands for
application programming interface so
it's like the interface between two
applications so just to show you what
that might look like here is some JSON
from an API and you can see that it kind
of looks kind of gross just a bunch of
like symbols and stuff but this is
actually a lot simpler than some
different ways to communicate between
languages such as XML I mentioned
briefly earlier this is actually very
lightweight so it's really good because
all it really has is the keys which are
these things on the left and then the
values which are the things on the right
so JSON is just a sequence of key value
pairs and with that you can format
basically any data you want you can have
simply a key value which that would be
the equivalent of a column inside of a
structured table or you can also have an
array so this little square bracket is
the start of an array and you can see
there's one workspace inside of this
array it's not so important that you
understand every single thing about how
to structure JSON all that really
matters to us is is it JSON or is it not
JSON if it's JSON we can work with it if
it's not JSON then too bad so it's a
standard and it allows apps to talk to
one another so now that we understand
what JSON looks like let's talk a little
bit about db2 so this is db2 okay so
that's not the home page normally it
would be like right
here there okay so when you open db2
it's going to look a little something
like this this is where you can run SQL
to talk to your database but you can
also do it inside of a web browser so if
you go up here and click these little
three lines and then click data
connection details you can click this
link right down here and that'll open a
browser and you can actually sign in
through the browser and do everything
inside of the browser which is pretty
cool the tool you are looking at right
now is data server manager and that is
kind of like your one tool to do
everything with db2 what I'm going to be
focusing on is running sequel or SQL
inside of here but you can also do
things such as administer your database
or you can monitor your database or you
can configure settings if you're into
that what we are going to need for this
example is some JSON so there's this
tool out there called JSON link and it
looks a little something like this and
why this is good is because this tool
will tell you if you have valid JSON so
you can see here I threw some JSON in
here that I wrote and you can actually
scroll down here and click validate and
it will say valid and as long as it's
valid we know we can work with that data
we don't really have to worry about what
data is itself so we are going to use
this throughout the example so I'm going
to copy that and then just X out of that
because we're not going to need it
anymore
so what are our goals our goals are to
create a table that can store JSON then
we want to insert and then we want to
select that data just to show you how
simple it is to insert and get that data
back out so the very first thing is
creating a table so we're going to say
create table and we can name it whatever
we want and then inside of parenthesis
we're going to name all of the columns
and then we're going to have one column
JSON data now this is going to store all
of our non structured data the cool part
here though is that you can actually
store non structured and structured data
inside of one table so for example I
could go up here and add a
another column like ID and make that up
type int and that is structured data
because we're basically saying every
single row inside this table that has
this JSON data is also going to have an
ID that is adding required structure to
our data but we're not going to do that
right now just for simplicity we're just
going to focus on the JSON data so when
we have a column that stores JSON we use
a format called blob now a blob column
is used to store binary data but JSON is
not binary we are actually going to
convert it to a binary format known as
binary JSON or beasts on and essentially
what that does is allows the database to
work with the JSON much faster so we are
going to run this and you can actually
run it using ctrl s and yes even on a
Mac it is ctrl s and you can see that
that created the table the next thing
we're going to want to do is insert data
into that table so we're going to go in
here and I'll zoom in a little bit just
so it's easier to see we're going to say
insert into custom data which is the
name of our table and then we're going
to say values and then inside of
parentheses we're going to give all of
the values now we're only going to give
one value because we only have one
column the column is JSON data so we
want to give a value for that column and
the way that works is we just pass in
all of that JSON but we have to use a
built-in function and I'll explain why
in just a minute
but you're going to want to put sis
tools dot JSON to be saan and then
parentheses this function is actually
going to take our JSON and convert it
into that binary format I was talking
about earlier binary JSON so all we have
to do in here is paste our JSON inside
of quotes paste that right there and
this is kind of what it looks like if
you can see that is the entire statement
we can run this and you can see here
that it inserted successfully but the
great part here is that this is non
structured data so we can format the
data however we want so typically the
data inside of this group members
be kind of mapped to a user table for
example and it would have one column
name with non structured data though we
can essentially add columns to this
individual row so a better word would
probably be fields or attributes we're
adding attributes to this specific group
member so we can go in here and add a
comma and then add another attribute in
JSON this attribute is called a key so
we changed the structure and when we
insert it it still works and the great
part is is if you had a structured table
that wouldn't work you can't just add a
column like that it would break it so
we've got the data in there how do we
actually go about getting that data back
out we need to create a select statement
so we need to say select and at this
point we're going to use another
built-in function so sis tools dot beefs
on to JSON that's going to convert our
data back and then we want to select it
from custom data which is our table name
inside of these parentheses we need to
pass in the column that is in binary
JSON format which was JSON data so let's
run this and make sure it works this
gives us a result set so when we click
that you can see that both rows are able
to be inserted into the table and
retrieved but they don't have the same
structure and that is the cool part
about this now non structured data is
not something revolutionary db2 did not
invent this this has been around with
other database systems but the great
part is is that if you are using vb2
with structured data it's super easy to
also use non structured data you can use
them both at the same time now it's
pretty cool that you can do this inside
of SQL like this but the reality is as a
developer you're often going to want to
work with the database through an
application using a programming language
so there is a github example showing you
how to do this so you can go to the URL
github.com slash db2 - samples
/ db2 no js' and inside of here there is
an file index j s and you scroll down
all the way to the bottom and this is
probably going to change by the time you
guys see this but look at here and you
can see how they are inserting JSON data
using the SIS tools dot JSON two beasts
on and I'm not going to go through all
of this but you can see that within just
a couple lines they're able to insert
and select that data back out so it's
super simple I would encourage you to
give it a try just to get the experience
of using non structured data in db2 if
you do want to give it a try I think the
free version is officially branded as
the Community Edition so when you go on
the interwebs search db2 community and
you'll be able to find it that way I'll
also try to throw a link down in the
description so you can go directly to
download it in conclusion you need to
have a balance between structured and
non structured data non structured data
is not at all a replacement for
structured data we have been using
structured data for like forever don't
consider non structured data a
replacement for all structured databases
because sometimes it's nice to have some
structure in your life
there's times for structure enzymes for
non structured so consider the non
structured data augmenting our
development experience not
revolutionising and changing everything
I guarantee you you're still going to
want to use structured data when you're
developing apps and with that with like
db2 you can combine structure to non
structured data inside of one table so
they're able to be worked with together
very easily once you have this non
structured data it allows you to scale
your business and your software much
faster and when you can do that you're
able to analyze the data you have easier
because your data is easily accessed and
it's up-to-date and everything is just
nice so when you get to that point
you're able to start using that data to
make wiser business this
so yeah guys hopefully you enjoyed this
video and if you would like to see the
actual presentation I did at the
conference I believe there's a video
floating around somewhere here on the
interwebs so I will try to find that and
put the link in the description and also
if anybody wants me to like speak
anywhere like totally be up for it
because a lot of fun I didn't get
murdered and you know school is cool so
keep that in mind if you guys are
considering people for future
presentations so thanks guys and I'll
see you in the next video and be sure to
subscribe thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
