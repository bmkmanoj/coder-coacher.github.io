it is caleb from caleb the video maker -
and this is your first video over DB -
now DB - is a database that was created
by IBM historically it's been marketed
largely towards enterprise customers so
think you know companies that have more
data than they would ever possibly know
what to do with but lately they've been
focusing a lot more on developers so
they've given new features and new
additions to meet the needs of
developers like me and you to make sure
we are all on the same page let's answer
the question what is a database the
classic example of a database is a user
using some application and just be
warned I literally have the worst
drawing skills of all time so here's
some user using an application and when
he types information in there it's going
to get stored inside of a database and
this is kind of like the typical drawing
for a database except way better so he
inputs info and that's stored in a
database so the database is usually
hidden from the user and then when this
user comes back and accesses that
application at a later time we can
actually get that information back from
the database display it on the
application which will be seen by the
user so this kind of setup here is good
for transactional data so if I said
something like we're doing transactional
processing I want you to think
input/output
updating deleting so this user inserts
data he gets that data back out the
other use for a database is analytics
analytics looks at all of the data or
parts of the data rather than just one
insert or one select so the analytics
are used to make business decisions
running analytics will give us averages
you know trends all of that good stuff
and we can use that to shape the
direction of where we're taking our
company if customers like one thing but
don't like something else well we can
match our company and our content with
what they like so these are the two
primary uses for databases and
fortunately db2 is suitable for both of
these we're going to start with
transactional processing but db2 is
some when it comes to analytics
generally though if you're new to
databases you will want to start with
transactional so that's learning how to
work with data how do we insert data
into a database how do we get the data
back out how do we update it and how do
we delete it
db2 is well known as a relational
database and what that means is it works
with structured data the other kind of
data out there is unstructured data just
like db2 works well with transactional
and analytical processing db2 does
support both structured and unstructured
data and if you're new to databases
that's probably not going to make any
sense at all so the easiest way to
illustrate this is with a very simple
example when we are working with a
relational database we represent our
data in tables so this is a table and
it's going to have a name for example
users and then we're going to have
columns these columns define the
structure of our data every single user
in here is going to have a structure
made by this table so a user ID first
name and last name this is structured
data unstructured data does not follow
table rules we are going to start with
treating db2 as a relational database so
we are going to learn about creating
tables and the columns the rows and how
to connect tables and all that stuff but
as you get more advanced you can work
with unstructured data inside a db2 it's
generally well known today that if
you're going to have any successful
application or business you are going to
need a database that being said I do
just want to take a couple seconds to
focus on the basics and really think why
do we need a database and I have two
good reasons the first one is security
so the security capabilities with the
database are tremendous a general rule
in computer science is that you don't
trust anyone ever for anything so with a
database you can be very specific about
who gets to see what the other thing is
scalability this refers to the
capability of expanding your data layer
of your application or business so as
your company grows db2 has many
additions that allow you to scale up to
even an enterprise edition so we talked
about a couple things for general
databases security and scalability but
now let's talk a little bit about db2
and why you would want to use
that the very first reason why I like
db2 is that there's a free version and
as you all know I'm a total tightwad the
other reason is something called Blu
acceleration this deals with the
analytic side of db2 I mentioned a
little bit ago that db2 has some awesome
things when it comes to analytics well
this is specifically what I was
referring about this is an in-memory
processor so essentially we bring our
data into RAM and then we can run crazy
fast analytics on our data there's a
plethora of other reasons why I think
db2 is a good database so if you are
starting a project and you're trying to
decide what database to go with go with
db2 on top of that this series is going
to give you the foundation needed to
build a db2 database if you guys have
any questions concerns or comments just
leave them in the comments below and I
will do my best to get back to you on
top of that I created blog posts for
these videos so I will put the link to
that in the description finally if you
actually want to give db2 a try I'll put
the link to get that in the description
as well be sure to subscribe because
there's going to be a lot of great
content coming out we doing some
concepts stuff up here and then some
coding down on the the computers we get
you know the concepts and the practical
we get you know the comp super excited
hopefully you guys are as well and as
always be sure to subscribe and I'll see
you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
