keyboard when explaining this because I
think it's a little better I'm going to
be going over a new type of interval
quality and it's called diminished here
are our intervals we have learned major
perfect minor and our learning
diminished you may have may or may not
have heard that it's represented with a
lowercase D minor is represented with a
lowercase M perfect with the capital P
major with the capital in suite so what
is diminished exactly well if we take
let me actually get a new color black if
we take minor or perfect minor are
perfect and lower them a half step we
get diminished so ten would become nine
so we take this minor 10 becomes 98
becomes 7 3 becomes 2 1 becomes 0 now we
can also do it with the perfect ones so
minor and perfect not major imperfect
minor imperfect so it's it's taken the
already dropped once and dropping the
meter farther so now 12 can become 11-7
can become 65 can become 40 can become
negative 1 and yes that's impossible
let's give an example c2g sounds nice
doesn't it
it's a perfect fifth with seven half
steps can you see one two three four
five six seven nobody calls me and when
they do it's like in the middle of my
videos really guys really it's probably
Claire see 2 g's perfect fifth with
seven half steps now what if we take
those seven half steps and make them six
becomes a diminished interval and it
sounds super depressing but it doesn't
quite sound minor here's a minor sound
miners cut is sad but not quite
depressing hopefully that makes sense
whereas a perfect fit it's like there's
some kind of tension that's just like
ruining your life
doesn't sound scary it does a little but
it's more of a gross sad kind of feeling
that is the basis of a diminished
interval we can do that for mine or two
for example that's the basics of minor
pretty much everything and you know
about minoring for now so in the next
video we'll be talking about something
even cooler all right these discs a
cooler and cooler don't they see ya
subscribe to my youtube channel follow
me on twitter subscribe to my youtube
channel and follow me on twitter goodbye
we have the diminished right here the
minors in green and the perfect sand
majors in green i mean in red saree so
now there's only one more type of
interval that we need to learn and
that's what we will be addressing in the
next video so subscribe and I'll see you
then
