I'm going to take a break we'll take a
break from talking about inputs and
stuff like that as you can see we have
completed our registration form
pretty much anything you're going to
need for a registration form now I want
to talk about something new if you're
new to this or whatever you may not have
heard of it but otherwise you probably
have so it's a dip so what is a div well
I think it stands for division like you
divide up your website it's used to
break up different pieces of your
website so for example I could already
have it already started if here sorry I
could put this entire form within a dish
right here then I can like close the div
and I'm pretty sure I have a mistake in
my HTML somewhere because if I close
this div it also closes the fieldset and
form which is clearly after the closing
point so I'm not sure what I messed up
but I can't seem to find it so hopefully
I find it out or if you notice something
like a mistake I have done please let me
know but as you can see this field set
points down to the field it stops at the
div for some reason instead of going
down to the field set so I don't know
why it's doing that but hopefully that's
not detrimental to my entire website but
if you do find that in a actual website
I do recommend you figure it out and
don't just let it pass like I am right
now but this is a div so now I just have
this entire thing within a division
let's look at the top again right where
is it where is it oh yeah there you go
so this is the div so now we can
actually break up the website into more
divs
if we wanted so we could have which this
is not going to do anything cause you
can't see it but if let's say you
registered and when you were edgers
registering they
have a part at the top that has a list
of links you may have an unordered list
dang a nice ticket typing and then list
items within this list and these could
be anchor tags thirst seconds so
obviously when you go to a website
usually the links are displayed
horizontally rather than vertically
although that is something you do with
CSS you would not do that with HTML but
you can't put the content within a div
like this and I screwed up the href here
it should look like this
so that's just a good example of links
and then you may have something down at
the bottom as well for a footer that
links to like like a you know the boring
stuff no one cares about see like terms
of service queue and et Cie I can't
think of anything else and then that can
go down in the footer of the website you
know what I mean
well that's an example of what you can
do what they did and then with CSS you
can actually style these divs so you can
break them apart you can break this into
a new section and put it over on to the
side as a side bar or develop different
parts of your website also it divs you
may just need to segregate certain parts
and divs will come in useful
because it doesn't actually display
anything within the code well if I put
everything in paragraph tags it actually
affects the website visually but divs
it's all behind the scenes
you could put 40 divs and close the divs
and nobody's gonna know the difference
it looks like okay changed a little bit
but oh wait a minute here all right that
wasn't because of the divs I don't think
I just didn't refresh it so div and if
so now if i refresh it nothing happens I
can add a million more if I really
wanted or I can nest them you can nest
divs so I can have within a day of I
could have a div and with initiative I
could have a div now obviously I'm not
really showing very good uses of a div
that's because all we really have is a
registration form and I'm about to go on
to CSS but I just want to explain what
it did was before we started using CSS
because it's commonly used and I figured
it'd be best if you knew what we were
going to use to style our website now
when we get into CSS I'm going to be
going over the basics we're not
necessarily going to be designing a
website and doing the layout and all
that I'm going to be talking about
designing your text and your text boxes
in simple underlining text align very
basic CSS to get you started and then
we'll see where we go from there so yeah
in the next video I'll be talking about
one more thing with HTML and then we
will be on to our CSS so thank you for
watching please share this series with a
friend or a professor or anybody and
tell them that I'd be very interested in
them watching it and giving me feedback
thank you and I think that's all I'll be
