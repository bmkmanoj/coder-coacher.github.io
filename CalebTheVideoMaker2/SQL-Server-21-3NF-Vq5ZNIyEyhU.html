maker oh right that's like for two every
stinking time i make a video
my dog drinks welcome back to give the
video maker to this video we are going
to be covering the third normal form of
database normalization now the first
rule of third normal form is that it's
already in second normal form so go make
sure you watch the previous video and
also the video before that before we
dive in the third normal form let's
refresh our memories on the term
dependency this is when something
depends on something else
the example I gave to describe a
dependency is when you have an entity
and an attribute describing that entity
you can say that this attribute is
dependent on the entity so this entity
will have a primary key let's just say
it's an ID and then an attribute of I
don't know name you'll often see these
dependencies drawn with an arrow like
this meaning that when you change the ID
the name will change as well because
it's a different person or different
whatever so 7 Caleb 8 might change into
something else that's because we're
talking about a different entity so
essentially all we're saying is that all
of the columns essentially all we are
saying is that all of the columns inside
of a table depend on the primary key of
that row or whatever the table is about
so if we have a user's table you can say
that all of the columns depend on the
user and we'll often describe the user
using the primary key so we would say
all the columns are dependent on the
user ID that kind of dependency is okay
there's other kind of dependencies that
are not okay for example in the last
video we talked about partial
dependencies well in this video we are
going to discuss a type of dependency
known as a transitive dependency a
transitive dependency is when something
depends on something which depends on
the primary key so you get this bouncing
kind of arrow thing so I don't know no
sense at all so the easiest way to
explain this is just to go through an
example we're going to continue to use
the exam
of our animal dating site and going back
to first normal form we set up a small
database where we had animals or
basically user accounts on this website
and then we also had interests so a
animal could sign up and then say the
different types of animals that they're
interested in so the structure was
something like this
we had the animals table and then we had
an interests table one of the columns in
here was an animal ID the other column
was an individual interest so the
columns might be ID name species and
then let's give some data for this so
we'll have an animal with the idea 16
named Sally and the species will be
bunny and this bunny has interests in
other animals so we add a row to this
interest table referencing that ID so
it's a 16 and thing is interested in
bunnies and then also 16 and gerbil so
this is our table structure so far and
there's really not anything wrong with
this table structure so where does third
normal form come in well if we were to
add columns to this interests table you
might run into some transitive
dependencies for examples here we have a
species name but it's really just a
friendly species name because you know
if you looked up different species
specifically they're gonna have these
long scientifical names that describe
them so let's say we want to store the
actual species and the friendly name so
we're going to alter this table a little
bit and we'll say interest species then
we'll say the friendly name so we can
move these friendly names over here to
this column then in here we can put some
crazy scientifical names
cuniculus my biology teacher would be so
proud and there we go now we can know
exactly the species that this animal is
interested in because you know you say
bunny that's very vague there's like
four trillion bunnies so if we say or
richtig us connect us then we know
exactly what the bunny is interested in
this is where we introduced a problem
though that's because there's a
transitive dependency in this table this
friendly name actually depends on the
interest and the interest depends on the
animal ID so you can see there's like
two dependencies in a row and by this
the friendly name still depends on the
animal ID think back to math class when
they say something like a is less than B
which is less than C therefore a is less
than C that's kind of how it works
so this friendly name is dependent on
the animal ID but it's dependent through
another column so you can see the way we
have our database setup is just messy
how do we go about fixing this what you
need to do is take the column that this
column depends on in this case interest
species and break that off into its own
table and specifically we could just
take the species because that would be
more useful because why limit the table
to species that animals are interested
in when we could just make a table for
species so we need to do that over here
SonoSite species inside of here will
have a species ID and we'll store just
the genus and the species so say which
that's what that is
this is the genus and that's a species
and then we'll say friendly name now we
can add this as a row in this table now
in here we can replace this with a
reference to the species so we can get
rid of this column and this column for
now and now we'll have a column species
which references the species this animal
is interested in so we would just say 1
&amp;amp; 2 and if by chance we were to add more
rows to this all we would do is
species Oh an X would you be quiet gosh
so we can say 700 new I love you but be
quiet so we can say 17 - you can see
that this fixed our transitive
dependency because we're not having any
data about the species in this interest
stable and you can see up here this
might be an issue that's because if you
have like quadrillion species in here
this might be very redundant because
it's it's a very vague name so you may
want to break that off into like a
friendly name table or something along
the lines of that in addition to fixing
this problem we have the added benefit
of improving this table that's because
this species column can be replaced with
a reference to one of these rows so this
is a bunny so we could replace species
with one and now this just points to
this row right here and there you go
guys that is third normal form
hopefully that was nice and helpful and
you enjoyed that so if you did be sure

this channel because that really helps
me out thanks and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
