tutorial series now so far we have
covered a lot of information when it
comes to database design I know some of
you guys think I go into way too much
detail when it comes to database design
but personally I think it is
foundational to everything we do with a
relational database because of that I
got a couple more videos for you on
database design just the relationships
and the normal forums are not enough so
these upcoming videos are going to teach
you how to enforce certain rules on your
database to have the most data integrity
so that brings up a term for you guys
data integrity if you say somebody has
integrity you think of that person as an
honest person they're consistent you
know who they are they don't act
differently in different situations well
the same kind of thing can apply with
data so if we're talking about data
having integrity you can trust the data
to be accurate you're not gonna have any
kind of inconsistencies throughout your
database essentially with data integrity
you can just assure yourself that the
data you're working with is the most
up-to-date it's correct and it's
trustworthy this is an overarching term
for a couple different types of data
integrity so that's what we're going to
be talking about in the next three
videos and this one is the first one so
the very first type of integrity is
entity integrity a lot of this is going
to be review and pretty simple if you've
watched the rest of the series so don't
expect something that's completely
breathtaking but I am going to give you
some extra tips just to make sure you
truly understand the concepts and what
you should do to your database to ensure
your database is up to standards so
first off let me show you a bad example
of a database table here is an example
table for users let's throw some data in
here let's say we have an Amy we'll give
her the last name white and we'll say
your email is Amy at email com
now let's say we have another row here
and this is another Amy white with our
email Amy white at email com and this
brings up the interesting question is
this the same Amy with two emails or are
these two separate Amy's and in this
situation you can't really tell now when
we do our database design that we've
done in the last previous videos you
should know that you should never have
two rows describing the same entity so
my heart is telling me that these are
two separate Amy's from this table
there's not a very good way to
distinguish them unless you can say that
all these emails are unique and Amy's
not going to be going in here and making
multiple emails generally to enforce
uniqueness we need a primary key now a
primary key is just a column that has
unique data in every single row it also
determines how the data is structured in
your table often it's going to be sorted
by the primary key now generally I
suggest just using an ID field or a
column so I have like a user ID and then
just use generated numbers that count
upwards alternatively you can use what's
known as a natural key which has
real-world meaning such as an email you
could make all these emails unique
meaning you could individually pick an
Amy using their email if you didn't have
this user ID here or this email and you
wanted to talk about a specific Amy
white you can't because there's not
enough information to distinguish the
Amy White's so you always always always
need a primary key for the primary
purpose of making sure every single row
is unique in your table
now generally primary keys are going to
follow these three rules the data is
going to be unique which I just
mentioned the next thing is the data
must be not null and what that means is
you can't have the absence of a value so
let's say we brought this column back
and we had a one here but we didn't have
anything right there you would say that
this entry is null well that's
unacceptable for primary keys so you can
actually label a column as not null and
it will prevent you from leaving that
blank additionally you're probably going
to want to pick data that doesn't change
with this I generally avoid natural keys
such as emails because Amy might want to
go change your email and that's just
gonna ruin everything so generally I
like what's known as surrogate keys or
generated keys but if they do change
it's not the end of the world it's just
generally frowned upon that concludes
entity
integrity in conclusion it's literally
just saying we need a way to say this is
an entity and this is an entity not the
same entity you need to be able to
uniquely identify each entity inside of
a table if you want a one sentence
summary of all of that give a table a
primary key boom done
you understand entity integrity thank
you guys for watching in the next video
we are going to be talking about
referential integrity this is one that
is extremely important if you're going
to be working with complex relational
database systems that have multiple
tables db2 gives you a lot of ways to
protect the relationships between tables
so that's what we're gonna be talking
about in the next video
so catch it in oh and don't forget to

for some good links there'll be a link
to download db2 and also check out the
next video see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
