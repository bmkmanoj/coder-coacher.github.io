database tutorial series this video we
are going to be discussing indexes now
the easiest way to understand indexes is
let's just imagine you have a book right
and you want to find something in this
book what do you do well you could you
know go through it one page at a time
and try to find what you're looking for
right and eventually you're gonna find
something but maybe not exactly what
might not be the fastest way of doing
things cuz it's gonna take you a lot of
time so you use something that's known
as an index but basically you just pop
to the back and it's gonna be like oh
you're looking for this you need to go
to this page and so forth so that's the
easiest way to think of an index when it
comes to database design essentially an
index is going to take a column and it's
going to sort it in some way that you
want to sort it either ascending or
descending and then it's going to
basically have a reference to where that
data is so that means if you're going
through your table of users and you're
looking for a specific user name as long
as that user name column has an index on
it you can just type in the user name it
will alphabetically find it and then
it'll have a reference to wherever that
data is even if the table is not
organized alphabetically another way to
really grasp how useful indexes are is
to imagine life without indexes if you
don't have an index on a column and you
need to find a column using the Select
statement for example your database is
going to have to do what's known as a
table scan this is kind of similar to
looking through a book for something
page by page it'll essentially just go
one at a time through all of your rows
until it finds that data that's not the
way to do it if you have alphabetically
it's already going to know about where
your data is so it's a whole lot faster
now we need to answer a question what
should you index well thankfully Oracle
database is actually going to index some
stuff automatically for us one thing
that it will do that for is the primary
key
the primary key is something we're often
going to search for we're often going to
join tables using the primary key and
yeah so we always want to have an index
on the primary key basically Oracle is
going to do that for us by default
there's another thing that it will
automatically create an index for and
that's when we use what's known as they
call them attribute unique so kind of
like how you can tell a column to be not
null or what data type it is you can
also say unique and that's basically
saying every single row has to have a
unique value it's kind of like a primary
key but it's not the entity it's just an
attribute of the entity think of like an
email for a user account system the
chances are your email is going to have
to be unique so you might throw the
unique column attribute on that column
now I don't think Oracle does this by
default but another thing you should
consider having an index for are your
foreign keys and the primary reason I
suggest you do Bourne keys is similar to
why we have it for primary keys it's
because we use these keys to join data
so what is a joint let's go into that a
little bit so you have more of an idea
of what I'm trying to explain here let's
say you have two tables here one is like
a user account table and another is a
comment table you might have an
individual comment that has the inside
of the column of who posted it an ID of
seven but you don't have the ID of seven
memorized you don't know who that is
so what you can do is do a joint on
these tables and you can essentially
turn them into one table now it doesn't
actually store it as one table it only
presents it as one table and the way it
works is it combines the tables based on
some kind of similarity basically so for
example we might have a user up here
with the ID of seven and we might have a
comment down here
from the user with the ID of seven then
instead of having this as our table we
can have this
as you can see this is a much better way
to present this data because we know who
the comment is from you could also have
a user name here or whatever you can
combine things in so many different ways
and you could literally make an entire
series on just joints so that's all we
really need to talk about for now but
essentially anytime you're going to be
joining two tables very often you might
want to consider indexing the columns
that they share so this one has a user
ID and this one has a user ID and you
use those to kind of combine the tables
you're going to want to index those the
one up here in the user table that's
going to be a primary key which is
probably going to be indexed by default
but the one over here is going to be a
foreign key so you're going to need to
index that if you so desire let's go
through an example that's a little bit
better let's say we have this website
and basically the point of the website
is to send people good deals that are
going on on the internet so we might
send them some links to Amazon or to
eBay or some Black Friday sales
whatever's going on at the time we
essentially want to kind of get some
revenue share from them buying stuff so
we have like literally five trillion
rows of emails so we might want to
consider indexing these well we can
actually index these as a group and
index this entire thing and this is
going to make the query run at the
optimum speed this my friend is known as
a composite index these are going to be
very important when you're making your
queries because you're going to want
your queries to be as fast as possible
so you might be wondering well if
indexes are so great why don't we just
index everything well indexes have their
downsides too just like when you take a
book and you change the contents of the
book you're going to have to update the
index so for databases every time you
update data delete data or add data the
indexes also have to be updated now the
database does this automatically so it's
not something really super manual labor
that you have to do but it does slow
things down
so you have to kind of balance do you
want faster queries or do you want
faster inserts faster updates and faster
deletes it's kind of a hard challenge so
basically what you want to do is you
want to get all of the indexes that
you're going to need but not anymore
because literally every index is going
to slow your database down more and more
that's why I've kind of given you this
as a guide you're not entirely sure this
would be a good place to start
make sure you have indexes on these and
any time you're doing a specific query
that you're going to be running numerous
times and it's very slow you might want
to look into a composite index or just
indexing whatever column you're looking
for it doesn't have to be unique to have
an index you can literally index any
column that basically wraps up our five
video introduction to database design
there's actually some more database
design topics that are really relevant
to Oracle and we're going to get into
those as time goes on but I didn't want
to spend like years going over database
design when we really just want to get
into actually making a database and all
that fun good stuff so some things that
are probably going to come up in future
videos are data types data types are the
type of the data that was super
unhelpful every piece of data has some
sort of type usually if there's quotes
it says this is a stream if it's a
number without quotes such as 12 it's
usually an inch or numeric or something
like that so we'll just what is going in
for this case so that's an integer
meaning there's no decimal point you can
also have dates and other kinds of data
types and we'll be getting through those
as we start creating our tables another
super really important thing when it
comes to database design is naming
conventions essentially what a naming
convention is is a rule that many people
have agreed upon on how we want to name
things now this is probably something
I've neglected the most in this series
so far we haven't really talked a whole
lot on proper naming conventions with
Oracle in fact I've just been writing
them basically as English
no naming conventions but there's
different kind of naming conventions
you're going to come across in
programming and computer science and
database management systems there's
something known as camel case there's
Pascal I'm not even sure how to
pronounce that there's two types of
Hungarian notation there's all caps or
all lowercase and so forth so you can
see there's tons of different ways we
can style things and this just describes
one word but if you look at work was a
whole there's a lot of different things
that you need to consider and that's one
very big thing that's important because
if you look at other people's code and
they follow a different naming
convention than you you're not going to
be able to read it very well so that's
why I really recommend that you figure
out the most popular the best naming
convention and follow that one there's
sometimes conflicting naming conventions
and if that's the case you can pick the
one that you like now there's also a
whole lot of database design when it
comes to presentation depending on your
role you may or may not be working a lot
with presentations basically
presentations are how we present the
data to the user or to the programmer or
whatever else so this includes things
such as views views are basically a
saved select statement kind of there's
also joins which we talked about a
little bit you're also going to have to
deal with things such as stored
procedures stored functions I have
another one I forget it
security these are all things that are
going to need to be designed now you
might be the kind of person who manages
the whole database as yourself if you're
doing a project on your own or you might
just be working with one thing like oh I
only do the data definition language or
oh I only do data manipulation language
that all depends but in reality you
should try to know as much as possible
so having a rough idea of all of these
things is very very good so as you can
tell this is kind of just an intro
hopefully guys it was helpful I really
