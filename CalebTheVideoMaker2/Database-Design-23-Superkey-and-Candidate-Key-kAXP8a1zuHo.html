couple of videos we've talked about all
the characteristics of keys in general
we talked about the org key and
databasing keys are the key to success
anyways this video we're going to be
talking about specific kind of keys
because all of the last videos were kind
of concepts but now we're going to be
talking how do we actually implement
that into a database I understand that
we want keys and we want references from
table to table and we want to want to be
connected but how do I do that well the
main two types of keys that you're going
to hear are known as primary and foreign
and actually we're not going to be
talking about these two kinds of keys in
this video surprise we're going to be
going a little bit broad more a little
bit more broad so when you're like a
beginner in your learning database
design you'll probably learn that these
are the two kinds of keys when uh when
you want to learn more advanced database
design you'll learn about different
categories of keys so before we get into
these two which if you guys have heard
of those just hold up if you have heard
of those keep holding up we're going to
be learning about what's known as a
super key now for some reason I think
this is one word with no space and I
don't know why there's no space there so
if someone knows if like when you guys
watch and know let me know because I
really want to know is driving me crazy
the other one that we're going veneering
is handed it
all right so before before we learn
about the Canada key let's just focus on
the super key so I'm just going to erase
this alright so what is a super key well
a super key is any number of columns
that forces every row to be unique now
if for some reason your table is
structured to where you can't have every
single row be unique you need to
consider adding some kind of column to
enforce uniqueness such as an ID or some
you need to make sure that everyone
using the database understands how that
table works if it's a special case but
generally every table you will be able
to make unique now when you work with
databases you'll often see IDs so like
user ID this is a type of key then you
also sometimes find keys such as like
username the difference between these is
that this one's kind is made up for the
sake of the database use your ID of 748
what does that mean absolutely nothing
it's just a number username actually has
some real world connection we'll be
getting into the difference between
these in an upcoming video and which one
will be best to use for which situations
but as for now we'll just be using kind
of natural practical columns that are
already in the database rather than IDs
but the same thing can apply with just
like an ID field or column so let's
learn about the super key super K it's
like Superman but it's a key just like a
giant key that just goes and breaks
through doors doesn't even use the
handle it just breaks the doors
anyways let's learn okay let's say we
have a table here big tail all right now
I'm going to put some columns in this
table that's not straight enough
close enough now just looks worse
whatever let's say we have a user table
just because I always think that's the
absolute easiest thing to use and we're
going to have a user name email password
then we're going to have first name
middle name last name and then we'll
have birth date so every single row
within this table is going to need a
value for each one of these columns I
know this is really bad handwriting but
it doesn't really matter how it looks
just to understand the concept there now
it looks a lot better I know you're
welcome now you can actually understand
what's going on okay some instances for
databases you will allow people to put
in blank values so for example if
someone doesn't have an email for
example we could make it optional that
way some people have knolled or no value
at all other people have values but for
this this case I'm going to say
everything is required because let's say
you use your email to sign in or to
verify your account I always draw my
chalk how do we make sure that every
single row is talking about one entity
and every single entity only has one row
everything is unique if we have a person
draw a little guy right and he wants to
sign up for this website so he goes this
website here's this website he puts this
information in and that information goes
into a table right he does new probably
won't actually have access to the SQL
because it's just some random user on
your website has access to your database
can I got some security problems but
anyways what's going to happen is he
will be entered into this and all of his
values
we'll be put into these values box so we
have a username like it CC email CC @
blah blah comm-pass it's pi first name
is Caleb real name Daniel last name
curly birthdate o2 1390 so this guy
insert all the information within this
database if you can't read it doesn't
really matter now when another guy comes
or let's say gal so this lady comes and
she sound like oh I want to set up this
website so she signs up this blip stood
and she puts her information in and this
also goes in a database as a new row so
this is just the : headers this is
separate from the actual data the rows
though they have individual values she
can put her values in I'm not going to
write them all out because you guys get
the point how do we know that each
individual row is unique and that talks
about one individual entity in this case
a user typically whatever the entity is
is what the table is titled so the
entity will be the user how do I know
that every single row is talking about
only one user and every user only has
one row the rule of one we don't want
Caleb to be able to come in here create
a new account and make his username CC
and all the same stuff again now in some
instances we may be able to allow them
to make more than one account like I
could make an extra YouTube account if I
really wanted to that would be okay so I
could have the same did a different
username a different email same password
same first name same little name same
last name in the same birth date the
only thing that changed is a username
and email now the definite like what the
table is trying to define has kind of
changed we're no longer trying to define
the person we're trying to define the
user account because now there's two
accounts and there are completely
separate entities hopeful that kind of
makes sense but you don't really need to
worry about
specifics I'm getting completely
off-topic so what were we talking about
10 minutes ago
I think we're talking about super fees
it's any number of columns that forces
every single row to be unique if you
take all this information and compare it
with another let's let's create a new
row let's say oh this lady here actually
ended up putting your information her
username is a your emails B password C
first name is high middle name is yo and
her last name is hello and she was born
over 316 72 that is her birthday well
now if you compare these values it is in
is there they're different not every
single individual value has to be
different for example this girl's last
name could be curry and that'd be
perfectly okay but all of the values as
a whole have to be different so if for
example if someone came in here and put
all of this information up here down
here si si si si at wah wah hi Caleb
Daniel Carrillo 213 90 that is not a
unique row and it would cause an error
so the super key could be all of these
columns right here now super keys are
usually not defined within the database
that's because they're so broad you have
all this information of course it's
going to be unique simply because you
can only use a user name one time
typically the email is only one time so
if someone comes down here and tries to
use an MCC well then you've already
gotten there it's not going to work
so all this extra columns are here kind
of unnecessary because we could simply
do that same thing with just the
username so a super key is any number of
columns that creates a unique row and
unique rows a candidate key is the least
number of columns
lord I read that can you see honey me I
carried so it candidate I'll explain why
it's called a candidate in second or in
the next video or something the
candidate key is the least number of
columns so for this example we're not
going to allow two people would have the
same username we may allow them to have
the same email we may allow them the
same password first name middle name
last name and birthday but not the same
username because then how do you tell
them apart you can't because all of
their information is the same their
exact clones to the database and we do
not ever want that within our database
typically I can't really think of any
examples where you would want duplicate
data but okay anyways the candidate key
is the least number of columns needed to
force every row to be unique in this
example the username is enough to make
it unique so we can take the candidate
key and have it to be just the username
or I guess we could start the column
because all throughout the D rows are
going to be unique so the can the
candidate is least and super key is any
nice now when it comes to database
programming let me clear this up so your
brain doesn't explode anymore
oh thanks for up on time limit you guys
people are gonna stop watching all right
now I just got my chalkboard to listen
to me and you raise it stuff when we're
talking about database programming
there's not really a time where we're
ever going to tell your database that
this is a super key because super keys
are not practical they are for designing
your database only when I looked at that
column first thing I do is I think super
key yes every single row can be unique
that's the first check so you ask can it
set and each row the unique that's the
question that's to define that's what
super key is questioning can each row be
unique and even better work can every
row unique because every single row
within a table has to be unique that's
what the super key is asking once we
figure that out if it can be unique then
we move on to figuring out the candy key
so now we ask how many columns are
needed can you read that hopefully it's
the first question can't every robing be
unique yes that means we have super key
that's all we have to worry about we'd
have to have to figure out which columns
or anything like that can every row be
unique always think about all the
possible values is it possible for a
duplicate if it is hmm you got to figure
something now if it's not you're good so
every row can be unique yes check move
on how many columns are needed now you
figure out the least number of columns
needed in order to create unlimited
uniqueness for
so no possibility of uniqueness and we
are allowed to put some kind of like
limitations we can put a unique we can
use the work it might be different from
for a different relational databases but
if we use a unique index for example
every single column I'm sorry every
single value within a column has to be
unique and that's that's a requirement
for people to put in so if it's not
unique we give it an error that's how we
force values to be unique so how many
columns are needed once I figure that
out we have what's known as a candidate
key so in the last the last example it
was just one because we could use the
username now the next thing I like to
figure out is how many candidate keys do
I have I'm just going to use a CK for
candidate keys how many CK do I have
what does this mean well we can actually
have more than one candidate key in the
last example we had a user name we also
had an email
okay well email could also work as a
candidate key because you could put a
requirement that every account has a
unique email some websites are cool with
people using the same email more than
once some websites aren't usually
they're not so there might be a chance
where we have more than one candidate
key or if rather than using the username
you want to use something else you could
have it to where we could have let's say
you can use your email one once we could
have first name plus last name plus
middle name or middle initial so that
eliminates most possibilities of
uniqueness
but they're still possibility that
people have the same name so then you
add birthday so now you have to find
someone with the same first name last
name middle name and the birthday very
rare still possible so then we could add
a third oh I guess one to a fifth column
we could make it
Eamonn or we could do something such as
a dress all right let's see let's go
with a dress this could be a candidate
key because we have first name last name
middle name birthday and a dress they
all have to be unique as a whole what
are they what are the chances of a
person living at a certain location born
on a certain day also the go to the
chances of two people having the same
name same birthday and living at the
same place unless you had twins and you
name them the same thing if that's the
case shame on you just going to confuse
people that could be a candidate key now
is it the best candidate key hmm
probably not because we're using five
columns and it's still technically
possible to have a duplicate but very
very very rare okay so how many candy
keys do I have you'd if you figure them
out I like to write out the possible
canopies and then we move on to the next
step which is defining the key that we
will use for our table once we have the
candidate keys we can choose one of them
they're called candidate because there's
there's an options like you could have
you have your first can Nicki you could
have kanaky one if candidate key to and
you've got panicky three this could be
the user name this could be the email
this could be that long first name last
name password blah blah or whatever you
really want to be now you have to decide
which one will be your primary key which
is what we'll be talking about in an
upcoming video so be sure to stick with
this series sorry this video is super
long and these videos are just getting
long not sure if you like cut them in
half or just continue talking about
subjects so I mean let me uh let me know
what you guys think if
should split videos up into shorter
pieces or like I could have broke this
up into super key and then Canada key or
if I should talk about big concepts like
this because this video is almost like
20 minutes long so yeah thank you all
for watching and I'm hoping that this
video is helpful if not or if you're
confused about anything just leave me a
comment and I'll be sure to try to help
you thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
