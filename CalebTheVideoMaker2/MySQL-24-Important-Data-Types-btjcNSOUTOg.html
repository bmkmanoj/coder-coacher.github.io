your MySQL tutorial series this video
we're going to be covering data types
now it's going to take a couple videos
to talk about data types and go through
all the stuff we need to go through so I
decided that I'm going to just create
one video to introduce to you the most
common data types
how's good I like awesome now the very
first data type you need to know about
is char char is a data type that is
known as a fixed length data type and
what that means is every single value
for a char column is going to be of the
same length so if you have a table and
one of the columns is a type char and
let's say it's char 10 every single
value for that column is going to be 10
characters what does that mean
practically though that means if you put
something like this which only has 5
characters it's actually still going to
store 10 it's just going to Pat it with
space so it'll be and you can see all of
this wasted space right here so when
would you want to use a char data type
you would want to use it when all of the
data is going to be of the same length
for example zip codes phone numbers
state abbreviations anything that is
consistent in the length if this is not
what you want and you want to be able to
store a variable length of characters
without having to pad it with a bunch of
spaces you will want to use the data
type VAR char varchar' works essentially
the same way as char but it doesn't pad
your strings to fit a certain length
that means when you declare a varchar'
you declare the max length not the total
length for every single value so if you
said varchar' 50 every value can have a
maximum of up to 50 characters but it
doesn't have to have 50 characters you
would want to use this if your data
changes for example names emails product
codes anything that has a variable
length these are the data types you're
going to want to use when you are
storing string data but what if you are
storing numbers well we don't want to
use these character data types we want
to have data types specifically for
numbers so let's talk about those now
the first numeric data type is int int
stands for integers and integers are
whole numbers that means there cannot be
a decimal point in fractions of a number
these are often used for IDs if you do
want to have data after a decimal you
can use the designated decimal type this
data type will allow for data after the
decimal and it can be used for perfect
math so that means if you're doing math
with something like money now you can
also use int for math but the thing is
int does not allow for anything after
decimal so anytime you have numbers like
10.5 and you want to add that with
another number you will want to use the
decimal datatype but you're only going
to want to use that type if you need
perfect math meaning you can't gain
fractions of a penny or lose fractions
of a penny if it is okay to kind of
waver on the precision a little bit you
can use the double type this is the
preferred datatype when you're working
with numbers that you don't have to be
perfect on precision for example if you
have a number ten point one four five
seven six three eight and it's okay if
it's a little bit different such as one
four five seven six three nine we can
see here that there's a very minor
difference between these and in some
situation that's okay for example if
you're measuring something to five
significant figures then it's okay to
lose a little bit precision at the very
far end of the decimal so if your data
does not have to be completely exact
when you're doing math or trying to
store very precise data it is okay to
use the double data type but once again
if you need perfection when you're doing
math you will want to use the decimal or
integer datatype and if that was a
little overwhelming or too much
information we're going to go more in
depth with this and kind of explain
everything I mean this video is this
design is an overview to introduce you
to the different data types
now numeric data types can have two
options signed and unsigned the
difference between these two is that
sign will allow for negative numbers
where unsigned will not allow for
negative numbers the reason you would
want to use
unsigned is because it allows you to
have higher positive numbers so for
example if you're working with IDs the
chances are they'll never be negative so
you could make the data type on signs
and then you can store more IDs in your
table in addition to numeric data we
will often want to store dates so that's
what we were going to talk about now the
first three data types I'm going to
teach you are date time and date time
and it's pretty obvious what each one of
these can store you can use each one of
these to store a specific moment in time
there is also another data type known as
a timestamp and there are some
differences between these three data
types and this one but they can both be
used to store some instants in time so
we will discuss the differences in the
upcoming videos but for now know that if
you need to store a date or a time you
can use one of these four data types so
that's all the information I have for
this video hopefully it was helpful I
just want to give you a good intro to
the data type so then when we discuss
them you already have those synaptic
connections and things that go on in
your brain so once again click like on
this video please be sure to subscribe
to my channel to help me out and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
