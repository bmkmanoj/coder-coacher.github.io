tutorial I believe I I think possibly I
don't know but in this video I want to
talk about assignment operators so I
know what you guys probably thinking
you're probably thinking oh we've
already done the assignment operator you
did it like an hour go with like the
variables and stuff like equals five
well this is the assignment operator you
know but there's also a lot more of
assignment operators that we are going
to learn about so basically all these
are going to be used to replace the
original value of a variable so what are
the most my hairs kind of weird-looking
right now what are the most common let's
go through the assignment operators that
we can use not sure if it's all of them
or not I'm pretty sure but I don't know
so here's one plus equals now how this
works is it's going to take a variable
so let's say we have a variable high and
it has the value five right makes sense
and then we can say hi is equal to or is
assigned the value 12 well what does
this do this actually replaces the old
variable so now High has the variable of
12 well we can use different assignment
operators to get different results so
what if I said hi plus equals two well
this is the equivalent of saying hi
equals well I need to stop saying equals
because this is the assignment operator
so hi is assigned the value
hi +2 so hopefully that makes sense so
this is basically these two here are the
same thing this is a different way to
write this and this is the shorthand
version more common I'd say so it's
easier to read for one so once you get
used to it that is okay I need to stop
saying so and then changing the topic so
hi has a value 5 and then we are adding
2 to the original value huh this is also
like saying I plus plus PI plus plus
twice but that's a different topic so
basically this is going to give us the
new variable hi which stores the value 5
+ 2 7 so that is what that assignment
operator does it takes the original
value of the variable alters it and then
re its reassigned so let's learn another
one there is
oh just I'll just write them all now
plus equals minus equals 5 equals
modulus equals I'm not modulus
multiplication equals and modulus equals
so here are all the possibilities that I
know of there's probably more out on
them so first one we could say hi equals
so for every single one of these
examples hi is going to equal 5 no let's
make that seven so yes seven
let's go 9
nice work all right so we could say hi
to this is going to give us the new
value 11 we could also do this with the
subtraction so the subtraction
assignment operator we could say hi
subtraction operator - this is going to
give high the value 7 nine months two
equals seven we could also use the
division so we could say hi divided by
two which would give us four and a half
then we could have also used the
multiplication assignment operator which
will give us 18 9 times 2 equals 18
finally we could use the division
I mean modulus gosh I cannot talk to it
at all
the modulus assignment operator this is
going to divide 9 by 2 and whatever is
the remainder is going to be the new
value of hi so 9 divided by 2 is equal
to 8 or gives us the value eight and
then a nine minus eight gives us the
value 1 this is this math note page B so
the final answer is 1 which would mean
hi now is the value 1 not 9 so if we do
this modulus assignment operator by 2
it's going to give with the answer 1 so
those are all of the main assignment
operators along with the original
assignment operator which just gives a
value to a variable like here the
variable hi it's a sign the value 9 so
that's all I have to say in this video
