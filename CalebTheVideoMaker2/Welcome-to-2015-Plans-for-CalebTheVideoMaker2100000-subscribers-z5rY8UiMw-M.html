this year is going to be awesome I have
so many great plans for this YouTube
channel and I wanted to make an update
video just to share a little bit of
what's going on so if you want to skip
around in this video here's a table of
contents that you can you know click so
let's begin first let's talk about my
goals well I actually have one really
awesome big goal it's pretty crazy but I
think I can achieve it because I'm going
to put a lot of work into this I want to
reach 100,000 subscribers by january
first 2016 ya later in this video I'll
be discussing some of the methods that
I'm going to be doing to help me achieve
this goal another sweet goal of mine is
I actually want to try and make a full
time income from youtube and i will tell
you later how you can help me with that
so a while ago i made an update video
and I was just explaining how I've been
pretty busy and I won't be making videos
for a while well I'm back and the video
series i was actually working on i'm
gonna try and finish which is database
design so for those of you who are in
the middle of that series be expecting
that because i enjoy that and i think
that series is going to be awesome so
please continue watching those but
moving on from there i'm going to be
making a lot of more database videos so
i was taking a look at the videos that i
have taking a look at my analytics and
also just the comments that i get i did
a little calculations and I decided that
the database videos were the way to go
it's what I enjoy the most it's what you
guys enjoy the most and along with that
will come you know general programming
maybe some PHP or some server-side
scripting other cool things anything
that will be beneficial is what I want
to do but I do want to have that focus
in database videos so for those of you
who enjoy those good news I updated my
mission statement or whatever they call
it so if you want to check out that go
to my about page on my youtube channel
you know the little about tab and in
there i will give you a little bit of
brief explanation of what my goals are
but in general i want to create way
better quality videos that are
entertaining educational fun and easy to
follow I made the commitment that any
future content i create is awesome
quality that good and of course this is
a work in progress i'm not going to be
releasing perfect content on day 1 of
2015 but if you want to track a little
bit of how it's going i'm going to try
and start a newsletter and I want that
newsletter to you know give a little bit
of the behind-the-scenes of what I do
here on my youtube channel and i also
want to send out what new content i have
released that's another goal of mine is
i want a little bit more of a way to
connect with people and i think giving
emails out will be great because then
people can reply and see what's going on
behind the scenes and get a little bit
more connected I think that's awesome so
if you want to check that out i will put
a link in the description another thing
i'm looking into is closed captioning my
videos closed captioning is something
that I've wanted to do for a really long
time the only thing is that it takes
forever it's hard to do because
programming it's hard to kind of put it
into english but i do think it'd be
really awesome for those of you who need
to watch my videos at work if you're
working on a database or got free time
or if you're on YouTube when you're
supposed to be working you know I also
think it'd be cool for translation
because then people from different
origins might be able to understand my
videos using different language captions
who knows so for those of you who are
wondering how you can help me I created
a campaign on patreon which is this
website where you can contribute a small
amount of money to help me create videos
each video I create you will contribute
a little bit of money you know like
fifty dollars per video or something oh
I'm kidding it's much more anyways if
you feel like you can contribute
anything even a couple pennies that'd be
super awesome it also be really helpful
if you subscribe to my newsletter
because then I can send you all the new
stuff I'm doing all the links to all my
junk and all of my blogs and videos and
another way you can help is every time I
create a new video or series go ahead
and share that with your friends and beg
them to subscribe I'm not going to be
able to get
to a hundred thousand subscribers
without everybody's help because that's
over ten times the amount that I have
now so I'm going to need some serious
help if you have any ideas of how you
can help go ahead and message me or send
me an email and i'll talk with you i'm
going to be contributing a lot of time
for these videos i'll be doing this full
time I was having some medical problems
and I ended up actually quitting school
and my job so it's like oh I got as for
what's new in my life well I got some
new equipment it's pretty cool except
it's like super complicated but I'm
trying to figure things out I'm working
with Camtasia Studio as my editor and it
doesn't accept my webcam files my
microphone doesn't have a microphone in
so basically the way I have it set up
right now is I'm recording my desktop
screen with the audio of this microphone
and then I'm recording with this camera
and then I do something like clap go
into my editing program line up the
audio spiked with the audio spike of
this one the audio from this camera with
this microphone and then I delete the
screen recording from Camtasia recorder
so now i just have the audio of this
microphone lined up with the video of
this microphone and then I mute this
microphone so it's this video in this
microphone then I keep them in line for
the whole video edit it and then publish
it one video ad time super complicated
so if you guys know any solution please
let me know I'm also dealing with some
lighting issues i want to make awesome
videos quality wise and basically the
microphones and the lighting and the
cameras are just calls me a bunch of
problems let me know if there's a
certain set up that you like or if you
have a solution i'm hoping to get some
more lighting equipment as i get more
money and so forth so if you want to see
better quality videos then be sure to
support me on patreon another thing is
if you go to that patreon page you can
scroll down and there might be some
perks you could get if you
do donate to me so be sure to check
those out to another goal of mine is to
take everything that's going on in my
business and life and my video
production and make a weekly update
video similar to this one maybe show
some stuff like my studio equipment and
so forth and I'm going to try and upload
one every single week for the rest of
this year and each video is going to
show my progress towards the goals that
I mentioned at the beginning of this
video so if you guys like that idea
please let me know if you think that
would be super annoying and make
everyone unsubscribe please let me know
before you unsubscribe thanks those will
probably just be uploaded here in my
youtube channel but if I find that a lot
of people don't like to watch them I
might make those exclusive to my website
or newsletter so I just need a couple
opinions on that and we'll see how it
goes 2015 for things to conclude with
one I'm gonna do this awesome I don't
even know what that means but all my
videos gonna be a whole new level of
quality I really hope you guys enjoy
them I'm gonna try make them funny
entertaining so forth it's going to be
great second I'm gonna try and get a
hundred thousand subscribers this year
I'm going to need your help with that
one to third I want to try make a full
time living off of youtube and forth I
want to continue helping others this is
a little small business here and do it
all for the glory of God so thank you
everybody who's been following me this
far I'd love to hear your opinion all
this and yeah catch in the next video
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
