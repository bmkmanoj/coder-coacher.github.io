programming tutorial series
now in the previous video I talked about
how to get input from the user and how
to take that and put it on the console
so output that to the console so you can
see here we have a radius and what we
are doing is we are actually taking the
radius from the user and then we're
printing that radius but now I want to
actually figure out the area of this
circle which is essentially what we're
trying to do in this app here whenever
you want to calculate something you're
going to need a location to store it
anytime we want to store information in
a program we need some kind of variable
so we are going to create another
variable where exactly are we going to
want to put this variable in our code
though do we put it up here do we put it
in here down here
well we actually want it about here the
reason we want to here is because the
area is actually going to be calculated
from the radius so the radius needs a
value and the radius doesn't get a value
until this line you could just the same
put it right here it doesn't really
matter because this is just a print
statement and in fact we're not even
going to need that print statement
anymore because all I want to do is
output the area so let's just get rid of
that whole line now let's create another
variable int area so we are going to
create a variable to store the
calculated area and how do we get the
area well this is where the formula
comes in and the way you calculate the
area from a radius is you take PI which
is 3.14 1 5 9 and you multiply that by
radius squared well how do we square
something in program the easiest way is
to just multiply the variable by itself
I mean isn't that what squaring
something means so if you have radius
squared it's the same thing as radius
times radius so radius times radius now
do you guys notice anything wrong with
this code this line of code actually has
one problem in it the problem is is that
we are making this an integer and an
integer is always a whole number and
almost anytime you multiply something by
this you're not going to get a whole
so this is faulty code you could
consider this a logical error a logical
error is when the code compiles it works
but the result is not what we are
expecting there is a problem in the code
that produces an incorrect result so to
fix this we are going to need a new data
type now a data type is literally just a
type of data into is an example of a
data type and that stores whole numbers
well there is also a data type that can
be used to store numbers with decimal
places if we were to just use this
integer data type and we got a value
let's say 76 point whatever well this
would actually be truncated to an
integer and that means that everything
after the decimal point is just the
least it's not rounded it's truncated
this is not what we want so to fix this
we need to use the data type called
double I would say that we are correctly
storing the data but how do we output
the data well if you were to just copy
that line we had previously we had
something like printf and then in here
we had you know quotes and percent I
inside of them and then we just passed
in that variable area well this isn't
going to work like we are hoping that's
because this percent I is specific to
printing integers and we don't want to
print an integer anymore we want to
print everything including what comes
after the decimal the correct conversion
character that we are going to use is
actually a % and then an F and the
reason we are going to use that is
because F is short for floating point
value and we'll get into all the data
types and fancy words like that but
double is an example of a floating point
value so that works just fine but we
should probably give some more
information like hey what exactly is
this variable so in here let's say the
area of a circle with percent i radius
is % f and then in here we're going to
have to also pass in the radius just
like that and then we'll run it please
enter in radius 5
seventy eight point five three nine
seven five zero so hopefully that gives
you guys some satisfaction writing your
very first program that actually does
something kind of cool you can run this
as many times with different values and
try all kinds of cool things so thanks
guys for watching in the next video we
will be talking about some more of the
basics of C programming so be sure to

guys I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
