WebSockets now I think WebSockets are
the best of all four of the ways signal
are works by far so in this video I'm
basically going to describe what a web
application would be like if it was a
perfect world which means we're using
WebSockets right so basically I'm
describing WebSockets when I do this
well the very first thing is I would say
it has to be bi-directional by this I
mean there is communication from the
client to the server and from the server
to the client so now the server can push
data to the client without the client
first having to ask for it in order to
do this we have to open up a persistent
connection so a persistent connection is
kind of just like an agreement between
the client and the server so the client
basically comes up to the server gets on
one knee and says server will you use
WebSockets with me and the server has
been waiting for this moment
its entire life the server says yes now
from this moment on for better or for
worse the client and the server have an
agreement to use WebSockets and this
agreement is kind of like agreements
these days they only lasts until one of
them decides they no longer want to be
using WebSockets the end so in this
situation if the client clicked the X to
close the browser or shut down the app
or whatever it is this would end the
persistent connection it's not going to
stay connected even when the browser is
not open when you X out of your browser
all connections end the second part of a
really good web app would be that it is
multi-user this one is important can you
imagine a web site where you can only
have one person connected at a time well
with WebSockets you can have multiple
people connected at one time all
interacting with one another so to go
along with the other example this server
wasn't very faithful because now it has
persistent connections with everybody
like a millions I didn't even know a
server could be so unfaithful the next
thing I would say is that the web app
location is full-duplex what this means
is that the client can send data to the
server and the server can send data to
the client at the same time the fourth
thing I think the web app should be
asynchronous and there's a 98% chance
I'm going to spell this wrong so I'm
just apologizing upfront did I get it
that's up so yeah that's right I checked
well this is basically everything
WebSockets is it is bi-directional
multi-user full duplex and asynchronous
that is just way too awesome for one
thing now some of the other technologies
we talked about have some of these for
example a event source it is
asynchronous but it's not full duplex
remember it's only one way same for
forever frame well WebSockets basically
combines everything awesome into one
giant delicious piece of cake no pie
yeah pie is better than cake well unless
it's gross by only apple pie that's good
so as you can see I get a little bit
excited when it comes to WebSockets
they're really cool and it's awesome
that signal our implements them so
WebSockets is going to use its own
protocol lws I bet you can't guess what
that stands for so I'm pretty sure all
of the modern browsers support
WebSockets although it's still kind of
new so there may still be some
limitations that being said you should
still learn them because they are the
future of the web and the best way to
learn them is through signal are because
it does all the magical stuff for you if
it's not supported boom don't even to
worry about it it just does something
else that's all I really got to say
about WebSockets I know wasn't the most
technical tutorial but that's all you
really need to know to understand them
so thanks guys and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
