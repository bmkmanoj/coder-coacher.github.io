series this video we are going to be
talking about the decimal data type the
decimal data type is similar to the int
data type and that when you use it for
math it maintains its precision the
difference between decimal and int
though is that the decimal data type
allows numbers after a decimal point so
for example we could store 10.5 inside
of the decimal datatype column when you
create a decimal column you are going to
define a certain number of digits that
are allowed so as in here you're going
to put two numbers the first number is
the number of digits you can allow
inside of that number so let me erase
this to not cause any confusion and
let's say the number is five that means
within one row for this column we can
store a number that has up to five
digits the next number after the comma
is the number of those digits that come
after the decimal point so for example
we could use the number two now if we
use these numbers on a column the lowest
number we could store would be negative
nine hundred and ninety nine point nine
nine there's a total of five digits two
of which are after the decimal point
the highest number would be nine hundred
and ninety nine point nine nine now this
number here is known as the precision
this number is known as the scale now
the max values for these this one is 65
and this one is thirty and obviously
this number is going to have to be
bigger than this number there are
actually a couple of different names for
the decimal datatype for example it can
also be named deaths or Bek I guess I
don't know numeric and fixed but in
general you're going to want to use this
name I think these are more for
portability when we're talking about
working with other databases now why
would you want to use the decimal
datatype mainly it's for mathematical
stuff that you need to maintain
precision so for example if you were
working with money you're going to want
to use the decimal data type this is in
contrast with the data types that are
used for estimating which we will be
discussing very soon so hopefully that
was helpful for you guys if you

see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
