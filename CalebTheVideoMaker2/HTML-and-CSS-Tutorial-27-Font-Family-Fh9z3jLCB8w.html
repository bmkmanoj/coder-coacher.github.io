him and if you haven't noticed the
longer I do this the longer it takes me
to get more videos done so it's taking a
while now getting pretty tired but I'm
think I'm gonna keep going for a bit and
maybe one more video I don't know
anyways this video I'm going to be
talking about different types of fonts
so as you can see we have the font size
and the font weight we also learned
about what else did we learn we learned
about font style yes what was style
which we learned italic for that which
allows us to italicize our text all
right but we're going to be learning a
new one today and that is called font
family so how exactly does this work
well we can change the font with this
for example I changed it earlier to
Tahoma and blastp we also change it to
Georgia so forth we could change it to I
don't know this will work
try it on its base yeah it worked so
that are those are examples of font
families alright but there's actually a
little bit more to it now let me get out
a notepad that's wrong like that I mean
so we have this box of fonts that we
want right and then we have this other
font box of what's known as generic
family this is known as font family so
this is where we if we pick a font we
want such as Georgia we picked we would
say we want we want George
well the person who receives this page
might not have that specific one
supported on his or her computer so that
font might not work exactly how you want
it to so then we have a little fallback
oh the font family doesn't work well we
go back to the generic family which is a
more broad range which will allow people
to view your website if your first font
fails so let's say our first one Georgia
oh I put that down here now a generic
family we could put serif so that is an
example of a generic font family so to
do that you just put Georgia comma Sarah
so that's pretty much the backup if
Georgia doesn't turn out the way you
want I'm pretty sure you can do other
backups such as so home times et Cie
which will give you more backups I'm not
really too sure I think you can but uh
yeah that's that's the idea of falling
family where you add a specific font
family and then it back up generic
family that if this one doesn't work
then we can go to the backup so just to
try things out we have Georgia
let's misspelled it right so now it's
not going to understand Georgia well
it's gonna go to serif instead what if I
bring it back to Georgia it's going to
use Georgia so let's let's try this
little chain here then we go Ariel let's
do or Donna and by the way these are
just fonts you can find out these names
online or just go to like Microsoft Word
or any text processing thing
and you can change your font name and
then that will give you new looking
letters so here's just a bunch of them
let's just see how this works so this is
what it looks at get first if I
misspelled Georgia it doesn't recognize
that one so it uses two Home Instead
misspelled Tahoma and it uses Arial
misspelled Arial and it uses verdun and
I misspelled or Donna and I use verdana
mom I mean it uses serif and if I you
misuse misspelled serif it goes to the
default which works fine so that's good
that is the idea of font family so you
might want to use that for your website
if you needed to look a specific way and
if you just needed to change everything
you can do this if you rather this
changing a paragraph you can put a
little asterisk which is a capital 8 or
just hold shift or you hold shift to
press 8 and then within here put the
text
I mean font family kind of crap so this
right here this asterisks this means
everything so everything on the page so
yeah that's what that does awesome
alright so that's all I really have to
say about font family and I shall see
you in the next video thank you guys for
watching please subscribe to my youtube
channel and help me out
thank you goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
