video I decided to continue my
discussion on links but now I'm going to
be doing something that's actually very
cool and very useful so I'm sure some of
you have been to pages where if you
click it like at the top it'll have a
table of contents and if you click one
of the links it'll take you lower in the
page I think Wikipedia doesn't let's see
Wikipedia
all right let's Wikipedia chicken
sandwich juice load load load load load
load load load load load load load load
yeah and then alright chicken sandwich
sweet so this is a chicken sandwich we
scroll down
is this contents we click history and it
takes us to the history portion of the
article
so this is actually used by huge
companies including Wikipedia so I'm
going to be teaching you how you can do
this on your own website so I'm going to
go back to our index.html page
I'm just going to get rid of the social
links page probably not going to use it
again for the rest of the website delete
that or yeah the rest of this series so
now let's go to let's make a frequently
asked questions page and we have h2 and
table of contents click click one to
jump to it we refresh this is what we
have looks nice so far but kind of
crappy that made no sense so let's make
some questions all right
to do that we make anchors let's make
two questions all right
alright so now we put some content here
let's let me think of some good
questions how do you manage get so many
girls that is a good question and I'm
going to answer that soon but just hold
up hold up it will happen just calm down
I know you guys want to know how do you
manage to be such a stud that's that's
more of a tough one but I think answer
that so right now we have these they're
not very clickable but just for some
styling I'm going to add a break so now
they're more easily read and actually
I'm going to show you something even
more cool coming up soon but not quite
yet now we reference something
what are we referencing well not going
to tell yet so here is what it looks
like now I have two links and they don't
go anywhere that's because we didn't put
anything it just takes us to our page
we're already on so that's a good way
how you can design links without making
them go to a page that doesn't exist
just make it like that so now we are
going to answer these questions so we
have a we make another anchor tag like
this and then we can say how do you
manage to get so many girls and then we
can give it a name let's make it
question 1 in quotation marks question 1
well viewers of all of my videos it's
it's kind of a natural thing but I
suggest just be yourself the number one
thing people tell you so yeah be
ourselves
haha not
oh so now we have this content and
typically we'll have a bunch of
questions so you won't see all of one
page so I'm going to simulate that by
putting a bunch of break tags Rick Rick
Rick Rick Rick Rick Rick Rick Rick
so now let's pretend there's another
question like a list of questions
actually I'm gonna put some more just
just an obsessive ability well so now
you can see there's a huge gap between
our question list and the answers to any
questions so wait so now we can
reference this by putting a pound sign
or a hash tag whatever you want to call
it even though it's called pound sign
guys come on and then we can put
question 1 now when we're you're fresh
click this it takes us down to that
question it's very nice the reason what
the why this works to get rid of these
so you can see right that's beautiful
that what a wonderful name equals
question 1 and then we're referencing
question 1 the reason we have this pound
sign is because if I took that off it
would try to go to the file question 1
and that webb's that that file does not
exist so to tell HTML that it's within
the same a file we put a little hash
pound sign I'm sorry same thing for this
if you put a pounce on there and refresh
and you click it it sends us back to the
same file if you look closely here it
actually has a little pound sign on it
but the pound sign brings us back to the
original file that's how a pound sign
works so when we read this it's a it's a
anchor link that references on the same
page link question 1
so it brings us down here to the other
anchor tag so this one sends us down
this direction and it's named question 1
so we can do this again let's answer the
other question how
do you manage to be such a stud well my
good friend it takes years of practice
but pretty much be a jerk ignore people
don't be nice you know same old same old
ha ha ha ha just kidding you need to be
a super nice gentleman open the doors
for ladies I'm serious on that one
always open doors for ladies I don't
care if they're your mom or your
girlfriend or your friend's girlfriend
or some random lady just be a gentleman
and open their door for them I mean if
it's like your sister you still open
doors but you don't always have to you
don't have to open every door you have
to open like counter doors cabinet doors
or anything like that or occasionally
you can open car doors but that's kind
of the next level of intimacy like oh
you're not really yeah because I like I
open the door for my sister sometimes as
well as some of my friends who are
ladies and I open normal doors so yeah
open doors and it's pretty much makes
you an automatic stud so that's how you
manage to be such a stud open doors name
is equal to question two and then down
here we can put up here I mean question
2 so it's kind of ugly it's hard to read
oh yeah this one sends us to question
one this one sends us to question 2 save
it refresh and it looks kind of RAM
together here so I'm going to do is face
these questions out with a break tag
now let's just pretend this questions
answer was really really really really
really long so I'm just going to copy
and paste that a million times now this
is what we get we get the first question
second question it's kind of hard to
read you know because you're like oh I
got to go look for it
well now you can just click this how do
you manage to be such a stud takes us
right there
now what was I going to show you earlier
well is actually going to show you you
can do this so now if this looks
familiar
this is an ordered list and wingo Li and
Li Li list item and list item so now
oh that looks a lot better a lot more
clear and we could also if we want to do
that for the answers so I can go oh L
ordered list and the ordered list I
always try to end it before I start
typing or also forget and then it look
it something messes up and I can't
figure out what's going on and list item
start list item and list item refresh oh
let me spread this out song so now you
can see it looks a lot more clear and we
can jump to questions I mean there's
only two questions here so it's not very
effective they both jump to the same
place anyways but we could simulate it a
little better by adding more questions
or just copying this a bunch more so now
if you look we have one really long
answer which jumps there or one click
number two which jumps there it would
jump farther but there's not enough
content so let's pretend
so is it really long a really long
answer as well do to do to do well so
now I have really long answers or more
questions but I don't feel like doing it
pressing one jumps right to one at the
top corner pressing two jumps titute
right at the top corner very useful very
professional so that's all I have to say
in this video and next video we will be
talking about let's go pictures yeah
that sounds good I will see you then
