and this video we are going to be
talking about data structure so we've
gotten our hands and feet wet a little
bit in the previous video but now before
you go making a fool of yourself you
should have some general things in your
mind so that you don't make yourself
look like an idiot
right so that's what this video is for
to make you not look like an idiot
essentially the goal is to teach you the
very basics of data structure and data
types let's start with data structure
now in the first video of this series we
talked about structured and unstructured
data that's not exactly what I'm talking
about I'm talking about if you just zoom
out a little bit and you look at the big
picture of your database so if we
represent our database here like this
and now I just want you to envision
zooming in on the database okay sort of
like you know those movies where they
zoom in on someone's arm or something
and then it goes into their cells and
all that cool stuff that's what we're
doing here so you zoom in well all of
our content is going to be organized in
schemas so this is a very important word
in db2 and it's basically just a super
fancy word for groups so we can have
multiple schemas in our database these
are just logical groupings we can decide
how we want to organize our tables by
putting them in different schemas if we
so desire
now we're zooming in and we zoom in onto
the schema well now inside of this
scheme when we're going to have multiple
tables all these tables share a schema
but the tables themselves don't
necessarily have to be related some of
them might be using relationships so
when you have tables where the data is
connected between tables somehow this is
known as a relationship we are going to
get into all the boring details of
relationships but we'll save that for
another video for now just know that our
data can be connected using
relationships now the way you structure
these tables well generally a table
describes one thing and it's going to
store multiple of those one things so
for example users or vehicles but you
never combine multiple things in one
table for example putting the users and
the vehicles and one table you just
do that you'll understand why later but
for now just understand that every
single table describes one individual
kind of thing so we'll see that more as
we zoom in on a specific table well
let's say we zoom in right here and I'll
bring that down here well we might be
looking at this table right here and
we'll say this is the users table inside
of this table we're going to have
columns so the columns know this way and
generally we're going to have a column
header the name of the column so for
example we can have the user ID and now
every single entry in this table is
going to be a new user so we could have
won some data and so forth that is one
specific user and then we can have
another user these that go this way are
called rows I don't really know what
this zooming illustration is helping
with but I just like to visualize
zooming deeper and deeper into the
structure of our database when we zoom
into this column I'll make it extra big
well this is going to have a data type a
data type is just a type of data as you
could probably figure out from the name
essentially they're restrictions on what
kind of data we allow in this column so
there are different categories of data
types that we are going to discuss in
this video there are a lot of data types
and it's important you don't spend years
and years studying the data types before
you really understand databases in
general so what I recommend is you learn
the basics of data types
then learn all the other things with
databases and then come back and learn
all the details with the data types the
very first thing you're going to want to
start with is the data type categories
so these are the general categories for
data types this is pretty universal so
any kind of relational database is going
to have data types in these categories
so when we talk about numeric that means
anything dealing with numbers strings on
the other hand are characters you know
like things you type on the keyboard
spaces tabs all that good stuff and
generally you represent these using
quotes either a single quote or a double
quote generally for databases we use a
single quote so I could say something
like this this is an example of a
straight temporal this deals with dates
and times once you got these categories
down there are some very specific data
types that go in these categories that
you should know I'll be explaining some
of the data types we'll be using in the
upcoming videos that way when it comes
up I don't have to spend a lot of time
explaining what everything means the
very first data type that I would like
to share with you is called int so int
is short for integer anytime we're
dealing with integers we are talking
about whole numbers so like 16 if you
had 16 point zero seven for example
that's not a whole number because you
have a fractional part so this is not an
integer this though is so integer whole
number the next is char and varchar'
these deal with strings there is a minor
difference between char and varchar' in
that if you're dealing with a char
column all of the data for that column
is going to be of the same length so for
example five characters varchar' on the
other hand is designed to store variable
length character data so it just thinks
variable character so that might be you
know a comment or something that's not
always going to be the same length the
next is boolean or boolean this is
designed to store something in two
states so usually this represents true
or false but you can interpret out how
you want on off yes/no high low strong
weak however you like as long as it has
two states the next data types are
date/time and timestamp these are the
temporal datatypes datastore is a date
and perl datatypes history or in the
future time will store a specific time
of some day it doesn't actually store
the date part so the date is your
relevant for this data type or you can
have kind of like a combination of both
in what's called a timestamp so this is
kind of just like an instant in time
past present or future that is a general
overview of data structure and how we
are going to approach the next videos
now that you have this under your belt
you will understand what it means when
you have
what's called a fully qualified name so
a fully qualified name looks like this
schema dot
is an example so it's general but this
is going to be some table names such as
users and then this is going to be
whatever schema that table is a part of
this allows us to be very specific about
what table we're talking about that way
the database knows what schema were in
so once again this is called a qualified
name and in computer science or maybe in
real life I don't know when you qualify
something you basically prefix it with
some more information so you know what
we're talking about so if you didn't
qualify this table it would just be
users but if you qualified it you'd put
schema dot that's all I got for you guys
so thanks for watching be sure to check
out the blog for this video give db2 a
try check out my website subscribe and
as always have a great day actually I
think that's the first time I've ever
said that I don't know well in these
videos not ever okay I'll see you in the
next video please be sure to subscribe
and yeah that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
