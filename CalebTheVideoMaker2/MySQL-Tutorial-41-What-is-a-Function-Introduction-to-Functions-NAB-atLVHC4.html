functions this is what this video will
be about and don't let them scare you
they can be a little scary at first but
I'm going to try and break it down so
they're really easy to understand a
function is sort of like a shortcut to
doing something else now basically two
simple things down simplify things you
will give a function information and the
function will return information the
function is sort of like a robot to do a
manual task that you don't want to do
like let's say you made a function in
real life to clean a room and you would
call the function say clean room and
then in parentheses you would say
bedroom or bathroom you're all you have
to do is tell it what room to clean and
the function will do all the all the
other work
so hopefully that that was kind of a bad
example but let me try and explain this
a little bit more an example of a MySQL
function is upper you define the
function in all caps and then put
parenthesis now what you put in the
parenthesis would be sort of like what
room so let's say hey we're going to put
in parenthesis the string hey so we're
going to put this within the function
upper now what does the upper function
do to this input it will uppercase all
the letters
so this manual labor for this function
is to go and capitalize each letter for
you so the end result is hey you see
what I'm saying
so if somebody enters into your database
and you want all the names to be
lowercase or uppercase you can use a
function so to make all the cases upper
kay although the names uppercase you
could say upper and then within the
parentheses
you could say the column first name and
then it's going to do the manual labor
and go and capitalize every single row
within the database where the first name
is so capitalized all the first names
you see that's a function another common
function is compact let me write that
out now this what this does is it will
combine more than one thing and put them
together and that was kind of a rough
explanation well let's say we want to
combine rather than having let's say
here's our table rather than having a
row for your first name and a row for
your last name you could have a row the
first name last name you see and the
function what it's going to do is it's
going to go through this and say oh
Caleb I mean Curt Caleb curry it's going
to them combine it and put it here as in
the first name comma last name you see
and you can basically this is all you
have to do use a concat function to make
things easier for you if we were to
concat my entry into the database which
name would be Caleb curry like this and
we'd con these are two separate entries
here and we concat is it use by this you
see what this is going to do where we
would put Caleb here I'm gonna put
curried here but when it comes out it's
going to come out like this with with no
spaces no commas or anything not to fix
this what we can do is we can concat
actually another thing within this so we
can concat the very first thing which is
Caleb you see and then we can also clunk
at curry and this is going combine them
together but within them we can actually
concat a comma right in a comma
would put it in parentheses because it's
not a column so within single quotes
after the first name you have a comma to
represent that we're going on to the
next thing in the list right after all
the formatting this is what we end up
with now let me explain this we're going
to concat my first name this will be the
first thing and then I put a comma to
say something else is coming after my
name and then we're going to put a comma
this is a coma these are all commas
these are quotation marks and in order
to put a comma we have to quote it so it
should be comma after my name and then
we're on to the next box which the Vives
I quoted comma and when we when it comes
out it won't be quoted we just need to
put quotes on it to say it's it's not a
column we actually want to put in a
comma right then after this we'll put
another coma to say something else is
coming and then we have curry so the
final result of this kaleb comma space
the curry in order to get that space
there you would put a space after the
comma right within the quotes you see so
if I wanted an extra space before it I
could put a space there and then with a
space and space that's it that's concat
that's a great example of function
because it will go and combined caleb a
comma and curry and put it in a single
column for you there are a ton of MySQL
functions and I'm going to be going over
a good bit of them hopefully teach you
some and there's a lot of them for text
which just like I said upper was one of
them there's some for math and so on so
in the next videos I'll be explaining
some of those and I'll also be showing
you some stuff on the computer which is
over that way which you don't even know
that so I could be like on the computer
which there's no computer over there
argue like on the computer
but sorry I got distracted oh yeah
subscribe and I'll see you soon and
trust me these videos are gonna be
awesome I'm so excited so please
subscribe like this video oh I just want
to focus because it helps me so much
when you like my videos truly does I
like it makes me happy makes me want to
make more videos so subscribe I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
