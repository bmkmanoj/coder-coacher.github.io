be telling you how to quickly recreate
the circle of fifths from memory quickly
it's the work quickly remember we start
on C now each time we go up to the next
letter we ascend a perfect fifth so all
you have to do is recreate this with
perfect fifths cool well I remember cool
guys drink alcohol whatever that's not
true anyways so that is the quick way to
recreate the ascending just perfect fits
we can also descend perfect fifths to
give us F B flat G flat a flat D flat um
G flat C flat and I think that's a him
that's it so now that is the order of
the circle now what about the sharps and
the flats well all you have to do is
remember they also go by fifths and we
start with F so this will have one and
it'll be F this one will have to it'll
be f5 from F goes up five letters not
perfect fifths just fifths I'll show you
what I mean on a keyboard so f 1 2 3 4 5
an interval of 5 that's why these
intervals coming in so this will be F
see this will be F see now c d e f g g g
a b c d so sometime FC g.d.p we'll have
f cg d
a and then a sharp will have FCG d now a
b c d e wait um a fe b c d e so f this
one have um II and then an e f g a b b f
c g d EI e be so those are just also
ascending fifths starting with f but
they're not perfect cliffs you just go
by the interval a b c d e f g a b c d e
f g a so on now the same thing backwards
a perfect fifth back from F F I don't
think this e d c b so we start on B and
then essence going to be just I'm going
to have pot down for be be be a g.f e so
this one's going to be e wearing just
remember bead be e a p/e a d be ii a d g
b e a d g c and b e a D G C F those are
all descending fifths that's how you can
recreate the entire circle of fifths
just from memory
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
