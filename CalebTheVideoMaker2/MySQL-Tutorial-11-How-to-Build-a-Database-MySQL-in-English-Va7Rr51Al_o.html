and uh my name is Caleb if you didn't
know that and I just dropped this book I
put it here so my chalkboard would be a
little higher and put a huge dent in it
and it hurt me deeply because it was
like brand-new almost but I guess it's
the content inside it I just thought I'd
tell you that to you guys because I
don't know but alright so and it's in
this video I'll be teaching you
basically everything you need to do to
build a database but I'll be putting it
in plain English so I may not be using
the proper syntax which is basically how
the language is set up and written but I
will be teaching you the basics of
building a database alright so the first
thing you want to do is dis fine what
your database is for so for this example
let's say you own a gym like you know a
place where you work out I haven't been
there obviously but uh and every people
sign up and give you like a monthly
payment or whatever to use your gym and
you have them fill in a form with all
their information so let's I'm gonna
write everything that's on that form now
here's everything I wanted to store oh
so let me go through this you have your
name which is the name of the person
where they live their phone number and
then um membership status I want that to
be like a three option like a bronze
silver and gold so like if you're gold
you had the most features or whatever
you understand workout program that's
like a specific workout program
currently in the gym that you can sign
up for and do with them and then their
age so that's the first thing you want
to do and then um you wanted to find
what types of information these are so
you look at this oh you have their name
that's string string this should be a
number membership status this is going
to be a string workout program string
age some numbers so two numbers and also
don't forget we need an ID for each
individual entry set an ID
which is number so the very first thing
you'll need to do is create a database
which you can just do with the MySQL
command create a database and then you
can just put your database name so let's
just make call a gym just like that and
then on what you do next is you create
tables for your information now before
we do that let's look at it and see if
there's any normalization needing done
name you can break that up into
first-name lastname but you can actually
do that with an alter command once you
create the database if something goes
wrong so don't worry about that for now
this membership status I'm going to use
a enum there which is one option out of
the select few and then workout program
I'm going to actually make a new table
for that because that is very dynamic
and will change over time so basically
you'll have a table with their
information which is all this stuff but
for a workout program you'll have
another table and basically it's a
many-to-many relationship because one
person can have multiple workout
programs and then a perk out program can
have multiple people in that workout
program so I hope that makes sense don't
worry if it doesn't you have basically
you have the workout programs down here
workouts that's the table name then you
have the info here and then you can put
more information about the workouts down
here an older info right here then right
here is a intermediary table between the
two so it's the actual let's let's make
that members then we can name this table
members workouts to combine them so
I don't think you can read it so it's
okay
this will basically say a member with an
ID of one has a workout of ID two member
ID of one has a workout of ID three
member with the ID of four has a workout
ID with number one that's how you
connect them so then what you want to do
is create a table for your members and
then put all of the columns and the type
of information that they'll store so
let's just say I'm not doing exact
syntax will have syntax will have the
name and it will be a string and it will
be not hold this like that this bit
basically and then I'll just do that for
everything and then you can close this
so this will basically just say create
table with the members and then you list
each column and all the extra features
with it and we'll get into more with
that when we program our database soon
and then we'll also need to create a
table for was it workout program yeah
workout program so create table workout
program and then what you can do is have
an ID which will be auto increment and
it will be a integer maybe and then uh
then you'll have the workout name name
and I work on my writing this is
ridiculous then you just list all the
columns in this table then what you want
to do is have a create a third table so
create table and this will be a members
workout program so members workout
program W mwp and you'll have a member
ID
and then you also have workout suite and
then this will be a foreign key up to
the members table I mean the workout
table and this will be a member a
foreign key to the ID of the members
table so this will be the workout table
this would be the members table and this
right here is a table in between the two
this connects these two tables okay as
you can see this is an entry into the
database the members table so the
members name is Jim he's 46 he's a gold
member and he has an ID of 9001 I left
out the address and stuff because I
don't feel like writing it but basically
then you can uh gather information from
your database and retrieve it so you can
say select all the members with the ID
of 9001 all right that should only
retrieve one result for one a primary
key should always be unique so if you
have two members within the idea of 9001
you're doing it wrong so you better stop
that and make auto-increment
so the next member should be nine
thousand and two that'll keep everything
separate because that's how you this is
the ID is how you can find information
such as the ID 9001 refers to Jim so if
you need to find Jim you can use his ID
now in order for you to get this
information out now in order for you to
get this information into your database
you need to do an insert command so you
would say insert into table members name
Jim
age 46 Goldmember with an ID and 9001
and so on
that's an insert command so basically
the steps go like this so here's the
process first thing first create the
database done we did that and we created
the tables one was members one was
workouts and one was members workouts
for the normalization process then we
inserted into the table now I actually
showed you how to
let the information first just because I
thought it'd be easier to understand
what's going on but you need to insert
your information into the table by
saying insert into table person with the
ID 9001 which then you can say their
name and all the other information and
then the information you don't have you
leave blank and that that goes on the
fact of being Knoll or not move if you
don't put anything it will be null and
if you have a not null column which if
you remember not know this will not
allow blank entries so it'll go to a
default entry or it will give you an
error if there's no default so after
that after you insert into the table you
can select the information basically
retrieving the information so select all
the members with the first name Jim
select all the members with the age 46
or select all gold members maybe you
want to give a discount to anybody who's
been a gold member for more than a year
as like a little bonus or something well
that's how you would go about doing that
using select statements now that's all
that and in the next video I'll be doing
similar thing still English but I'll be
doing more advanced queries and also
some other updating information that
will help you to better understand
what's going on and you better stick
with me because this could be awesome I
don't say that all the time but
seriously this series is awesome so yeah
I'm excited to finish the next video so
watch that and please click like and
