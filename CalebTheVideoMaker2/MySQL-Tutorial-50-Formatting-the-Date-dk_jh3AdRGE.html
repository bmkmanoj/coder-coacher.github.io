format tutorial and also these things
here let me let me show you a closer
look this two thousand eighty nine
fourteen eleven eleven eleven or since
I'm in % d percent sign capital wide
you're probably like what does this mean
want me to tell you so in the last video
I'm not sure if I used quotation marks
for my dates I don't remember but they
are in quotation marks just so you guys
know so dates put them in quotation
works now here these represent values
the M represents the month the D
represents the day the capital y
represents the year alright so if I ran
this it would take this date and it
would return the month the day in the
four digit year so the end result would
be 909 cuz this is the format for a
two-digit thing is 209 14 2008 if we
want this is this is how we can get this
format if this is the format desired to
be inserted in a database or retrieved
or shown then we need to format in this
format so if we want to change this such
as put the Year first we can actually
switch these by putting the Y first I
don't even know if you can see that % &amp;amp;
% d % y I'll explain this what the %
means but Y can be put it the first and
the end can be put last and then when we
get the results out it'll be 2008 oh
well the month 2 uh if we put the y at
the beginning and scooted those two over
there would be like this so that's just
an example
basically these represent a value a
value of a date
so it's % and then I letter a through a
through z I think they use every single
letter except G and z and some are
capitalized some are not so um
for example % them represents the month
lowercase mu C and if we change this to
say the lowercase D it represents the
day so we can use these secret codes I
don't even know what I'm doing that but
anyways we can use these to format the
date the way we want it to all right so
here are some common secret codes I like
to call them this is the year capital y
the reason it's capital if it's a
lowercase Y it represents a two-digit
year value so like 95 or 82 you get
points so these are all lowercase M D H
is f so year month day hour minute it's
an I gotta realize not M well yes
because M is representing the month
well I represents the second I mean the
minutes re s is the second and F is
microseconds so I line these up in this
order to to be in an order so year month
day hour minute second microsecond and I
remember these by your mom so your mom
drinks his H is Frappuccino I know that
doesn't look like Frappuccino but that's
this Frappuccino your mom drinks his H
is as i suppo his Frappuccino so now you
can be like huh what's that one code
that represents the minute any can spell
Y your mom drinks is the year minute day
our second a minute and second
microsecond so you can figure it out by
memory memorizing that
that's this little secret I sat down and
practiced and memorized so yeah those
are some more of the secret codes so you
can use these to manipulate time for
example like time stamps you can take
the years the hours and then the months
with the actual month name so January
and you can all change this by the
representative letter that you choose I
know this all is like really confusing
but just work with it it'll make sense
because you should you should know this
because if you don't know this and
you're try and get like a databasing job
they're gonna laugh at you if you don't
know how to format a date because this
you should know this basic stuff and you
will have to form a format dates and
your database thing and if you don't
know what to laugh at you and then
they'll be like and no they'll be like
wool and then they'll be like ruffle and
then they'll be like but yeah
you get the point better no these here's
another example of function that you can
use to manipulate time so we have
somebody submits a date in this format
April 4 2009 now your mysql' might not
understand that because they don't know
what's they they don't know this garbage
they have to teach them this it's it's a
database it's not a human they don't so
what you do is you tell them what is
what you say % capital m or this this
right here basically means the month
name so it has the month names
programmed it'll know that this will be
converted to a four so January February
March April fourth month then the D for
the day so it goes yeah so - and then
capital Y for the year so it will
convert it to 2009 Oh 402 which though
it will convert it to an acceptable date
for MySQL so that is how you convert
and manipulate dates using
representative characters or secret
codes see ya in the next video I will be
talking maybe some more about this maybe
somewhere else something else whatever
it is is gonna be sweet
so yeah catch you later subscribe and
