been learning some cool stuff and well
basically in this video I'm going to be
talking about how notes are divided in
music so typically things are divided by
two for example we have a quarter note
which breaks down into two eighth notes
which one of these can break down into
two sixteenth notes one of these can
break down into two thirty-second notes
so you can basically keep going and
going and going though well occasionally
we don't always break things up into two
but actually something odd or like let's
say three giving three notes in one beat
rather than one or two makes sense the
and we often get the term tuplet to
represent notes that aren't exactly in
beats in groups of two but you may hear
other things there's very common one of
these called triplets which we'll be
learning about those in depth in the
next video so basically this is just an
example of how music can be different
and let's say rather than having four
Col four sixteenth notes and remember
when you have four when you have them in
a group like this you can connect them
with a bar on top this will make them
eighth notes because there's one flag if
we put another flag now we have
sixteenth notes what if instead of
sixteenth notes I put what looks like
sixteenth notes but instead I put five
of them so now rather than four notes in
a beat we have five we put a little five
above it to represent what is called
will late you can call them fives or you
can call them five top --let's there's
probably another proper name for them
but that's an example
of a top lip now when we're given the
beat we would subdivide that in fives so
let me show you what I mean one E and a
two E and A three and a four you know so
that's an example of sixteenth notes or
four per B if you make it five it's one
two three four five one two three four
five one two three four five one two
three four five one
so that it's offbeat it's not it doesn't
feel right but it's still used because
it's cool now there's also what we may
hear as of sextuplets way to put tops
stop let's shut up which will put six
notes in one beat one two three four
five six one two three four five six one
two three four five six that's sort of
like triplets which we'll put three
notes for every two so you may see some
odd ones such as rather than six you may
see seven so seven beats per measure or
seven seven hits or counts per beep and
see nine pretty much an unlimited option
and you may see what's called I don't
know what it's called a ratio where you
have like a number compared to him said
17 compared to 16 which is basically
saying 17 notes for every 16 mm normal
notes which that's pretty advanced but
that's alright so that's an example of a
ratio whereas typically we have normal
ones no don't start again the most
common ones are triplets sextuplets
which is similar to 16th note triplets
pretty much the same thing and then um
we have fives nines and so forth just
any number that is not four two eight
sixteen thirty-two something that is not
dividable from you can't get continually
dividing it okay let me put it this way
you can't divide it by two continuously
to get to for example five sixteen
divided by 2 we get eight divided again
we get four divided by two again we get
two but if I have 6 divided by 2 I get
three divided by 2 I get one point five
so there's 1.5 beats for every one beat
which ain't right
so ya sextuplets is a good example and
there's another cool ones that's just
the basics of templates why dogs right
now please I'm making a video huh I
better go take my dogs out so I'll see
you in the next video so yeah subscribe
sorry if my teaching sucked for this
video stunk for this video because I
just got done not making videos this is
my first video this of today so yeah now
that I'm in the teaching mood I think my
next one will be better
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
