your id3 algorithm tutorial this is
going to discuss the base cases so these
are the cases where we've reached the
end and we need to stop the recursion
and just go back up to the next node
there are three base cases for the id3
algorithm the first base case is when we
get down to the very end of it and every
single person or thing whatever we're
predicting on has the same target
feature value that is going to be the
leaf node value so imagine we have a
bunch of people and we start building
our decision tree and we split the data
and then we split the data again and all
three of these people have the same
target feature value let's say they all
have diabetes well then we make that a
leaf node that would be diabetes and
then we return the second base case is
if we get down to the point where we're
out of descriptive features so if you
remember in the previous video every
time we split on a descriptive feature
we would remove it from the available
descriptive features list well what
happens if we split our data and we
split it again and keep doing that and
we eventually end up with let's say
three people and let's say two of them
have diabetes and the third one doesn't
well now it's not so easy we can't just
say oh everyone in this group has
diabetes so in this case it's going to
go with the majority so 66% of the
people in this group have diabetes and
we can't split our data anymore to
separate these two like that it's not
possible because we're out of
descriptive features we don't have any
more data to differentiate these people
so you can kind of consider these three
people as identical in our data set they
have all the same descriptive feature
values but different target feature
values these two might have diabetes and
this one may not so in that situation we
do the same thing but we go with the
majority so we would say if you're in
this group you're more than likely going
to have diet
so let's write that out we can make an
if statement and this is going to be
inside of the function that we call so
if all instances have the same target
feature value we're going to make a leaf
node with that value the other base case
is a little different but very similar
else if we run out of descriptive
features to split one we are going to
make the leaf node with the majority so
hopefully this is nice and clear for you
guys really simple if all the instances
have the same target feature value they
all have diabetes or they all do not
have diabetes we're going to make the
leaf node with that value whatever it
may be if we are out of descriptive
features to split our data on and we end
up with a group with some people having
diabetes and some people not having
diabetes we take the majority target
feature value so when we're making a
tree this case up here can actually make
a shorter tree and that's one of the
goals of the id3 algorithm essentially
when we get to the situation where
everybody has the same target feature
value it's going to return which that's
another thing I need to put in here you
need to return which is going to end
that function call so if we get down to
age somewhere in our group and we split
and we still have you know three or four
descriptive features we could split on
but everyone so far already has the same
target feature value it's just going to
end and go to a solution such as
diabetes so it's optimized to make the
shallowest tree as possible which
obviously is going to make things better
more efficient and just good now there
is a third case so we need an else if
again but this one unfortunately is a
little bit more complicated and I know I
said this was going to be a two part
video series on ID three but I changed
my mind because I think this could use a
video of its own as this can get pretty
confusing pretty quickly and this video
is already very deep and very brain
demanding what we have so far basically
sums up the id3
algorithm there's just one case that we
haven't covered and to figure that out I
want you guys to go check out the next
video so please be sure to subscribe
because I got lots of new video ideas
coming up and I just love to have you
part of this channel so thank you for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
