your database design series in the
previous video we talked about a
one-to-one relationship that is one of
the three kinds of relationships that we
can have the other one is one too many
what that means is that one entity can
have a relationship with multiple other
entities but a specific entity can only
be related back to one other entity I
know that sounds a little confusing when
confusing when we're talking about
entities and all this conceptual
high-level thinking but think of think
of it like comment on a website when you
go on to YouTube or whatever you go
below you can leave a comment on my
videos that comment is only owned by you
it has your has your name that is a
one-to-many relationship the reason for
that is you can make many comments but
an individual comment is only owned by
one person so to draw that out you have
a user and we have multiple comments
you can see that the user is able to
make multiple comments but each
individual comment like this one for
example is only owned by one user that
is a one-to-many relationship or one :
money can you see that yeah I think you
can so this is how a one-to-many
relationship works if you want to think
of Buganda like the marriage thing think
of a king we'll just name him King Sam
and Sam demands to have multiple wives
and he's super controlling of his wives
so Sam has multiple lives right sorry
I'm just kind of dry on a chalkboard
here we have Sam the king over here give
him a crown give on a big smile and he
is this royal and famous among the lands
and he's really selfish with his women
he demands to have five hundred wives
however many wives your desires so we
have all of his wives over here
so he has these two wives and then he
has this wife over here she's not so
good-looking but anyways he is married
to these three wives although he's very
he's very protective and very selfish
with his women and he does not want
these wives to marry other men he
they're strictly married to the king so
the king can marry multiple women but
each woman can only marry one person
whoops I kind of already have the line
drip drop so they can only marry one
person they're not able to go marry
another guy that would be a ho another
way that ain't going to happen off with
their heads
see what I'm saying it's not going to
work so that is a one-to-many
relationship as well I'd say about one
of many relationships next video we'll
be talking about many to many see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
