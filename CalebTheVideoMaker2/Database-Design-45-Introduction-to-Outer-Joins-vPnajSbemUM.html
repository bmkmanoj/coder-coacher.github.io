be talking about outer joins so in the
last video we talked about in her joints
and the video before that we talked
about inner joins and two videos before
that we talked about inner joins so I'm
basically sick and tired of inner joins
so now we're just gonna be doing the
same exact thing except without our
joints so what's the difference between
an inner join and an outer join that's
what we will be discussing in this
entire video it's gonna be about 20
videos so hold it when I'm skinned it
won't take too long
once you understand what an inner joint
is picking up outer joins and the other
junk it's like super easy okay kind of
how like once you learn a one
programming language the second one is
only somewhat less hard right see I have
some junk written behind me let's look
at it right so we have what's known as a
join condition that is at the end of the
join statement do you remember doing
this I can't hear you I'm just kidding
okay so we got customer dot customer ID
and card got customer ID that means
there's two tables the customer table
and the card table and then both of
these have a column customer ID so
basically just simple dot syntax the
table dot column and this is making an
association so this is saying that we
want to join two tables and the rows
that need to be connected are connected
by the column of the customer ID and
customer ID so the two columns here this
is going to make a connection and our
join is going to bill is going to be
built upon that so we know where to
connect things so the way this will work
with an inner join me to show ya
we got let me just redraw those two
tables real quick we have the customer
and then we have the card so this is
like a bank and people can get credit
cards and a person doesn't necessarily
have to have a credit card because they
can go to that bank without having a
credit card and also a card doesn't
necessarily have to have a current owner
because it could be a disabled card or
it could be a a car that hasn't yet been
activated or something else could happen
to where a person doesn't own that card
so there's no required columns for this
now when we join these did join table is
going to only include customers who own
a card that's going to be the end result
that is with a inner join so we have the
customer card join table of card and the
customer that is exclusive pushing away
all of the customers with no cards and
all of the cards without an Associated
customer who owns that card the outer
join works a little differently and that
it's still going to return all of the
rows of from one of these tables you can
decide which one whether or not they
have been associated and to be on the
other side so that joint statement comes
in here it's important so we had it to
where it was the customer ID I'm just
going to put Seymour short if we have it
where we have it what's known as a left
join I'm just gonna write it okay it's
going to basically ignore that statement
and it's going to return all of the rows
from the left table the right one though
it's still going to be obeying that
joint statement so the joint stay there
was a tough customer
so with this left join all of the rows
are going to ignore this on the left
side so it's going to return back every
single row on the right side though it's
going to only return the ones that have
a customer ID that has an A customer ID
of the same value within the customer
table so for example we could have a
card with the ID the customer ID of 7 so
that's customer ID not card ID so that's
referring to the person who actually
owns the car
all right we could have that person over
here and since if you basically insert
this into the join condition we have 7
equals 7 because this card customer ID
has an equal value in this table which
means this card is owned by that person
it's kind of how it works but with an
outer join we are going to ignore that
and basically say we're going to return
all of the rows for either the left or
right side so there are men or and there
are three main classifications of joins
outer joins that are I'm going to write
them all and then the next videos we are
going to discuss them there's a left
outer join right outer join and that's
you see where outer outer join oh I am
so dumb I meant you're right full outer
join excuse me oh but basically we're
going to be discussing these two right
off hand and full that can be a little
more complicated for some database
management systems so we're gonna
probably discuss that a little farther
down the road hopefully so let's dive
right in with left outer joins I will
catch you in the next video thank you
for watching please be sure
subscribe and I'll see you in the next
video I already said that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
