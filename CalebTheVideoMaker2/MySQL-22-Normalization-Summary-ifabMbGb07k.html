maker - the goal of this video is to
summarize the three normal forms now I'm
not going to go through and discuss all
of the same information I just talked
about because that's redundant and as
you learn from database normalization
redundancy is bad but who am I to say
that because I've made normalization
videos for Oracle MySQL and sequel
server and database design so talk about
redundancy anywho let's get on with this
summary so we have three normal forms
and if you had to summarize all of these
they all talk about how data relates to
the key so first normal form the goal is
to make sure every single column is
singular so each attribute is one column
and every column relates to the key so
when we have a table we want to make
sure all of the columns in there are
singular or atomic and every single
column is relevant to that primary key
so if it's a user's table we want to
make sure all of the data is relevant to
a single user the second normal form
deals with partial dependencies
essentially we could word this that
every single column has to describe the
entire key if we have a partial
dependency the data only describes part
of the key so that's not allowed if you
want to follow second normal form
finally third normal form deals with
transitive dependencies that is when a
column does depend on the primary key
but through another column so you get
that bouncing with the arrows and that I
drew in the last video third normal form
says that all data depends on only the
key so the solution all of these is to
make all the columns atomic that's a
pretty simple solution for second normal
form take any partial dependencies and
move them to a different table or just
get rid of them
for third normal form you find all the
transitive dependencies take them and
move them to their own table and then in
the original table you reference them
with a foreign key so if you want to
make this correct every single attribute
or column describes only the key which
means we have to get rid of transitive
dependencies to sum up everything all of
the data depends on the key the entire
key and only the key a lot of people
word it saying
the data depends on the key the entire
key and nothing but the key and now you
could say our data is normalized
hopefully you guys grasp normalization
if you liked this video be sure to click
like and as always if you want to study
more on this I have other videos and
different series also you can look it up
online and learn about some of the other
normal forms but for now I think third
normal form is more than adequate for
what we are trying to do so I would
consider our database to be normalized
if we got to third normal form thank you
