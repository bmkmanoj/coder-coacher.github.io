to talk about selecting data from our
db2 tables now what good is a table if
you can't get the data back out that you
put into it that's why there is the
Select statement so just to get some
vocabulary correct the Select is an
example of a statement and the from is
an example of a clause so the clause
kind of gives more information to the
statement without this from db2 would
have to just guess what table you're
going to get your data from and that
requires mind-reading and unfortunately
mind-reading is only available in the
enterprise editions so you're going to
have to settle with using that from
clause so the general structure is here
goes the columns and we just have a star
which in computer science this is known
as a wild card which means basically
anything anything goes when you have a
star the data right here is the table
you are selecting from so columns tables
if there is any ambiguity on what table
you are referring to
you can prefix it with the schema db2
instance dot users and you can see it
works just the same check the result set
yeah there you go but now instead of
using this wildcard I want to be
specific on what I want to select from
this database so to do that it's really
super easy just go here and delete that
star the asterisk is what it's called
and just type the column names that you
want to select and you can actually do
this in any order so I could start with
the email if I wanted and now when we
view our result set you can see it only
gives us the email first name and last
name now you look at these columns and
you think oh that's disgusting who would
want to look at an underscore and blah
so there's actually ways you can change
the way that these columns present
themselves and that's with what is known
as an alias so an alias is just a
nickname for nickname
oh that's confusing so we'll see that in
practice and it'll make sense so let's
go up to our select statement and we're
going to change the way this looks a
little bit I'm going to bring each
column down on a new line so it's very
easy to see and then what you do is you
use the as
word and then in double quotes you say
what you want it to show up as so I'm
just gonna say first name so I got rid
of those nasty underscores and it's
gonna look really beautiful when I do my
reporting my boss is gonna love me gave
me a promotion and so forth so in
conclusion always be sure to use the as
keyword oh we run that and we see we got
an error and let's look
ah I accidentally deleted the comma
after email there we go beautiful
oh that's so delicious now that is how
you make a good select statement oh this
should be a comment by the way which
takes two dashes not one now the Select
statement is extremely extremely
powerful honestly without the Select
statement and databases would be useless
some people focus their entire career on
just select statements so it's a big big
topic but it's extremely valuable so
that's all I got for select statements
in this video pretty simple but nice and
to the point so thank you for watching
