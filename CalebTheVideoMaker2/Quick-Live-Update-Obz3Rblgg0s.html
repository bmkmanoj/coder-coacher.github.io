and 18 seconds sitting here in my
basement right over there is where I
make my tutorials I used to do it up in
my room but it got pretty hot and summer
and so forth so I move down to the
basement and guys want to see something
awesome
here's my new monitor i got so I've dual
monitor system it's gonna be pretty
awesome friend gave me that thanks to
him
hey everybody welcome my name is caleb
and well i thought i'd give you a little
update i did a live stream second ago
but I kind of failed so just ignore that
one alright so I want to talk about a
few things I decided to do this on a
live stream rather than record it to see
how that goes and if I absolutely hate
it I'll probably never do it again but
if it's cool i might continue to do it
so for those of you who don't know my
name is Caleb I own the channel Caleb do
video maker I also my website Caleb
curry calm my facebook and twitter and
so forth so I'm just going to talk about
a few things right now on my channel I
have fourteen hundred and ninety-eight
subscribers to think yet 1498
subscribers and 124 thousand views so
that's super awesome so thank you guys
for that and hopefully we can work
together to build out even higher and i
hope i can try to keep you guys updated
with my views and so forth in the future
that's for now I just want to talk about
a few things I'm a little nervous but I
mean got you I can chill apps give me a
minute alright so mainly today I worked
on my website so for those of you don't
know I also have a website Caleb curry
com it's still kind of in production
mode so it sucks but you know that's my
excuse right so check that out you can
find most of my videos that are
available on my channel you find most of
them on that website and i will also be
posting some blog post as well as extra
content for the videos that you can find
on there so that's going to be pretty
awesome alright so i need to upload the
rest of my music theory series which is
going to take forever because there's a
million of them and then also the HTML /
CSS series i'm working on so we'll see
how that goes alright so i don't know
when i'll get that done but
someday I'm pretty busy all right so I
want to talk about some of you may know
I have a couple social networks i use i
want to talk about differences between
each one and what they're for alright so
the main 1i use youtube obviously so
where i post mainly educational videos i
have two channels two channels i have
more but I mean two channels I really
use cable the video maker and Caleb the
video maker too all right so which one
is which well Caleb the video maker I
started a while ago and I created like
these little skits and so forth and well
uh after a while I wanted to upload more
content such as behind-the-scenes and
tutorials and stuff on how i created
those skits and how to do that better so
uh that ended up becoming Caleb the
video maker too but then I kind of
changed my mind and I didn't this I
decided not to use scale the video maker
to as a secondary channel and i just
uploaded the extra content on to Kaleb
the video maker and then I figured if
one day I decided to do vlogs or
something i'll post them on cable the
video maker too well then I kind of got
into the idea of tutorials I made a
couple tutorials for like Google+ and
some random technology hacks or not
really hacks but like tricks and stuff
and I uploaded those and I thought it
was pretty fun so I originally tried to
like one a day but I got pretty boring
so I stopped and then I got a new
database bill I got into database
programming and I programmed some
databases for practice and I read some
books and stuff basically I wanted to
become a web developer and well that
kind of evolved over a course of a
couple months I started in the summer of
two thousand twelve it's 2013
yeah last summer I start I got the idea
okay i want to be a web developer and
starting like june fourth was when i
entered my extreme study sessions or
whatever basically not they weren't
really that extreme i just tried to work
for at least six hours a day I want
wanted to get six hours a day and study
or some sort of work so I tried to do
that every day of the week except sunday
I gave myself a day off on Sunday and
that that kind of one okay it's funny
cuz like my work is the same thing as
what I do in my free time in my head so
back then I was like okay I gotta work
for six hours so this works out to study
for six hours and then after that well
I'm off my work hour and I do the same
thing until I go to bed so you know most
tech geeks do the same thing they do at
work at home if they have a good job
that they like anyways even that they do
whatever they can that's different from
their job because they hate the job but
I wasn't really getting paid it was just
my learning phase so what I did was I
just studied first to start studying
servers because i was playing video
games and i wanted to set up some
private servers not like not against the
role private servers but like minecraft
server or whatever and that kind of
evolved into well I want to learn about
port forwarding so I got a book on port
forwarding which was actually web how to
build a website and within that book it
talked about port forwarding well I was
that while i was at that at that same
time in my life i was also studying like
HTML like super old HTML with like bold
tags and all that crap and i didn't
really understand proper modern web
development so i figured out how to make
the forms this was like I really got in
this I really got into like programming
my sophomore year and
in high school that is and I got the
forms bill but I didn't know how to
submit them or do anything with the
content they uploaded so then I got a
book from my grandma well my step
grandma Tecna my yeah step grandma I
think my dad's dad's second wife sent me
a book over SQL and that was like super
awesome so I read that thing like a boss
and I got some other databasing books
and then I got a PHP and MySQL a quick
start guide that's not anywhere I read
that and I started building my own
little websites and I've got one for my
friend they're kind of crappy I mean I
was kind of starting out you know didn't
really do anything professionally well
then I wanted to take a small portion
that was it I want to take a small
portion of databasing because databasing
is a huge topic and I wanted to explain
it in detail to people because I was
already in the habit of making videos
I've made videos like my entire life
these comedy skits whatever you want to
call them as well as other things so I
wanted to take this content and create a
funny educational videos I mean I've
seen a lot of YouTube tutorials I like
the idea I created some tutorials for
video games as well as google plus and
so forth that I talked about earlier so
what I did was I thought about creating
a database design series because you
want to know why I picked that well
because when I was first learning
database design I thought it was the
most confusing thing in the world so
that what kind of that's what kind of
triggered the idea well I should turn
this into something people can
understand
because I feel the stuff that people
don't understand that's what they're
going to come to me to help understand
if that makes any sense so basically if
there's a high hated situation or
whatever I want to take that break it up
into pieces manageable pieces that each
person can understand these pieces and
put it together to fully understand the
idea so rather than cramming it all in
okay let's make a video / database
design and then boom we're done with
that let's talk about web development
and then uh then I'm also oh man all
right I think I'm think my youtube got
chopped out there but anyways if I put
extra content on my website then I don't
have to update the description of all my
youtube videos and makes things easier
for me kind of being lazy here
this is connected here disconnected see
so working i'm gonna guess it's working
if not oh well so are this summer thing
haha boken maybe alright so what a setup
I'm a website i retorted difference
between my social networks alright next
thing i want to do another series over
some programming stuff and I'm coming up
with a problem I don't know whether to
do on screen videos or if i should do on
my chalkboard videos by the way i think
i'm going to go back to the chalkboard
I'm not digging the whiteboard thing I
think it's lame and I like chalk boards
though I would like a good higher
quality chalk and chalk board but that's
that's in my in a perfect world but i'm
not sure i might stick with the
whiteboard so i got a lot of decisions
to think about but anyways i like to do
the explanations and stuff on the
whiteboard and i like to show code on
the computer but i think the
demonstration quality goes down as i'm
on the computer and i'm just rambling on
about these concepts but if i'm in real
life i can draw pictures and talk face
to face well face the camera but you
know better than a face to screen to
screen to recorder to screen to you so
i'm not sure what to do for that I mean
I might go back and forth but i'm still
I've did the HTML and CSS tutorial
series which I'm still working on that
was all on screen and I thought it was a
lot more boring and not as high-quality
work so what you for that alright what
else
alright so yeah I'm working on finishing
the HTML and CSS series and then when I
have planned is to do a PHP series over
lots of things that you can do with PHP
mainly building dynamic websites so
where you can take content from a
database or through a program and
display such as saying hello Caleb
welcome to your site today is one day
the 38th I mean 31st or whatever it
doesn't matter that's called dynamic
websites because you know it changes
that's called dynamic so that's one
thing I want to do as well as
communications to databases and search
results page in nation or paging paint
paginated results I'm not sure how to
say it that's where you can have 10
results on a page and then with PHP
it'll automatically know to create
another page so if you have 50 results
that you can search from a database with
PHP you can display those on a website
such as users and it'll have multiple
pages of them and you can edit the
content right on your website without
having to go to your server through PHP
my admin or a command prompt or anything
like that so that's some cool things you
do with PHP as well as using file
imaging and so forth that frameworks I
want to get into that I want to get kind
of in depth to where you can actually
start building websites so I'm still
working on the appropriate method to
display for that and we'll see how that
goes so mmm kind of almost I'm talking I
want to know what you guys would like to
start seeing from me I mean I like
making videos I have like 341 public
right now on my main channel I mean
second ship that's confusing Caleb the
video maker to which I use the most so
it's my second channel but its my
primary channel
that's confusing because Calum the video
maker without the two is my second
channel mind equals blown but yeah I
would like to know what you want to see
more of because I I love making videos
I'm starting school soon so I'm going to
be pretty busy but I would like to
continue to create just as much or more
content than what i'm doing right now so
we'll see how that goes and as for my
HTML and CSS series that's kind of just
an introduction so people who can you
need to know PHP can take that HTML and
CSS and use it to their advantage
without knowing HTML and CSS like a boss
just getting the basics to where you can
understand PHP because if you want to
