theory tutorial this video I will be
talking about transposing your melody by
scale degrees so we have the harmony
which is like the chords and stuff then
the melody which is the catchy tune that
everybody recognizes so it's very
similar it depends and it depends on
what scale were in but it all matters on
the scale degree but for a specific
example let's go with the D major scale
d e F sharp G a B C sharp and then we're
back to D now this is the first note
this is the second third fourth fifth
sixth seventh verb 1 I should say octave
so now that we have this we can make up
a melody let's say it's D F sharp B a G
bag then it goes C sharp hey I'm going
to play this for you and it's going to
sound probably absolutely horrible
because I just picked random letters
which oh alright so hmm let's try this
toto toto all right
now you try and do it in time it's all I
messed up alright anyways now that I'm
done getting distracted and playing
beautiful music we are going to try to
transpose this up to half steps so two
half steps is another way of saying one
whole step or one tone because we also
have tones and semitones which are the
same thing just another word so now what
is f what is one tone up from d well it
goes d 2 d sharp is one semitone or one
half step d sharp to e I don't know I
was who knows that's like really easy so
ABCD d sharp E that now we are
transposing it something is my eye now I
want to transpose this song down to half
steps that's another way of saying one
whole step or one time because remember
we have semi tones and tones which are
basically the same thing just different
names so one time is the same as one
whole step so what is one whole step
down from see well if one whole step
equals two half steps we go d down to D
flat down to C so C is two tones down
from D if you want to see that visually
we have D one half step down d flat one
more half step down see two half steps
makes a whole step so now we know our
scale is going to be c d e f g
the sea because that is the C major
scale now we have to we should have
wrote down what degree of the scale
these are before i erase the D major
scale so i'm going to rewrite it right
here d F sharp G a B C sharp and then
dig so now this was the one so we have
one followed by F sharp one two three
the third followed by one two three four
five six followed by one two three four
five fifth degree folded by G which is
one two three four so he can easily see
these at the boxes so then we had a 32g
c sharp one two three four five six
seven and then a 1 2 3 4 5 so now I can
erase this because we know what scale
degree they were in or what what was the
interval size from the tonic now we can
recreate this transposed two semitones
down well the tonic here is C third note
is e 6th is 123456 a the fifth was G the
fourth is f7 is be the fifth is G so
this is our new melody now I want to say
something if you transpose the melody
without transposing the chords it's
going to sound like absolute poop unless
u transpose it to a certain degree from
what it originally was but this one
would probably sound bad maybe I don't
know so now let me play our new song all
right
it's going to be bad just saying see it
didn't sound resolve but if I ended it
with C probably would that's another
side note it's sometimes pleasant to end
things with the tonic because it
resolves whatever's going on we try it
again hey I dragon okay sounds good so
that is how to transpose using scale
degrees and interval sizes from the
tonic so basically this is just saying
an e is a third from see makes sense but
you have to follow the scale and yeah so
forth so in the next video we're still
going to be doing some transposing stuff
although we're going in go we're going
to go into a new type of transposing so
I will see you there
