your sequel server tutorial series now
I'm gonna keep this one short cuz I
gotta go eat some grilled cheese but
let's get started the very first term
that I'm going to introduce to you in
this video is foreign key now a column
inside of a table can be labelled as a
foreign key and when you do that you're
telling the database that every single
row for this column has to have a value
that is in a different column it's much
easier to visualize so let's draw that
out here we have two tables and let's
say we label this column as a foreign
key and we say that it references this
column that means every single row
inside of this table has to be a value
inside of this call so for example let's
say this is 812 and the accepted values
here would be any of these but 13 would
not work because it's not in this tables
column the reason we create foreign keys
is to create relationships in our
database relationships are when two
tables are connected somehow using a
foreign key now almost always a foreign
key is going to reference a primary key
so in this situation this would be the
PK this would be the FK primary key
foreign key and the foreign key
references in the primary key now both
the primary key and the foreign key are
known as constraints a constraint is
something that prevents certain data in
this situation we are preventing to
value 13 because it's not a value in the
parent table that is a perfect example
of a constraint now constraints are a
very important thing when it comes to
protecting our data integrity now there
are numerous constraints primary and
foreign keys are just examples but
there's some other options that you can
use we will be getting into all of the
constraints in upcoming videos now when
you create a primary key it's
automatically indexed when a column is
indexed we can select data and use that
column much
faster literally just think of like an
index in a book it helps you find
information much faster primary keys are
automatically indexed foreign keys on
the other hand are not automatically
indexed will often be using foreign keys
and primary keys together so it's
usually beneficial to manually give the
foreign key in index and we'll get into
the details of indexes too in future
videos but this is kind of like a video
just to kind of give you a feel of
everything that's going to be coming
that way when it comes it's not wham
here's a bunch of new information yeah
another thing regarding foreign keys is
that when you're referencing another
column both of the columns have to have
the same data type but simply a data
type is just the type of data there are
a couple different categories we have
numeric data that would be a number we
have string data and we have what some
people call temporal data and that's
just dates and times then there's a
couple of other data types that don't
really fit into these categories a data
type is used to tell the database how to
work with our data so this is completely
different than this in this situation
this is numeric data and this is string
data string data is essentially data
that is enclosed in quotes and is just a
sequence of characters so a number is an
example of a character so a string is
alphanumeric and that means alpha as an
alphabet and numeric as in numbers but
they don't work like numbers when you
store this as a string you're not
planning on doing max with these numbers
this is a number in the database
therefore you can do math stuff with it
math stuff temporal those are dates and
we'll get into all of those details
later but just so you guys have a rough
overview there's three main categories
numeric a string and temporal memorize
this now when you're talking about
database constraints you don't usually
mean data types because that's kind of
like a separate topic but you can kind
of think of them as constraints because
if you labeled and call them
the numeric data types and you tried to
put something in like PI that's going to
be rejected so a data type is another
way to protect our data integrity and
you can see all of this comes back to
data integrity the most important thing
in your database is data integrity
because of that the upcoming videos are
going to discuss data integrity database
design relationships normalization all
of that good stuff check out the next
videos if you've enjoyed these if you've
been learning please click Subscribe it
really helps my channel and it means a
lot to me too I'll be sure to click like
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
