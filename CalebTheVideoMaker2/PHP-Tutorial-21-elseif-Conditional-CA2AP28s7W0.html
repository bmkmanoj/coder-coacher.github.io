want to talk about the else if
conditional so this is very similar to
the if conditional even we have the if
conditional then we have the if-else
conditional basically the if conditional
if it's true it does something that's it
if it's false it doesn't do anything the
out if else does something if it's true
but if it's false it does something else
so the first one if looks like this
that's it so basically anything within
these curly braces is going to be R and
if else you just add an else right here
curly braces and then anything within
here is r an now we're going to learn a
new one which is the else if now the way
this works is on it will test something
it'll have an if clause or whatever you
want to call it and then basically it's
going to test it now if it's true it's
going to run whatever you tell it to run
if it's false it's going to go to the
else if or another test and if it's true
it's going to be R and if it's not it'll
go to the 3rd else if or the 4th else if
or the fifth else if however many else
if c1 so let's let's illustrate this
let's go have a little example first we
have an if
so make sense so far so we're making an
if and then we can close it within curly
braces I don't know where they put mine
I'm gonna put mine here I'm so bad at
drawing curly braces I'm funny and then
we have feet else I'm just trying to
make it darker what I'm pretty sure I
just made it more confusing and then
within four new curly braces we can have
also then we have another test
so six equals six and then we have the
curly braces anything within the curly
braces is ran yo all right so now let's
look at this if v equals five
this will be printed echo five equals
five that's what's going to show on the
web browser well five does equal five
so this is what's going to happen and
the elsif is going to be ignored
now if this was false such as at v
equals six
well that's false so it's going to look
okay well it's not this one let's take a
look at the else if if six equals six
well it does so let's echo yo so this is
what's going to happen we can also have
an else which would then give us a final
if none of them are true then echo you
are
so hopefully that makes sense also be
sure to end with semi-colons
I always forget a right line but it's
really no big deal so hopefully that
makes sense you can have multiple elsif
so basically the setup is going to be if
else--if else--if many times you want
and then else very first one that's
going to be tested is this one let's say
it's false so it's going to test this
one
oh it's false so it's going to test this
one oh it's false it's going to test
this one oh it's true well it's going to
skip all of the rest and go to the end
of the after the else clause so the else
clause opens they also cost closes so
that will end this it'll break to the
end of the conditional now let's say
they're all false so this one this one
and this one well that means the only
resort is the else which is going to run
if all the others are not true the else
is optional by the way so if all these
are come out as false then the else is
going to run now also when we're talking
about short-circuiting in the last video
it will do it for this one just like if
this one's true there's no need to test
all the other ones so it's going to skip
to the end of the program or the end of
this specific if statement so that's the
if-elsif and the else all put together
in one video so hopefully that is all
crystal clear if you have any questions
please leave me a comment and then
subscribe yeah hey I just wanted to give
a quick example of what you could use
the if else if statement for so let's
say you wanted to axe only certain
people can access a webpage I mean this
is just a random example I mean it's
probably probably not the best way to
use I'm just giving an example so you
can help understand
how it works and you say okay well in
order to access this web page your name
if your name is something
so if name equals something does really
matter what do this or if your name
equals something else allow access so
only certain people are going to get
access to this web page the first if
let's say Calum or Austin can get access
to this web page the first if test is
your name Caleb if it's not test is your
name Austin if it's not don't grant
access or say access denied you can do
that with multiple people if there's
three people you did it if it's Caleb do
this else if it's Austin do this else if
it's whatever do this grant access each
time hopefully that helps clear things
up usually you will test the same
variable for different values so if you
want to know if very well X either has
the value of 3 5 or 7 well you could use
an if else if statement all right thank
you hopefully that cleared things up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
