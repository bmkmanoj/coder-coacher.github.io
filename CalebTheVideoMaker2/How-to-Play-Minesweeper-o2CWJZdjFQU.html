Surprise!
We are actually going to be playing a game; Minesweeper
So how does Minesweeper work? If you guys are wondering how to access this game.
You can just click you're start menu and search Minesweeper
Or you can search in all programs and find games somewhere.
If you still don't have you might be able to find it online somewhere. Who knows.
Anyways let me move this start menu out of the way and let's get on to our gaming experience.
I'm just using this white as a background. Alright Minesweeper.
So the goal of this game there is basically a whole bunch of mines on this field alright
and we have to figure out which one of these blocks
are mines. There is 10 of them. We're on easy. If you go to new game
Or I'm sorry, options. It will tell you the difficulty.
Alright so what we do. First we just randomly click.
And you see it discovered a whole bunch of the map. Now when you see a number
That means there is a mine in this box.
Basically this clear box is touching a mine.
So it can be any of these boxes; this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one
this one, this one. Basically it's being surounded by a mine somewhere
and because there is only one that's not already discovered.
We know for sure that this is a mine.
because it's touching this box and it's the only box touching this box.
and this box says that a mine is touching it. Therefore
Due to logic we can assume that that is a mine. Now this box
let's take a look. We'll any box surrounding it. One, two, three four. Oh! Well see
we know this is a mine and it's only touching one mine.
and it can be cornered like this. So that means that this one
has to not be a mine. Otherwise this would be a 2.
&amp;lt;click&amp;gt;
Alright so you see the same thing here. So we look around this 1. 
and you can see that there is only one mine. Therefore we know that these 2 are not mines.
Now we have this one. Let's look around this one. Once again
This is the only mine beside this one &amp;lt;click&amp;gt; &amp;lt;click&amp;gt;
Now for the 2. We go all the way around. da da da da da and you can see
that there is two mines. It's telling us that there is 2. That means this has to be a mine.
cause it's the only other box the 2 is touching. So by the way
to flag it we can just right click. That will help us remember that those are mines, don't click them. 
Now  let's look at this 3. Well three mines; One.. Two..
There is only three boxes so that means all three of these are mines.
Let's try this box and once again three boxes therefore this one is a mine. Let's try this box.
Ok well now we have one two and then we have more boxes
then this number. That means one of these is a mine and we're not exactly sure which one
If you want you can lable them question mark. But I prefer to keep them clear until
I get back to them. So let's start somewhere else.
Let's start with this box here. Alrigh so let's look around it.
This block, nope. This one? nope. nope. 
Alright so that means this has to be a mine because it's the only box in the square around it.
Alright so let's try this one. Yep. So that means this one is not a mine.
Let's try this one. It would go this way
Because that means this one is a mine and this is not a mine
This 1. Well around the one. There is only one box. Therefore that is a mine.
Now this one is a four and there is 4 boxes. Therefore we know
That these are mines. And we've used all of our flags. Therefore I can assume
That these are all mines. Now if you're playing on Extreme difficulty you might want to check
To try to make sure you got it all right. I'm just going to click.
And we have one left, boom! &amp;lt;clap&amp;gt; that's right.
You just officially completed you're first game of Minesweeper.
No more being confused at this weird mine game.
Now you know how to play and how to win.
So once you get bored of it you can click games.
Options, and then click advanced.
And now, oh yeah buddy! I am going to play this whole thing
With each.. awhh. You can try it on this if you
are up for the challenge. So that's all I have to say.
Thank you for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
