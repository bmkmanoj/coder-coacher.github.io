video in the music theory series and in
this video I want to talk about
something a little new known as multiple
voice harmony so I already know what the
harmony is that is basically the quartz
or the bass notes or anything to
complement the main melody
so typically it'd be like the bass notes
in piano or something or yeah we know
what a harmony is we've we've worked
with it we've done harmonizing a major
scale and so forth so you may want to
see some of those videos now we can have
a multiple voice harmony so what's a
voice the term voice are you probably
obviously we know the voices well in
music a voice is not always a singer a
voice is considered any part of a song
or a player that helps create the song
so a violin can be one of the voices so
can a piano or a or a cello or a ukulele
okay so those are all voices it's all
part of the big song a song consists of
a bunch of voices so if you have
multiple voice harmony it's breaking up
chords and putting them all among
multiple voices so for example we could
have the chord progression see eg played
by one person piano or we could have
three people this guy sing it this guy
sing it I got looks weird
this lady sing it and that's a
weird-looking lady but we're getting
there now we have a three voice harmony
that's what you would call this so we
can take this concept a step farther and
break this up into three separate staffs
for different people
so we have one down here three four five
one two three four five I was gonna
round a room there I was like I don't
know have to redo it alright so now
let's create the notes let's say this
lady down here with the weird eye and a
beard there's a little masculine she's
singing the bass notes then we have this
guy up here
he's just normal but he has a mohawk
because he's cool and he has three arms
I don't know why just because now we
have this guy here who has he breathes
fire just good I thought that'd be cool
too green fire alright so yeah and he
also has wings on his head for hair
instead of hairiest wings
see ya that these are our base our
Corden singers started so let's create a
chord progression let's go
so let's go through the chord
progression see g FC so let's create all
the notes for that c e g gb d fa c and c
e g now just to make things easier let's
make her sing the high part and it'll
sing the low part because that's that's
easier to match what I wrote here see ya
so G
let's scoot that up so we're gonna have
a G here eat here and a/c here so that's
our first chord we're breaking it up so
this one goes to her
listen goes to him this one goes to him
D that would be right here B would be
here G would be right here FAC
she would get C so C you would get a a
and he would get F so we already did C
so we don't even worry about that so
here is now our new the harmony so what
we can also do to funk things up some
take this note and replace it with this
person's and so forth so we don't always
have to keep it the same like this
person doesn't always have to sing the
highest note let's say black represents
her she could sing G D a G rather than
singing all of the high notes so you can
swap them for example we could switch
these two notes and so forth now once in
the next video we talk about something
new we're going to be talking about the
difference between the pitches it may be
best for this person is seeing a certain
group of pitches this person is seeing a
certain group of pitches and this one to
sing a certain group of pitches to help
reduce the size of the intervals between
the notes which makes it easier to sing
for a specific person see ya stick
around for the next video and subscribe
