I'll be covering in this last segment of
your tutorial series I hope everything
has been going well I know this has been
a shorter series I mean it's only in my
second series so it's not like I made a
billion of them but shorter than last
one so uh let's go going date and date
talent and here's the format of it the
year your your-your-your okay
be like 2005 then the month
oh six and then uh like it's twelve it
doesn't matter that's not what the date
or anything I'm just making something
month now for date time it's like the
same exact thing except this will be
added to the end our our min a minute
and second segment and also you can also
split seconds up or up to microseconds
which is like just much six after the
decimal so if you need to have it this
specific go for it
alright now if you don't want it in this
format because that's not normally how I
do it I usually do a month date than the
year you can change that when you are
requesting it from the server here if
you can even read this this is the
acceptable range of data and date/time
update time so from the Year 1000 date
January 1st of the very first not even
first second of the day all the way up
to the 9999 'the year which that's like
i'm forever from now so to the 12th
month 31st day December 31st 23rd our
59th minute 59 seconds and don't forget
you can also add decimals after this to
six spots so that's the acceptable range
and now I'm going to be moving on to
year which was one of the other data
types
well year as a format of
so it's like this if you remember from
day time like 20 seconds ago but it can
also have the format this as in like oh
five for 2005 or 95 for 1995 but the
default is this and the two-year version
is deprecated which typically means it's
uh outdated and not used as much and not
fully some not supported as much not
always but typically year has a range
from 1901 2155 and invalid entries let's
say three thousand these will be
converted to restrain zeros this is time
this has a valid range from 838 hours 59
minutes and 59 seconds all the way to
positive negative ISM 838 59 59 now if
you're one how it can be negative well
things can pass more like you're gonna
have 60 hours until something or 60
hours since something happened so that's
usually from Counting from one event to
the next such as like one weekend to the
next weekend and so forth and any
invalid entries will just be converted
to zeros so 0 0 0 0 0 and try to avoid
that because that just causes confusion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
