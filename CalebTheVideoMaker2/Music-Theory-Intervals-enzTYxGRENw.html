youtube channel Caleb the video maker
and also Caleb the video maker too which
is where this video is uploaded and
basically in this video I want to be
speaking of intervals and I know I have
a piano here but this will work for any
pitched instrument and basically a pitch
is just perception of how fast a sound
vibrates so basically this one this key
here has a lower pitch than this key
here the higher up a keyboard we go the
higher the pitch and basically i'm only
using a keyboard to visually represent
represent the different pitches and
intervals which we will be learning
about i hope you like my beautiful
clipboard this is where i'll be putting
our notes I don't have a whiteboard
right now so this is all you get but
good enough right you don't need fancy
equipment to create a video so yeah you
can learn this stuff whether you are
trumpet player guitar player uh
basically you can use this for timpani
tons of stuff so this is pretty
important and with intervals you can use
them to figure out chords so here is the
word we're learning about all right so
to get started when we're working with
music we have a system of measuring the
distance between notes so from here to
here for example and I know that sounds
kind of weird but we can use the system
to figure out chords scales and so on
you know and the distance between two
notes or the interval is a relative
measurement this means that rather than
saying go from AC to AD I can tell
somebody to raise the note a major
second and I know you don't know what a
major second is but you will be learning
this so yeah that's basically what an
interval is now a scale this is a series
of notes in ascending or descending
order so C major scale
and we can name each one of these notes
a different term and this is called the
scale degree so we have the tonic
supertonic medient subdominant dominant
sub mediant leading note and a tonic
again these are both called the tonic
now you don't necessarily have to
memorize this fancy terms but if you
must know that's what they are and you
can do this for any scales these are the
sharp notes or flat notes these are the
natural notes and we can measure the
intervals between them so yeah basically
when we measure the distance between
notes we call this the interval and an
interval is a combination of two notes
so G a the notes can be played together
or one after the other the first one
together that is known as melodic wear
one after the other is known as harmonic
sorry it's all in here i'm taking my
sweatshirt off whoa oh okay oh now that
i'm ready to properly teach you if we
play a note followed by the same note
this is known as unison so or yeah
that's unison note ctd this is a second
c2e third C to F is a fourth C to the G
is a fifth c2a is a sixth C to B is a
seventh and finally see to the next see
on a keyboard or any instrument is an
octave now basically we're just
measuring how much of a scale we covered
as you can see C to D covers two notes
C&amp;amp;E therefore that interval is called a
second now to demonstrate this concept
i'll be using a see to be
yes see to be here now if we start at
sea and travel up the scale we pass d we
start on c so c d e f g a b that's seven
notes one two three four five six seven
therefore this is called a seventh i
move my camera down a bit so let me now
because every single note if you've ever
read music i know i'm not teaching how
to read music right now but we'll see
music written on five lines which is
called the staff and we can represent
notes on different lines of the steps of
the staff my bad now when we're creating
intervals all we do is get any peace
measure the lines and spaces that they
cover so here we have a staff five lines
and I know it look better uh that's
wrong like that it be close enough so
now we have down here would be an E and
if we moved up to G this covers one two
three so it covers the first line one
the space between the two lines two and
three therefore this right here is a
third you see so if we're going let me
draw another staff I'm just going to
pull this up here boom boom boom boom i
suck at drawing just forget that though
if i'm going from e to d v 1 between
would be to the line would be three
between would be four five six seven we
have one unison second third fourth
fifth sixth seventh so as you can see
here's a d here's a neat we covered
seven notes within
an office that means this is a seventh
cool so now we can measure more
precisely so for example we have right
here in E + + up so you can see better
and E and A D so what happens if we
sharp this you see it's still a seventh
but they're they're not the same because
the first one e to d that is a seventh
but if we play d sharp it's not the same
thing so we have to have a way to tell
the difference between these types of
intervals this is where we get the term
interval shoot whoa Oh interval quality
it shut up so interval quality now the
terms we were going over before the
second third fourth unison octave those
are known as the interval size so we
have the interval size and the interval
quality so let's go over the interval
quality now I'm gonna get a new piece of
paper here there are four five types of
interval qualities these would be we
have a major perfect minor diminished
and augmented but don't don't freak out
I know that's a lot to learn but we're
going to go over the slowly and you will
understand so let me write these out
it's really awkward positioning I like a
tripod beside me I can't reach and I'm
my arms are short oh shoot so we have
stopped so we have augmented
major minor perfect and diminished now
let's go over let me show you these
let's go over the major intervals first
so I'm going to that and if my new
people recovered so we had we can have
the we had eight types of interval sizes
we had a unison which I'll represent as
a one but it is not caught up first it's
called a unison so that would be that
would be C to C or B g2g or C sharp to c
sharp that is a unison and then we had a
second which would be G to A then we had
a third which would stick the left hand
which would be G to be oh that sounds
cool but anyways then we had G to C 4
and we had G to D 5 g to e 6 g 27 I mean
g2f as a seven and then g2g is an octave
which I will represent within eight you
can see that but basically here are all
of our intervals we have a unison second
third fourth fifth sixth seventh octave
an octave is just the same note and all
up the keyboard so we have a
and bed and if you know anything about
half steps there 12 half steps will be
we learning about that more so if we
have a major interval it can either be a
second a third a sixth or seventh now to
tell if it's major it a second would
have two half steps and we'll learn
about this in second two half steps now
let's learn what a half step is when we
travel a note on the keyboard or move a
nope so we are traveling a distance of
half steps a distance of a half step is
one key so from C to C sharp that is a
half step from C sharp to D it's a half
step d sharp I mean d 2 d sharp one half
step from d sharp to e one half step now
here even though there's no black key
here we're still going to count as a
half step you may think oh well there's
we should count as two half steps
because there's normally a black key
there or something but no there's
actually only 111 the number one half
step between e to F and uh speak to see
you see you see oh man cuz its letter C
I don't think you can see that but yeah
anyways the distance between B to C is
one half step c to c sharp one half step
C to D or ah up to half steps because we
go c sharp to D you see so that would
that is the date that is what half steps
are ok now a major second
which we represent with a capital M you
can see that I need to like scoot this
up some right there a major second has
two half steps so if we're going from C
to D that is two half steps 1 2
therefore that is in major second now
let's look at this on a staff if we have
five line staff boom we have see that's
that's a DD dang it see right here up to
a d now we count the lines and spaces
starting with the note we're on see
would be 1d the line would be too
therefore it's a second but what if we
sharped or flatted the dior see if we
sharp the d we can see that we actually
travel three half steps 1 2 3 which that
would not qualify as a major interval
therefore this C to D sharp is not a
major interval that is actually
something else and we'll be learning
about that soon so as you can tell from
what we've learned so far when we're
counting the interval size we include
the note we start on and the end all the
note we end on so for example from C to
D we include that in the count on 2 but
when we're counting half steps I've
nowhere to read this half steps on the
other hand we do not count the note we
start on because a step involves
movement so C to C sharp or C to D even
though we started on
and move to d we're only get two half
steps because we cross the black no but
versus B to C it's one half step versus
two does that make any sense let me
write this out on a staff here we have B
and here we have see you see the
interval size we have B not be 1 and C
would be too so we have a second with
one half step b to c this would qualify
as something else now let's look at that
take this off here go to my new page we
would have a minor a major interval
oh shoot that scares me every time oh my
gosh oh I'm one of them guys who is
gonna die of a heart attack cuz I get
scared I like everything it's crazy like
when I watch scary movies I pee myself
like twice if we take a major interval
and lower it one half step we get what
is called a minor interval oops minor
interval and we represent this with a
lowercase m dot would go to minor major
on the other hand would go to an
uppercase M full that is very important
if you put an uppercase M people
thinking me major if you put a lowercase
M people think you mean liner it's not
just something we do it's actually
pretty important and I need a drink of
water so give me a sec
holly has some good water thank you some
more that hmm yeah that's some good
water now let's let's look at this again
we take a major interval and lower it a
half step so a major second if you
remember had two half steps a minor
second will have one half step an
example of this is a b2c because baby
the interval size is a second because it
covers two notes but we only travel one
half step B to C so it's not major it's
minor this is a minor second and you can
tell that they sound different and one
here let me turn the volume up little
here's a major second here's a minor
second
so yeah you can tell the difference here
oh I'm thirsty oh my throat oh yeah
still recording my ass so sidetracked
that's crazy but anyways as I was trying
to say minor is just taking a major
interval and minus it one half step
subtracting lowering whatever you want
to say so let me give you all the major
intervals major second major third we
have major 6th and a major seven major
second has two half steps and you will
often see half steps represented with an
H or capital H it doesn't really matter
here a major 3rd will have 4 half steps
major 6th will have let me think 975
three two three point one four one I
think 79 sorry yeah a major 6 has nine
half steps and a major seventh will have
11 half steps so we got to for 911 to
get minor a minor second will have one a
minor third will have three a minor
sixth will have eight and then a minor
seventh will have 10 that's pretty
important and you should know these
half steps for example just for creating
a cord or a triad AC major chord I can
take a major third and a minor third
which should be four half steps and
three half steps oh man my piano is off
we start on C and travel up a major
third one two three four then we travel
up a minor third one two three now you
have a c-major chord and this is
repeatable so if we start on D 1 2 3 4 1
2 3 D major chord but if we have two
minor thirds we can have an email like a
minor chord but that's getting into a
whole different subject so see my other
videos for that if I'd makes them be
sure to link them somewhere so yeah now
let's look at something new we have the
major in the minor let's look at perfect
intervals because perfect and I came to
stop recording darn it but that's okay
can you get angry over oh I'm out of
paper that's not good so let's just use
this piece we had a we could have a
major second major third major sixth and
a major 7th so what happened to the
Unison the fourth fifth and the eighth
leaves are actually perfect intervals so
we have a perfect unison perfect fourth
perfect fifth perfect sixth in a perfect
unison that's pretty cool what's going
out of focus focus so yeah perfect first
we'll have 0 half steps now I'm going to
tell you why these are called perfect
and why the others are called minor
because if you I'll tell you later cuz
it's kinda hard to explain and I haven't
prepared myself but basically some of
them are called perfect some of them are
called major so major 2nd has two half
steps sorry major third has 4 perfect 4
s 5 perfect if s seven major six test
9 what whoa whoa I did something wrong
here not for the six sorry I'm retarded
I'm sorry I'm dumb major 7th has 11 and
a perfect unison has 12 so now when we
look back an octave not a perfect unison
octave uh covers 12 half step so from F
to F 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 it's a
perfect octave cool I know so the reason
we we can't make a minor perfect I know
that didn't make any sense but basically
if we take all these miners majors and
lower my half step oh this is pretty
unorganized help me make this look nicer
okay i'm pretty sure that didn't help
anything but if we take all these majors
and subtract them a half step subtract a
half step from them this is what we get
mate a minor second minor third minor
sixth and a minor seventh but a perfect
on the other hand you can't do that
because it doesn't create the same sound
for example a perfect fourth as five hat
half steps so c 1 2 3 4 5 we get what is
called a diminished interval if we
subtract a perfect if we subtract one
half step from a perfect interval but
we'll get into that soon so now that we
have all this all we have to do is learn
about augmented and diminished so a
diminished is the same thing as taking
any minor here i'm at here these are
minor or any major or any perfect and
lowering them one half step so now if we
take a perfect unison and make it
diminished we actually get negative one
half steps which is impossible but
that's besides the point this is music
theory guys do anything
so if we have a major second subtracted
half step we get a minor second if we
lower one more half step we get a
diminished second with zero half steps
which is also impossible major third
subtract a half step from it we get a
minor third so originally we have four
half steps now i have three then we
subtract one more and we get two or a
diminished third so let's let's go
through the sound of a major third c2e
that's a major third here's a minor
third and two half steps within a major
third would be D but that doesn't really
cover three notes this is technically e
double flat telling you to lower two
half steps which is kind of confusing so
you won't really see diminished
intervals quite as often but now if we
take a perfect interval and we lower it
one half step we get automatically go
straight to diminished we don't have a
minor for a perfect interval so a
perfect interval minus one is diminished
a major interval minus one is minor
minus one is diminished that make any
sense hopefully so now a perfect fifth
has 757 half steps now it becomes 6 and
it becomes diminished major sixth has
nine eight would be minor 7 would be
diminished major 7th as 11 minor 7th as
10 and a diminished 7th has nine you see
perfect date oh oh sorry perfect octave
it's not called Nate man teaching you
back Oh guys have a question do you have
any idea what to do
with like a whole stack of CDs because I
don't know what to do with them but I
want to do something really cool with
them so yeah just just give me some
suggestions there but anyways if we take
a perfect octave and lower it a half
step we get 11 or a diminished octave
that would be C to C would be 12 C to B
becomes 11 and you can tell it sounds
freaky as heck so now let's learn about
the last one augmented if we take any
perfect or major so not minor major
perfect or major plus one and we get an
Augmented so that means this charts
looking pretty crappy right now but a
perfect unison plus one would be an
Augmented unison with one half step I'm
going to recreate this chart quickly and
show you what it looks like when it's
not a piece of crap looking drawing here
take a major second which has two half
steps give it three and it becomes an
Augmented second so this would have five
this would have six this would have not
sixth inning this was at eight because a
perfect fifth at seven and if we
increase it one we get 8 or an augmented
interval a major sixth has nine so
increase that by one and we have 10 or
augmented and in case you didn't know
diminished just means lower augment
means increase and now major 7th has 11
so it would have 12 perfect octave would
have 12 and now has 13 so let's here's a
here's a perfect octave right here c2c
here's a diminished octave here's an
Augmented octave so yeah the augmented
and diminished sound pretty creepy and
you usually see those and horror films
or upsetting music whereas major and
perfect are the happy sounds minor is
sad sounds
you're the difference C minor C major so
I don't really play piano I just know
stuff which is kind of depressing but
it's okay i'm so sad i just want to cry
subscribe to my youtube channel please
make me feel better but anyways that is
all of our intervals now let me go find
a piece of paper and i will finish this
off with teaching you why we have
perfect and major intervals but we don't
why we can't create a perfect interval
that's why we can't get a minor interval
from a perfect interval so we see how we
can get a minor interval from a major
third but we can't get a minor interval
from a perfect fourth so yeah let me go
find some paper hey guys i am back with
this beautiful chart that I already
screwed up but that's okay because I
make a lot of mistakes I am only human
therefore you should not touch me
therefore we're going to learn this and
I don't know what I'm talking about so
basically i put the major and the Minor
on the same line that's because we
cannot have a perfect second a perfect
third perfect 6th perfect seventh so if
we put them on separate lines which you
can do if you want we would have blank
spots for all of those perfect spots and
we also have we would not have any
numbers for a major unison major a
fourth major fifth and a major octave
because there are none you have to
remember that that's why I decided to
put them on the same line to avoid any
confusion so now we can say Oh perfect
fifth and it's with the major perfect
but all you have to do is memorize which
ones are perfect here I'll show you
perfect fourth perfect fifth perfect
unison perfect octave so I highlighted
the perfect ones now if we take any
major interval these four and lower it
one half step
that's the equivalent of one key we get
a minor so 2 to 14 23 9 28 11 to 10 now
if we take any of the minor or the
perfect so this one this one this one
this one this one this one this one and
this one and lower it one half step then
we get what is called diminished which
is represented by a lowercase D so here
are our diminished intervals now if we
take any major or perfect notice i said
major not minor so if you take any major
or perfect and raise it one half step
then we get augmented now augmented is
represented with a capital A so 2 2 3 4
5 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 to 13 so an
example c2c which I see to see that is
an octave but if we raise it it becomes
a plankton that's an Augmented I like
representing this because you can really
hear the difference now as you can tell
some of these have the same number is
such as here here here here what that is
called an harmonic that basically means
they have the same sound but they're
different so here's an example this note
right here this is C sharp so if we take
go from C to hear it C sharp or when go
d to hear d flat basically we can either
sharp a C or fly to D and we get the
same sound of a note but they're written
differently so if we have a staff one
would be written C sure oh that's the
dang it huh huh stop here is our staff
right we've had C sharp or we could have
D flat same sound I'm suck at
representing things so yeah let me show
you
that on my prepared piece of paper so
here we have an harmonic we have a
diminished fifth right here and
augmented forth as you can see this as a
sharp and this as a flat so we're
showing two notes that create the same
sound we have G sharp and a flat let's
find that you know me a little bit more
the keyboard G sharp or a flat same note
and we are traveling up to D let's count
the half steps one two three four five
six six so basically we're traveling six
half steps but if we're traveling from
what you would call G sharp it's a fifth
and if we're traveling from a flat it's
a fourth because if we're going from A
to D we're covering four notes one two
three four but if we're going from G to
D we're covering five one two three four
five so that is what is known as an
harmonic now when we take this and
studied a little bit more we can do what
we call flipping the interval now ignore
that sign that was supposed to be a
treble clef but I screwed it up real bad
foo so if we take one of the notes and
raise it in octave such as this one
right here we will get what's called
flipping the interval and basically this
will explain why a major can be minor
but a perfect can't be minor so I have a
major second here and we raise this an
octave this is an F this is a G so if we
raise this F an octave so from here up
to here it will be represented as this
now this is a minor second if we look at
it like this oh sorry that's a major
second because we go from F to G two
half steps and it becomes a major second
if we go from g2
the F above it it's a minor seventh so
as we can tell if we flip a major it
becomes a minor major to minor minor to
major but if we take a perfect and flip
it it stays it perfect so if you have a
perfect fifth and you flip it it's going
to be a perfect fourth so if you take
that fourth and flip it back it's going
to be perfect still if you haven't
augmented though and flip it it'll be
diminished if you have diminished it'll
be an Augmented now for the size what
you can do is take the first size and
subtract it from 9 so 9 minus 2 we get
seven so what this means is if we have a
augmented sixth if you take 9-6 and
we're going to get so we haven't
augmented we're going to get a
diminished third that is how you can
figure out why perfect is somewhat
special so now when we look back at our
original chart here oops that is why we
do not have an equivalent interval for
the perfect on the minor bar or uh I
should notice i cought create databases
row so we do not have an entry within
the minor row huh so yes that's
basically a whole ton of crap and you
can learn about intervals so here are
the inner monix 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 2 to 4 45
to 5 6 2 6 seven 7 eight to eight nine
to nine 10 to 10 11 to 11 and 12 to 12
so as you tell there are a ton of an
harmonics and basically the way they
sound will be relevant to what you are
playing and so forth so may not always
and also it depends on how you decide to
write it on the sheet music so I am
Caleb curry this is caleb the video
maker to thank you for watching my video
and i'll be posting some links
after this for you to check out some of
my other stuff thank you for watching
and subscribe and if you enjoyed this
please leave me a comment and like this
video goodbye hey guys if you want to
know how to use these intervals you just
learned about to create chords be sure
to click this video up here and if it's
not yet created then I should probably
start because I haven't done that yet
but I'm going to get around to it and if
you want to learn about scales clicky I
haven't made that one either yet but I'm
sure by the time you're watching this
it'll be created because I don't
procrastinate so yeah thank you for
