video real quick it will be quick though
because I have to clean the house cuz
it's so important well anyways in this
video I'm going to be telling you how to
open new links on to our dynamic header
so let's open notepad plus plus Oh
apparently I already have it open drag
it over here alright so here's what we
have we have the index we can ex out of
the home to HTML because now it's a PHP
page so the index header and the footer
so let's now look at the file I'm gonna
fullscreen this and now let's look at
the file structure of this so you open
up your xampp folder and go to htdocs
you can see we have the index.php then
we have an includes folder which holds
our footer and header what I want to do
just to keep things more organized I
want to create a new folder oh see how
how can I do that
new folder and we're going to name this
CSS and what we're going to do is we're
going to take our style CSS and we're
going to put that within our CSS folder
so that way if we have any other styles
as we go on we can keep it organized and
then what we need to do is change the
location of our stylesheet because it's
not going to work so what we need to do
is we need to save it and we need to
change this and make it CSS forward
slash styles.css know what you need to
do is you need to open a web browser and
go to localhost and you can see it still
works if we didn't put that I only put
this over here so we can see both of
these at the same time if we didn't
update our CSS location all of our
styling would be gone and it would just
be plain text and I will show you that
right now so you see what it's like save
it
refresh oh looks like crap so we're
gonna put that back looks bad all right
so now what I want to do is I want to
add more links on the side of this page
that actually do so
thing all right so I just need to update
this link here
cuz it changed so like this Caleb curry
dot come save that refresh our page and
then the navigation we can change that
first one is going to be the home page
and then the second one I want it to be
an about page alright and then let me
click that now we need to change these
links so the first one is going to be
localhost the next one will be cool host
and now we can try these so now that
Caleb Kirkland brings us back to the
same page and the home brings us back to
the same page now what we need to do is
we need to create a new page for the
about me so open a new page file save as
and then don't put it in the includes
file because that's where our footer and
header go so go back to htdocs and make
about me doc DHP alright so now this is
an about me page and we're going to have
to include our header and footer so what
we can do is we can just copy this
format for our homepage if we wanted
paste this on here and change this
so now I added a phone number and it's
all good so now what we can do is we can
link the second page to the about me
page so what we need to do HTTP colon
forward slash forward slash localhost
forward slash about me PHP and we can
save it refresh the page and now when we
click the about me it brings us to an
about me page which tells our
information and then we click home takes
us to our home page and the great thing
about this is you can update the entire
website layout without having to change
both pages all you have to do is change
to the header or the footer so if I want
this footer to say let's see
we need to change this right here the
reason it wasn't updating on my website
is because I I had these files open and
then I updated them in another tab and I
didn't update it over here so we can
change this copyright 2013 check out my
links here which then you can put your
social links right there refresh the
page and then you can have like Facebook
or Twitter or whatever or the frequently
asked questions and you can see this
changes on both the home page and on the
about page so that's what's so awesome
about having a dynamic header and footer
is once you need to update something you
don't have to change the whole website
the only thing that changes is this
information right here check on the home
page this information right here and
it's much more easier to write pages
because you don't have to type all this
extra garbage every single time you
write a page all you need is the actual
content you need to include and then
write the content and then include
that's all you have to do so hopefully
that was helpful and I will see you in
the next video also be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
