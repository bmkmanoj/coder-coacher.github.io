something all by the way my name is
Caleb welcome to your fifth I think my
music theory tutorial and in this video
we are going to be going over something
called perfect and relative pitch so if
I am super talented not not from
practising but just naturally talented
at interpreting pitches remember pitch
is just the sound low versus high whoa
that's a little bit higher now if I'm
really good at figuring out those such
as somebody can play that note let me
pick a lot higher would somebody plays
that note and I can go up to a keyboard
and plant pluck press that note or key I
should say because it's a keyboard um
that's what's called perfect or absolute
pitch so merit that out perfect pitch
and this is also called absolute pitch
you should know both of these words and
basically that means I can figure out
the pitch of something just by hearing
it basically I'm perfect at it I don't
make I don't make mistakes but then
there's something called relative pitch
and this is where you can figure out
what it pitches by other pitches for
example let's say my lowest know I can
sing is right here I can't say but let's
say that's the lowest note I can sing
and somebody plays that note and then in
my head or in my vocal cords I can sing
my lowest note and then travel up the
pitches so I start here until I get to
the note they played and then I know
what note they played basically it's
called relative pitch because it's I'm
relating it to another pitch not exactly
for example absolute pitch or perfect
pitch it's just that pitch relative
pitch would be plus a couple pitches to
figure it out now most of us our
relative pitch there's a couple people
in this world a few people well there's
decent amount but most people don't even
know perfect pitch or absolute pitch and
if your only relative pitch is not that
big of deal winks perfect pitch can
recreate pitches without referencing
something whereas relative pitch really
figures it out from something given so
an example of this I can play this note
and a person with perfect pitch can
understand one note that is or the
frequency or the pitch of it versus
relative pitch can figure it out
referencing a different note such as
that one or from the key signature blah
blah blah blah we'll get into that we're
going to learn more about this and all
this other cool stuff in upcoming videos
so be sure to subscribe like my video
because that means a lot to me and I'll
see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
