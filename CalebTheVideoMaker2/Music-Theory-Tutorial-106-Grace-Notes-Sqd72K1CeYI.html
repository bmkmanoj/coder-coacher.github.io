called a grace note I'm not sure if this
is still considered articulation or not
but okay so if you have a note
occasionally you'll see this little tiny
note before it like that really tiny
itsy-bitsy teeny little and it's
basically telling you to play a note
right before this note so so if I'm
playing I have four notes but this one
has a little grace note it be duh duh
duh duh now the space between these two
notes here varies it just depends on the
tempo and how this person who is
composing or performing the song once it
so this could be six eighth notes
which I doubt it'd be that slow because
typically it would be less space between
these two rather than between these two
so it'll be dum duh duh duh
almost as in a swing feel and which this
actually brings up a good point for you
drummers out there you may see rudiments
for example we can have what's called
the flam flam accent and it looks like
this now the reason it's called a flam
accent because in the drummer world
these little things are called flam's
now the way we play up would just be you
don't pick up your left hand or whatever
whatever little with the grace note is
quieter than the main note you don't
pick it up you just push it down that is
to create a fuller sound rather than
just a single note so this would be
played right left right left right left
you may see this this is the rudiment
flam accent
guess I learned so much this is one of
the 40 essential rudiments my battery
almost dead okay no it's not now how do
you know how much space to give between
these if you're going really slow should
it be or should it be well I guess it
just depends how are you supposed to
know so that depends on the composer of
the song and the performer and also if
you're with a group it also depends on
what the group as in if you're just drum
line or just trumpets whatever this
grace that is being played with you may
need you have to make sure you all agree
on one specific time so another example
of this determining whether the grace
note is close or far away is to give an
example of another profession tournament
which is just the flam where we
alternate where we just play alternating
flam's like this
left-right big ones logon so this would
be how do you know whether this note
should be close or far away well we've
actually come up with another type of
notation where we put it in a different
timing and we play triplets so it's like
this we put it in 6/8 time now if you
remember 6/8 time six eighth notes the
dotted quarter gets the beat one two
three two one two three four five six
one two three four five six we can put
the grace note on six and then on one we
can have the actual note so six one then
we have two three four would be the next
grace note and then five would be the
next actual hit
upside us so here is another way to
think of the grace note this allows us
to have a specific timing between the
two notes so this is another type of
notation just written differently of the
same concept 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
that is now it may seem a little open
come like most drawn lines have them
close so but with this when you're doing
open closed rudiments you have the equal
distance between the two notes as you
speed up it sounds normal
6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 2 4 so that's an
example of specific timing for the grace
notes but typically you won't be given
that so you may just have to guest as is
this sixteenth note thirty-second note
should be or or or all depends so that
is my huge rain on grace notes now it
doesn't just apply for drumming it's all
instruments but more typically drumming
I have to say so yeah the next video
I'll be going over something very
similar so subscribe and I'll see you
then
