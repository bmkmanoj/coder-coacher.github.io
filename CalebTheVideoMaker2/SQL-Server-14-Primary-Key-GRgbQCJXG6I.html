looked off so again welcome back
everyone to your series ever sequel
server I'm Caleb from Caleb the video
maker - and in this video we are going
to discuss primary keys now before we
start I had a question for you have you
ever ordered like some some really
delicious food and you need about 90% of
it and there's about 10% left over for
leftovers and it frustrates you because
10% is just enough to make you want more
and not satisfy you
you're probably wondering where is is
going well throughout the series I've
kind of sprinkled some primary key stuff
so you've gotten a couple pieces of
pizza here and there but now this is the
whole pizza I'm basically putting it all
together in one video so you don't have
to look through the entire series to
find all the details on primary keys
that means a lot of this might be review
but it's all in one spot so it's a good
review now a primary key is a column
that is added to a table that allows
every single road to be uniquely
identifiable what that means is that
every single row has to have a primary
key not all means that nulls are not
allowed null is just the absence of a
value in addition to the primary key
being not null every single row has to
have a unique primary key or else it
wouldn't be able to uniquely identify
one of the entities that means the
primary key also has to be unique you
can basically think of the primary key
as a combination of not null and unique
column attributes or constraints lastly
the primary key should never change
there's actually a way in sequel server
to force the primary key column to never
allow changes we will discuss that in
just a moment but for now let's just
think about why why is it that the
primary key should never change within a
table we have a couple columns it
doesn't matter what they are let's just
say one's a string and one's a number
and then we add a primary key column so
we'll just use a number so we'll say ID
and this will have the idea of seven so
you can tell that this ID points to a
specific
entity this one right here squeak but
now we go ahead and change this 7 to an
8 just for some reason now this brings
confusion because we don't know if the 8
is talking about a new entity or it's
the same entity with a new number you
might think well obviously it's the same
entity with just a different ID but
maybe it's not so obvious it's obvious
in this situation because we manually
change the number but if you're just
looking at data you might not have that
memorized or know that ahead of time and
it might be a little bit confusing
especially when there's conventions that
the primary key should never change and
then you see a change like that your
first thought would be that it's a new
entity because primary keys don't change
therefore since this one has an 8 huh
must be a new entity additionally there
are two categories of primary keys
surrogate keys and natural keys
surrogate keys are just computer
generated numbers often this will be
some sort of ID the reason we do this is
that it automatically makes it super
easy to make the column not null and
unique and actually it's pretty easy to
make it never change natural Keys on the
other hand have real-world meaning they
are a column that stores actual useful
information and these columns have to as
well be not in all unique and never
changing because of that natural Keys
are usually a bit harder to come up with
it takes a little bit more thinking but
as a result you'll often have data
that's easier to read because you don't
have all of these IDs everywhere you
have to connect whether you use
surrogate or natural Keys that's up to
you I'll probably be using mostly
surrogate Keys that's just because I
think it makes it easier to make things
work natural Keys can also work well too
it just might take an extra level of
thinking and it's also important to
understand that these are categories
that we use to make it easier to discuss
primary Keys but the database does not
know the difference between these two
it's not like you create a primary key
and say oh this is a surrogate one oh
this one's a natural key you don't do
that you just use primary key keyword so
when you create the
you're going to say primarykey and you
were going to use this right after you
create that column and once we get into
the create table statement that's gonna
make a whole lot more sense but that's
literally all you have to do you don't
have to say oh primary key surrogate or
anything like that so the summarized
surrogate keys are almost always IDs
natural keys are something that can
uniquely identify a row but have
real-world meaning for example an email
address oftentimes you'll want to use
either surrogate for natural keys
throughout the entire database rather
than switching the surrogate for part of
it and switching to natural for part of
it because then it's kind of confusing
because you don't know which tables are
using surrogate Keys and you don't know
which ones are using natural peace
unless you dive in and look through the
columns if you're just starting out with
database design and you're not required
to use natural Keys for some reason I
recommend starting out with surrogate
Keys that's because it's super easy to
make the database create your IDs for
you you don't have to worry about the
data changing or anything like that now
the way we protect the data from
never-changing
is we use what's known as an identity
now an identity column is a column that
automatically gives you a new number
every time you insert a new row each
table can have up to one identity also a
table can only have one primary key
because of that it often makes sense
that the identity column is also the
column labeled as primary key it does
not have to be that way though you can
actually have an identity on a different
column that would only really make sense
though if you're using a natural key and
you still needed a column that counts
for you in addition to counting the
identity will also prevent you from
changing the data so that is how we
protect this one rule of never changing
we make sure that the column is labeled
the identity column when we start
talking about primary Keys the concept
of indexes needs to come up because
we've already covered a lot of
information and we still have to cover
indexes I'm going to break this up into
two parts and in the next video we will
be discussing indexes relating to
primary keys so thanks guys for watching
this video hopefully
helpful if you have any questions just
leave a comment I'll try to help out or
someone else can leave a comment and
reply be sure to click like subscribe
and as always I'll see you in the next
video thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
