will be covering that is the third third
normal form more commonly written as 3nf
because it's shorter and easier so
basically the third normal form is just
a way to get rid okay let me let me
restart basically everything in a table
should rely on the primary key so if you
have a table for students at a college
you will have the student ID and then
the name city state and all that it's
all based around the student ID so now
the third normal form if you follow the
first and second normal form you may not
actually have any third normal form
problems your database might be exactly
how it should be so I just like to warn
you on that because you might not have
anything to change and basically if you
look at a table and you see something
that relies on something else then
there's a problem so of course I'm going
to give you an example because I always
do student ID first name last name city
city governor now you look at this if
the ID changes so the first name because
it goes to a different person unless
they both have the same first name of
course
so this relies on the ID last name
relies on the ID the city also relies on
the ID because every person that has an
ID should live in a city and then the
city governor obviously if you change
the ID so with the city governor unless
they lived in the same city as somebody
else but do you see the problem here
I sure do what happens if you change the
city so you cross it out and you write a
new city well now the city governor is
able to will change because the city
governor is different so this not only
relies on
student ID but also relies on the city
and the ID so this is what the third
normal form is for it is to get rid of
columns that rely another column every
column should be mutually independent
and only rely on the ID this relies on
the city so that's wrong what you need
to do here is you need to make some
changes we're going to make another
table and when you see this problem you
automatically know you need to make
another table because that's what
normalization is it's making more tables
to reduce redundancies the data and bad
design and all kinds of stuff like that
so instead of City we're going to have a
city ID because this is going to
reference into another table now city ID
this is the primary key this is not a
foreign key because remember city d s--
if students had a city ID in there that
is the foreign key so the foreign key in
students is the primary key that is the
foreign key you can tell because the
relevance of the table students has
nothing to do with cities cities does
have stuff to build cities because
they're the same thing so that's how you
tell that this is the primary key and
not the foreign key this is the foreign
key okay so now if you go and need to
know the governor of the cities that
students are in you can do more advanced
query so that's the only downside
normalization is it can make accessing
data more difficult but now you don't
get some confusion because what happens
if you have a table for the students and
they change their city but they don't
change their city governor now you have
incorrect
information but on here if somebody
changes their city it will automatically
update the governor because it's tied to
this table oh the bad things about
normalization is it makes bigger
databases may be slower searches or
queries and it can make some things
confusing how it's all connected but the
good thing about it is you reduce all
extra redundant useless information make
things it prevents incorrect information
and also conflicting information because
what if two students do that and then
their city governors are different well
this it will automatically update with
the city ID so if they change their City
the governor changes that is what is
amazing that's why it's highly
recommended to normalize a database and
that is the third normal form and I hope
that helped and I will see you in the
next video it's going to be awesome
because you'll have to see why just just
trust me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
