maker to this video we are going to
explore the char data type so let's
create a new file we'll just name this
char dot C and you know we'll do the
standard include us standard i/o alright
so how do we make a character variable
well we just say char and then we give
it a name and then we can give it a
value
now remember when we're working with
characters we always want to use single
quotes so something needs to go inside
of those single quotes but what let's
use capital a just so we can become
familiar with one character this is the
one we used in the previous video and we
learned that the integer value for a is
actually 65 and I want to prove that to
you in this video so you know I'm not
just making something up let's learn to
print characters to the screen we are
still going to use the printf function
but we are going to learn a new
conversion character specifically it is
percent C and then we'll go to a new
line and what are we going to print
we're gonna print X that's a
particularly confusing variable name
because it's a character itself I want
to make sure there's not confusion I
don't want people to think hey I'm going
to print the value X instead I'm going
to rename this to something else
my character or my char now it's a
little less confusing now let's run this
make sure it works and you can see
outputs the character a just like we
wanted now how do we actually take input
of characters well I'm going to show you
that let's go back to our code and in
here we're going to declare the char
variable but we're not going to
initialize it and now we are going to
use the scanf function and in here we
are going to pass in % C just like you
would expect the variable we are going
to put it in is with the address of
operator my char let's try this when we
output it it'll ask us for a character
even though it doesn't say anything we
never put a prompt but let's try our and
outputs are so it's working well what
else
do you need to know well to be honest
there's really not a whole lot to it
there is one thing I wanted to share
with you guys and that is the ASCII
table this is the ASCII value for every
single character that we can use inside
of ASCII and inside of the console you
can see here this is capital a and it
has the value of 65 as you can see the
decimal version is 65 right there now if
you wanted to classify these things
because I know some of you guys love
classifications you could say that the
first section of characters are called
control characters only a few of those
are going to be useful for us
I'd also group the last one in here
these codes were for controlling devices
such as printers they're really not used
so much today
there are a couple that will be useful
for us for example tab the null
character and I'm sure there's a couple
others we might run into the rest of
them these are considered the printable
characters these are the ones we could
actually see the second table down here
is called the extended ASCII codes
that's what I was explaining in the last
video where in some situations that most
significant bit will be used and this
will allow us to have more options in
the next video we are going to create a
program that will actually convert
between integers and ASCII by the end of
that video you'll see how easy it is to
work with ASCII so be sure to check that

thanks guys and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
