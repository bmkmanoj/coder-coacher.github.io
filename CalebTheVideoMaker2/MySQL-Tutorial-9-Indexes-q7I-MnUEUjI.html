you made it this far and now I'm going
to be talking about something that's a
little more advanced not advanced I want
to say advanced but you don't really
know MySQL that well yet unless you do
when you're just refreshing yourself
with this information that's fine um but
I'll be talking about indexes and
basically just think of an index as
retrieving information faster and easier
such as finding it is something I'll
JavaScript to get my JavaScript book out
look at the index look for arrays all
page 1 and go to page 1 sort of like
that makes things easier ah but how this
works it's good for way information is
sorted so let's just go to the basics
when you have a database you're not just
going to throw all your data and crap in
it and never retrieve it you're always
going to retrieve it back or what's the
point in storing it I mean so I'm
guessing eventually some time you will
retrieve your data and you usually want
this data organized so you can read it
or understand what's going on so you may
uh order it so let's say you have a
shopping you have a shop and a bunch of
people have bought stuff and you want to
order everything everybody is bought by
their last name so people with the last
name of a up here and the people with
the last name starting with Z down here
or the other way around
so yeah that's a good way to organize it
order it from A to Z it's a great
organization another thing is you can
make limitations to the results that are
returned so let's say I have a bank
system and you want everybody's account
that has more than 200 bucks or dollars
returned or 200 euros or whatever it is
so you could say give me all the bank
accounts where the account balance is
over 200 so then the people with 100
would not be displayed and the people
with 6000 would be displayed that's a
great organization method and then you
can order it again by
last name or their first name which I
wouldn't recommend but last name so an
index will basically allow you to do
this faster and easier by telling MySQL
that you'll be organizing it by this so
you have last name this would be a good
column to give an index because you're
commonly sorting it by the last name
because if you get a book and you look
at the index it's not going to tell you
about all the pictures and stuff inside
this it's going to tell you what the
book is about so this column
it's about your last name and you're
going to sort it by your last name
that's why you have an index by last
name so I hope that makes sense so you
don't index last name it's like that
that's a good example of a great index
and then another one would be account
balance as we said earlier a lot account
balance
I mean index account balance so I just
needed to explain that a bit so you
would understand what the use of an
index is for because when I first
started this I was so confused I did not
understand indexes I read books read
things online and just didn't make any
sense but I don't know why I'm kind of
kind of slow and but I eventually got it
so I'm trying to make it so everybody
else can understand it here so basically
when you're organizing something or
ordering it by something you want to use
an index for that column so the good
thing about index is it makes things
faster when retrieving it the bad thing
is when inserting new info or new data
or new columns or new entries into the
database it's actually slower because
you have to update all the indexes so
from now I'll be going over all the
index types and when to use what and
explain each one alright here are the
four types of indexes and yes the first
one is just plain index so as we go on
through this course I will be going over
something called full-text searches and
basically this allows you to search your
database more advanced rather than
another search miss that another search
method I'll be teaching you it's kind of
hard to explain this when I haven't gone
over the other stuff but the reason I'm
teaching this first is knowing this
first will help the other stuff help you
understand it way easier so full text is
basically sort of like a Google search
engine of your data and that's basically
all that is it will give you an index to
allow you to do that and so let's give
that's what that that's what a full text
is my code just left out there but
that's okay
now index is the one we just went over
good for sorting and we're limitations
so that's what this index is for now
primary key I already told you what a
primary key was back at the beginning of
the series but if you weren't there or
you forget it is something that keeps
everything unique um such as an ID a
student ID for a college a social
security number a order ID order numbers
you know you understand what I'm saying
it just keeps everything unique this
will receive a primary key index but
automatically so got stopped dropping
this uh this will allow you to order
things by the primary key much quicker
and the last type of index is unique
this is really simple it just keeps
everything in a column unique and so so
you're going to call them you have rows
so this would be like the ID and the ID
is assumed to be unique automatically
but then we can have like a model number
or no even better you have a website and
you're having people sign up a great
unique index would be the user
this is because you can't have two
people with the same username but it's
not a good idea as in like Oh what's
your ID my ID is Caleb Caleb seat 12:36
as my ID that's a horrible ID although
it is a good username well I guess and
it's unique because nobody else can have
that username as me so that's what index
is do they allow you to sort information
and get things gathered together in a in
a faster easier manner it's better for
you to add indexes but you do not want
too many because it can slow down
updating the information and adding new
information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
