relationships it's a slow course it

database normalization and all that good
stuff but it does start talking about
what databases are how date a bit
databases structure their data simple
stuff now it's nothing too special it's
not anything that I wouldn't have put in
my database design courses but it takes
it slow and it makes it in a fun way

with one of these welcome tablets and

I'm doing it it's kind of fun and I
enjoy making it so I think you guys will
