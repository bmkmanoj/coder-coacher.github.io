have decided to subscribe if not I'm
going to be super mad I'm just kidding
if you don't want to subscribe that's
okay
just appreciate it but anyways in this
video I want to talk about JavaScript
datatypes so if you remember from the
last video I said a data type was the
type of value we assigned to a variable
rather whether it be string number or
anything like that
well if data types in Java Script is a
very confusing thing because it's so
unclear about how things work so I'm
going to do my best to explain how all
of this works and hopefully give you a
clearer understanding so in JavaScript
we have two data I mean two pretty much
groups of data types literals and
objects so literals store only one piece
of information so for example we could
have all our X like this this is a
variable with the identifier X and we
give it the value hey hey has multiple
characters but it's really only one
string we enclose the string with in
quotation marks so this is a literal we
also have objects but we'll be getting
into that as we go through this video so
let's look at our literals first one is
undefined
basically that's when we have a variable
and we well we usually with variables we
assign the valuable very sorry a value
but if we don't it has the type
undefined because we haven't given it a
value this is the first value you should
be familiar with because it's pretty
easy to understand undefined is the
result of inaction on a variable it has
no value now the next one very similar
is null null is very similar to
undefined but it differs in that null is
defined so null is defined non value
it's an OP it's a
non value but it's defined think of null
as nothing
so no basically no data was returned
undefined though I guess I should make
it consistent here it has no scent value
so and no data was returned its null but
undefined is basically saying oh nothing
has been done with this variable
confusing distinction and it takes
practice to understand but we will be
working with both of these later as we
go on with our actual scripting and so
forth so basically two values undefined
and null are two you should be familiar
with and understand the distinction
between the two we also have other
values such as strength a string is zero
or more quoted characters we have
already seen this in previous lessons
but if you're just jumping in right now
that's fine I'm gonna explain it it is
quotation marks and any number of
characters zero or more quoted
characters right here so this is a
string this is a string this is a string
this is a string these are all examples
of strings we can use single quotes a
pasta which are also known as
apostrophes or double quotes for Strings
and the values can be empty so these are
both empty strings that's the term you
should know and they're valid in
JavaScript so these are correct you can
use these and once again an empty string
is different than null or undefined so
that's another thing you need to be
familiar with with we have no undefined
strings but within strings we have empty
strings which you may confuse with null
or undefined just be sure to know that
there's three datatypes so far strings
null and undefined and as you go on in
your Java scripting programming Java
scripting it'll start to make more sense
numbers are also a datatype
unlike most programming languages
javascript has only one type for numbers
that means we don't have to worry about
int double or flow
just one data type that handles
everything which can be useful and
obviously there may be some downsides to
that so here are some valid numbers we
do not quote numbers like we do string
so you can see there's no quotation
marks right here we just put the number
that is different than with the
quotation marks so this down here is a
string this up here is a number so
what's the difference the difference
between quoted numbers and numbers is
the way JavaScript treats them behind
the scene this is a string containing
numbers 9 9 9 9 is just a number
so those those will work differently in
JavaScript and to be honest javascript
is pretty relaxed when it comes to data
types so we saw this in the last lesson
with creating variables so this means
occasionally we may get some conversions
between types so we may think we have a
number but we have actually have a
string so that can be a downside to
JavaScript when people don't understand
how JavaScript works with their data
types and then we get a string rather
than a number which is to be expected so
for example if we add a number and a
string it's going to convert the value
to a string so that's something you need
to understand with JavaScript you have
to really understand how JavaScript
works with its variables and the data
types to understand how to get a
specific value and get the correct value
and we'll be going over that in upcoming
videos just understand that these are
different the next data type is boolean
boolean has two options true or false
these are lower case and are also non
quoted so this
is not boolean this is a string just
like that is a string and not a number
data type boolean can be used for
comparison testing and more all right so
now we're getting into what's known as
complex data types so when we were at
the beginning we said there was two
groups basically literals and objects so
far we just went over all of the
literals in JavaScript they are known as
simple data types because they only
store one piece of information the
following data types are known as
complex data types they are handled
differently by JavaScript simple data
types have one piece of info complex
data types can have multiple basically a
collection of primitives which I don't
even know if I mentioned what that is
basically primitives are all of the
literals so an example of one of these
complex data types is an array this is
an object in JavaScript that is designed
to store multiple values usually when we
use arrays but not always all of the
values within the array are of the same
type so in an array named scores we may
store 12 14 64 34:54 these are all of
type number we will be creating arrays
later dates this is another important
object in JavaScript you may want to
know about its and basically yeah
dates can do multiple multitude of
things they are designed to store times
days years months weeks and so forth we
will be creating dates later basically
I'm just giving you an introduction
objects because javascript is an
object-oriented programming language it
would make sense for us to have the
ability to create more objects so we're
not just limited to the ones
that are already defined such as dates
date objects or array objects we can
create our own and we will be doing this
as we go farther in our video lessons so
as a review here are all of the data
types I talked about these ones are are
simple or literals these ones are
objects which we'll be getting into this
in comparison in future videos sorry I
keep referring to future videos but I
can't explain everything at once
be impossible but think of all of these
as the basic JavaScript data types or
objects I'm going to put types here
there are also constants but when
defined they do not work on all browsers
so we're not even going to talk about
those right now but yeah that's
basically all of the data types you
should be familiar with and you will be
understanding these in a better way as
we go on in our JavaScript tutorial
series so thank you for sticking with
this far hopefully this all makes sense
and I'm trying to give an understanding
of how JavaScript works rather than just
talking about oh to define a string you
use single quotes or double quotes blah
blah blah and then use like 30 videos to
explain all of these data types and
Const role control structures basically
I want to give people a deeper
understanding of how JavaScript works so
then when you have to learn about data
types specifically it makes more sense
as to how JavaScript works with those
and you have a better understanding of
why we do what we do with JavaScript so
hopefully I'm succeeding in that goal of
mine if not be sure to let me know but
as we keep going I'm going to be trying
to give a deeper comprehension of
concepts in JavaScript so thank you for
watching be sure to subscribe and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
