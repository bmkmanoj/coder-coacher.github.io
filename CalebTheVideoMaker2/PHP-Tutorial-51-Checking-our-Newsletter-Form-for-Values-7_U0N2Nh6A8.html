open a new file and what we're going to
do is name it handle dot PHP so I want
to file save as handle dot PHP all right
so this is going to be a PHP script
which has all of our handling form junk
okay so well we can do is we can copy
the this setup and use it again for here
so now this is what we have we put
information in we submit it and it will
bring us to our our handle form right
here so this page is right here so as
you can see when you click Submit look
at the URL up at the top right now its
newsletter dot PHP and when we submit it
it takes it to handle form now if we can
make the handling not handle form handle
dot PHP if we can make handle dot PHP do
something with that PHP then we will be
good all right so what we want to do is
we want to start typing PHP so what you
can do is you can either open up PHP
tags or you can modify this system so
all of it is within one giant PHP tag so
you'd get rid of this get rid of this
get rid of this and then you would drag
this down to the bottom well I'm just
going to keep it separate because you
can do that with PHP and I think it
keeps it more organized but it really
doesn't matter the other way it probably
better yeah teaching you bad habits I
don't really know but anyways what we
want to do with in here is in our last
video what we did we tested those values
so we created if statements which tested
something and then ran something and
then was in this if statement we had a
function such as not empty what this
will do is it will check if our form is
not empty and if it's true it will do
something so what we need to do is
within parenthesis of the function we
say alright what are we testing to see
if it's empty and we are testing
requests
square brackets quotation marks name so
this is connecting us to the input type
name equals name so whatever we put in
here this is going to we're going to
test that here by putting this so if
it's not empty that means it has a value
and what we what we could do we test if
it has a value if it's not empty
whatever we put here will be ran so we
can echo something such as it has a
value and then we can submit this with a
value and it will give us a result if we
don't give it a value nothing happens so
we're just going to build off of this
concept we're going to make it a little
more advanced and if you want you can
ashot assign these to shorthand
variables to make things easier for you
so you could go request name so now then
we could echo out name watch this and we
put a value in here and submit it and it
echoes that value out so that's an
example of a dynamic webpage it changes
by what we put into the forms for
example all right so that's what we're
going to do here we're just going to
assign it to a shorthand variable that's
basically saying if it has a value we
want to take that value and assign it to
this variable that way we always know
that this variable has a value because
if we didn't do this test we use name so
for example if we didn't test this we
just did this and then we echoed out
name well it could be a problem because
we don't know if they put a name and if
we submit it with a value it doesn't go
out but if it doesn't it's blank
so it could be it could come to problems
when we're like Hello
and then we go back that was wrong so I
fix that save that and then we submit it
it just says hello whatever the name is
but if we leave it blank it causes a
problem because it does not put the name
there so we want to always test to make
sure we have the proper value we want to
know that it has a value and then if it
does we can assign it to the variable
name now we're going to do is just copy
this concept by ctrl C and we are going
to paste it again and this time we're
going to go for the email and then we're
going to assign it to a shorthand
variable email like this so we're just
replacing name with the word email and
then we want to go back enter a name mmm
now we could put an email into and what
we can do is just echo these out so we
can see if it worked
submit bro hey hey - so obviously it
worked if we didn't put email in it
would just put hey and that's how you
can test it if you would like but we're
not really doing that for this oops so
what we're going to do is just leave it
like that and now we used not empty for
the input types of text but for the
radio buttons we want to do something a
little bit different so what we're going
to do is actually at first we're going
to bring all this to the front of the
page because that is unnecessary spacing
this is what we have now what we're
going to do is just sort of do the same
thing but we're going to use the is set
function
so now this will test to see if these
are set if it is set it will become true
so within here we just say we're gonna
indent these because they're within the
if statement so this is what we have now
everything looks good and what we want
to do now is we want to say okay if they
don't have a value we want to assign
them the value normal so to do this we
need to make else statements and we can
just do this for all of them because
they're pretty much the same and my
hands are so cold it is freezing in here
anyways what we want to do now is we say
if it if it's false we want to a sign it
a null value with no quotation marks the
reason for this is if we use quotation
marks it would be a string with the
value null and it's not a string it's an
empty value so this is what we have so
far should be working good and then what
we can do now is that we have a test for
all of these we can further test this by
creating an if statement and if all of
them have values then the form was
submitted successfully so to do this we
say name and
email and sex the way this works is
these evaluate as if you put something
in here it evaluates as true so if name
has a value it evaluates as true if up
here it came out as null instead that
means it doesn't have a value and no
tests as false with an if statement so
this means all are true so whatever we
put in here means it's all true and then
we could make an else statement if we
want it which means one of the group or
more are false so within this echo
statement I could say we will email you
shortly
please go back and try and this is what
we have so let's try it out
we're going to put a name caleb email yo
never submit bro and then we will email
you shortly if for some reason I didn't
check one or I didn't put one of these
in it's going to say please go back and
try the form again and also I would like
to make a link that'll take them back to
the forum if I wish so to do that within
our echo statement I could say by
clicking and make an anchor tag and you
can see a problem here we've been using
double quotes so our double quotes
within are messed up so I'm gonna change
these two single quotes patron localhost
forward slash news letter dot PHP and
then here
we're going to end that anchor tag so
basically what this does is add a link
you can click here in a newsletter so
what we want to do is we want to take
out the local host here sorry about that
and then this will be a relative path to
whatever from our web page so there it
takes us back to the original web page
so that is the basics of how we check if
they value as a if an input has a value
using PHP and HTML forms the reason this
is in PHP is because we have to include
the header and the footer so yeah you
can integrate HTML and PHP within the
same page and we will be learning that
as we go so hopefully I was helpful
please be sure to subscribe and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
