Caleb the video maker - this video is
going to continue your MySQL tutorial
series now we are going to be talking
about data types for the next few videos
and the ones we are going to start with
are the character data types or string
data types we've discussed char and
varchar' and I'm going to discuss those
in more detail in this video and the
next video specifically we will start
with char so when we have a column in a
table we have to specify the data type
one of the available data types is char
and this is a fixed length data type and
what that means is that every single
value for that column is of the same
length and we actually specify that
length in parenthesis when we declare
that column so something like this this
50 here refers to characters now I'm
going to go off-topic just a little bit
because there's something I wanted to
introduce to you how do we know what
kind of characters we are allowed to put
in there can we use English can we use
Arabic can we use Chinese so forth well
this is determined by the character set
of that column and the character set
that this is going to use is known as
Unicode which is one of the most common
and most popular character sets that's
because it supports multiple languages
now the way this character set is
actually interpreted by the computer is
called the encoding and the encoding
that is used is known as utf-8 so when
you see utf-8 think of a Unicode
character set now you don't need to know
all the details of this I just wanted to
introduce you to it so then when you
hear it you're not dumbfounded when I
column is a fixed length that means if
you put something in shorter than that
length it's going to Pat it with spaces
so something like Hello only takes up 5
characters but it's going to spat spat
it but it's going to Pat it with 45
spaces you can see that that's a problem
so you only want to use char when the
data is fixed length or very close to
that length so for example if we're
going to have data that's always 10
characters long we could say char 10 and
because MySQL knows that every single
value is going to be 10 characters it
doesn't have to keep a working knowledge
of how long each string is
we are talking about varchar' though
which is the data type we'll talk about
in the next video this is a variable
length character string and what that
means is MySQL has to keep track of how
long that string is so it actually takes
up more storage but if for some reason
you're not storing ten characters here
let's say you're only storing seven that
means there's going to be three
characters wasted because seven plus
three equals ten that means char is only
going to save you space if you are using
the total number of characters now what
values are allowed in here as of this
video the lowest value you can give is
actually zero and the highest is 255 so
if you had zero the only thing that
would be allowed is null and empty
strings so an empty string is just a
string with no data not any spaces
nothing 255 where does that number come
from well this has to do with binary
which there's a lot of information in
this video so all trials overwhelm me
with binary now but this is the maximum
number for an 8-bit number so in binary
you could have zeros or ones so if we
have eight ones this number represents
255 zero on the other hand would be this
but the goal of this video is not to
teach you binary I do have other videos
over that if you're interested let's
zoom now like I said if you put a string
in here shorter than 50 characters it's
going to Pat it with spaces but the
thing is when you take that data back
out MySQL is going to strip those spaces
so it doesn't look like it's padded now
I'm going to introduce you to something
known as an SQL mode and one of those is
pad char to full length
it's pretty long name but you can
actually turn this on and I'm not going
to discuss how to do that in this video
if you want to know you can look it up
on the internet but when this is turned
on MySQL is no longer going to strip
those spaces out when it's returned so
if you do a select statement on a column
of 50 characters and it only has 5 in
there it'll look something like this
and you can see that space so you guys
that's all I have to say about char in
this video in the upcoming video I'm
going to be discussing varchar' so I'll
be sure to see you guys then
