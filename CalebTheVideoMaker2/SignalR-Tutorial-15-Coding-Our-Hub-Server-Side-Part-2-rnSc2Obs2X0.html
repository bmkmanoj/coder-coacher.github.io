continuation of the last video now
before we talk about how the clients are
going to call this method let's first
make the method dusim so what we're
going to do is tell all of the clients
that there's an announcement so to do
that we can access the clients property
and then we can select all of the
clients and then after this dot we can
put a method or a function that is
available on the clients so just for
consistency sake we will call it
announced so what's happening here is
that when this method gets called every
single client has a function announced
that is going to be executed all right
so what exactly are we going to be
announcing on the clients well we're
actually going to pass in some data to
be announced so that means the client is
going to have an announced function that
accepts data what are we going to pass
in well we're going to pass in a message
and you can see that's going to give us
an error because the message does not
exist so where does this message come
from well essentially what we're trying
to do is make it so a client can type up
a message and press send that message
gets sent up to the server and it's
rebroadcast and do all of the clients
and the client is going to pass in data
to this method so we could say string
message so basically this method gets
called and we receive this message here
and then this message is rebroadcast
into all of the clients that is
essentially how the server-side code
works in the next video we'll be talking
about the client-side code thanks guys
and I'll see you there peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
