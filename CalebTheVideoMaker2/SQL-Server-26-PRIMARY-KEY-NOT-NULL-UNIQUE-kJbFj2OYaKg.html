going to be talking about primary keys
and a couple other constraints and how
to add them to the create table
statement the reason being is because we
have these columns in here but we
haven't told sequel server which one's
the primary key and we haven't really
described any of the columns in any
detail the very first thing I want to do
is start with the primary key but first
I'm going to change this back to
varchar' 50 and that way everything's
back to how it was now the column we
want to be the primary key is this ID
column and there's a couple different
ways you can add constraints but one of
the easiest ways is to add them as a
column attribute so when you have an
attribute it describes the column and we
put these right after the column and you
don't use commas or any kind of
punctuation all you do is put it space
so it's really simple just go after this
inch right here and say primary key /
Mary key there we go oh there we go
that's literally all you got to do to
say it's the primary key but the
downside to just leaving at a primary
key is that it's not going to
automatically generate new numbers and
the way to do that is to say that this
is the identity column and you can also
see that when we have multiple
attributes we can just separate them by
spaces as well as that when you say
primary key it's automatically going to
be not null and unique but we might want
to add some of those attributes to some
of the other columns for example this
name here we might want to say a name is
required so to do that you can just say
not and all same for the species another
attribute we can use is unique the thing
is here we don't really have a good
column to use this attribute on so let's
add another column we'll add an email
address for us to contact this animal or
or the animals owner if that would be
more appropriate so we'll just say
contact email and we'll need to add a
comma after the previous column and for
this one we'll say not null and unique
and obviously we're going to want to
throw in a data type here too
we'll just go with varchar' 50 now
something about emails is that emails
can actually be longer than this but in
the practical world most emails are
going to be way under 50 characters so
if you make a larger varchar' you
increase the probability of people
putting fake huge emails into your
database so generally I think
50 characters is just fine now you can
see that we've described a lot of the
other stuff in this table and the table
becomes a lot more like what we imagined
when we were designing this so let's run
this and just make sure everything works
fine okay commands completed
successfully now let's go to our object
Explorer and see how these things show
up so let's go to databases subscribe
tables animals and you see all the
columns right here you can see that this
is the primary key that's what that
little key symbol is and you can find
all of our attributes right here not in
all not null not null the unique
actually goes in the keys so unique key
right there and then there's the primary
key as well which is the same as this
one right here so that's a pretty rough
introduction to column attributes and
how to use them there are some other
attributes you're going to want to use
eventually including foreign keys
default which is actually going to give
a default value if you leave something
out when you insert data into this table
and then there's also an attribute known
as sparse which can be used for nulls so
if a lot of the data for a column is
null you can use this sparse attribute
and it will help save storage but we
will talk about all that in the upcoming
video so don't worry about it for right
now
just focus on what we did here and in
the upcoming videos we'll be adding some
more to this table and everything will
go well so thanks guys and I'll see you
in the next video and as always please
