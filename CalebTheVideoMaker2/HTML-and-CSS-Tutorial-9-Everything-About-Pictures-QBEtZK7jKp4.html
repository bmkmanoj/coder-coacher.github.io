it doesn't even make sense
hello everybody welcome to your HTML
tutorial I don't I don't want sure what
one this is I think it is the 8 then
it's the 9th yeah 9th and in this video
we are going to be going over pictures
so there's not too much to do with
pictures but sometimes you want to
insert a picture into your website or
your page or whatever else you're
developing and the way you do that is
well first you find a picture so I have
a picture here on my desktop image 0 0 1
I just drag it there from a different
folder you can upload it there whatever
and don't freak out but it's picture me
with a pig it's a picture of me holding
a iPad with a picture of me so it's like
a double picture of me see what I'm
saying
so that is image 0 0 0 1 alright so the
first thing you want to do is right
click it and click properties at the
bottom probably click that or if you're
on a Mac or something figure out another
way to do it type of file look right
here
dot jpg with noe so that is the type of
file that is what you will need to know
so I'm just gonna cover that up and then
we can have a paragraph tag which is
where we can put our content and within
this paragraph tag we can have a not an
anchor tag I'm sorry I said a which made
me type a but I I'm into say a image tag
IMG SRC
this is an image tag so this is what it
looks like
yes it's pretty cool
I know but nothing too exciting
basically we have the image IMG that's
what that stands for source SRC and then
in quotation marks is the name of the
file and it was image dot image 0 0
jpg and then what we have we have to add
something called a bolt which this this
shows up if for some reason the image
won't load or if there's some problems
we could say a picture of me holding a
picture of me which is probably a crappy
description so this is what this is what
happens and it looks I mean good I mean
not the picture but the website and
whole looks pretty good so that's good
means we didn't screw something up so
what other tricks can we do well
oftentimes when you have a website you
won't have your images in the same exact
folder as the index because in it then
I'll just get messy so you often have
the index as well as any other pages
such as social links and all that on the
same part of the website so what often
times you will have either a if scuse me
a folder which we will name images and
we can put images in there or the folder
will be in one directory up which will
be explaining that soon so now our
folder is in the image our picture is in
the images folder so I bring this over
here we have the images folder and we
have one image in right here so how can
we access this photo well if we refresh
we can see the photo is gone so it's
it's still trying to get it which means
it's not an error it thinks it's there
so it's confused it doesn't know what to
do well now we have to add a forward
slash images sorry take off that first
forward slash images forward slash and
this is what we get now so that is how
you go into a folder so if you had to go
in another folder you can go like this
so if you have three images folder for
some three images folder for some
folders three images orders for some
reason then that is how you would do it
but then there's an other times when
your image is not in a folder but
actually if older up so if you look if
you look here
our URL it says G users Caleb desktop
and then our file index.html so that is
where our our web page is located the
picture on the other hand is also
located on the desktop so you can
actually look you can actually get a
hold of the picture by typing image 0:01
dot jpg and it opens just the image file
so that's actually a security threat for
some picture files or other types of
files if you can just access them like
that in the URL that's not a good thing
so that would be lets say Caleb
currycomb was where my index page was
right there well then our images could
be one folder back to where you can't
reach using the URL so how would we do
that with this well we can get rid of
the index this is what we did we get all
our index of users Caleb desktop and we
can actually put this image in this
index you see what I'm saying so let me
get this folder up so you can see if I
have it all right so we are on we're
currently on the desktop right so if I
go to if we go to my name we can access
the desktop from here
so Caleb desktop this is where my
picture file is well if I go up one and
put in Caleb like here now it's not it's
going to be confused and not know how to
access it again because we changed the
file path so to get to it now we don't
put this images folder we actually have
to put two periods one to forward slash
and then image zero zero one dot jpg
this means to go up one directory and a
directory is just a folder so if we
refresh now it works that's because it's
going to desktop
it's back to Caleb and then it's typing
in well then it's retrieving image 0 0 1
dot jpg so that is how that works now
there's just one more thing I want to
talk about real quick when we are with
pictures sometimes we will want to put
the pictures on there ourselves other
times they will be on there dynamically
what that means is for example if I
build a social network and all of my
users could upload pictures you know
like F book or Twitter or whatever well
then you're not sure exactly how big
these files are going to be so in CSS or
any other programming language you can
limit the file size or shrink the
picture size so they're all the same
size because if this was a profile
picture that'd be pretty big but other
times when you're uploading the picture
yourself you can limit the size
beforehand so it doesn't throw off the
throw off of the website display so you
can do that by typing width equals and I
need to put like 100 or you can put
pixels if you want which I think that
works too yeah that's the same thing so
typically it's not recommended to design
web pages with HTML you're actually
supposed to use CSS because a long time
ago people built websites using only
HTML and it it doesn't work good but
when you don't want to throw off your
form HTML can actually shrink the file
itself let me show you what I mean it
can shrink this box here to fit the
picture perfectly without having to
resize your website as it's being loaded
so sometimes it is recommended to use
HTML to style things but very very very
very rarely this is an example where you
may want to give the picture a width so
you can
keep it sized nicely so if I duplicated
this now we can have it fit nicely all
the same size and someone else could
upload a different picture for example
and that's really really cool and creepy
at the same time let's do a whole bunch
of those Swede
that's so cool I all right well that's
all I really have to say about images
and thank you for watching in the next
video we will be going over inputs input
types like text inputs and all kinds of
cool stuff which is really awesome so
that is where things get intense I will
see you then bye intense I mean fun not
not hard see I'll see you then be sure
to subscribe and if you don't I will
show up at your door like that and you
don't want that
so yeah and you won't be able to escape
no matter what you do I'll just I'll
just keep just keep appearing and keep
keep appearing see I'll see you later
good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
