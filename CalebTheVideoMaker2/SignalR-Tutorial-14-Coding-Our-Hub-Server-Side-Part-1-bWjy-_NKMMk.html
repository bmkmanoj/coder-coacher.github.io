are going to continue our signal our
adventure by creating our first hub so a
hub is just a c-sharp
class so to add a class to our project
all you have to do is right click and
click Add and then class now you can
name it whatever you like and you can
see here has this dot CS that means a
c-sharp file if you don't put that it
will add it by itself so you can just
put the name of it here I'll just put my
hub and click Add now it just added it
right here right in the root of our
project if you want you can put it in a
folder or something like that but this
will do for now if you remember from one
of my older videos I mentioned that in
order to tell c-sharp hey this is a hub
we have to inherit from hub now you can
see when I put hub it has a little red
squiggly under it and it's not doing
much it doesn't seem to be working well
that's because of namespaces so any
class is always inside of a namespace so
if you remember back when we had the
console we went through here and we
installed Microsoft is p.net signal are
well this is the namespace of that hub
so what we need to do is put polling
Microsoft dot is P net dot signal r dot
hub now that is quite the long name
there so because that can get kind of
tedious there is an easier way to do
this and what you can do is just take
all of this stuff right here and take it
up here and put it as a using statement
so you can say using Microsoft dot asp
net dot signal are and then you don't
have to qualify it
qualifying means when you put the
namespace before or to tell it where
it's from so now we can just put hub
great that's all you really have to do
to create your hub but we're going to go
a little bit farther within this hub we
are
going to create a method so to create a
method just put public void and then you
put the name of the method announce put
two parentheses open close and then put
an open parenthesis you can see it'll
automatically put the closing one press
ENTER it'll take them down to the next
line so now we have an announcement to
kind of go over this a little bit public
means it's access it's accessible to
other classes void means it's not
returning any data as you can see it's
really not even doing anything this is
what's known as the identifier it's the
name of the method and then the
parentheses are where we put parameters
so if we need to send data to this
method when we call it that is where we
put that so for example we could say
string announcement and what that would
require is when we go and call this
method we have to pass in an
announcement which we can then use
inside of the method announcement but
for now that's that's out of the scope
of this video so that's really all we
really are going to talk about in this
video in the next video we'll be talking
about what we're going to put inside of
here and how exactly the client is going
to call this data so thanks guys and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
