HTML CSS tutorial and if you remember in
the last video we talked about whoops
too big starting our HTML page so I'm
going to just see ya so I'm just gonna
put this on the side like that and I'm
going to so this is what it's going but
this is my setup here so in the last
video we talked about creating a basic
very very very very very very very very
very basic website though so this is
this is in essence our website all it
says its content in first HTML page at
the top if you can see that it's kind of
cutting off right there but it's fine if
you look at right there ah yeah this is
our website now as you learn these are
all called tags they have an HTML tag
head tag title tag and a body tech
weight and we end them all by we always
end tags by putting a left mouth thing I
don't I don't even know what's called Oh
a lesser than sign then we followed by a
forward slash which the top part points
to the right and then we end it by
typing the tag and then we put a greater
than sign so that is how you close tags
so now we're going to learn about a new
tag it is this so I've put them in all
lowercase this is what we call the
paragraph tag this is where we can put
our content to where it now has a tag
rather than just throwing it in there
because HTML it works if you just throw
content in here it's still renders it
but it's not it's not good practice
because as you can see FS DF
still works even though it's before this
because it shows up right here and all
this crap so you want to follow a basic
guideline so it's not a huge mess and
doesn't cause any errors with older
browsers and other stuff
that so we want to put our content
within paragraph tax so inside this is
an awesome paragraph yo-yo save refresh
this is an awesome paragraph view as you
can see it shows up we wanted another
paragraph we could just go down add new
paragraph tag this is a second paragraph
then we can end
oops and the paragraph tag save it
refresh this is a second paragraph with
doubts I'm not sure is it well yes it is
because it's within paragraph tags or P
tags whatever you want to call them so
now what okay well the next thing is as
you can see there is a there's a break
here so it's not all ramp there's not
they're not running together right but
what if I say in this paragraph I want a
bunch of content so this is a quick
story and I was out in the woods and I
found these objects dog a dog car and a
chicken sandwich and then we save it
refresh it this is what it looks like
well if we wanted to break up these
words on their own line we could add
another tag in here this is called a
break tag it looks like this so as you
can see this one's a little different
whoops sorry about that guys
this one's a little different it's a
break tag and it has a space and then a
forward slash and a closing tag you may
see it like this but I'm going to put it
as this because I think it's the most
appropriate way to do it the reason it
looks like this is
because it does not have a closing tag
so if you see paragraph opens and then
paragraph closes well this break tag
doesn't close it only opens so for it to
do that we put the closing part within
the opening tag it's kind of weird but
you'll get used to it very quickly so I
can go like this put a break there put a
break there and then if i refresh the
page
I found these objects a dog car a
chicken sandwich so that is the break
tag so that's really cool now we're
going to be getting into some titles
because this may look a little boring
it's all the same size and stuff what if
I want it to be like this is a story so
I feel like this is a story and then we
start the story down here we refresh all
right sweet so now we have our little
story
sweet yeah I know pretty awesome I'm
gonna get rid of these commas I think
it'll look better save it refresh a
doggie a car a chicken sandwich I think
I spelled sandwich wrong no I think it's
right I don't know it's probably wrong
but anyways now we have this as a story
and then we have the story down here
this is a really lame story the end so
what can we do with this well we can
make this what's known as a header so to
do that we put h1 then we end the h1 so
the h1 tag does have an ending we save
it and refresh this is a story as you
can see it's big bold easy to read so I
guess you could say this is a title the
following content is a story that's more
appropriate
so now the big bold letters is the
tighter title the following content is a
story here's the story
so as maybe for a blog post or something
like that now you may be wanting to
you're wondering to yourself why is it
h1 well that's because there's actually
more than one type of header so I'm
going to display all these let's get rid
of all this crap stuff I should say
let's go through the list H 1 and H 1 H
2 throw words almost done making
mistakes here so I think there's six
types so this is H 1 this is H 2 this is
H 3 this is H 4
this is H 5 by the way you can also use
the arrow keys to navigate between
letters so we doesn't know that I'm sure
you did but maybe not I don't know save
it refresh now you can see 3 6 different
types of titles I don't think there's an
H 6 but I mean a 7 let's try though yet
see it's not even recognized so this is
what it comes up ax which is the normal
size so those are all of our headings
and you can use those to make titles and
subtitles so typically h1 will be used
for the main big letters at the top h2
may be used for a title or subtitle and
h3 can also be used so that's some new
tags that you may need in the future and
in the next video we're going to be
going going over lists which are very
useful so I will see you then thank you
