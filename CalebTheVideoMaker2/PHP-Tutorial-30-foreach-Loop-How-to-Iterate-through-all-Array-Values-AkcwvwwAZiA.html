the video maker - and in this video I
want to talk about another control
structure or basically you can think of
this as a way to it8 through every
single value in an array so earlier in
our previous videos I talked about
echoing a single value in array so you
could do like cake zero for example
that's going to reference a single value
well occasionally you're going to want
to do something with every single value
within an array with an array oh gosh
within an array so to do this we use
what's known as a for each it's one word
by the way I'm using new chalk but I
only have one piece but I'm planning on
getting some more hopefully I took this
from a school and I liked it I asked for
permission I trust me I would not steal
chalk that's ridiculous
so if it's good go to buy some more we
have 4-h now within parentheses we add
something actually playing anymore so
here's what it looks like similar to any
other control structure shows such as an
if you've seen the same you see the same
structure of parenthesis and curly
braces alright so here we can just to
make things easy let's pretend we have a
variable so up here we have a variable
and it is food and this is an array
consisting of five foods doesn't really
matter what they are
well the first thing that we put in the
for each it is the variable that we want
to use so we would write it like this
food and then we put the word
as a s-s-so food as and then we can just
make up any variable one such as value
so this is all we have food as variable
value all right you probably are
wondering what is the variable value
well that is actually going to be a
reference to the value of each of the
key value pairs in food so let's take a
look at food here this is separate from
this just say now food consists of pizza
cake um human flesh ah bacon bits and
zhonya cool cool cool so here are all of
the values within food and these would
also have an appropriate key so if it
was an indexed array this would be 0
this would be 1 2 3 4 and that's it so
how does this work exactly well it's
going to ite 8 or go through every
single one of these key value pairs so
the first one pizza it's going to assign
value pizza so within these curly braces
if we do something with value such as
echo it
just like this
well the first time it goes through it's
going to echo pizza once that's done
it's going to go to the next value it's
going to change the fat the value of the
variable value that's kind of confusing
make it cake so then it's going to echo
cake and then it's going to echo human
flush and then it's going to echo bacon
bits and then it's going to echo lasagna
so value turns out the variable value
points to all of these right here and
it's going to it8 so it's going to use I
don't even know if that's the right word
it's going to go through each one of
these and replace the previous value so
the first time it's pizza the second
time it's going to be cake third time
human flesh then bacon and then lasagna
so we declare this variable within the
parentheses which allows us to use it
inside of our code block so you could
say between these this is a code block
value points to each value within the
array and then we're echoing that value
we could change this because I said you
could make up any variable so if you
wanted you could make it X and then we
echo X if we echoed value well it
doesn't point anywhere so it's going to
call us an error so that is how you go
through each one of the value key value
pairs within a for each although there's
one thing you probably noticed all we
looked at was the value we never really
looked at the key
you know what I mean so we there's
another thing we can do to look at the
key and the value
well that one's a little more
complicated but it's not bad but I'm not
gonna have enough room so I'm going to
shrink this down bit looks like this
we're each within parentheses we would
have the the array we want to use so
foods as now we're going to have two
variables key all right so now you can
see we have another thing in here right
here and that is this the variable key
which points to the variable value all
right so now when we have it in this
format the ver the array as variable
pointing to another variable that's
going to give us the key and the value
so let's look at this
we had the array of foods and first one
was pizza so let's use this block of
code to echo what is going on echo and
we are going to echo within quotes key
value that is what we're going to echo
okay so what is this going to do well
the key is going to it8 or go through
the keys and the value is going to go
through the value so pizza had the key 0
so this is going to echo out 0
Pizza okay and then once that one's done
with its going to go back through the
for each and let go the second key and
the second value which will give us one
and whatever the second value is I don't
remember and we don't always have to
echo it like this for example we could
say key is string value and then add
some extra words within the quotation
mark maybe a line break and so forth now
there's one thing that you really need
to understand about this these variables
here the first one points with an equal
sign and a greater than sign to the next
but they are not predefined in the
program so these are not up here to find
this one is so we can pretty much name
these whatever we want so we could say
okay points to be variable v and then
when we're using them within the bar of
code we're going to have to use the name
of row briefly and in the next video or
living after that one of these upcoming
videos I'm going to be showing you this
on the computer because now we're
getting to in to come into some complex
programming concepts and I don't want to
confuse you so I think it'd be easier to
see actually done so yeah that's gonna
be awesome so I will see you then be
sure to subscribe and I'll see you that
