basics we're going to jump into
something a little bit more advanced or
entertaining whatever you want to call
it I don't know but it's gonna be sweet
we're going to be learning about scales
this is on a whole new degree of
Awesomeness I just said a joke but you
won't get it until the end of this video
oh man
I'm funny alright so the natural sign if
you remember looks like this is very
important and the reason why is it'll
tell us our natural note so G sharp is
actually a G with a sharp sign so we
just ignore the start side this gets
important when it comes to scales
because I can have a scale let's say oh
yeah by the way sorry I shouldn't joke
too far ahead in the process a scale is
any group of notes played one after the
other in a sending or descending order a
sending is going up and pitch descending
is going down a fish
now a group of notes played an ascending
or descending order I'll play an example
of a scale
I just played a c-major scale so let's
say I have a scale starting on G a B C
now D E and then F sharp G here I'll
play this for you can we go
there that was a G Major scale hook you
could hear that that was AG major scale
now each one of these even though this
has a sharp on it has what's called a
scale degree that's why I said a whole
new degree of Awesomeness so I'm not
going to get too much into it but we can
just call this one this one two three
four five six seven eight even though
this has a sharp because that's just the
way the G Major scale is made even
though this has a sharp it still sounds
major and I know you have no clue what
I'm talking about but we'll get into it
so these are the scale degrees so this
means the third note in the scale we can
say is a third the third gonna be sorry
or three the seventh is seven so on so
forth now I wrote the fancy names for
all of the scale degrees it is not
necessary to learn these yet because we
are going to be going over these in
depth but just so you know these right
here are the fancy names for these this
one has two names because it depends on
the situation
and we'll get on get into that more
later so it's actually very important to
know understand the concept of scale
degrees because it allows us to measure
the distance between notes and the
reason we want to do that is because
it'll allow us to figure out how their
frequencies are their pitches if you
remember this from the beginning of the
series interact and how they sound
together for example some sounds
together sound back we find an example
it doesn't sound that Pleasant some
sound good
ah it's peaceful some sounds sad so uh
yeah some are something some will not
sound sad not sound Pleasant but they
will sound like they're pushing forward
into the movement of the song which is
very important because when we have
music we want to keep it going so if we
just play all happy songs so calming
it's not really that exciting what we
want is some tension that gets resolved
so we can do that with seventh chords
which if you play guitar or piano you
may have heard of these or any other
instrument really those are the
instruments I know about but we're going
to get into that later but the distance
between the notes is very important and
all this is going to sound kind of
stupid at first but in the end this is
going to help you more than anything so
pay attention now the scale degree we
had the 1 through 8 now it's important
to notice that the first one is not zero
but one and then the next one the last
one is 8 ok so we actually if we start
on C it's 1 we would call it 1 or if we
start on E we would call it 1 depending
on the scale the first one is always 1
not 0 so even though we didn't move it's
still considered a an important we have
to know that it's there I hope that
makes sense probably not but for now all
you need to know is when we have a scale
such as this is the first scale second
scale third scale fourth scale for scale
sixth scale 7th and 8th they're
different scale they're different
portions
of the scale as a whole it's broken up
into eight pieces in this case so that's
important and you need to familiarize
yourself with this and in the next video
we were getting it we will be using this
to figure things out so subscribe and
I'll see you then Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
