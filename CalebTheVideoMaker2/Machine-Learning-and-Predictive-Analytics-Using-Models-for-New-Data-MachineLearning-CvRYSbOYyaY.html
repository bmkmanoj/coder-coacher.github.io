last video we were gonna talk about
something new and you know what I
totally misled you because I totally
forgot about this really important thing
that we needed to talk about in the next
video we are going to be talking about a
new topic so this very important thing
that I completely forgot to talk to you
about is when you go through all these
processes you want to keep record of
what you've changed to your data so if
there's any kind of invalid data issues
which if you remember that's from like
when you're extracting the data you
messed something up or something like
that those kinds of things you'll want
to keep track of but those are less
important what's really most important
is any valid data issues so when the
data is valid it's just really awful
those kind of changes you're going to
want to keep a record of and record it
very well so basically you can kind of
keep a record like when you find a data
issue you can write it down and then
think okay what are we going to do to
this data to make it not terrible and
then you can do that to the data and
just write down in detail what you did
because you're going to actually need to
use that later and the reason that is is
because when you have new data that is
not historic and you want to make
predictions on it which is like the
whole point of machine learning you need
to go through that same process on that
new data in order to form your data to
the quasi reality you've been building
by messing with your data okay so think
about it this way here is your data this
is reality much much more complicated
and these kind of kind of represent each
other sort of but not really
so what we do is we take our data and we
go through a cleaning process to try to
make this represent this a little better
so we come up with a new clean data
source where we've gone through all the
processing and we've gotten rid of all
the issues and we just got the features
that are really relevant to our
prediction all of that kind of stuff is
it's ready to go and this better
represents this reality but the thing is
this reality which was originally tied
to this one has features that match this
reality representation so what we need
to do is we need to go through the same
cleaning process on what we what we
would say is new data from reality I
guess and put that into a new reality
okay so that's kind of a terrible
example essentially what I'm saying is
when you have a new patient come in you
have to go through those same changes
with that patient's data to get it to
line up with this new reality so I think
if this is historic data so anything you
know this way is historic and this is
kind of like present and future
okay so I'll think of some changes we
could have done we could have done a
clamp transformation that could have
been on wait for example we could have
also done a bidding process that could
have been on age and now when you have a
patient come in and you know they're
like 1200 pounds well we need to go
through that clamp transformation and
you know they're like 76 we need to go
through that bidding process that's
because if you remember back and one of
the long videos ago when we were talking
about all of the different possibilities
of attributes and the model is
essentially a traversal of an if
statement where you say oh if you have
this descriptive feature value with this
descriptive feature value with this
descriptive feature value then you have
this target feature value well if the
descriptive feature values don't line up
with that model then the models not
going to be useful for the new data that
you're using so we might not be able to
do anything with a 76 for a 1200 because
we don't have a model that represents
that data so we have to go through the
same transformations on modern new data
yeah cool that's that's really all I
have to say so see you in the next one
