your second database design series this
video we're going to be talking about
the relation very basic don't freak out
what it is math we're not going to go
super in-depth with math if you want to
know more about the math I have blogs on
my website about that
Caleb curry comm forward slash blocks
advertising not blocks advertising house
advertising anyways basically a relation
is just a connection between data so
let's just think of silly example if we
have the two sets of numbers 2 4 and
then the other set was 6 8 and then we
kind of combined these sets so we've
kind of like crossed here and then we
cross down here and where these cross is
our new set so we have the combined set
of 6 2 and then we have the combined set
of 6 4 and then we have the combined set
of 8 - and then the combined set of a 4
and like you're probably wondering like
what the heck does that have to do with
database design well somewhat we kind of
do the same thing with database design
relation in relational database comes
from this mathematical concept but
rather than combining sets of numbers
we're combining attributes of real-world
things so let's apply this to the
database first you need to know two
terms the first one is an entity the
second one is an attribute so an entity
is anything we store data about
attribute are the things that we store
so if an entity is a person and a
tribute would be their name their user
name their password their hair color
their address their phone number their
relationship status the person they're
in a relationship with the orders that
they've made or whatever whatever it is
it's depends on what you need to store
for that specific
application so entity is what we store
the data about the tribute is what we
store when we apply this to this this
connection with the relation we have the
atribute types and the attribute values
so let's say we have this person over
here and we'll name him Caleb because
it's an awesome name alright and then we
will also give him a user named Caleb
curry with no spaces and we'll give them
a password
hi 1 2 3 and then over here we have the
set of attributes for a table we have
name username and password we can make
this connection of data so the name is
Caleb the username
Caleb curry passwords PI 1 2 3 that
makes sense
although graphically it looks like a
mess so we store these in tables which
is exactly what we were doing with the
relations so we have up here in our
columns we have we have the name and
then we have the username and then the
password don't worry if you can't read
my handwriting your UV you get it we
store this in a table alright so these
are the things we need to connect with
this person over here which we named
Caleb and I accidentally erased them
whatever we'll just leave out that so
that's Caleb and we want to store this
information in this table which is a
graphical way to illustrate how we're
storing data in a database so we take
his name Caleb we take his username
cable curry
we take his password pi 1 2 3 we kind of
get this this table concept it almost
looks like a spreadsheet that we talked
about in the last video although it is
slightly different and we'll be talking
about that as time goes on this guy is
the entity that we're storing
information about these are the
attributes that we need to store about
this person or any other person so we
enter specific values for each one of
these attributes to make the relation
between the atributes and the entity
hopefully that makes kind of somewhat
sense and if it doesn't don't freak out
this all kind of I mean this is complex
dot and you don't necessarily need to
understand every single detail to design
a database so I'm just trying to explain
things and we'll get through these are
the attributes of this person this
entity and entity is basically just
anything we store data about it's
something could be a person in this case
but it can also be in order it can be a
customer can be a client it can be a
employee and employer whatever it is it
doesn't even have to be a person so now
the relation idea you kind of understand
that we're just making the connection
between the attributes and the entity
the value the entity attributes we're
entering that in the database that's
that's kind of a weak explanation but
honestly it doesn't really matter that
much for getting into basic database
design so if you want to learn more
about that just look up relation and
database design you'll figure it out so
now we have the entity over here and
then we have the attributes
so in table terms you probably know rows
and columns you might not know
specifically what they are and I'm going
to tell you this right here is a row can
you see that might be run that space
here I think we're good yeah we're good
so this all of these values are a row so
a row is all of the attribute values for
a specific entity so this row would be
easier just to go like this this row
points to that entity that person pretty
simple a column are all of the values
for a specific attribute type
so the atribute type is username we can
have another person Billy Joe and his
name his password can be what do you and
his name can be built this is another
person in our table so this is talking
about a different person we have this
person over here he's pretty chill well
this row is talking about this entity
the user name is a column where we have
all of the attribute types username so
Caleb curry Billy Joe and whatever more
if we put more values into the table all
right so let's again a little messy so
I'm just going to clean it up a bit
ah you raise so just to summarize a bit
we have very first thing we have an
entity type that's that's a word you
won't know entity type let's talk about
entities I'll just always tell you what
into the type is just a second entity
type and then we have the attribute type
so basically the type means it's a
category so the person was a specific
entity the Cape the guy whose name Caleb
that was an entity it was the person
then we also had the entity Joe or Billy
or whatever his name was those were two
separate people two separate entities
although you could tell that they were
somewhat similar they were both in the
same table
they were both talking about the
username password and so forth so the
entity type is user a specific entities
would be Caleb or bill or Jane or Jake
or whoever it is so the entity type is
basically the category of the entities
that were storing the category is a user
and all the all the entities within it
should be a user so my camera stopped
recording by itself for some reason
which is super annoying but anyways our
entity type is the category of entities
such as user every single entity should
be a user Caleb was a user Billy was a
user we could have Jimmy John we could
have got Katherine we could have Caitlin
we could have Cassandra we could have
you get the point the atribute type is
basically the categories of attributes
so we had the username we had the name
we had the password
these are attribute types because we
don't actually have a specific value if
like no one's name is name when we
actually give these specific values they
no longer become types and they become
specific examples so this guy over here
here's our entity Klingon store so
basically here's our entity we can store
attributes about this entity the
username can be Caleb curry bola the
name can be Caleb and the password can
be PI 1 2 3 so these are specific
contributes about that guy now all these
are all like complex terms and blah blah
blah
who really cares what really matters is
can you put this into a table for people
to understand who really cares if you
know the terms but I mean I'm sure your
professor cares so make him happy
anyways the table the columns are the
attributes so we could have for example
an ID a password a user name and email
we could keep going address phone number
and whatever else and then a row is
where we give a value for every single
one of these attributes all talking
about one entity so like this guy this
guy right here
well is you ID for example 72 his user
name is Caleb curry this email is cool
guy at hotmail calm blah blah blah blah
blah all of this row talks about this
guy so basically just think attributes
or columns entities are individual rows
sweet then this whole thing right here
this is the table and that is the entity
type so the entity type would be user
because every single row within this
table should be a user Oh another thing
I would like to mention real quick of
another name in mathematics for a row is
a couple or tuple I think it's double I
don't really know but that is another
term you'll hear so yeah double is a row
thank you
so yeah sorry for like yelling and
getting all intense but
it's fun alright so that's all I have to
say in this video if you want to
subscribe you better do that like right
now just click Subscribe and if you
haven't subscribed yet you better
subscribe and also click like you have
subscribed thank you and I will see you
guys in the next video where we will be
talking about relational database
management systems another big word
which we will explain shortly so see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
