HTML CSS tutorial series and now I'm
going to be getting into something
really cool so I mean yeah everything
we've been going over it's cool
by the way it's 5:11 just so you guys
know I'm going to be getting into what's
called lists lists so there's three main
types of Lists let's go over what's
called let me put in let's go
h2o I'm in the head I meant to go in the
body so I'm going to close yeah let's
close the head here so can't leave the
subliminal message here oh it's okay
body let's give an h2 around the h2 and
we're going to put things I enjoy doing
so I'm just going to put a list of
activities that I like to do so we can
create a list by putting ul and then we
can put end you up
this stands for unordered list so let's
look what we got so far things I enjoy
doing unordered list that's not
something I enjoy doing so let's just
put this on all right unordered list
oops I'm gonna chit sorry guys I'm gonna
change this to an h1 cuz I got a better
idea
so just gonna go h1 and then we're gonna
go yeah I'm order this page two things
by the way texts aren't usually this big
I'm zoomed in 200% if you can see here
so in reality it'll actually be right
there
which I'm also zoomed in with mine
recording systems so it is it looks
pretty big just so you can see clearly
so we have an unordered list and then we
can add Lisp items so to do that we put
Li and Li and in here I can put eat
peanut butter and jelly period things I
enjoy doing eat peanut butter and jelly
and then if we want to do that again we
could create a new list item riding my
bicycle another list I'm creating videos
and let's go one more
pretending to be gangster alright so
that is my unordered list so as you can
see we just declare it by putting ul and
then we end the UL and within the UL or
the tag I call it ul tag or tag or
whatever we put list tags so this stands
for list item unordered list then we can
just put the list item within the list
item tags so here's four things I enjoy
doing now let's make another h3 tag this
is going to be a ordered list things I
hate doing and I don't like typing in
caps someone take that out and this is
going to be a ordered list so to do this
we it's very similar Oh L and o L and
then within here we can create list
items just like the last one just doing
it all in one line this time you can do
that so now we can kind of organize this
song so I don't know what I ain't doing
I like doing a lot of stuff I hate
dusting I can't stand dusting I also
hate touching please I can't stand keys
oh man just thinking of keys makes me
mad well
anyways and I can't think of anything
else so oh yeah I got a good one
oh I and I hate hurting people's
feelings ha just kidding
all right refresh things I hate doing
dusting and touching keys that's
interesting now the last one this is I
can't remember what it's called
descriptive list right so to do this we
put DL and do descriptive list and then
within here unfortunately we don't have
Li that'd be nice
we actually have DT and then we end the
DT and DT and the DT and within here we
we have DD so I can put let's describe
this this table let's put an h3
descriptive list all right
and then in h2 we can put describe
myself so for your fresh grad
descriptive list describe myself alright
well my hair is curly it is kind of long
but not super long and
oh well we got my hair curly kind of
long awesome
I'm new GT my dog GD and now I want to
show you guys something very useful when
you're rushed on time if you're on a
line you can press control-d
and it will put the same line one line
below it so that's how you can quickly
create three data whatever DT stands for
my dog it's a border collie likes to
catch frisbees and he's awesome awesome
so now we have our three types of Lists
an unordered list things I enjoy doing
as you can see there's dots thing
ordered list things I hate doing they
have numbers that's why it's considered
an ordered list so yeah it'd probably be
something like things I need to do today
and then you'd order them and most
importantly support descriptive lists
you can add a like a thing to describe
and then you can give a description so
those are the three types of lists I
have to explain to you and in the next
video we are going to be going over
tables which not to design websites and
stuff because that's so like 1930s so
we're going over to tables to display
information and yes we still do that
nowadays to display database information
or anything so you can learn how to use
it and that's what we're going to be use
doing in the next video so be sure to
