so far you've created tables you've
inserted data you've selected data but
how do you actually go about updating
data for example what if this Caleb
curry here wants to change his email
address how do we go about doing that in
SQL well it's actually pretty simple we
use an update statement so the syntax is
easy you just put the column name and
then generally on the next line you say
set the column name equal to some value
and let me just scroll down a little bit
so we can see a little better and here's
where we type the new value for the
email so we could say new email email
com now before you run this please
please please please be careful okay if
you run this there's like a 50% chance
to get fired because this will literally
update every single email address in the
entire table so you always have to do
one more thing and that is use a where
Clause so now we specify which rows we
want to update and we have to do some
kind of comparison so we can do
something like where email equals on
also these should probably be in single
quotes and say Caleb at email com so
what this is going to do is update the
person who has the email Caleb at email
com so let's run this and make sure
works put semicolon and it ran so now we
can select everything from users check
the results and the email is now new
email at email com so it worked great we
could use this to our advantage to fill
in some of this null data let's say we
wanted to give Dylan an email we might
write something like this update users'
set email equal to Dylan at email com
but how do we go about actually deciding
which row well he doesn't have an email
so we can't do this so you might think
hmmm let's use his first name so we'd
say where first-name equals Dylan this
will work for now but this has a very
serious problem in that in the future we
might have multiple Dylan's and even if
you made this where
cause more complex to say oh where the
first name is Dylan and the last name is
Johnson well we could have multiple
Dylan Johnson's so this is why the
primary key is so essential instead of
using this where clause for the first or
last name we can use the user ID so what
we could say is where user ID equals
four so when we're doing an update
statement and we're just doing it on one
row we always want to use the primary
key or a unique column so we can be very
specific about what row we're trying to
update let's run this make sure it works
okay it ran successfully now let's
select from the table and now Dylan has
an email
awesome Dylan now you fit in how does it
feel and that is a general summary of
the update statement I know it's super
simple but that's always a great thing
right so one thing I wanted to mention
to you is the term data manipulation
language and that is what we've been
focusing on these last couple videos
with the insert select and update but
there is one more piece that we need to
cover and that is the delete this is how
we get rid of data inside of a table
that's what we're going to be talking
about in the next video so thank you
guys be sure to subscribe check the
description click like all that good
stuff thank you and I'll see you in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
