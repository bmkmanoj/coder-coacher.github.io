I'm going to be talking about a problem
you may run across and I'm gonna get a
drink real quick
I always forget to do it before I start
all right let's get started so as you
see in this comment this is how it works
you'll be writing Jim Larry Billy Joe
Swanson saved 84 and then it jumps to
the next line well that's something your
web browser does automatically but so I
mean look let's just try this out here
save it here it goes 84 then I put cats
and it goes to the next line that's
because I zoomed in to where it crunches
down see it's it changes as I scroll so
if I go to normal soon it looks like
that save it oops all right so that's
what it looks like so this is known as
word wrap
but actually when you think about it
this word wrap is done automatically so
this is actually with it has word wrap
yes but this new type of word wrap I'm
going to be explaining it does not have
so it does not have the appropriate word
wrap that we were talking about and this
is I'm going to show you I'm going to go
to paragraph go down to the bottom here
and I'm going to add
word-wrap:break-word and look you see
the difference it does absolutely the
same exact thing you see so there really
isn't a difference so what exactly does
this do well occasionally you will have
very very very very very large words
where people are just spamming so let me
say girl BAM so now I have this really
long word you'll see this is I'll get
back to them in a minute so as you can
see it goes hey girl and then a finished
girl on the next line so that is with
word wrap because I added the word wrap
CSS over here if I turn this off it's
going to look very unpleasant so boom
you can see it just goes off the page
right off the side and it kind of looks
like it just goes a little bit farther
but as I scroll out you can see it
continues to go so if I want to fix this
I could add a width and then you may see
comments ended like that and that does
not look very nice so we can add that
back in word wrap equals break or
and I would recommend you put that on
any on any limited size comment or box
or anything typically on the width or
something but that's what the word wrap
does so accidentally I didn't mean to do
that was it reported there we go so now
it's going to break it up and bring it
down to a new line so let's try let's
let's add this that's out of div in here
alright so just gonna make a division in
these comments this is also a comment
but it is not part of a paragraph so it
looks a lot different don't make fun
just because it's different so that is
another comment and you're probably
wondering why it looks like that well
it's actually a div so we styled the
divs to hold the comments if we wanted
to we could give this div is we can
style this specific div for the comments
which we'll get into that in upcoming
videos but not right now so for the div
I'm gonna have word wrap off and for the
paragraphs from that word wrap on so I'm
gonna add a really long word here all
right there we go so now you can see it
goes off the page and it doesn't look
very good but the comments on the other
hand cut off and bring the word down to
the next line so if you absolutely can't
break the word like that and you need it
all in one line you can keep word wrap
off otherwise you might just need it
alright so that's all I have to say in
this video so I shall see you in the
next one be sure to subscribe and
I go to my facebook page and so forth
but mostly subscribe so I shall see you
in the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
