actually gonna be really simple I mean
let's it fly it's gonna be pretty simple
and probably be pretty short too because
it's really simple concept to grasp and
I've actually already explained it a
little I keep repeating myself but it's
alright because I want to drill this
into your brain so you can be PHP
myadmin in MySQL experts so you can know
SQL and be good at it
build your databases and stuff so yeah
this is my members table with all this
crap about my members yeah
pretty interesting so from SQL this is
actually going to be a limit clause now
you're probably thinking like oh okay
look you've already told us about this
why are you wasting our time well for
one it's interesting and for - I like
wasting your time so let's go select
everything from members now let's let me
think of an example first let's go back
to the table and look at it you may say
hmm
let's find organize everything by their
birthday which is cool and all but I
mean yeah if you if you want to be
really cool you'll say let's find the
three oldest people in this entire
database so what you want to do with
this is from us query we can say select
first name last name and what this is
going to do is this is what it's going
to return so the three entries are going
to have the first name and the last name
so you will not see any of this stuff
here nothing so that's gonna be pretty
cool I guess so first name last name
from members
let's capitalize this for good
consistency just like first name last
name from members we're actually
learning even need a where clause for
this because it's just all we're going
to do it's order order by and then
birthday so let's let's just see what
this comes out of us and you can see we
should probably display the birthday
yeah let's do that
edit first name last name birthday that
would make a lot more sense click go so
you can see this guy was born a long
time ago and here's the oldest people
the three oldest people so we can return
just these by putting a limit and simply
do that limit 3 it's really simple click
go and it returns 3 you're probably
think what is the purpose of this well
be creative I mean you can limit your
options to it'll make things faster for
once because you're not going to need
hundreds of things return you're only
going to need three so that's gonna be a
good thing so that's one reason why you
could use a limit and another reason is
for selecting like let's say I have a
bank system and you want to select the
person with the most money that they
have and you're gonna send him a bunch
of advertisements for your new banking
program and hopefully since he's such a
dedicated banking member he will sponsor
you or something like I don't know
basically when you need to return less
results you can use a limit by so you
can use order by to organize by their
birthday and then a limit to three so
let's say we were doing that banking
system we may be doing something order
by account balance and then limit one
and this will basically give us the
highest I mean this is a ascending so
when you click go it's a going to
organize and limit to just one result
returned so if you want to find a person
with the lowest you just make it
descending or a sending just flip it
around and you can get different results
so if you see this as we have it now
let's go
how we add it because this isn't going
to work court order by birthday limit 1
and we want this to be a sending so if
you see this click go we get the results
so the oldest person is John Ming and if
we want to see the youngest person let
me say decently or des c4d sending click
go and Bucky Roberts which pretty sure
is older than this but pretty cool so
yeah that is the limit clause hopefully
that I gave you some cool ideas and hope
you have some such so with some stuff so
yeah subscribe and I'll see you in my
next video thanks and it's going to be
awesome I promise why can't promise that
but probably see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
