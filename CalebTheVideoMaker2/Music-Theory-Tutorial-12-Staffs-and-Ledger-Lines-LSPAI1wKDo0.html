into writing our music down on a staff
I'm super excited
and for those of you who don't read
music you're probably thinking oh it's
so stupid no one cares but it's
definitely an important part and it's
kind of fun once you get used to it
so as I said in the last video we write
music on what's called a staff it's cold
in here
just throw that out there so staff five
lines oh whoa that could have been bad
where was I
five nights well it looks pretty da da
da da da now sweet that's all cool and
yeah yeah yeah
so we can represent pitches on this
staff so we can okay let's say we can
just assign a certain line a pitch so
let's say this is going to be a G this
line so when we write a note which just
looks like this like that
or like a deal most without the little
yeah you get the point that's that's a
note we can represent pitches with just
a circle or a little bit technically
they're kind of sawed angled upward but
it's not that big of a deal so we can
represent pitches like this that's AG
because that's the pitch I assign to
this line so this is a G and each line
and each space represents a different
pitch so the line above it is naturally
going to be the next letter in the
musical alphabet and we know it's ops a
G so it goes so let's say this is G for
this is going to be a four because
remember scientific pitch notation goes
from C to C so even though we're going
to the next set of A to G we're still at
a four because down here is C and we're
gonna do that soon this is G this is a
so a the next line right here is going
to be
be and then this line right here is
going to be C and this one right here is
going to be D and this one right here is
going to be e and then this line right
here is going to be s then we can
actually write a note above the line
like that see it's not it's on the line
but it's not a cross line like this
because if we were to represent an F we
would draw it with a line in between the
whole of the circle so this is actually
G we can do that we can right above the
staff lines so this is a G I don't know
I wrote it inside it here this is a G
and now when we go too far high or too
far low we create what's called a ledger
one more vocabulary it's important you
familiarize yourself with these terms
I'm giving you although it doesn't
really matter that you know them as long
as you know how to use them for example
you can know that this is a ledger line
and not really know it's a ledger line
as long as you know this represents a C
and it's above or below the staff that's
all it really matters but as a music
major or a professional musician a tutor
trainer or just having fun you may want
to pick up on some of the vocabulary
because when somebody's talking about
ledger lines and you're like what I have
no clue what you're talking about you're
going to a look dumb especially when
you're such a great musician and don't
know what a ledger line is - I think -
but you're not going to know what
they're talking about which eliminates
because we think of music theory as the
universal language everybody knows about
music theory no matter if you're in
America or anywhere else you should know
these vocabulary words because you're
limiting yourself from what you can
learn from what you can interpret from
what you can that's about it but you can
still hear music
that's why music is the universal
language anybody anywhere can hear it
interpreted the way we write music is
just a way to represent the way it
sounds on paper or nowadays on tablets
or computers or well they're best
computers but yes
so pleasure lines after my rant a ledger
line is a small short line above or
below the staff so an example of a
ledger line would be here and here and
here and here and here so if we wanted
to represent this pitch
we'd have to create one two three four
five ledger lines to tell them that's
how far to go down because there's all
these notes here so this one's gonna
back tall and this one's gonna make done
because this is a lower pitch on the
staff well that's all I have to say in
this video which was the introduction of
staffs and writing music and also notes
the way they're written but we're going
to get a lot more in depth and in the
next video I'm going to be talking about
something really cool it's very
important it has to do with this cool
design looking thing that musicians draw
and look fancy it doesn't work so yeah
we're going to talk about that little
cool thing in the next video so yeah
subscribe follow me on Twitter and like
this video please I'm not begging but
please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
