going to be going over what you may hear
as a triad vocabulary but I mean it
doesn't really have a name that I know
of so yeah let's go basically when we're
creating triads we make thirds on top of
thirds or if you're thinking absolute
measurement we have a third and a fifth
from the root so if that all confuses
you just forget it for now let's go back
to the full third concept we have a note
called the root which is the note we
start on it is the tonic of that scale
for the major chord we're creating so if
we're creating a G major score well it
looks almost blue we can take the tonic
of the G Major scale which is
conveniently g but it's more appropriate
to call this the route because it's the
root of the chord or the triad now when
we are inverting it or flipping the
notes such as see eg eg see then the
root is no longer in the base or the
lowest note in the triad and that's how
chord inversions are created now that we
know that everything is built from
thirds we can study it more and get what
you may hear as the Triad vocabulary and
this is start on the a chord and a third
from the a is a see now the third from
the a is C third from C is e this is the
vocabulary for a the term for this is
the formation of a course or triads now
what about B a B has B D and F I think
so so be
see d that's the third d e f here's the
formations for a B major triad will see
this chalkboard for dead now we have C I
think we have this one memorized by now
see EG d we have D F a we're just
ignoring all accidentals don't worry
about them c d e g and b f a c and g e--
be i think those are all right we'll
check as we go so now what did I just do
i took a note such as be found a third
above it be what's after bc d so this
would be the 3rd this would be the root
makes sense we just get rid of the seat
now what's after the third so we have
yeah march Steve Parker Barker's only so
we have be followed by D followed d e f
F I really hope you have the idea of
triad formations drill it into your
brain if you don't learn them it's just
a major third followed by a minor third
for the major triad now you can get
different versions so we're just
ignoring the majors and the minors and
all that crap we're just thinking of
thirds so third from be this is a third
because in a scale we're covering three
of the scale degrees a b c d so if it
from here to here that is a third one
two three because we're covering three b
c d now sorry if I'm saying the same
thing over and over again I really
apologize i tend to do that but it's
okay now d to f is also a third that is
how this is being created
such as e a third from E is g e f g
pretty cool so what is the point of this
well good question i have no clue that's
all see you the next video top skinny so
this is how all triads are made using
one of these so we pick a triad let's
say i would make a d major chord that
would be this one right here so we're
doing something with D F and egg now
what exactly are we doing well that
depends what kind of cord we want all we
have to do is figure out the accidentals
now I know off the top of my head
because I'm really smart this is ad
minor chord because this is a minor
third this is a major third let's take a
look at a piano over here stupid marker
and like you anyways d
four half steps one two three four
that's an f-sharp so if we want to
create a major chord we'd sharp the f
but we're not so we're going to find it
or bring it to its natural state F
natural now three followed by four half
steps so one two three one two three
four dfdf add a marker here stay DF and
a basically it's going to have a DF and
an A one of them may be short such as d
f sharp and an a or we may have DF and a
flat for a diminishment the concept i'm
trying to show is we always have them a
third a part now you may want to
memorize these if we have sheet music or
staff i should say we get one two three
four five and we're starting on D the
notes will always look like this I just
think of like a snowman then add like a
little rest here but anyways I don't
even have a rest with nodes but anyways
before I get sidetracked again here is
the creation of D triads if I want to
make it major we had a sharp here if we
want to make it augmented land sharp
here if we want to make it diminished we
erase both of these ad flat here so
forth if I wanna make a minor we just
leave like that cool so let's try one on
see recreate my staff here we have C E
and G that is actually a major chord and
if you don't know why this one's major
in the other ones minor
all you have to remember is the what was
it we had major minor minor major major
minor diminished and we're starting on C
so that's why I have C major D minor E
minor F major G major a minor and be
diminished so that is the basics for
when they're all blank like this so what
am I trying to set for C gone 2 3 4 e 1
2 3 cheap so it's the formation of AC
chord they're always the 30 part c g so
that's why i'm just trying to say you
should memorize the Third's separated
between each note and i write them out
really super quick let's see how fast I
can do this AC e be e f that's so wrong
b c d e is big shoes alright no more
thinking see e.g d f a e.g be f a c and
g e-- be oh that was so fast not really
so here are the creations I remember
this one because it says ace really easy
this one fac I just remember the first
three letters of face and that's the
only trick I have to memorize these so
yeah that's all I have to say in this
video I'm talking a whole lot but i
think i repeated myself only 630 7 times
so that's less than usual so in the next
video i'm going to go over something
different maybe maybe not I might just
talk about this for a hundred hours
straight and I'll see you there
