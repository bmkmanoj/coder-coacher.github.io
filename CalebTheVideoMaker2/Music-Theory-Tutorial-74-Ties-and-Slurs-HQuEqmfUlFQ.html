about ties and said oh I'm sorry I
didn't mean to slur my speech oh oh oh
man i was given cuz i'm talking about
ties and slurs oh man one day I'm gonna
find a lady and she's gonna love my
humor alright so just say but anyways a
tie is when we want enough to continue
for a longer value usually over a
measure so let's say I have a measure
here and then I have a measure here each
have four beats and I have a quarter
note well it's Avva a half rest in here
and then I have a quarter rest and then
I have a half note i'm in a quarter note
but i wanted to continue on for more
than one beat actually went to continue
up for two beats what i could do is tie
these notes together now i don't i don't
play these like duh i play it i play it
both the same note and that's what the
meaning of a tie is it just extends the
value of the first note it's not always
over the n over m bar line but it
basically you just add this value to
this one right here so this was a
quarter note tied to a half note this
would be become three beats long now
this is specifically for new musical
instruments that extend for longer
periods of time for example as a snare
drummer occasionally I will get a
quarter note tied to a quarter note
which gives this the value of two beats
but as a snare drum can only click it
and you're not going to roll because
there's no nothing telling you to roll
so basically what we do or I do is I
what we're supposed to do is we just
ignore this note and basically count the
as a quarter note and place the rest
there or count this as two and don't
don't hit again for the time note
because it's basically just extending
this no here all right cool that's all
cool but now there's also something
called slurs so if I have a note here
here's my staff and then I have another
note here and I connect them with a bar
like that like whooshed that's called a
slur that means you are to play those
without separation so we go from E to G
without breathing without stopping our
music it's just total I don't know what
the what it sounds are but um that's
what a slur is so if I this is part all
by the way these are both a part of
something called articulation which we
will be getting into farther into the
series I just wanted to explain this now
because it's pretty basic and I'm trying
to give you a good introduction without
overwhelming you too much we may see
notes tied together like this which
means we play this one and then we play
this one without separation let me try
and let me try and show you on the
keyboard here shop a mad slurring skills
right rat rat you ready for this got my
corset
that is a slur I didn't know I went
I just
now technically I should give them the
same length of time because these are
supposed to both be coordinates so the
tempo is 1234 1234 it rings itself but
and it typically that's when you let go
or represent that represents me not
making the sound anymore you're not
supposed to make the sound ring for 30
measures you're only supposed to make
the sound ring for however many beats
there are total to now if we have a tie
for example a quarter note tied to a
whole note that means and they're up at
I remember you don't change the pitch
you don't play the second note you just
hold this note longer that's the
difference between a tie and a slur this
would be basically holding this note 45
beats two three four five that's great
example of ties and slurs so thank you
for watching in the next video we'll be
going over something else that's pretty
awesome so subscribe thank you and I'll
see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
