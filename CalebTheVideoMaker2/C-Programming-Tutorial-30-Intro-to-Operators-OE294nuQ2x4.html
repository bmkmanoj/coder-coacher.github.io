caleb the video maker to this video we
are gonna be talking about operators
operators are super important in
computer programming so pay attention at
least more than you pay attention in
class because that's probably why you're
looking this up right now you didn't pay
attention in class right i know you
don't lie the easiest example of using
operators is in an arithmetic expression
such as 5 plus 5
this plus sign is an example of an
operator both of these are examples of
operands so the things that the
operators work on are called patients
getting operands see what I did there
cuz operators you know like nevermind so
you're probably thinking like didn't we
discuss math and see like a million
years ago yes but there's more to
operators than just basic addition and
subtraction and even the assignment
operator we talked about in the previous
video there is much more and this video
is going to introduce you to that so as
we discuss it in future videos you have
that organized structure you can
categorize things and have a nice
organized understanding of see operators
it's also very important to understand
that not all operators are used for meth
here is a perfect example if you guys
can even see that this is the assignment
operator an equal sign this isn't used
for math this is used to give a value to
a variable
well there's operators for all kinds of
things when we get into math there's
only a couple operators if we want to do
some more complex stuff with math for
example if we want to get the cosine of
something this is generally where
functions would come in operators are
usually more for the basic stuff such as
addition subtraction division
multiplication and yeah we'll get into
all that later I've mentioned it before
I am a firm believer that human brains
like to categorize and group everything
so there are groups or categories for
the operators the first are binary
operators I think I spelled this wrong
you can see that this has the terms by
in it and this refers to the number of
operands this is one of the three
classifications so I will write all
three now the first which only has one
operand are called unary the second are
binary and the third is ternary so this
is one operand two and three classifying
the operators by the number of operands
works great when you're first starting
out but there's actually another
classification you know you know I got
to make it even more confusing right and
this is grouping them by function not
function like computer science functions
that you call but function meaning what
do they do one example of a
classification of this is arithmetic
operators some of the other
classifications of operators are logical
operators assignment operators and
relational operators and there's some
more but these are the foundational ones
the reason I gave you these two
groupings first classifying by the
number of operands and then grouping
them by their functional or how they're
used the reason I do all that is because
I can describe an operator when I'm
first introducing it to you and you can
already figure out a lot about it for
example if I say we are going to learn a
new binary arithmetic operator you can
already figure out that hey it's going
to have two operands and it's going to
be used for arithmetic so you don't
really need to know much more than that
except what to put in so you guys that
is your introduction operators there's a
lot of classifications here don't feel
like you have to have it all memorized
right now but this is something you
should familiarize yourself with so when
someone says hey it's a binary operator
you have an idea of what that means you
also need to know these groups but don't
feel like you have to know them right
now
because we are going to go through all
of these so thanks guys I'm excited for
the upcoming videos because we are going
to be learning a whole lot of cool stuff
so thanks and I'll see you in the
upcoming videos if you want to support
