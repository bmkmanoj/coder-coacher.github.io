series I seriously just said MySQL again
didn't I
welcome back everybody to your music
theory series that means I need to get
asleep I'm going to be talking about
something called a metronome beats per
minute and the tempo and such like that
so a metronome is something that clicks
to give the consistent tempo here I got
one down here okay slow down speed that
up so that's a consistent tempo so
somebody invented this it's I think his
name's I don't know smell it Dietrich
and we go in like 1812 by this other guy
stole credit for it his name was
Johannes I don't pronounce these names
but anyways it was uh it was much more
primitive it wasn't it wasn't digital it
was like mechanical and first major
person use it was I don't know like
Beethoven I think 50 cent one of the two
everyone so anyways tempo markings are a
how fast or so needs to be played and
it's measured in beats per minute so if
I have a song at 60 beats per minute
I would represent it I'll draw a quarter
note say equals sixty and that tells
everybody there's sixty quarter notes in
a minute and at first look you might not
understand that but once you learn the
language it makes sense so that would
basically be like one-mississippi
two-mississippi three-mississippi and
the reason I say Mississippi rather than
Mississippi it allows you to break it up
into
Sweetzer one Mississippi two Mississippi
one Mississippi two Mississippi to get
120 beats a minute see I'm saying
hopefully that makes sense okay I was
pretty slow but that's one that's 118 so
160 160 beats a minute is this speed
pretty slow that's how fast a song would
be so fast play a song that's pretty
slow what if I crank this up
I'm not a musician very well who I am
but I mean I could use some work that is
an example of tempo markings because
that was planted 131 beats per minute
which are quarter notes and quarter
notes basically divide and measure into
a corridor typically so we'll get more
into that what we need to follow these
tempo markings typically at the top of
music this go along with the time
signature of usually 4/4 which is known
as common time and this will say there's
60 of these beats quarter notes and a
minute so if I wanted to double that
speed I can make it 120 get what I'm
saying so that's the basis of beats per
minute I don't really have one anything
else to say although I should say tempo
is another name for this and tempo can
change throughout the song and there's
you can actually accelerate there's
terms like accelerando or whatever or
how it's spelled
but there's fancy terms to speed up and
then there's you can change tempos
midway through a song and a bunch of
other cool things so that's about all I
have to say and I'll see you next video
Thanks bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
