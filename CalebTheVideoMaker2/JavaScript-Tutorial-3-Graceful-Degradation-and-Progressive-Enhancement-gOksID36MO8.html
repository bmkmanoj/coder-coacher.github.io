JavaScript tutorial thank you for
sticking with so far hopefully things
are going well if you have any questions
be sure to leave a comment alright so in
this video I'm talking about JavaScript
functionality so unfortunately there's
times when JavaScript just isn't going
to work the way we would like it to and
that means we have to use something else
so javascript is what's known as
client-side this means all the source
code is accessible by the person going
to your website that means it can be
altered and so forth
it doesn't affect everybody it just
affects their current session I guess
you could say so javascript is pretty
much useless for security because all of
the stuff within all of the code can be
altered it's also useless for complete
form validation and we'll be getting
into both of these in detail so useless
for security as I said it's client-side
this means all the source code can be
accessed by the user
anything can be altered for their
specific session and using something
that can be changed by anybody for
security that's bad because if they can
change it that means they can alter what
you're trying to secure against or
pretty much anything like that so don't
think of JavaScript as a method to
secure your website also javascript is
not perfect for form validation it's
great for form validation but it's not
perfect
nothing's perfect it can validate data
entered in a form very nicely but it's
useless for security preventing people
from putting malicious code in forms
cannot be done effectively with
JavaScript so proper form validation
must be done with a server-side language
that means all the code is on the server
the where the website is hosted and
specific users cannot access the source
code PHP is an example of a server-side
language JavaScript form validation can
is is in you still it always has been
but this is only an added bonus for
people who use javascript properly it
will make their web experience better
because they know that their stuff is
being entered properly because
javascript can tell them that oh you
need to correct your name or your email
or your passwords not appropriate so
that's what javascript can do I probably
should have said this already but a
forum is where you put data in so if
you're like registering for a website or
something like that but JavaScript can
take the values you put in and check
them or also known as validation to see
so that's a validation is so what are
some uses of javascript javascript is
used to enhance the user experience not
allow the experience to happen so there
should be people should be able to use
your website but some features may not
be accessible
this means a website should still be
functional without JavaScript I mean in
most cases unless you absolutely have to
have JavaScript or something so to
create a good website when people can't
use JavaScript for some reason we can do
any of the following things we can use
what's known as graceful degradation or
progressive enhancement we can also
pretend the people who don't use
JavaScript don't exist but that's that's
such a bad idea I decided not to include
it in the list so that's why it doesn't
get its own personal number so
degradation is building the complete
website and then working your way back
to make it work for people who don't
have JavaScript so you may build your
website and it works perfectly for
people have JavaScript but if they don't
well then there's some problems that
means you have to go in do do some
things work your way back to where it
works with JavaScript without messing up
the complete website you may have to
hack the website and do some other
things to allow it to work that way
also this right here may be of use no
script tags is something that pops up
when users do not have JavaScript
enabled so let's take a look here here I
have my website I have an index dot HTML
basic I haven't done any of the extra
stuff we'll get into that probably I'll
probably do that for the next video very
basic and you can see I have a no script
tag as well as a script tag so if they
have JavaScript this will happen if they
don't have JavaScript this will happen
so why don't people have JavaScript
well they for one it can be disabled in
any web browser and it may be something
such as a mobile device that doesn't
support JavaScript so for example in
Google Chrome
I can go to settings show advanced
settings and then keep going down under
privacy and go to content settings and I
can disable JavaScript so now if I look
on the website it originally said hey
that's because through the script tag it
references my JavaScript and writes hey
but if I have javascript disabled it's
going to do this rather than this
because I don't have any JavaScript
enabled so now if i refresh your browser
does not support JavaScript so now
that's something you can do you can have
your complete website and then you can
add a no script tag and say oh you need
JavaScript to do this feature that way
you're not completely ignoring the
people who don't have JavaScript but
you're letting them know that some
features may not work for them such as
instant form validation all right so now
there's enhancement so this is building
the website from scratch to where it
works for everybody and then once you
have the complete website to where it
works for everybody then you add the
extra content that just enhances the web
experience but it doesn't define the web
experience that is something you do
first
then you add the JavaScript in this
means everybody is happy so in review
there's two main methods graceful
degradation and progressive enhancement
graceful degradation basically building
the website and then working your way
back to allow people who don't have all
the features for them to be able to use
your website progressive enhancement is
where you build a website to where
everybody can use your website and then
you add the extra content to enhance the
website for people who have JavaScript
so that's all I have to say in this
video hopefully this is helpful if you
have any questions leave me a comment
and be sure to subscribe thank you and
see you later subscribe yeah that's what
