your 39th PHP tutorial that's pretty far
so thanks for sticking with it
if you liked this video please be sure
to subscribe this video I'll be talking
about absolute and relative paths so it
kind of relates to the last video when
we talked about include and require not
crap stuff now within these parentheses
we are going to include a file so we're
going to put these in quotes now there's
two types of paths if you don't know a
path is basically it points to the file
if you shouldn't if you're working with
PHP you're going to need to know a lot
about file locations and basically the
directory or whatever you want to call
it
how files are organized and the
directories they're in so you may have
you have like C users payload documents
this is an example of a file pack and
then we write that like this and so
forth now that is an absolute path the
reason it's an absolute path is because
it starts at the very absolute beginning
through can think of it like a tree so
if we turn it this way or you can think
about as an upside-down tree this sort
of like points everywhere so this is the
root and then all of these are known as
sub directories so like users as a sub
directory and then um Caleb was a sub
directory of users which is a
subdirectory of C now there's also
relative paths this goes from what's
known as the parent directory so when we
have a file let's say this file is in
Caleb documents
and if we're going to exam for xampp' or
whatever you wanna call it it'll
probably be an htdocs or somewhere
around there so this is just an example
documents well if we have a file within
documents called index.php documents is
known as the parent file because it
holds the index dot PHP just think of
like a kangaroo so let's draw kanga real
real quick that's a leg all right so
here's the kangaroo and then within this
little pouch
it has index dot PHP right so index dot
PHP is held within the mother directory
simple so the reference point is the
mother directory so if we wanted to
reference another file that was within
documents such as photo dot jpg whatever
you want it to be photo dot HTML well
then all we would have to do is put
photo dot HTML and bolt it's done
because it's a relative path very simple
now if we want to go even farther such
as another subdirectory so if it goes
documents forward slash pics and then
the file name well then all we would
have to do is add a slash fix slash file
name so those are the differences
between relative and absolute patents
one more thing you need to know about
that is if you want to go up a directory
so rather than going document pics you
want to go to Caleb which holds
documents you add two dots
and then a forward slash that's going to
go up the document tree so all of this
is new to you it may require some
practice so just look up when you look
up like file locations absolute and
relative that's all for that now since
its relative everything can be moved
like the whole website can be moved
because all the files stay relative to
each other
as for an absolute if you move the
website well it's no longer going to be
the same route it's going to change
routes so that's the downside to
absolutes but if your file system
changes and you move your pictures
folder or something well then the
relative is going to mess up well and so
either one because they absolutely mess
up too but the relative will work as
long as all the files stay in the same
location relative to each other but the
whole thing can move as a group which is
convenient now as for the file extension
here it doesn't really matter because
you're including it so you should just
use something consistent oftentimes I'll
use dog Inc thought PHP as the file
extension which seems to work good so
yeah but that's just we'll get into that
as we go in future videos I'm just
saying if you want to mess around a bit
so that's all I really have to say about
this and hopefully I was helpful I will
see you in the next video so I hope you
like this if so click like or wherever
they put it in a couple years or however
long and subscribe thank you and check
