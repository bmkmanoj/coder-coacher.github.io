simple I'm just going to be talking
about some consistencies that I've
collected and that you may want to
implement when you're doing databases or
databasing and basically what I mean by
that is you want to try and keep things
the same each time so I mean I guess
it's not that super important it for
everything but when someone else works
with your database or if you work with
your database
it'll help because it'll help you
understand what's going on and how
things are connected and some examples
of this are like how you name things and
how you describe the tables and such
that you're naming so the first one is
when you name your database always give
us something descriptive so my database
in my last video was Jim so I guess that
wasn't very descriptive because what's
Jim what's that to do with anything so I
guess I could have said like nah I don't
know that worked for my application
because I really wasn't going into that
much depth all of us would all it was
was about a gym so I named it Jim that's
a descriptive name for my database but
for your database or somebody's database
a short name like that may be too broad
and Confused people I mean people get
confused pretty easily so yeah and then
the next thing I'd say is for your
tables to also be descriptive by this I
mean name what you're going to have
within the tables so as mine was I think
it was members so basically the members
of the Jim
so I couldn't named it like Jim members
or in from Iowa's info so it's stored
info about the members so I should have
a good name for that table would have
been members info rather than info
because what kind of info that's
ridiculous nobody's going to know and
you want your database to be very
understandable for because that's the
goal to be a good database ER and to be
a good database sir you had good
database design so follow that next
thing the tables um let me draw this out
so here we have two tables all right and
then we have to call off the columns
let's say so
that's more like rows let's have the
columns here 1 column 2 column 3 column
1 so we have two tables with columns so
this one's like information this is
something else when you name a column
you want the the person who reads it to
know what table it belongs to so let's
say we have Jim so this is the info for
the people info and then you can post
reviews about your Jim where you work
out and so this is reviews now the next
that that's a descriptive name for the
tables the next thing you do is find a
primary key and primary keys I always
have a consistency of putting an
underscore up at the end underscore and
then ID so this would be member ID or
user ID whatever it is this would be
review underscore ID that's what that
way they know it's primary key and if
you don't remember a primary key just
keeps everything unique within a table
and I know I've told you that a hundred
thousand times if you watched all these
but that's just because I want you to
remember it now a foreign key refers
back to a primary key and I'll also have
those ID just like that alright let me
just clear things up a little bit here's
a table these are both tables and these
are the table names sat at table Jim
member info salad store all the info
like the name of the member and the
address so on
Jim reviews is stuff people say about
the gym now when you have a column
within this table such as the ID or
primary key you want to know which
column it goes to this will make things
a lot easier and clearer when you're
doing advanced queries and such so take
this word so the column would be
member ID rather than just ID or primary
PD or anything ridiculous so basically
this a lot if you see this and you have
two options either this table or this
table and it's a primary key you can
probably guess it's this table if not
that's okay so Jim reviews you may want
to review ID because now you know that
review goes to this table and you'll see
more of this when I'm building databases
that I'll try to make descriptive
columns so things don't conflict and you
always know which table they go to for
easier reading the next thing about
consistency I'll be going over is some
capitalization and such so basically
anything you put into the database
that's a call name database name or
anything like that I always on you
always should uncapitalized it so no
capitals no camel casing which is like
first on capitalized it's just basically
the whole word should be uncapitalized
so my database Jim it's not Jim it's Jim
it's not that big of a deal but when
you're making the base it's just the
queries that you type in it's best to
make the words that you're putting in to
be a lower cased because this makes
things clearer to read and anything
that's my SQL related such as insert
oops this will be capitalized because
that's the command and you didn't make
it up you can't change this or it won't
work then the other thing is quotation
marks when I quote something such as hey
I will usually use single quotes I was
pretty bad rather than double quotes and
I guess that really doesn't matter and
the only reason I'd use double quotes is
if I need to store a single quote or I
could just escape it but yeah you get
the point
and the last thing is when we go on
we'll get more advanced queries if you
remember some of my queries had a where
statement
so basically that will limit what you're
getting back where users account
balances over $50 that's an example of
where clause there's some more things
that you can put in the query to make it
more specific and when you do that
you'll put each one on a new line that
doesn't really matter it just makes
things consistent that's what I'm trying
to go for here this is all optional you
can do whatever you want and if you want
to change something it's fine it's not
set in stone but this is what most
people do and it's best to keep things
consistent all right so that's all I'm
describing in this video and I know
hopefully that helped clear things some
things up if it didn't well man I just
wasted a lot of my talking power for
nothing no I don't want to do that so
subscribe like the video and I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
