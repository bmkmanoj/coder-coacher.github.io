going to be talking about the cleaning
process we're going to focus
specifically on outliers it's going to
be a pretty simple video and in the next
video we're going to be continuing the
outliers and going through a specific
process so this one's kind of just an
introduction and we're just going to
talk about what to consider when we're
approaching outliers all that stuff so
what is an outlier well if you think of
like the normal distribution for example
an outlier maybe and value that is like
really really really far up here so
let's draw this out like this you can
see that you know there's really not
that many people out here but there's
like one or two extremely extremely high
values so this is the value how big it
is and this is number of people or
instances if we want to be vague that is
an outlier the same thing could happen
in the opposite direction outliers are
interesting when it comes to data
cleaning and this is where that
controversial thing I was mentioning a
couple videos ago comes up where some
people say Oh get rid of them
other people say oh they're essential
because they actually do represent
reality so one of the first things is
you want to make sure you get rid of any
invalid
outliers so an example of an outlier
might be 4-h you might have values from
100 to like maybe even 130 or something
and then you have a couple values in
there that are like 487 can you look at
that and you say oh clearly that's a lie
or someone type that in wrong well that
is exactly what an invalid outlier is
the value is not legitimate so you for
that you want to either replace it with
null or go through the process I'm going
to be talking about in this video in the
next video if it is a valid outlier
meaning the value is correct then you
want to keep it because it is legitimate
but you still might want to go through a
cleaning process which you'll see in
these two videos here so valid outliers
you want to keep them for now but
invalid outliers you want to mark them
somehow to say these need to be reduced
to a more realistic value or replaced
with null the outliers are going to
completely mess up your measures
central tendency because if you have an
age like 487 well if you took the range
for example that's going to make the
range seem much much higher than it
really truly is so you got to really be
careful with the outliers they affect
how our algorithms work they affect how
our data looks which is a huge thing
once we start talking about data
visualization this chart could look a
whole lot prettier and a lot more useful
if we didn't have this section right
here that is only contributing a very
small amount of information the goal
when we're doing machine learning is to
represent a lot of information without a
lot of information so we try to clean
out information that's useless keep the
information that's most useful so we
have very dense powerful useful
information close to the minimum needed
to make predictions and to find
correlations in our data so those are
the two things to be aware of with
outliers one is they mess up our central
tendency and two they mess up our data
visualization in the next video I'm
gonna be talking about how we address
these outliers the right process called
a clamp transformation it's not crazy
complex but complex enough where I
didn't want to overdo this video and
make it like forever long where no one
watches it and it's super lame so next
video will just be dedicated to the
clamp transformation hopefully this is
all making sense to you guys if you have
any questions or comments concerns or
would just like to say have a nice day
just go into the comments section and
just let me have it give me what you got
unless it's me okay thank you please be
sure to subscribe
help me take over the youtubes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
