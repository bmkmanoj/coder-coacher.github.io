glad that you have made it this far
keep up don't quit keep studying and ask
me questions do something just don't
quit
alright so when you're developing
websites you want to be able to size
stuff appropriately and you can do this
with a CSS obviously and well you can
decide to all right let me just let me
show you and go paragraph and then we
can go size 10 pixels so if we increase
this to 100 pixels oops it doesn't do
anything so I need you to do font size
I'm sorry so now that's a little too big
all right so we can change the size of
these paragraphs here by changing the
font size and as you can see I'm using
this thing this is 10px and if you don't
know what that is that's a pixel so what
is a pixel it's pretty much like a dot
like back in the old days like you have
those CRT monitors and I pretty much a
pixel it's like one of the little dots
from the screen and basically 10 pixel
font basically 10 pixel size which I
mean now it's now obviously it's
adjustable so it's kind of a lie because
it put anyways that that's a form of
measurement so there's also other forms
of measurement and which ones to use
depends on the situation so most
commonly I use pixels so I measure
things and pixels I want larger text
I'll use 30 to form if I think the
titles are too big
I can give an h1
and then I can change the font size to
10 pixels so now my titles aren't going
to be like ginormous they're going to be
actually really really small a little
too small to be honest so I'm going to
crank that back up to be 20 all right so
the average like average text size is a
16 so like I'm pretty sure the default
is 16 let me see let me see 16 pixels
all right so this right here 16 and then
if I delete it you see it stays the same
so the default paragraph text is 16
megapixels not mega whoa not megapixels
just pixels sorry on the lots of it so
let's try it figure out what each one is
well we could say font size 24 pixels
and you can see it shrinks a little so
it's probably a little bigger 30 pixels
all right that might be it let's try
deleting instant if it changes all right
got a little bigger still so let's go 32
pixels and boom I think I just figured
out the default font size for h1 titles
is 32 pixels so as I said pixels is just
one way to measure it there's also we
have water called EMS I me know it
stands for and then we have percent and
then we have points I wonder what AM
stands for let's look it up what does PM
stand
all right I'll sit on the right page
right here that's okay
I have no idea so yeah
it stands for now I'm just gonna say it
stands for electronic media because I
can't think of anything else
so I'm sorry I've been talking for like
like so many hours straight now I throw
it's kind of sore so we have EMS
electronic media's percents and points
now points that's like when you're in
Microsoft Word or something and you see
a 72 point like the font size 72 and
Microsoft Word is the equivalent of 72
point in CSS that's supposedly one inch
on paper so 72 point is supposably one
inch when you print out paper so now we
have all of these things so I'm pretty
sure you can also use inches and
centimeters and just a couple others but
I'm just going over these ones for now
so we can add points and then we can
have pixels px for now all right so
we're going to compare these obviously
pixels we already talked about that one
and points we already talked about that
one EMS on the other end that's almost
like a percent so if you twelve point if
you have twelve point font 16 pixels
that is one VM so the default the
default is 16 pixels like I said up here
for the first paragraph this is the
equivalent of 12 points all right so I
could say font size 12 PT and it should
stay the same you see what I'm saying so
that's that now that's equivalent to 1
a.m. the default if we want to double
that let's change to 1 a.m. boom it
stays the same we want to double that
size we change it to 2 so it's almost
like a percent sign it's almost from
going from 100% to 200% by doubling it
so if your default font size for let's
say h1 is 32 pixels and we put a.m. 1
a.m. 1 electronic media it's goes back
to that Sun so that would be 16 phone I
believe yes though that was what we
decided was the default so as you can
see these are the same the only
difference is pulled so that is a
relative measurement from 16 pixels
although if we change the font it can
screw things up so font it's how to
change the font it would be alright so
now we have a different font family
alright and then we go to warn TM this
is 1 a.m. in Tahoma but if we go back
two times let me just just erase it you
can see the size actually shrinks but if
we are in 16 pixels and then we go to
home ah that's just a tad font this is
with 16 pixels Tahoma we get rid of it
and this is 16 pixels normal so uh yeah
that's that see the difference one more
timee alright so now we kind of
understand a little bit M's are sort of
like a percent from 16 and then we also
have percent which obviously that's
pretty obvious one here's a little
conversion chart I found online
somewhere I don't know pxt oh I am calm
Oh pics 2 p.m. all right that makes
sense sorry so 16 pixels
100% 12-point and you can kind of get
this conversion in your head so 16
pixels times 2 would be 32 so I'm
guessing 32 pixels would be 2 en
hopefully that makes sense
that's the idea between e/m pixels
percents and points and it kind of
depends if you want to do things in
percents it might be better for cell
phones and tablets and so forth for app
development although if you're
developing websites you might want to
use pixels or in it just depends I'm
going to be using pixels for the rest of
this series I doubt I'll be using
anything else I might use percents but
we'll just have to see so that's all I
really need to say about pixels EMS
percents at points and next video we
will be talking about something new
let's go font style and weight so I will
see you then thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
