series here and I'm going to review a
little bit about what we talked about in
the last video as well as similar as
well as learn some new things having to
do with word wrap and whitespace so we
have right here word wrap colon break -
word and this this is the property this
is the value we are assigning to it and
what this does is if we have a really
long word that goes longer than the box
that it's in allows it to go well then
it's going to break out in that box and
continue to go so if we don't have this
on watch what happens to this text oh
you see it's too long
so it continues to go on the webpage
that's not good here we don't want that
there may be a situation where you do
want that but we don't in this situation
so what I'm going to do is add that back
in just word-wrap:break-word and now it
stays within the page now the reason why
this one down here goes out of the page
that's because we are assigning this to
the paragraph and this is not a
paragraph this is a div div so that's
where that text went all right so
there's another thing we can learn about
that is what's it called what's call
it's called it's called well we have we
have whitespace and we also have text in
it so let's go over whitespace
whitespace there's a few options we can
give it obviously we have normal almost
anything has a normal property value
which just brings back to normal so it's
pretty much pointless unless you're
getting rid of a value that's been given
to it already
so whitespace we can have no wrap and
what this does is it's not going
Rapp any words it's just going to keep
on running so if you look at the
paragraph here ignore this this is a div
it goes on and goes on even with spaces
except spaces but spaces don't bring it
down to a new line as you can see here
so that's no wrap we also have pre which
I think stands for preserve and that's
going to preserve our spaces between it
looks normal for us but if we go to the
HTML and I say today I am going to go
through the store and buy a llama for it
cases jelly bean and shoe as well as a
40 pack of CDs so now as you can see it
reserves this these spaces normally you
would have to put a break tag like this
so you can see it allows breaks and
allows normal spaces that's because we
have to preserve it preserves any white
space we give it so if we turn if we
turn this back off and say it refresh it
oh you can see it doesn't work anymore
just as long a for cases at jelly beans
shoe for tea packs at CD for ya so that
is what pre does there's a few more
other settings including pre line pre
wrap which you can look those up I'm not
going to go into those but I do want to
go over a new thing text indent this we
can give it a pixel amount on how much
to indent words so like 30 pixels for
say so that will indent the first line
of every paragraph because if you if you
know much about paragraphs oftentimes we
will want to invent the very first line
so that is the text indent property we
can just give this a value let's say
200 refreshing now oh you see it messes
with things so yeah that's what the text
indent does so that's all I really have
to say in this oh no it's not a limp
Santi over something else I bring this
back down to 40 that looks pretty good
we have text aligned so it looks like
this text align and there's three values
we can give this Center left and right
so let's get Tommy yeah I am just so
popular oh I got a text saying on the
loser like I'm not even kidding
it just says loser Bob which I don't I
don't know why Bob's there but for some
reason people put Bob at the end of my
name oh well all right so left oh well
you see nothing happens that's because
it's already aligned to the left center
on the other hand we'll put all the text
in the center
the reason it's lined to the left you
can see every new line these line up
with the side of the comment if you look
here they're all lined up but on the
other side you can see there's space
between these words that's because as
left aligned not right aligned so let's
try Center so now all of our content is
centered in the center now this indent
is kind of throwing things off so you
may want to take the indent Lynn you're
using the center so this is what the
center looks like it balances the space
between the left side and the right side
we can also put text-align:right which
that's what that does and if you want to
see what happens when you add a text
indent 40 pixels that's what happened
and then sit even farther why don't you
put a negative yes you can so yeah you
can put a negative which you can mess
with your view here so negative 10
so yes that is all I have to say in this
video so be sure to check out the next
one sure to subscribe and check out my
other content thank you and I shall see
you around god bless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
