but I completely failed so I decided to
restart from the beginning alright so
basically I'm going to arrange the modes
in a way that fits the circle of fifths
and more specifically the flat side of
the circle of fifths the only sharp one
we're going to have is G so let me
recreate the circle of fifths we got C G
don't worry about any other of the
sharps F natural B flat E flat a flat D
flat G flat and then C thought the way
you can remember this is just bead
that's high remember just the word bead
there and then remember the FS first
though so yeah we're going to arrange
these to fit that and if you don't
understand just just wait a second so
basically we went from G to C to F to B
flat to E flat a flat to D flat and
that's pretty good for now so the first
thing we want to look at is the Lydian
mode the Lydian mode is to start on the
fourth scale degree if you remember if
you don't remember go back to my Lydian
video and we'll talk about it start
starting on the fourth scale degree so
we're going to follow the circle of
fifths so we're in the scale of g g a b
c d e f sharp g fourth scale degree c
convenient enough cuz that one's easy so
we just follow this pattern where you're
going to have the C major scale with a
sharp seven C D F sharp G a C so all I
really have here
is a sharp force or a raised force one
two three four F sharp so basically what
we're going to get is sharp fourth
because it works for any scale and
rather than just saying see the fourth
rather than saying F sharp we can say
the fourth is sharp so now we're going
to write that down we have a sharped
fourth alright now let's go to the next
one in this list I have Ionian yeah I'll
use black I guess I own all right this
one's really easy because Ionian is just
a major scale and we're on the scale of
C because we just did G see there's no
accidentals we're starting on the root
so this has no sharps no flats this one
has a raised fourth this one has none
done with that one the next one in the
list mixolydian all right this one this
one is the same as starting on the fifth
I believe so if we have an F now that
we're in the f major scale we have F G a
B flat C now I want to show you we're
always starting on C here 1 2 3 4 5
we're always starting on C it's just the
accidentals we are changing C cool so
now if we recreate this scale we get c d
e f G a b-flat and C so now we have the
same thing with a lowered 7th so we get
a flatted 7th all right next one Dorian
this is the second scale degree oh wait
we just did F so the second scale degree
of B is C like I said we're always
starting on C
the accidentals within a b-flat scale
well we have B flat obviously and we
also have E flat so we can just recreate
the C major scale using that see the B
flat F G a B flat C so now we have a
lowered third one two three and a
lowered 7th so again fly to third and
there I descend right here a flatted
third and a flatted seventh so there's
like a pattern here this will this one
has a flatted 7th and five 1/3 so let's
see what happens I'm gonna go to the
next one
Yoli in this is starting on the sixth
scale degree and this is the same thing
as a natural minor scale whoopsies I
can't hold on to this marker ah so the
natural minor scale you may already know
it's the same thing as fighting the
third of a major scale the 6th and the
7th well would you look at that we
already have a flatted 3rd and a flatted
7th so I gotta do flatted 3rd fun at 6
and a flatted 7th all right let's go on
to the next one frigate okay so I've got
the b-flat
we're on to e-flat what's in the E flat
major scale well we have B flat E flat
and a flat so let's create the C major
scale with that C D E flat F G a flat
and b-flat and I see so here are
accidentals and basically this is a
honest and something we also have a
d-flat sorry D flat one the 2nd 3rd 6th
and 7th are all lower now we have a flat
at 2nd fly the 3rd flat at 6th and a
flatted 7th now let's go on to low I the
last one Phrygian I'm sorry I just did
that one more pre-ind ok and we are on -
I don't think we need D flat so we are
on to the a flat major scale which
should have B flat E flat a flat D flat
and G flat so let me write that out I'm
going right up here so I can see D flat
a flat B flat D flat and G flat
typically those are switched but so now
let's create the C major scale C D E
flat F sorry for e e flat F G flat a
flat B flat and C so we have a flat at
2nd flatted 3rd flatted 5th flat 6 flat
7th flat its 2nd flatted 3rd flatted 5th
flat at 6th and a flatted 7th so that is
all of the modes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
we just arrange them in a way that will
alter according to the circle of fifths
if you look at these these 3 are the
major
these three are the miner and this one
was the diminished this is the same
thing as scharping the third flatting
the seventh now for the minor scale this
is the same thing as raising the sixth
why because typically the minor c has a
flaw has a this one but if we raise it
it goes away because it's not flat it
any longer
so typically actually we're raising it
which makes it raised a half step so the
Olien natural minor this is what a
normal minor scale looks like then
Phrygian we are flatting the second
that's a three by the way now long
Korean is diminished because we are also
flatting the fifth typically you won't
see this one much but maybe so those are
all of the modes and that is everything
I have to say about modes threw it out
there I don't know if this actually is
going to help you with anything but this
is another way to view them because this
one's a sharping fourth finding the
seventh defines a flat seventh same way
if you didn't understand the circle fits
maybe this will help clear things up and
this goes well with the modes so do some
more research on that if you want that's
all I had to say and I'll see you in the
next video
