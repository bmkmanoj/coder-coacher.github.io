talk about multi-dimensional arrays I
know it sounds fancy
it's cuz it is but it's not too
difficult so when we first started
talking we talked about arrays an array
is just a group of values such as
strings and numbers or the mix of the
both now a multi-dimensional array I'll
spell that out I probably did not help
at all cuz you probably can't even read
that well a multi-dimensional array is
an array of arrays so first let's look
at a normal array let's say we have one
foo pretty simple you sign it and then
we say array and we open a function and
then anything within these parentheses
gets added to our array let's make that
a little bigger so we could say we want
sandwich comma and we also want cereal
so here's our array it's really simple
it's an array named food which points to
two values
sandwich and cereal all right well now
what if we turn this into a
multi-dimensional array let's say we
want a sandwich
oops sandwich consists of bread meat and
a tomato well we can also put this array
right here within this and that would
make it multi-dimensional and for cereal
we want it to be as high as possible
cereal contains cereal milk and banana
forgot what the name of that fruit was
for a minute huh all right so now let's
draw a little concept map of this just
to make things pretty darn clear all
right so we have food all right
food is broken up into two separate
values we had sandwich and we had cereal
so right now
food is an array consisting of two key
values so this would be 0 this will be 1
but that doesn't matter we're not even
talking about keys right now so this
array contains two values what if we
make these values arrays themselves well
sandwich has I forget what sandwich was
made out of bread
meat and a tomato
now cereal contains cereal milk and a
banana so here is our little concept map
this is an array in fact now it's a
multi-dimensional array and then we have
an array here and an array here so it's
a multi-dimensional array because it's
consists of not only strings of numbers
but of a race now I'm going to be
showing you how to properly code this
cover my chalk I'm gonna bring this
parenthesis all the way down here just
to give us some more room now to do this
we're going to have an associative array
so the the string sandwich is going to
be used as the key for our new array and
we draw an equal sign and in a greater
than sign to make an arrow and then we
say array so we're making an array
within an array and within this array we
have three values Fred comma V comma and
tomato tomato all right so each of these
values has quotes and they're separated
by commas and then we can do it again
with cereal
arrey and then within these parentheses
we have cereal milk and banana okay so
now you can see we have an array which
encloses to erase all right so what are
the keys for this well the first key of
the multiple dimensional read is
sandwich it's it's an associative array
so it's not 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 it's
actually a string because we're
associating a string with a value this
is the second string or the second key
serial now for this array this one right
here
well this these specific values are not
associative because if we were to make
them associative within this array we
would have to go array and then we'd
have to give it a string such as first
ingredient and then an arrow which we
didn't so that means within this array
red is 0 meat is 1 and tomato is 2 same
for this one cereal is 0
milk is 1 tomato is 2 now as for
accessing these values we can do it like
this we would have a label is called
remember and then within these square
brackets this is where we would put our
string so we would write cereal this is
the key value which points to something
it points to an array and we can't
really just print out full arrays so we
actually have to have
another square brackets and now we're
going to put which key within this array
we want to use so we could have one for
example which I believe was cereal milk
so if we were to echo this it would
prove it would come out pass milk pretty
simple but also complex I know that made
no sense at all because this are
completely contradictory but basically
it's an advanced concept but if you
follow the steps it makes sense and just
try not to get confused and as we get
farther into the series we will be
learning how to echo out in the entire
array and so forth but not right now
because it's complex and I don't want to
confuse you guys so first key cereal we
only had two options cereal or sandwich
and then within that array we use the
index values for the keys sorry we use
the indexed keys zero one or two so
that's all I have to say in this video
hopefully it was helpful and I will see
