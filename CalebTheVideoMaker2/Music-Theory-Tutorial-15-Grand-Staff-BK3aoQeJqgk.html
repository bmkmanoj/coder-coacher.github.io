video maker in case you didn't know or
Caleb curry and in the last video I
talked about the bass clef and a little
bit of the treble clef and well when
you're writing music for stuff that can
reach both ranges because if you
remember bass clef is in the lower range
treble clef was in the higher range
sometimes you'll put them together so
you'll get five lines up here three four
five and then you get the treble clef
and then you'll get like this little bar
thing then we'll get the little bass
clef down here with the five lines here
and then every single line of music will
have both of this the reason for this is
so you can get the complete range so
when we have the bass clef middle C is
represented by one ledger line above the
tapas highest line so this is middle C
on the bass clef conveniently the C for
treble clef is one alleged line below
little C so this is where they
interconnect if we go these are the same
notes here because this is middle C the
only thing different is the way we
represent represent it if we want the
notes middle C and up we can use a
treble clef Philip notes middle C and
down and use a bass clef so if we were
to write the notes on here it would look
like oops
it'd be like and then this is where it
would connect to here and then we go up
on this scale so this is where this one
would typically stop this hold where
that's where this one typically begins
or we can put this middle C up here it
doesn't matter but the what I'm trying
to say here is rather than having five
lines here and then four ledger lines to
represent this note what we could do is
just use the treble clef because it this
this is where they overlap let me show
you a good picture
this I found this on Google Images here
we have the treble clef here we have the
bass clef now if we're going to write
notes here are the notes they line up
with on the keyboard or piano or
basically any instrument these just
represent pitches it doesn't have to be
a piano because every single instrument
has specific pitches that we are talking
about in new ways
so now we go up and this is where they
overlap right here on middle C these are
both the same notes and then it goes up
so rather than having ledger lines and
then notes like right here we can just
use a treble clef that's why there's two
clefts rather than having 400 ledger
lines above the staff we can just use a
different clef once again this is what a
grand staff will look like it will have
the treble clef a little bar thing I'm
not sure where it's called and a bass
clef and we will just write on both
staffs and they'll both be played at the
same time this with the left hand on a
piano
oops what you just want to do and this
one with the right hand typically so
that's that's everything you need to
know about a grand staff for now and the
next video we'll be talking about
something even awesomer okay this dude's
awesome or an awesome awesome ER more
awesome so yeah subscribe and click like
follow me on Twitter subscribe and I
think that's it thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
