Ha Ha 
I always mess that up.. but anyways I am going to be teaching
  you how to fix a problem in Camtasia Studio. It's a pretty simple
Problem and the fix is pretty easy. If you guys already know this then
You don't need to worry about it. But if you're getting a problem where it either says that
&quot;You need an updated version of Quicktime&quot; or if you're trying
to import a .MOV file and it's saying that you're codec
is not supported or something like that. Well then what you need to do is follow 
this tutorial. So I'm just going to give you an example. 
I take this .MOV file and drag it in here and you can
see it causes an error. It says you need Quicktime version 7.2 or later.
Well to do that we need to go to the website and download it.
So to do that you go to your web browser and you go to Quicktime.
 
and if you want a little shortcut you can go to this link right here.
 
Alright and then you just gotta put in you're e-mail address. You don't have to check this if you don't want.
and then you just download it. It's pretty easy. Once you download
it you just open the file and install it which I'm
pretty sure you guys can figure that out too. So yeah you can just read through this.
It's a really good read. Yes. You can go whichever way you want. 
I'm just going to go with typical cause it's easier. You know whatever. Install.
And then user account control, click yes.
 
Oo Ooo, it's almost done..
I'm just kidding it's back to the beginning.
Alright if you've been waiting a while and nothing is happening. Just make sure at the start menu
there is no little shield asking for your permission
Cause I totally did not wait forever and then realize there was a shield asking for my permission.
and we're done. If you drag in a file
and look you can see it works. Alright so
now you can go watch you're legit dance party right
Pretty.. pretty intense!  ~Music in Background~
Alright that's enough of that. One other thing if the problem still persists.
I recommend you install the latest version of Quicktime and then
restart you're computer then try it
If it's still not working leave me a comment and I can try to help you out
Or the other people here who have found solutions please leave a comment below.
and we'll try to figure out the problem. Thanks Guys!
and I'll see you in the next video. Peace!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
