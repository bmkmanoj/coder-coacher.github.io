are going to be discussing how signal r
is implemented we're just gonna be
scratching the surface here to actually
talk about what we need to do as
programmers to make signal r do its
thing like what do we type the first
thing we need to do is create a c-sharp
class so for those of you who don't know
a class is basically a blueprint of data
we want to create and we'll discuss that
a little bit more but within this class
we are going to create methods a method
is basically a section of code that we
can call or invoke that is the term that
I'm going to try to use in this series
no methods you can also call them
functions but the difference is that a
method is basically a function in a
class or an object which minor detail
but basically methods functions same
thing what is a class again well it's a
blueprint that we basically structure
what are we want our data to look like
and then what we do is we instantiate
that class into what's known as an
object so you could say an object is an
instance of a class so I'll just go
through a classic example of a person
class so we have a person class and we
put methods in there such as anything we
want the person to do such as walk talk
complain whine you know what most people
do eat and then we can instantiate that
class into an object which would be a
specific person such as Caleb then Caleb
could do those methods such as walk talk
eat or whatever so this is like the
basics of object-oriented programming
and the series really isn't about
object-oriented programming but I'm just
trying to give you the basics in case
you don't know much about it but in
general it's pretty easy so you don't
got worry about it because I'll be
explaining it as we type out code but
this will give you the fundamentals of
what we need to know a class is
instantiated into an object and then you
can invoke the methods in that object so
if we created a class called person we
could make an object called Caleb and
then we could say something like this
would be invoking the talk
that on the Caleb object which is an
instance of the person class well how
does this apply to signal are because
we're not going to be making person
classes we're going to be making a class
called a hub and how is signal are going
to know that this class is a hub well
it's going to inherit from a class
that's already made in signal R which is
conveniently named the hub class the way
we show that in c-sharp is we put a
colon after our after a class name so if
we made a class we could say it it's
called a Mike my hub all right we need
to tell c-sharp but this is a hub so I
put a colon and then just put hub now
this is a hub class we are going to
instantiate this when somebody goes to
our website we create a my hub instance
so within this my hub class which by the
way you can name it whatever you want
you're going to put methods of things
that you want the client to be able to
tell the server to do so this is going
to define what the client can command
the server do and then we're also going
to make it so the server can tell the
client what to do on the server side of
things we have C sharp and within this
class we have methods well on the client
side in this example we're using
JavaScript so on the client my chalk on
the client side we're going to have
JavaScript functions so with the magic
miss of signal are the server side can
call the functions or invoke the
functions and the client can invoke the
server side methods this is something
that's very similar to what's known as
our PC now our PC stands for a remote
procedure call so what that means is
that the server and the client are
separated and we're doing a procedural
call on the other one so a procedure is
basically the same as a function or
method so the server can call a
seizure on the client side and the
client can call a procedure on the
server side by the way the word call
this is basically the equivalent of
invoke I'll use both of these
interchangeably so same thing now with
the hub you have to inherit from the hub
class there's another kind of class we
can use known as a persistent connection
so for that one you're going to have to
inherit from the persistent connection
class now what's the difference between
these well they're slightly different so
they're basically two different ways you
can work with signal are in the next
video I'm going to be talking about the
difference between hubs and persistent
connections thanks guys and I will see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
