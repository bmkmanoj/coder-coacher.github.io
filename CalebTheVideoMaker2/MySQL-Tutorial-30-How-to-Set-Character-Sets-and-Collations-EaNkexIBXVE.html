talking about character sets and
collisions a bit more so as soon as you
open PHP my admin you can see the
general settings right here displays
your MySQL connection collation so this
right here is the character set and
everything below it is the collation and
there you can see that there's bunch
collisions a bunch of character sets but
you don't need to worry about that I
mean don't don't get overwhelmed you can
see is also displayed over here to the
right so the first thing I want to show
you is if you click SQL you can say show
collations and this will also just split
oh god this will display make sure
there's show collation no s this will
display all the collisions and which
character set they belong to so a
collation can only belong to one
character set and if you remember the
collation is how things are compared and
the character set is all the available
characters that you can use for your
database your table or whatever so here
is a bunch of stuff it's kind of
overwhelming to ask me so don't get
overwhelmed then you can also say show a
car set which just stands there
character set or chairs so however you
want to promise it I don't know
and then this will display all the
character sets and also the description
and the default collation for that
character set so utf-8 the default is
general case-insensitive and so on
latin-1 is the default is Swedish
case-insensitive
so that's pretty cool and then you can
also go to the home page and on the
right side there's button assist car
sets on the other panel set and this
will also display all of them for you
see so that is how you view all the
character sets
now character sets can be a set on like
the database will the connection the
database the table and each individual
query so basically what this means
is if you want one table to be a certain
character set let's say this one and
then you want another to be this one you
can do that and let's say you're wanting
to like retrieve results and you want to
change how characters are compared you
can actually change the character the
collation to allow that to happen in a
single query without altering any
settings just for the query so that's
pretty cool now to do an SQL query to
find this is a little more advanced you
can I don't really explain this what you
can do this show collation and then say
like and I'll explain this some time and
up coming up videos and then in single
quotes you can say like Latin yeah
Latin one and then put a percentage sign
and click go so I'm going to explain
this of it basically this says show care
of collisions like Latin 1 % the % says
any amount of characters after Latin 1
so basically this and I'll explain that
again upcoming video so you know so here
are all the collisions for a specific
character set alright to set the
character set when creating a database
if you remember to create a database by
saying create database now what you
simply do is say the database name so
let's do some elemental messaging here
subscribe sweet so that's my database
name then when you say is character set
and then you say what character set so
utf-8 and then you say what is the
collation or collate and then you say
the collation so we want utf-8
underscore Unicode case-insensitive so
let me go over this a bit we're creating
a database called subscribe so that's
the database name the character set is
utf-8 so if you remember a character set
is just all the available characters the
collation which you say by saying
collate
after that is the coalition so make this
easier to read we could go here there we
go so the create database subscribe
character set UTF then collation is
utf-8 unicode case-insensitive which
just how characters are compared so i
click go
we see we have a database down here and
order to go it doesn't look any
different it looks just like everything
else well basically we set the character
set for future use
all right here is the query you would
run to create a table so we're creating
a table friends that's going to store my
friends their ID and their name so their
ID and their name this will be the
primary key friend ID well if you want
to set a character set for a specific
specific table you simply say after the
colon you say character set
thanks oldest right and that's two words
and say the character set name so latin
one and then a comma collate let's make
it
Latin wand VI in for binary and then
click go and you can see created a table
so the default character set for this
table even though it looks exactly the
same you can see the collation is now
Latin binary alright because the last
thing I'm going to be showing you is how
to alter your collation within a table
because let's say you set it as Latin
binary and you don't want that anymore
so in SQL box you can just say alter
because it's an ultra command alter what
are we altering we're altering a table
so we're altering the table friends and
then what we're going to do is convert
to character set and let's make this
utf-8 collate UTF
so let me just read this off now that I
type it all out we're altering the table
friends and we're converting it to the
character set utf-8
a character set is just a group of
characters that you can use and collate
is the collation which is how things are
compared and we're setting it to utf-8
general case-insensitive so if we click
go you can see some popped up then if we
go to the friends table we can see now
the collation is UTF general
case-insensitive which is what we want
so that's good and that's all for this
video and if you have any questions or
some successes also some suggestions so
then just leave me a comment and I'll
read them so thanks see you later and
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
