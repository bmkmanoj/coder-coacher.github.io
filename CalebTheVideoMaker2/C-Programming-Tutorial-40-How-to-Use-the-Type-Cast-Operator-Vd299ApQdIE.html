get started
we're going to be talking about
typecasting now I started talking about
this in the previous video
so make sure you watch that video but
we're going to be covering some more
stuff and go over some examples in this
video so let's create a file now you
know I love my pizza so let's make a
variable we'll just call it in slices
equals 17 so that's the number of slices
of pizza of course now unfortunately you
have to split this pizza with a friend
so let's create a new variable and we're
going to call it a double and this is
going to be set to slices divided by 2
in this situation we are splitting the
pieces of pizza with our friend and
we're trying to figure out how many
pieces each person is going to get now I
know this issue came up in a previous
video but we are going to do a quick
review you see in this situation slices
is an integer from right here and 2 is
an integer
that means the result is going to be an
integer there are two ways to fix this
the first way is to add point 0 to a
constant this will work if we just put
point 0 right there but the problem is
this is not always going to work for
example let's say the value 2 comes from
a variable so let's go up here and
create a new variable and we'll call it
people and then in our calculation we
have divided by people exactly the same
thing but now in this situation we can't
just put 0 it doesn't make sense just to
show that I'll prove it to you let's
save it and you could see when I compile
there is an issue right here so
basically the compiler looks at that and
it's like what is this garbage this is
not code so we need to figure out a
different way to do this so the second
way to do this the one that's a little
bit more useful is explicit typecasting
so to do that all we have to do is put a
cast before one of the variables just
like that and now when we compile you
can see there
compiling errors now the important thing
to know is that typecasting does not
affect the original variable people is
still equal to the casting here is
actually just another type of operator
you can think of double as a unary
operator that does not change the value
of the variable essentially what I'm
trying to say is once you define a
variable as a certain type for example
in this situation it's an integer you're
stuck with that datatype another thing
with the fact that this is a unary
operator is that it only works on one
operand so what operand does it work on
for example let's look at a code here
and let's change a little bit I want to
put this at the beginning so we're going
to put it over here this operator has a
precedence just like every other
operator so you need to ask yourself is
this double going to work on this or is
it going to work on just this and it
ultimately comes down to does the
division have higher precedence or does
the typecasting have higher precedence
if the Division has higher precedence
we're going to have 17 divided by 2
which is going to be an integer because
they're both integers and then we're
going to cast it to a double if that was
the case essentially it would look like
this if we had to make it very clear but
that is actually not the way it works
the way it works is it actually has
higher precedence than the division
operator what that means is that the
double typecasting works on the operand
immediately to the right if you wanted
to force it to be the other way yeah go
ahead and put those parentheses back in
but this is not going to give you the
result of 17 divided by 2 as what it
should be which would be 8 and 1/2 it
would actually be 8.0
that's because we get 17 divided by 2
which will be evaluated as 8 and then
we're typing 8 to a double so if you
want to visually see the correct way of
how this works it would be like this
boom double is affecting just the
operand to the
so just to show the difference let's
output some data or data if you're fancy
so we are going to print half the pizza
now as always we need to put this inside
of a format string so we'll throw that
in right here and this will be printed
as a double and then the newline save
and we'll compile this and output it and
you can see that the result is eight
point five if we do it the other way
where we take this parentheses here and
move it to the end now we save it and
run it look what happens the result is
eight point zero all right this video is
not over I still have some more
information for you guys specifically I
want to have some trivia so let's make
some more code cc equals 25 divided by
two times two and now we're going to say
double D equals 25 divided by two times
two 2.0 and I want you to guess what
this is going to output all right so
here is our code what do you think this
is going to output great yes you're
right I'm just playing let's see all
right let's compile and run okay so the
first number was from the previous chunk
we're working with and then we have
twenty-four point zero and twenty four
point zero let's figure out why go back
in our code essentially what I'm trying
to show here is that just because one of
the values has a point zero essentially
it's a double doesn't necessarily mean
all of the arithmetic is done with
double arithmetic it's step by step so
in the first example we take 25 divided
by two as integers so the result is 14
then we multiply it by 2 which is 24 and
then we take 24 and store it in a double
which is 24 point 0 now for the next one
we do the same exact thing 25 divided by
2
as an integer which is 14 times 2.0
which is 20 4.0
has the extra zero on there because it's
a double but we store it as a double so
it doesn't really matter so essentially
the result is exactly the same so just
because one of the operands and your
entire arithmetic expression is a double
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
get the results you're expecting make
sure you watch every single step another
thing that you need to remember is that
the decimal is always truncated when you
do introvert another integer division so
if you got something like let's just say
you have some crazy math and you end up
with 0.9999 and then you convert this to
an integer the result is going to be
zero additionally if you had something
like 23 point nine eight nine nine and
whatever that is going to be truncated
to 23 so hopefully all the information
was helpful and if you knew all of it
already
then hopefully it was a great reminder
thanks guys and I'll see you in the next
video if you've enjoyed this please be
