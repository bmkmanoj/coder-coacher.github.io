40th something MySQL video I didn't even
know but I think I said the wrong number
in the last one but I don't care so
let's go first we're gonna go over
numeric functions is bugging me umm
numeric functions basically take a
number and do something really cool with
it that you don't have to do yourself
the first one I'm gonna go over is POW
powerful function you also use power
same things and within here you give it
two numbers so let's say these are the
parentheses right here I can say 2 comma
3 what will do it'll it'll raise this
number to the third power so it'll look
like basically it'll be like this if
he's ever seen this in math class
probably never pay attention to math
class did you I have to watch these
videos to catch up or get ahead so what
this will do is it'll take two and it'll
times it by itself so it'll be 2 so
it'll multiply this many times 3 by
itself so 2 times 2 times 2 which is 2
times 2 is 4 which times 2 is 8 so the
result of this would be 8 if we replace
this 3 with a 4 it would be 16 because
we're taking that 2 and once playing it
by 2 one more time so 8 times 2 is 16
all right here's a useful function maybe
so this will give you a random number
between 0 and 1 with like a billion
decimals for example you all you have to
do is say select Rand or whatever Rand
in parenthesis don't put anything in the
parenthesis just leave a blank and then
the return result will be like point 6 3
1 4 7 8 this can be used for like
randomizing things for like encryption
or for passwords it can be used for a
lot of stuff actually so you just
remember a random Rand
so if you remember the math operators
from the last video we had one that was
mod or a % there's actually a function
for that so you can say mod I think
you've it two numbers say 15 and a four
four eight twelve sixteen so it goes in
there three times for a 12 13 14 15 with
three left over so the returned result
is actually three see that's what the
mod function does there's two ones that
are very similar see you'll know not
like up like a SCAL see oh this is the
sei of seel seel
and worried you ceiling and then there's
floor now the way these are used is
within parenthesis you give it a number
say 8.3 and it is going to raise it or
lower it to the next possible integer if
you don't remember an integer is a
number without decimals so eight is an
integer 8.3 is not an integer if we put
eight within ceiling or see you doesn't
matter which the return result is
actually going to be eight it raises it
to an integer what it is already is an
integer so it doesn't have to raise it
any it's not going to give you nine
because it is already the integer so it
doesn't have to do anything but if we
give it eight point zero four it's
actually going to raise it to nine
that's why it says seal for ceiling so
if we gave it eight the returns will be
eight point eight forget 8.04 the return
your selfie nine now for four if we gave
it eight right here the return result
would be 8 because it's lowering it to
itself because it's already an integer
but if we get 8.04 it would give us
eight this is different than rounding
which I'll be going over next now for
this one I'm going to have to teach you
some basic rounding skills the function
is round is what it's called
round and in parentheses now rounding if
a number is 5 or greater it's considered
rounding it goes up if it's 4.9 or lower
it goes down 6.4 if we round this number
to an integer it is going to be 6
because it has to be 5 or up to go up so
if this was 6.5 it's going to be 7 you
see so the numbers work up 1 you see you
see you see you see so if we had six
point four nine nine nine nine the
result is still going to be six because
it rounds it down not up so the number
before it decides we have six point one
two nine right and we want to round this
to two decimal places the numbers after
the little dot in the decimal one two so
we want a number in the form of this
let's look at this nine rounds this up
to a three to a three and then this is
two three this is still a one and that's
a six so that's how that works if we
were rounding this number to two decimal
places the result would be six point one
five if we were rounding it to one
decimal place the result would be six
point one because this is not 5 - round
it up if this was a 5 oops this is a 5
then this would be a 2 so that's what
the round knows we give it a number
let's say three point eight four seven
and we want to round this to two decimal
places we would comma two like that and
this will count two decimal places one
one two so they're outs results going to
be like this seven is going to round
this up so the result is going to be
three point eight five you see cool
