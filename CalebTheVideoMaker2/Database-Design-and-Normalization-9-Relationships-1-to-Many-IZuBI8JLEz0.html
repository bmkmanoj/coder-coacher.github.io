tables here we have classes over here we
have teachers over here there's two
classes math and English there's one
teacher Joe now one class is only
allowed to have one teacher for this
case I know there's some classes with
multiple teachers but for this example
each class only has one teacher so Joe
is a math teacher but guess what Joe is
also an English teacher you see that now
let's say we have Jim Jim is a math
teacher uh-oh look math has two teachers
that's not allowed that's because it's a
one-to-many one teacher can have many
classes but many classes but one class
can only have one teacher that's because
it's one to many so may repeat that a
teacher can have multiple classes but a
class can only have one teacher it's a
one to many relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
