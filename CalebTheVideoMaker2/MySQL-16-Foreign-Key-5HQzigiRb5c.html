Kayla the video maker to this video we
are going to be discussing ah some
reason I friggin borin Keith just like
in the primary keys video I said we kind
of sprinkled this information throughout
the series but this one's kind of going
to put it all together but mostly we are
going to be discussing column attributes
related to foreign keys so foreign keys
reference primary keys when you make a
call on a foreign key you are saying
every single value in this column has to
be a value that exists and whatever
column or referencing that's essentially
what a foreign key is now a foreign key
has to reference a column that is unique
kind of goes back to that example I gave
you if some guy coming up to you on the
street and asking you for some
information if you don't have a specific
way on how to identify a row it's hard
to reference that data same thing
applies for foreign keys the foreign key
needs something it can reference that is
unique so that way it knows exactly what
row you were talking about this would
also include primary keys because
primary keys themselves are unique now
when you create a primary key on with
that over here it is automatically
unique and not all what about foreign
keys
well foreign keys are not these by
default this is something you have to
choose do you want the foreign key
column to be unique do you want the
foreign key column to be not in all and
that requires some thinking on how we
want these databases to be designed so
the easiest way to think about this is
rather than having tables reference this
way it's to rotate the whole thing and
create parents and children so the
foreign key down here is the child pk up
here is a primary key is the parent this
allows us to kind of think about things
a little bit differently put this into
like a family tree kind of thing so when
we do this rather than thinking of a
column referencing another column think
of an individual row referencing an
individual row because when we make a
foreign key column that's essentially
where we're saying we're saying a row
for this column has to reference another
row
so to make that a little bit more
concrete let's use some actual data here
we have a row and it has a column with
the value of seven and here we have a
child row that has a value of seven
pointing back to that seven so this here
would be inside of a foreign key column
so if you wanted to draw that out we'd
have a table probably an IDE for this
table and then an ID for the other table
and this would be a foreign key so kind
of like two seven for example we could
have three seven could have four eight
this individual row references this
parent so does this row so we actually
have two rows I reference this parent so
that's kind of the way this design works
this is how foreign keys work so we're
just going to write parent and then two
children now we need to ask ourselves
what is the unique and not in all
constraints going to do to these rows so
first let's draw these out the first one
unique that means if we have a child
with like the ID of seven referencing
the parent we cannot have another child
referencing the same parents that would
not work this is basically the way you
design a one-to-one relationship
plumber' two tables that means this
child is going to have to reference a
different parent here the child
reference is the parent and here the
child references the parent but we can't
have two children referencing one parent
that's what the unique and strength will
do and I call these attributes that's
another name but there's a slight
difference and we'll discuss that in a
future video but essentially an
attribute can be a constraint these are
both examples of constraints but not all
attributes are constraints sorry
kind of off topic so don't worry about
that but that's what the unique
constraint is going to do so if we have
two tables and we'll draw each row as a
line it's for simplicity and let's say
this is the primary key and this is the
foreign key one row can reference one
parent but that parent cannot be
referenced by another call that's not
allowed
that means there's exclusivity between
this child
and this parent that's the only
Association we can't have it like this
or anything like that now what about the
not null constraint what that's going to
do is basically force every single child
to have a parent so if we have another
child over here we could theoretically
have a null for the value of what the
parent is and in that situation there
would be no parent but if we say not
null we're basically saying every single
child has to have a parent but if we're
using unique we couldn't do that we'd
have to plan it to a different parent so
whenever you have a foreign key ask
yourself the two questions
should it be unique and should it be not
novel would it make sense for the child
to exist with no parent just orphaned
all by himself
or does it make sense that it has to
have a parent it really just depends on
what you're working with more often than
not not in all is going to be applied
but not always so that's a rough
overview of unique and not null for
foreign keys
hopefully that was helpful I know we
didn't discuss everything in foreign
keys and because of that we're going to
talk about them a little bit more in the
next video so be sure to watch that
because we are going to be discussing
the on delete and on update clauses
these are two more things you need to
consider when you're creating foreign
keys so that's all for this video guys
thanks for watching please be sure to
subscribe and click like on this video
and I will see you in the next one yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
