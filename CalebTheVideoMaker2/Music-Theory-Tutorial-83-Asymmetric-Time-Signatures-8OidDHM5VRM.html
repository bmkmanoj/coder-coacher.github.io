know I hey guys welcome back to your
music theory complete series and I've
been right and on about time signatures
and how important they are very
important we've learned most of them we
learned about 44 comment I'm see and
then we learn about cut time and then we
learned about compound time so we have
common time cut time compound time now
um but common time is for for this
markers not even working let me know I'm
using it piece of crap Jesus stupid
orange one can't even see 44 then we
have cut time which is 2 over 2 and we
have compound time which puts it over it
in 8 such as 12-8 time which is what we
just reviewed in the last video now
we're going over something called
asymmetric time by the way those are
just some terms I give you so you know
asymmetric probably not spelling that
right basically what asymmetric time is
is it will put a non multiple of 3 over
8 so in the last video we learned that
compound time counts in threes 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so I'd be common when
we come in and be compound if it was 3 /
8 6 7 8 9 / 8 12 / 8 and so forth
typically either 12 / 8 or six or eight
so what if we put one of those that is
not a multiple of three such as seven
well now what because we know we count
on threes 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 yeah it's
basically what it is this is called a
symmetric as it just it's not I don't
know why it's called a symmetric but I'm
not gonna make something up look I
usually do some examples are seven eight
nine eight
mmm let's see we could have 11 828
anything that's not a multiple three
really now the way to count these there
is a trick we can count with threes or
with tubes so typically we Cal threes so
let's try counting seven eight time now
asymmetric time the best way to count it
is to accent not when you're playing by
the way exit means to make it louder
typically but not when you're playing
just where you're counting it certain
beats or accounts or yeah so um for
example we can count one two three and
accent1 and then we can count accent
before four five six seven now it's it's
not counted in threes but it still feels
on like it feels like a rhythm rather
than saying 1 2 3 4 5 6 11 to throw I
mean yeah 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
it's a little awkward but if we count it
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 it doesn't
it's not the same every single time
that's why it's asymmetric so that's one
way we could count it or we could count
it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 savvy one two three
four five six one three five six seven
so basically we're going to count
asymmetric time signatures with groups
of either three or two what that means
is if we're let's try an easier one
we're drunk we're going 58 time this
means we could have a group of three
fallen by 2 so 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 not
six don't take this I'm and say it's
actually pretty cool sounding rhythm
don't don't don't don't don't same for
78 we just add another to dub dub dub
dub dub feels 58 it be done
deduct adopted now 98 we could add
another two so duck to duck duck Duck
Duck the death of death deducted or what
we can do is we can alter the sum for
example let me just erase all this
sometimes we can count in three so that
would be six plus 26 plus two is seven
so that's why we count 786 die seriously
just say six plus two is seven huh I'm
need so we can count 3 + 3 + 23 + 3 + 3
+ 2 that would be 11-8 time because 9 10
11 so a way we can count 11 8 time would
be like this three plus three plus three
equal to 9 10 11 now to count it 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 12 12
now the reason I repeat 12 here instead
of 10 11 is it for 111 is a multiple
syllable number 11 so it's hard to count
it in one be for example 1 2 3 4 11 you
have to start it early 11 that's one
reason another isn't it's hard to count
that high so I think it's easy to repeat
1 and 2 1 2 3 1 for example sometimes I
count in this three one two three one
two three one two three one two one two
three one two three basically the lower
the number i think it's easier to count
for example it's easier to count three
groups of three rather than up to nine
that's that's one big reason so what I
do is this figure out a pattern that
adds up to this number that counts with
threes or tues now typically if you have
a song in an asymmetric time signature
that you're reading not writing reading
there will be a feel and this in this um
count of counting methods so for example
you make it
okay so we have 28 notes in a triplet oh
that's not a triplet it's not a triplet
because there's no three above it that's
basically just saying three eighth notes
and we have to do that because it's
asymmetric time we could all by the way
this is in 589 11-8 we could break it
off like this but there's no need to
when we can just connect it with a
little bar like that so as you can tell
how do you think we should count this we
can count it 3 2 3 + 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3
but it's better to count it in 2 + 3
because that's how it's written as you
can see here's to here's three now that
doesn't mean to accent don't make this
load note louder than the rest don't go
dot dot dot dot just count that way in
your head one two one two three you
don't have to accent the first letter or
number sorry one two one two three one
two one two three one two one two three
one two sweet so during 7 sep if you're
in 78 you may see straight eighth notes
sometimes or you can break them up into
some threes let's say we just have 78
notes one two three four five six seven
let's try to count one and two and three
and four and be like count if we counted
it normally be one and two and three and
four one and two and three and four one
and two and three and four one so that's
awkward so we count in twos and threes
we can say all right we're going to
count two followed by three followed by
two 1 and so one two one two three one
two don't play those notes louder though
so it's one two one two three one two
one two one two three
one two one two that allows us to sort
of make sense of it in our brain and
don't think that this is so weird never
gonna have to run into this because it's
actually quite common but it's not
common it's asymmetric get it cuz
Coleman is 44 ha ha ha ha ha ha sorry
cut me some slack ahh get it cuz we have
cut time oh man but anyways basically
we're just going to count on tues and
threes I've said that four hundred times
and you may often see cool patterns
built off of these rhythms and there's
actually some popular songs out there
with this type with these kind of time
signatures so familiarize yourself with
it and that's all I have to say for this
video tomorrow by tomorrow I mean in the
next video I don't know why I said
tomorrow you should be watching all
these in one single day by the way the
entire series no break no eating no
peeing and to the next video we will be
talking about some cool terms so see you
then bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
