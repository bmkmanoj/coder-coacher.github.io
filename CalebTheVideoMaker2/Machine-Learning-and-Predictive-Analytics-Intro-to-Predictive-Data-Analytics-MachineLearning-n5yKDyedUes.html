going to be about predictive data
analytics we talked about in the
previous video but now I'm going to go
into more depth of what that is and why
it is useful when it comes to machine
learning
like I said machine learning is teaching
computers to learn from data now
predictive data analytics is applying
that to data we already have in order to
predict in the future but why would we
want to predict the future don't just
think like oh and 2085 the world's gonna
end
not that kind of stuff we're talking
about if someone comes to your site what
kind of products are they going to be
interested in what kind of restaurants
are people interested in we can look at
historical data to make things more
relevant to our users of our
applications or to make our applications
work more effectively a lot of uses for
this are recommendation engines so you
think you go and shopping at a website
and then they have all these products
that you haven't even looked at but
somehow they're recommending them to you
and it's crazy because you know how did
how did they know that well they can
look at their trends in their data to
figure out oh people who've looked at
this product might be interested in this
product over here that is one good
practical use Onix I gave them a yoga
mat and he tore into a thousand pieces
that is one very good practical use of
data analytics and just so you know
analytics powers everything so this is
the foundation for all business
decisions so let's get started in
talking about data analytics and
predictive data analytics and defining
the difference so I said data analytics
now data analytics looks at data and I
drew this image in the previous video
which just kind of represents you know a
database or a data source of some sort
and just imagine having tons of data in
here this is known as our data set so
why it's called that is because I don't
know but it's just a set the data set
contains
a lot of historical data now that's kind
of a key here we need what's known as
historical data and what that means is
that what we are trying to predict is
already known for this data set so in
the recommendation engine that I was
talking about a couple minutes ago if we
have a bunch of historical data of
people interested in this particular
product but we don't know if they're
interested in another product that
doesn't really help us we need to know
that association between what they're
interested in and other products they've
bought so that means this data has to
come from the history we have to be able
to look at what people have already
bought once we have that historical data
set we can use that on modern or future
data so think now we have people on our
website and they are feeding us a bunch
of data they're looking at all these
products they're making purchases how do
we take this data set and kind of use it
on modern data to predict what kind of
products they are interested in that is
the field of data analytics and
specifically if we're talking predictive
analytics we're talking about predicting
what people are interested in but
there's one thing I wanted to mention
this predictive word in predictive data
analytics goes a little bit farther than
just predicting the future because you
can do data predictions with just
historical data you don't need to bring
machine learning into it necessarily for
example there's a lot of people who have
a lot of talent and skill and knowledge
in statistics they can look at
historical data and make predictions and
probability calculations on what's going
to happen in the future or currently so
what is this predictive part and why do
we care about machine learning the
reason we care about machine learning is
if you look at a data set such as this
one the reality is is that it doesn't
represent reality
in its entirety so it's hard to draw
reality I was trying to draw it over
here and then I was like I'll just try
to explain it
reality is what's actually existing and
what's going on right data just
represents reality so as people buy
things we can figure out what they're
interested in and that is a
representation of reality that makes any
sense and I'm not trying to get like
weird here anything I'm just saying data
represents reality but does it represent
reality entirely does it represent all
of reality does it capture the full
essence of reality no it does not it
might only represent a portion of
reality and if I'm starting to sound
crazy just hold up we might have a
thousand people interested in a
particular product in reality
historically though we have only logged
you know a couple hundred purchases from
these specific people or people similar
to these people so we don't know for
sure what the people of reality are
going to purchase and what they're going
to be interested in we may know what
most of the people are interested in but
I can guarantee you there's one person
out there who's completely unique and
there's not really anybody good to
compare them to so that's where the
predictive part comes in when we have a
data set and it does not represent
reality entirely let's just say this
represents reality like 95% and just oh
no it's weird quantifying how much
something represents reality but just
trust me here the reason it's like that
is because we don't have data for every
single possibility in the entire world
in this data set then we could represent
reality completely in our data set the
predictive part of data analytics is the
5% what is the 5% of non represented
reality going to do and this process is
something you can go through manually
but it's very tedious
and using a computer we can speed up the
process and figure out the best model of
reality and we'll get into more of the
fancy machine learning terms like model
pretty soon but this 5% is the part that
requires predicting that is where
machine learning comes in if you want to
make this more concrete imagine we have
a person and we don't have any data that
really represents this person and what
they might be interested in well in that
situation we don't know what this person
might do they might be interested in
buying a purse they might be interested
in buying a car or they might be
interested in buying some candy machine
learning essentially is going to go
through all of the options of what this
5% of unrepresented reality is going to
choose and it's going to pick the most
likely we as humans might look at our
historical data and not be able to see
trends in our data but a machine
learning algorithm has like 4,000 eyes
to look at the same data and can see
trends that we normally would not be
able to see so it can pick what's most
likely to happen in this situation even
though we don't have this specific
person or someone similar to this person
it can go up a step and look at an
overarching number of people and see
what the majority of people that are
sort of close to this person are likely
to choose and say oh well this person's
likely to buy a purse it seems kind of
crazy right now and it's like wow that's
kind of magical and essentially that's
what you know most people think of
machine learning is it's just you know
this magical computer science thing you
throw at software and makes it work
cooler but this is really how it works
and once we start talking about decision
trees for example you will see how this
works in action and it's going to be a
lot of fun so thank you guys for
watching and hopefully you guys can see
the magic and the usefulness of machine
learning please be sure to subscribe
as that really helps out my channel I'm
almost a 50,000 I'm at like 49,000
something so please help me out here
guys and appreciate it thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
