video I'm going to be talking about
something else rather than chord
progression oh thanks for now anyways so
in this video I'm going to be talking
about what's called a leading tone
reading I said that kind of weird
leading tone now a leading tone is
defined as something a well a tone a
pitch that either pushes you forward to
a higher pitch or pushes you forward to
a lower pitch so what does this mean
well it'll Claire message Jane it hasn't
been like nothing but like two hours
since she texted me I started texted her
back in like four months so whatever
anyways what was that saying frost
brutally interrupted I'm thirsty so
leading tone makes you your ears want to
move forward into something it leads
your ears so for example when you have a
C major scale the seventh of the scale
is a B misgives c d e f g a b the
seventh this wants to pull you back to G
C that's because it's a leading tone now
we have two types of leading tones upper
leading tones and lower leading tones
the difference between these is a lower
leading tone is below the note it leads
to so this is an example of a lower
leading tone this one right here the B
the B is below the C so they call it a
lower leading tone an upper leading tone
would bring you forward to a lower
pitched sound this is what makes music
forward and doesn't make you feel like
you're sitting stagnant it's a ride and
keeps going and it pushes forward now
let's go into an example of an upper
leading tongue I'm actually going to be
explaining why G 1 on G dominant 7th
chords are effective so what is the
dominant 7th that's a little bit of
review but if you haven't seen my other
videos I'm going to go over that really
quick it is a major scale taking the 1st
3rd 5th and the 7th notes and then
lowering the 7th a half-step so for
example and the scale of G we would have
G skip a go to B skip C go to D and then
skip E and go to f-sharp
but then we lower this a half-step and
we get this G B D and F so on music
staff it would look like this G B D and
F and if we're in the key of G we would
have an f-sharp here so this would have
to be a have a natural note before it to
allow people to understand that they're
not supposed to play a sharp so if we're
in the key of G this is what it would be
like but if we're not in the key of G
this won't be here and you can just
leave this like this unless stated
otherwise by key signature so I'm
getting way off topic let's go back we
have a 7th note right here this is an
upper leading tone up early why is that
well this will actually resolve to this
specific court would resolve to AC major
chord and a C major chord has C E and G
well take a look at this F resolves to
an e within the C major chord because
it's one half step above the E
you
so when we're in music we have something
called a cadence which pulls us back to
the way where the tonic the resolve
point we will often have C to a g7 back
to AC or anything in between here but
the g7 almost go back to the almost
always go back to see here's a C major
chord here's a g7
that's within a G dominant seventh
doesn't sound quite right but it doesn't
sound bad it just adds a little bit of
tension and it's resolved when we go
back to the C major chord so that's all
I have to say about leading tones and in
the next video I'll be talking about
something awesome so yeah see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
