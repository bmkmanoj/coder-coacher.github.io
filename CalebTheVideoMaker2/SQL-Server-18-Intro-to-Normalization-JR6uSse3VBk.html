Caleb the video maker do and welcome
back to your sequel server tutorial
series this video we are going to
preface the next three or so videos
that's because the next three videos go
into a new topic and I don't know where
to piece all this information in and I
don't really want to bombard you with a
ton of information in those videos so I
thought it was necessary to pull out
some information and just kind of make a
foundation for the next few videos so
this video we are going to introduce the
topic of database normalization anytime
you study databases you will come across
the term normalization guarantee it it's
basically this process that is used to
improve the database structure think of
like this x-ray that like scans your
database and is like wrong wrong wrong
wrong and points out all the bad things
and helps you fix it now obviously this
isn't automated all of them be pretty
cool it's something we do so we look at
our database with our normalization
glasses and scan for different rules and
when we find one of these rules that are
broken we fix it it's a pretty simple
concept but it's kind of complex and
complicated so I'm gonna try and keep it
as simple as possible that's because
whenever you study this stuff online and
you look up a definition they'll give
you like 40 different terms that you've
probably never heard of and even I am
like whoa so that being said this is
going to be a pretty simple introduction
to database normalization then maybe
later down the road we can go into a
little bit more detail with all of the
functional dependencies and fancy terms
and all that kind of stuff but I will
try to give you as many terms as
possible so don't think this is gonna be
like baby level this will be like entry
to mid-level all right so let's do this
as everything is in databases
normalization is broken up into sections
basically we have these steps we take
so we scan our database
and we find everything that's wrong with
it and then we're like awesome we got
past stage one and then we do it again
and we find even more errors and we do
this as many times as we want until we
get through all of the different normal
forms normal forms by the way are what
the steps are called how many normal
forms are there though well there is
actually a lot of normal forms but we as
beginner noobs we are going to focus on
first normal form second normal form and
third normal form and these are
abbreviated as 1n F 2 and F and three
units consider these are x-ray goggles
that scan our database and each level is
progressively more strict so the first
one might scan it and say oh yeah here's
a couple things wrong but it's you know
it's not a huge deal let's get rid of
those but then the second one it also
has to pass all of the first normal form
rules too
and additional rules so this one is like
oh no there's a lot of more errors we
got to get rid of those and by the time
you get to third normal form you have to
have both first normal form second
normal form done and then we scan our
database and we get more things wrong
with our database than things right with
our database when we study this stuff
the concept of dependencies will come up
now what is a dependency essentially a
dependency is when a thing all this is
totally not helpful but a thing depends
on something else and the simplest way I
can explain that is using the idea of
entities and attributes and this goes
back to way the beginning of this series
so if you don't know that make sure you
start from the beginning of this series
but essentially an entity is anything we
want to store data about and an
attribute is the data we store about the
entity so we kind of get this little
diagram so each one of these would be
something describing this entity you
could however worded that the attribute
depends on the entity and this would be
a dependence now there are numerous
kinds of dependencies some are
appropriate and some are not but we will
go over a couple but just so you know
when you study normalization they're
going to talk about
kinds of different dependencies and when
you hear that term I want you to think
of an attribute describing an entity or
essentially a column inside of a table
so if we have a user's table one column
might be the username I always make it
way too small
let's jazzy oh okay there we go
now this username depends on the user
that's because if we changed the user
the username would also change so to
think about that we can draw some users
still am bad at drawing here's the user
and here is a user and each one of these
users might have a user name so the
value of usernames changes based on the
user that we're talking about that is an
example of a dependency now going beyond
a third normal form
there is Boyce Codd normal form fourth
normal form fifth normal form
blah blah blah normal form and
yadda-yadda normal form and just a bunch
of other things but once you get to
third normal form you can basically
consider your database to be normalized
normalized is a state where all of the
normal forms have been done on our
database and we fix all of the problems
this is obviously something that is
subjective that's because some people
would consider third normal form to be
normalized or other people think you
have to go farther down and it really
just depends on the application I
personally think third normal form is
suitable for 99% of applications so
there's really not a huge reason to go
past that but occasionally there is so
it still might benefit you learning the
other normal forms now all of this is
designed to help us get data integrity
and I know we've had like a crap ton of
videos over data integrity and you're
probably sick of hearing that term but
as I said it's very very important in
our database
if you go through the normal forms you
can basically assure yourself that your
data has integrity how exactly does this
help our data integrity it helps it by
preventing anomalies an anomaly is
something out of the order
there are different types of anomalies
such as insert anomalies and update
anomalies and delete anomalies but if
you had to summarize it all essentially
when you do something with your database
it does something that is not expected
and that stems from our data not having
proper integrity so if we can get rid of
anomalies then we can protect our data
how do we get rid of anomalies by
reducing redundancy what is redundancy
redundancy is when we have the same
information in our database two times or
more you can think of if we had a user
table and let's say we have user name
name and phone and when we insert data
into this we give a user name and we
give it a name and a phone number and
now let's say we want to add a second
phone number well let's just add another
row in this situation we have data
redundancy that's because we have this
user name in here twice and we have this
name in here twice now if these are
foreign keys and they pointed back to
one entity that would be okay but in
this situation it's not okay because we
have the same data repeating and if we
were to try to update this data let's
say Caleb got a name change well now we
go and say oh let's grab this row and
update it to something else so instead
of Caleb we're gonna have John here this
is a perfect example of an anomaly
that's because now we have John and
Caleb in here and they're both the same
person so is this guy's named Caleb or
John no and there's no real good way to
find out so we do not want anomalies
ever when you study normalization you're
going to come across different terms
such as candidate key and there are a
few others essentially what a candidate
key is is a combination of columns or
just a column that can uniquely identify
a row so basically we're going to have
numerous candidate keys and then we have
to pick which one is going to be the
most best primary key so let's say this
one's the best we could say
oh this is our new primary key when you
go through these normal forms it's going
to be talking about all of the candidate
keys now candidate keys come in more
commonly when we're using natural keys
which have real-world meaning that's
because we have to find a good
combination of columns to force
something to be unique but when we're
using surrogate Keys we almost always
just have an ID column and if that's the
situation we only have one primary key
and because of that I almost ignore the
candidate key now it's probably not like
the world's best practice but you know
it works as long as we have a primary
key that's unique not null and never
changing I don't see a huge reason and
freaking out about all of the different
candidate keys and all of that stuff
that means in the upcoming videos I'm
going to be talking about first normal
forms second normal form and third
normal form relating to the primary key
I think that's an appropriate way to
start database normalization especially
when we're using surrogate Keys which I
have IDs let me know what you guys think
do you think it's a huge deal to focus
on all of the candidate keys I guess it
might be more helpful to go through the
videos over the normal forms and then
come back and let me know what you think
but people have different attitudes and
different thoughts on all of this
information so hopefully all that
information was a good foundation for
the next three or four videos that way
when you go in there you're not going to
be completely lost and I'm not gonna
have to do a 12-minute
intro to first normal form if you guys
