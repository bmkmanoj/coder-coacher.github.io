going to be discussing the magical
forever frame forever frame is one of
the four ways signal our works we have
WebSockets eventsource
forever frame and a long pulling so
forever frame is kind of like the third
option in the list but it's still really
cool so let's kind of dig in and see
what it's like well the first thing we
need to know about forever frame is it
has to do with an HTML iframe iframe is
an HTML element that means we can embed
it in our HTML pages
if you've ever embedded a YouTube video
you have probably used an iframe it's a
way to open a connection to another
server so with within this iframe you're
going to put a URL to where the server
is listening on this is kind of complex
and you don't really need to understand
all the details I don't even understand
all the details but just this is kind of
a rough overview the iframe is going to
have a URL of where the server is
listening on so kind of like making a
request over the Internet but now we're
doing it within our HTML page in an
iframe and once this connection is made
through this iframe the server is able
to run stuff on the client so if we have
a JavaScript function that's called
announced well on the server
that's our server it is able to call
this function and give it data so it
could announce something on the client
by putting data in the announced
function and then that function runs and
just for your beginners out there a
function is basically a piece of code
that can be ran just by calling its name
and passing in some data so when we say
announce parenthesis and we pass in like
welcome to the webpage or whatever and
close it we are running the announce
function which might do all kinds of
different things that is the way forever
frame works now this video is the first
video where we actually talk about the
server push
which i've mentioned many times in this
situation the server can send data to
the client without the client requesting
it the only request of the client is the
initial request to get the client-side
code and that's going to be that way for
all of them that's when you go to http
whatever the website is and then you get
the code and then forever frame starts
running well once it starts running the
server can now send data to the client
as it desires that's cool
that's called a server push so it's a
push from the server now just like
anything forever frame has its downsides
one of the downsides is that when it
sends data to the client it can take up
a bunch of RAM by just sitting there in
that iframe one of the ways around this
is to program and to clear out the data
every so often another downside is that
the client must support iframes so how
many clients actually support iframes
well the only kind I can think of are
ones that have web browsers because web
browsers can have iframes in HTML that
you receive from the server there may be
more out there but that's the only one I
know of so this is limiting in the
clients earlier I mentioned how signal
art can work with all different kinds of
clients so if for any reason the client
does not support an iframe well in that
situation it's not going to choose
forever frame this is a good reason why
you should use signal are because you
don't have to worry about whether the
client has support for iframes or not
you don't have to worry about putting
the iframe in your HTML it's gonna do
all that goodness for you if you were
just using forever frame alone you would
be limiting yourself to just web
browsers or anything else that supports
iframes the third downside is that this
is a one-way persistent connection what
this means is that any time the client
wants to request data or wants to send
data to the server it's going to have to
make a new request it's not going to be
able to send it through the iframe in
like
that tunnel I drew earlier when I was
talking about persistent connections
it's going to have to make a new request
which requires more resources from the
server but this is great for pushes so
if your application primarily uses
pushes like pushing data from the server
to the client then this might be
something that would work
good thing we don't even have to worry
about that but I'm just saying in some
kind of application such as a chat room
this would not be the best option
because anytime you submit a message
that's going to have to be sent to the
server in a separate request
well that is forever frame thanks guys
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
