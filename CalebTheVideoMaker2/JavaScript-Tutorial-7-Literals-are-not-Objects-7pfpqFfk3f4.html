seventh JavaScript tutorial thank you
for sticking with this so far I know
it's still kind of early in the series
although I want to talk about something
that's kind of advanced so I'm going to
simplify it a little bit not get real
technical hopefully make you understand
but I mean you can always go more in
depth if you want but I'd like to get
this crossed early in the series so you
really understand how JavaScript works
with literals and objects so we're going
to be looking behind the scenes of
JavaScript come on work there we go all
right in JavaScript
everything is treated as an object so
when we started we had properties and
methods I explained that in video number
one so here we declare a variable and we
initialize it with the value Caleb the
video maker to the string and yes this
is a subliminal message to please
subscribe to my youtube channel
subscribe dot length will return a value
it'll rittle tell you how many
characters is in the string 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 that
is a really long name but anyways behind
the scenes the value of the variables
subscribe is not an object it's a
literal we talked about this in data
types a little bit but now we're going
to be going in more depth so if you
remember from the data type video we
have two types of values literals and
then anything else is an object so we
have strings numbers boolean null and
undefined if the two groups are literals
and objects it would make sense to say
that literals are in fact different than
objects there's something else they are
not the same as objects and that is
right they are in fact not objects as I
just said all right so objects have
properties and methods literals do not
so as you can see you may be asking
explain this then see we're declaring a
variable
X and we're signing at the value yo my
bro ha whatever that means and then we
use a property X dot length it's going
to return a value 11 one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
okay well this length that's a property
and as I said earlier this is a literal
this value here is a literal so how is
it that this literal value has a
property that we can use such as length
because it's not an object if the
variable X points to a literal value
rather than an object how can we use
that property that's what we're going to
be answering in this video x dot length
is known as object syntax since our
syntax
basically when we use periods between
the oops the object and the property
this is known as object syntax or dot
alright so anyways it must be an object
right well not necessarily the value of
x is a literal it is not an object when
we use a property on X javascript is
actually looking at a copy of the string
in object form so that's a little
confusing so let's look at a simplified
beginner version of this alright so here
we have X it's a variable with a value
the value is going to be a literal and
when necessary javascript is going to
create an object copy of this pretty
much when we need a property which is
something only objects have javascript
looks at the object version of the value
so x dot length is going to look at the
object copy not the literal it's going
to look at the object version
javascript does this behind the scenes
so users well I use the user the user
only sees it as variable X having a
value all the other stuff is done behind
the scenes and you're not really going
to know about it unless you work in
depth with JavaScript and figure out how
literals act and how objects act which
we'll be getting into that in future
videos so here we have a user will name
him Pablo and he he defined or declared
a variable X and he gave it a value as
well what the we could say values a
string it doesn't really matter and
behind the scenes of JavaScript so you
can say there's like an imaginary wall
right here the user only sees variable X
but behind the scenes in normal
operations JavaScript is going to use a
literal datatype but if necessary if a
method or property is called well then
javascript is going to use an object
version of the same data that is created
from the literal so once again variable
X has a value that is a literal literal
datatype and through normal operation
we're going to use the literal datatype
but when we use a method or property the
object version of the same data is going
to be used so that's the copy that right
here
javascript created right here is going
to be used for methods and properties so
hopefully that's not too confusing
trying to break it down simple but I
mean in general it's a confusing concept
well because of this literals act like
objects because of this is all all of
this is done behind the scenes we can
call a method or request the value of a
property on any literal value without
getting errors or understanding how
things work behind the scenes but
understanding how things work behind the
scenes is always better to create better
JavaScript code
in fact most people don't understand
that everything in JavaScript is not an
object but everything in JavaScript
actually acts like an object as we just
saw because we have the object copy
so why methods do not change about you
so if you remember from previous videos
we can also call methods on literal
values a method takes the value does
something with it and returns it these
are also known as functions basically it
would look something or I'll type down
here that is an example of a method here
is our variable identifier or name of
the variable and this is going to
uppercase the value of the variable we
always had to reassign the new value to
the original variable or to a new
variable so here we have a variable we
declared it it has an identifier
subscribe and it has a value that is of
string type and it says subscribe to my
channel now subscribe to uppercase well
this right here is the method right here
this is going to uppercase all of the
characters within the string and return
subscribe to my channel so yeah pretty
big deal it's all caps
that means I'm serious but the return
value does nothing unless be assigned
and let's assign to the original
variable or a new one so no changes to
the proper font here so subscribe is
equal to the old value of subscribe in
uppercase letters that's basically what
it says in English so the old value was
subscribed to my channel we're going to
uppercase it and then so we're going to
uppercase it and then we're going to
assign it back to the variables
subscribe
so now variable subscribe
as a value of subscribe to my channel
the reason behind this this is because
we cannot run methods on literal strings
because they're not objects this does
nothing to the literal string because
this is a method it is required that
JavaScript uses the object copy of the
value this means the method is not being
done on the literal value which is why
nothing changes so if we look back at
this picture you can see we have a
variable we call it a method to
uppercase it takes the data from the
object version of the same data so this
value up here does not get affected or
nothing is even done with this literal
value up here so we have a variable X
it's a string hey we uppercase it and
then we alert which is just a way to
test what variables are show things on
the screen there's all there's other
ways to do it but that's just an example
of one this will give us a in lowercase
letters not hey in all capital letters
so this the the method follows the path
of the object version the literal is
untouched so variable X it's a method so
goes to the object version of the same
data
now we reassign it so we have variable X
is equal to the string PI it's a method
so we call to upper case goes to the
object copy which is PI lower case and
it outputs PI in all capital letters we
then take this value reassign it to the
original value so in the next whenever
we use the variable and then in the next
coding sequence or whatever you want to
call it variable X is now going to have
the value PI and all capital letters and
as you can see the literal over here
nothing is done with it it's still the
value PI unless we change
what variable X is equal to value eyes
so to explain that a little better once
we assign pie and all capital letters
back to variable X it is going to update
the literal value and the value is not
going to be PI lowercased it would be I
have nowhere to type this but it would
be a PI uppercase so I guess I could
illustrate this real quickly new dot
HTML and I can make a little script and
I can end this script so what we can do
is create a string variable variable X
is equal to hey so now I have a variable
X which has the value hey now we're
going to call a method notice I use the
same method every time but there's other
ones but I think it's a simple to use
the same one each time alright so when
we run this in a web browser well it's
not really going to do anything so we
can run in chrome and you can see no
value is returned or displayed a values
returned but it we never displayed it to
the screen so we could try alert X and
then when we save it an update or page a
javascript alerts going to come up that
says hey and to uppercase is not going
to affect the original variable but we
could do something like to uppercase
here so now we're alerting the uppercase
version forgot the of X so INRIA
refresh the page now let's hey in all
capital letters now there's something
else that's useful in JavaScript that is
the type all right so this is going to
test what type of value a value is what
type evaluate so we with sorry within
these parentheses we can put something
such as type of X
we refresh the page and of course to see
this we could alert it you just get rid
of this so now we're alerting the type
of X let's refresh the page and it's a
string well we could do this again and
we could say X is now equal to X to
upper case refresh it and you can say
see it's still a string so if we look
back at our presentation here alright
it's so as I was saying we changed the
variable X to the capital PI and it goes
back to the literal value so in review
obviously this is a simplified picture
version of the actual process when you
use methods or properties of literals
javascript defines a copy of the
original value with the type object this
object copy is only going to be used
when necessary
usually we can treat treat literals as
objects in how they act
but there are no more there are more
underlying differences we will get into
in future videos so some other stuff be
sure to subscribe to my channel thank
you very much and that's all I have to
say in this video kind of ran a little
long but that's okay well I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
