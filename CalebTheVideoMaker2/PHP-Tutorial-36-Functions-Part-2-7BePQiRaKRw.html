I wanted to talk about declaring or
defining your own user-defined functions
it's gonna be awesome so if you liked it
please click Subscribe in fact do it now
and if you decide you don't like it just
stay subscribed I'm kidding but
seriously please subscribe
alright so defining functions functions
alright so very first thing is the
syntax to define a function to do that
you write function and then you name the
function and the naming rules I talked
about it in the last video so I can name
it for example then I can add
parentheses and then curly braces like
this okay
now this right here this area between
these two curly braces is the code block
that is going to be ran when I call the
function so later in my program if I
type add the two curly braces
well everything within here is going to
run okay so cool that is the basic
function syntax so that is how you
create a function once you type this
this function is created and right now
it does absolutely nothing so it's
pointless now this is going to be a very
very very simple basic beginner easy
novice newbie function alright so this
is not practical at all I'm just
teaching you we're going to create a
function called add and just to clear
things up I'm gonna erase a little this
extra stuff
all right yeah I need more room I'm just
gonna race it all
so um chin ah parentheses Open bracket
close bracket all right now what we're
going to do is take two numbers so let's
say this is one of the numbers and this
is the number another one of the numbers
we're going to add them and then we're
going to get a final value to be used so
it's pretty complex not it's not really
though
so don't freak out well you could say
these little boxes here since we don't
know what the value is going to be we
can use variables so we could say this
is X and this is y and that's just the
final result we have to worry about that
okay so we can make these variables to
store whatever value is going to be used
because we don't really know because
when you call the function that is
that's going to be given by the program
not when we define the function so for
example when we use the array function
within these parentheses we gave it
values so this would be stored in a
variable that temporary holds the vet
temporarily holds the value and
converted it into an array well the same
thing happens when we're doing this
addition function it's going to take a
given value such as five and ten and
it's going to take these put them in our
variables X and the other one was Y and
it's going to replace them with five and
and so that's pretty much how it works
these replace the variables and then it
adds these together and gives us the
final result and I don't know where I'm
drawing this arrow at oh okay okay so to
put these variables in our function what
we do is we define them up here a
variable X variable Y and then we have
the opening curly brace in the closing
curly brace then within the function we
can use these variables so we could say
echo the variable X plus the variable Y
so this is going to take these add them
together and then echo it out to the
screen so then when we call it it's
going to look like this five and one and
then on the screen it's gonna show up as
six or on in the web browser this is
what the user is going to see this is
the PHP code to get that answer so these
that was weird I sounded weird there
these variables that we put our values
in are known as parameters okay
the values we give it when we call it so
and then within parenthesis we have five
and one these are known as arguments
so let's draw a little boxes to make
this very clear we have two boxes this
one is named variable X this one's
variable Y these boxes are known as
parameters the values within the boxes
we add together they are known as the
arguments so when we're defining a
function the temporary variables that
take the values we give the function
when we call it those are the parameters
the actual values we give it with right
here they are known as the arguments so
when you're watching programming
tutorials from other people or from me
you may hear me say oh we need a
function and this function takes two
parameters this means when the function
was defined we had two temporary values
if I said it takes three parameters that
means it takes three temporary variables
that hold values the actual values I
give it such as Caleb Daniel and curry
three separate values well those are the
arguments oh now that I got that out of
my way I think I'm ready to move on
hopefully that makes good sense so this
video is running a bit long so I'm
actually going to stop it now and I'll
finish up in the next one thank you for
