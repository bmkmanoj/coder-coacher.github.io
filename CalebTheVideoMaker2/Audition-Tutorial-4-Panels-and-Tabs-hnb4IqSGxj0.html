your fourth adobe audition tutorial and
just to warn you this is going to be
like super boring so just deal with it
alright so basically I'm just going to
teach you how to rearrange the looks of
this everything here so as you can see
we have we have files here that we've
created bunch of garbage we have the
multitrack session here and then we have
a little toolbar at the top media
browser and then we have some other tabs
which are the sex out of one right here
then down here we have the history and
the video and then Daphne we have levels
which you can make this rate monitor
like you're recording levels or anything
and then a section this will tell you
where your bar is and stuff so if you
need to go back to what it was like
wingo works window workspace reset
default and this will bring us back to
the original view of how I have it
currently so now um here all of these
things we have open such as the mixer
here you can at reeve retrieve these by
opening the window tab and selecting one
so let's say I want to play this thing I
opened a new playlist tab so as you can
see we can open new things and we can
also X out of things by clicking the
little X now maybe you don't like the
way this is all set up and you want
something moved well as you can see we
have four little we have a bunch of
little boxes we have a box here and box
here and box here a giant box here and
like a little line down here well two
boxes so these are our panels and then
within the panels we have some tabs you
see so what we can do is we can grab a
tab and we can drag it between other
boxes so i can i can take the markers
tab and bring it down to this box so now
the markers is down here i can also
bring it down here and add it to the
levels box or the panel as i should say
so now i have these down here which
isn't really enough room so i'm bringing
this back up here so that's pretty cool
spoke we can move that i think but what
we can do is we can actually modify this
more by completely changing the panel
for example if I want this in its own
separate box when I drag it down here
you can see there's five spots i can
place it the top left bottom right and
the middle now if i put it in the middle
this is going to keep it how it is this
is the same as dragging it up here to
the tool but the little tab bar so if we
drag it down here to the middle it's
going to add it to this tab bar right
here so placing it here and here does
the same thing BAM so now you can see
the markers is up here and properties is
now the main tab but what are the other
boxes do you can see if I want it to be
between these if I want the markers to
be between these two boxes I can
actually drag it to this box this blue
triangle trapezoid booking not a
trapezoid what are those things called I
can't remember but if I if I do that
it'll bring it to its own tab but it's
already its own tab so let me take the
properties and drag it down here and you
can see now I have properties markers in
the history all in three separate tabs
so that's pretty stupid so I'm just
going to X out of these and you can see
this automatically grew to take up the
whole spot so another thing we can do is
take between two bars or two panels and
drag to resize so if I need this master
multitrack to be larger I can just
shrink everything else I can also
complete the X out of these and it'll
make itself larger so now it takes up
the whole screen I can also get rid of
these levels down here because see just
to show you that we can make this pretty
big so that's pretty cool so let's go
back to how was because that looks
pretty crappy yes sure that's cool so
now I want to teach you about the
workspaces so basically we can modify
this how i like it so i'm going to set
the levels over here which i don't know
if i'm going to use these book and i'll
set it there i'm gonna drag this over
some i like the files being here but i
don't really need the effects I'll leave
the markers up all
into this sometime soon exhale the
property's history in the video because
I don't need those now this I'm also
going to drag over here so just like
that and actually no I think I like that
down there better oh yeah what you can
also do is if you drag it off the screen
like this and then place it it can be a
float its own floating window and to put
it back you can click this little tab
here and we cannot sorry this little
well I don't even know what it's called
it looks like a little dotted square if
you can even see it here let me zoom in
wait what you can do is you can grab
that so if I make this its own if it's
it's own floating window I can take this
to end drag it back to replace it so
that's pretty cool if you need to if you
have like two monitors you can drag one
off to the side to make things really
easier so it's like oh no what do i do
how do I get it back we'll just grab
this place it there so that's cool now
once you have it the way you like it and
I'm going to drag this down here but and
I'm going then you go to window
workspace and you can Newton create a
new workspace so Caleb the video maker
too okay so that's my workspace pretty
sweet I know I know you're totally
jealous so now when let's say I screw
something up my ex out of this oh no
it's gone forever what do i do what i
can do is i can go to window workspace
reset Caleb the video maker too and it's
back to how it was so that's workspaces
and moving around tables I mean on
tables darn panels I always forget that
word so yeah that's what you need to
know to move things around and customize
the layout and i'll be getting into some
more of this in the future so subscribe
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
