briefly about musical phrases now this
is a way to break up songs and logical
pieces so it's not just one long song so
I'm sure you have heard of verse and
chorus and bridge maybe so these are
basically pieces of a song so when we
have a song will have something
everybody recognizes the chorus of a
song it's the thing that plays like
three times or four times or a million
times if it's pop and that's what gets
drilled in your brain then we have the
verses which all sounds similar but
there are slight variations such as
lyrical changes but typically the chorus
stays the same the bridge that is
usually after like two choruses and
verse they'll have a bridge which is
like a special piece that leads back
into another chorus but nothing crazy on
the intro that's pretty simple it's an
introduction pre-course sort of like
this is something you play real quick
before course instrumental solo pretty
obvious instrumental solo and an ending
that's how you end the song or finale or
whatever so here are just some of the
musical phrases you may might run across
and your musical adventures and a common
way to announce these is to label them
as with letters so for example the
verses can be a and the course can be be
so now if we are designing a song let's
make bridge see and let's make yeah
that's good let's serious the other ones
for now if we're making a song and we're
telling people how how it is to be
played such as a guitarist you can tell
them okay it's it's a a be a see be a be
now that's a way to say okay I know how
to play the verse I know how to play the
course I know how to play the bridge I
just need to know what order they're in
because the
Bridge might be I mean as bridge might
be here it might be over here so you can
use these letters to represent these
things so oftentimes in music you'll see
an A or B above certain parts to
represent verse and chorus now my thing
to be careful with is putting numbers
after the letters so you may see a one
now let's go yeah a1 a2 a3 and a lot of
people think that this means all right
this is the first versus the second
versus of third verse well that's not
true the technical definition for this
is these are variations so this one
would be like three different kinds of
verses but usually it should just be a
even if the lyrics change because versus
the lyrics always change usually that
doesn't mean you get a new version it's
still the verse but if you have a
different underlying chord structure or
different rhythms within the verse you
may need to make a new version call the
original a1 and call the new 1a too so
people can distinguish that in their
brain which version is to be played so
that is the thing make sure you're not
getting confused and labeling each thing
with different numbers such as course
one course to course three course for
and so forth so that's just some of the
musical phrases you will see I mean
that's not a huge part of music but a
lot of people do that 22 / lower how
much music you need to look at so if you
have the music memorized such as if
you're a guitar player you just play cg
c g 7c for the verse and for the course
you go cc GGC then if they just say a be
a be well you know cgc g7 see see see I
forget it already and you can just play
each one of these as pieces rather than
having to look at your music over and
over
to see what's coming up next alright so
that's all I really have to say about
musical phrases and the next video we'll
be going over something new so if you
would like to support me please
subscribe to my youtube channel it means
everything so thank you and see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
