Caleb's video maker to this video we are
going to be talking about many to many
relationships in the previous two videos
we talked about one-to-one relationships
and one-to-many relationships and the
example we used was a blogging website
we had a user's table and a blogs table
and the blog's table referenced the
users table that is how we allowed
multiple blogs to be written by one
person in that situation though a blog
could only be authored by one person so
you could kind of draw it like this user
has a one-to-many with blog blog is on
the many side what if we wanted to alter
this app though so that a blog could
have many users then it would look like
this
the way we did it without the many side
for the user is we had the blog table
reference the user well if we wanted to
do the mini side on this side all we
would have to do right is have the user
table reference the blog table but then
there's a problem because now we have a
table referencing another table and it
gets really messy for example if this is
the table and let's say we just have
different rows and these tables each
line we can say is a user in each line
we could say is a blog so this one user
could have wrote numerous blogs and this
user could have wrote numerous blogs and
then you could also think of it the
other way this blog was written by this
user and that user as you can see it
just kind of gets messy when we start
working with a lot of data the solution
of this is to break this many-to-many
relationship into two one-to-many
relationships so then what we are going
to have is the users table with a
one-to-many and the blog's table what
they want many but how do these connect
or we're actually going to have another
table inside of here to fix this
conflict imagine that this
disorganization is a conflict and we
need someone to kind of break in and
separate the fighting entities
so we are going to name this user blogs
by convention I'm having the first one
singular and second one plural it will
look something like this
this table is known as an intermediary
table or a junction table essentially
what this table does is it records the
associations between the users and the
blocks so anytime a user has a blog it's
going to be listed in this table so
let's put some simple data in here let's
say we have a few users and we have a
few blogs in here and we'll just write
some IDs let's say 6 7 and we'll have
another person down here so these are
the 3 users inside of the users table
and we'll have 3 blogs over here too and
we'll give them all IDs now anytime
there is a user authoring a blog that
Association is going to go in this users
blog table so let's say this guy right
here he authored these two blogs all you
would have to do is for every blog he's
associated with is create a row the
columns in here are going to be the IDS
so we could say 6 7 and then we have
another row 6 12 and that shows the
combination of this user with these two
blogs if you want to reverse the
thinking a little bit and say blog users
you can do that too but in this
situation it's not quite as clear that's
because on the application a user
creates a blog it's not so much the
other way where i blog creates a user
that's why I decided to put users first
but if you wanted you could flip these
tables and do it the other way you could
say blog authors for example and you
would have blogs and then the users
table over here any way you want to
design it is fine as long as there's
only two one-to-many relationships
in this situation we have a one-to-many
this way and a one-to-many this way
that's because we have only one 6 here
but we can have as many sixes as they
want here same for this side we can have
the blog 7 one time here we can have as
many references to blog 7 as we
here so for example this lady could work
on the blog with the ID of seven and now
we have two references to the blog with
the ID upset so that is your
introduction to intermediary tables in
designing many-to-many relationships you
were always going to want to break
many-to-many relationships up into
one-to-many relationships
hopefully that is all clear for you guys
hopefully you enjoyed the video if
you're enjoying this content please
click like subscribe what's coming up
next well I think I'm going to do an
overview of all of this not to be
redundant but just to kind of wrap it
all together and Express the three
different ways to design tables and that
will just kind of make it more concrete
in our minds before we move on so thanks
guys I will see you in the next video
