obviously tell that I did something with
this text from the last video i just
wanted to show you what i did real quick
before we get started click options
configure and then here is the font face
any size that i'm using i'm going to try
it out and see if I like it but I just
figured it'd be better for you people
watching this that you'd actually be
able to see what I'm typing without
happening to have a huge computer
monitor or anything else like that so I
probably should have done this like a
long ago but it's fine for now so yeah
we'll keep it like this and we will see
how it goes so let me just fix things up
real quick ok so this video we'll be
talking about using operators on strings
so specifically mathematic operators we
learned about these in previous videos
so we can actually use these on strings
well sort of all right so let's try it
out we can do something this is actually
known as concatenation when we have one
string and we add it with another string
and then we can print that and it gives
us this value although the only problem
is obviously that there is no space
right here that is because we don't have
a space it just goes from right here to
right here with no space so we can fix
that by either putting a space where you
get this bring this back up we can get a
space here and then enter it and then we
have that solution but I like to do this
what I like to do is I I make the
strings just how they are not to worry
about spaces and then occasionally I
will just put an extra string in there
or an extra extra string with just a
space that way I don't have to worry
about a pending a space on my actual
values and you'll see why in a second so
what we can do with this is we can
actually use variables here which we
will try now
so let's have first name I'm just going
to put my name into a database I mean
yeah so we're just sorry my brain is
like focused on MySQL for some reason
but anyways we are going to put my name
as the value for this variable first
name and then we can have last name
equal courage so now we have both of
those print and we can concatenate these
by using first name plus last name and
it will give us this value now the
reason I don't like to put spaces here
is because when i'm using variables well
if i just put a space here it's not
going to do anything you'll see why in
just a sec put a space there and then oh
it looks exactly the same that's because
white space does not matter for this so
in order to do that there we would have
to go when and see that even this isn't
going to work because we learned that
this is just going to give us this
string value so the only way we could
possibly do this is to create a string
which is % s and you'd have to do
something funky with the % s thing that
we taught you that I taught you in the
previous video so this only solution to
really do this is to have first name
plus an empty string we will we have a
space within that string and then last
name oh we have to add we have to put a
plus they're obviously so now we have
first name plus a space plus last name
so that is an example of what we can do
we can also do things such as
multiplication oops on Caleb we can go
print and go first name and we can
multiply that well hell let's do
something crazy
let's see what happens when we do this
let's just go 9999 and it looks like
we're done so that is what happens and
you can see it's extremely slow so yeah
maybe not the best idea to go like nein
nein nein nein nein nein nein because
that's just going to cause problems ok
is it done I don't oh I think it's still
going oh goodness oh right the only
thing that we can't really do is use
subtraction and division because I mean
how are we going to do this like let's
just give an example let's say we have
the Navy value Caleb and we want to
divide that by five well that's not
practical because we can divide that by
five see but when we when we do
something like multiply it by five well
it knows that we're literally not we're
not literally trying to take the letters
of Caleb and do a mathematical equation
Python knows that we just want to show
that five times you see that it's now if
Caleb Caleb Caleb Caleb Caleb so we
can't really divide a string same thing
we can't really prob subtract a string
because that doesn't really make much
sense either
I love them if we wanted to subtract
five from this well what does that even
mean nothing it doesn't make sense so
that's why we can use addition and
multiplication so yeah that's how we do
that we can also do things such as
creating a let's say let's think we we
can create a variable let's go yo and
give it the value of a space and then we
can like multiply that by 200 just for
example right so what does that really
do not much but then we can do stuff
like print and within here we can say
hey dude here are a ton of spaces % s
Wow and then outside of this we can put
a print by % and then we can put yo let
me see if I get the right number 0 0 1 2
3 4 5 and we can say oops on we cannot
press ENTER on that and you can say hey
dude here a ton of spaces and it shows
all those faces wow so this is a kind of
stupid example but we can use that for
formatting certain like for example if
we needed to indent something 25 spaces
we could basically just do that using
this and then put our string within
quotes and put this wherever we desire
so that's just some examples of what you
can do and in the next video we'll be
talking about something else so see you
around thank you for watching and
