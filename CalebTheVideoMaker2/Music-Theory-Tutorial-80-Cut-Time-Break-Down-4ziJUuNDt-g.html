talk about the beats per minute
normally we had like let's say a quarter
note is equal to 60 this would be put
one quarter note equal to one second
because that was sang and there's a
quarter note every 60 seconds if we're
in cut time which is to two it would say
one half note is equal to 30 that means
thirty half notes in a second that way
everything still is the same so for
example if I have four quarter notes in
4/4 time where one quarter note is equal
to 60 now
we swap over to - to - to time and we
set the half note to 30 and we have four
quarter notes and yes I'd be on one
measure because two quarter notes is
equal to a half note and there's two
half notes in the measure so here's one
measure
here's one measure and we're counting
this one missus - I don't know how fast
time is alright so 60 80 beats per
minute
here's how fast food companies one to
make sense can you see it 1 2 3 4 1 2 2
1 1 2 1 so forth
compared to this this is going to be
double the speed so we would count this
let's see 1 2 3 so forth we had a bunch
of them 1 2 because it's double the
tempo so what does this mean typically
we will see 2 - time for songs that are
very fast and we don't want have a
conductor these are going 1 2 3 4 1 2 3
4
it's easier to go 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
even if it's really fast so you may hear
people tell you that in cut time
everything is worth half well that's
partly true but it's not because only if
the tempo stays the same or beats per
minute stays the same so if I have a
song and for 4 that is at 120 beats per
minute what kind of beats
well the quarter note gets to be right
but if we are at halftime where it's 2 2
it's telling us here the 2 tells us that
the half note gets the beat so if we
have a hundred and twenty
half notes in a minute beats per minute
well that's saying there's 120 half
notes which is the equivalent of 240
quarter notes so it sounds double the
speed although the reason for this is
because you conduct it in half one two
one two so you could count quarter notes
one to count two quarter notes for every
beat one two one two which is almost
like eighth notes so I know this is a
lot to take in at first but it makes
sense after a while basically all you
have to need - all you need to know is
that in order for a to two versus a
common time song to sound the same and
then it needs to be half the tempo 60
beats per minute
so now ah 60 half notes is the
equivalent of 120 quarter notes which is
cool so that's about all you need to
know about that and let's try it with
some more fancy rhythms I know this
video is getting long but I think I
should go over this a bit more if we
have
this is cut time to to this is common
for for now in order for these to sound
the same
this one has to be half the beats per
minute as this one so let's say this is
60 this is 30 I really know how fast I
would be sorry
Bobson flip that 60 this is 31 1 2 and
the only difference is it's slower
conducting but it can still sound the
same using a half tempo so if we were to
play this really fast such as 60 beats
per minute we don't have to count 1 a 2
2 a 2 3 and a 4 E and 1 and a 2 a 2 3 we
can count half of that one and two and
and just play 16th notes and boom it's
easier because it's slower counts but it
still sounds very similar so that's all
I'm gonna say for common and cut time in
this video so I will see you in the next
one and that's it so subscribe and I'll
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
