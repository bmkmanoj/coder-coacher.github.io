Adobe Audition tutorial and in this
video I will be speaking about some
things you need to set up and some other
stuff that you should do before you
start actually using the program now the
first thing is your default inputs and
outputs for audio so if you go down here
in the corner you can right click this
and click playback devices and here is
where you'll see under playback tab what
is playing back and I'm using headphones
right here so this is my default so if
you're using a set of speakers or
something you will need to select those
and then click set default now for
recording this is how you record into
audition and I am also using a
microphone so those are all good now
from here after this you'll want to
under the Edit tab click preferences and
audio channel mapping now if you see
that when you're listening back or
something that your left is on your
right side and your right is on your
left side you can switch these because
if you click this little arrow I can say
the this side should be the left because
the microphone I'm using has two inputs
so if I switch this it'll switch which
headphone plug it goes into in my ears
and hears from my speaker's right here
and then you can also go to audio
hardware now the default input is
microphone h1 because this is what I'm
using to record my stuff in the future
default output I have it as speakers I'm
going to set this to headphones this is
what I'm using to listen back now
latency that is basically a delay from
how long when you record to when it goes
into your system if there's if it's
higher it's better performance but lower
is faster so 200 is considered like safe
for everything
so that should be good sampling rate
I'll be getting into that in the future
for now let's just leave that 44100 now
after here you can see this is the
default setup and if you ever need to
change this it's under window workspace
and I am under default if you screw
something up such as X out of this
this and this and yours oh no how do I
go back to the original click window
workspace reset default yes now let's
start by opening a project by file new
audio file and we're going to name this
first audio file very creative I know
now sampling rate I'm going to explain
this and I'll also be explaining the bit
depth and I actually drew these highly
professional photos to explain this so
the sampling rate this is basically how
accurate the curve is to a natural voice
which is this is represented by a sine
wave as it is called and it looks like
this right here so if you have a high
sampling rate it replicates the sine
wave as close as possible but not
perfect because you can see if we zoom
up we can still see that it's almost
like staircases so if you have a low
sampling rate it's going to be very
blocky as it is here and if you have a
higher sampling rate it'll look less
blocky but if you have a really high
sampling right it'll be nice and smooth
almost like a natural voice you can't
have it too high because it'll be too
high of a file size and there there will
be a point where you can't even notice
the difference so I'm going to go with
44.1 for this and bit-depth
this is let me show you my other picture
what the bit-depth does is describe how
many possibilities of sounds there are
for example if we have a 1 bit sound
there's two options either on or off so
we can only have above the bar and below
the bar but if we have a 2 bit word here
we have a wide a wider range of
possibilities if you have a higher bit
it's more like a real voice rather than
on or off it can be on on on off off on
off off and these are just used to
describe different possibilities so if
we have a 16 bit bit word that means
there's 16 what you could say digits
within the word so like 1 0 1
blah blah sixteen of them with this it
allows 65535 different possibilities so
if you have a 32-bit it allows up to 2
billion 100 million something so to put
this a different way the sampling rate
is how many samples you take within a
second so if we look at audition we have
it at forty four thousand one hundred
this means in one second we will take
44,100 samples and the bit depth is how
many possibilities to take from so if
it's 8-bit that means the first sample
may be this sound and then the second
sample will be something else and
there's 255 possibilities then it just
arranges those 255 possibilities to
match the given sound as close as
possible so if I'm recording an 8-bit
it's not going to be as realistic as
recording as 16-bit which has 65535
possibilities so a higher sampling rate
is taking more sounds on a second and a
higher bit depth is having more possible
sounds within that second but the thing
you got to worry about is the file size
so for this I'm going to use 44,000 132
bit depth now this is comes up and in
the next video I will actually be
teaching you more about recording and
explaining some sweet stuff so I will
see you then thank you for watching and
