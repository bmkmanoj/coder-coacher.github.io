are the 1 chord 4 chord and the 5 chord
these are important chords within the
scale and they're also all of the major
chords so let's pick a scale C because
it's probably one of the easiest and I
will be explaining these chord families
in more detail so we have C let's create
the whole scale quick c d e f G a B now
let's harmonize this we get c e g d fa e
gb f AC g b d ye g ya AC e and b DF so
here's our harmonized version of the C
major scale here we have the tonic here
we have the sub-dominant and the
dominant now I wanted to show some of
these courts are so close together that
they can be part of these families for
example and the C major scale we have an
e well let's take a look at the E minor
chord it also has an E C major has a G
and so does the e minor so this is
actually very similar to the tonic so we
say this is part of the tonic family
cool a so let's take an it look at this
one AC e well this one has a C and E so
does this one C in an e so this one will
be an atomic family because they're so
similar to the tonic chord or the 1
chord let's take a look at the
sub-dominant family f AC well this one
has an F in an a fa fa so they're very
similar there's only one pitch that's
different
G
differ making them different so these
are sub-dominant sorry i subbed on
because it's shorter
now GBD well it says it let's go to
black this has a B and a D this has a B
and a deep so we can say these two are
dominant so basically I'm saying this
chord can fit nicely with the dominant
chord so we can say it's part of the
family of the dominant dominant family
hopefully that makes sense so here are
our are our three families and I'm just
trying to show you that some of these
chords share a lot of notes with other
chords so I'm saying if we go from a C
chord to an E minor chord the difference
is only a one pitch it still sounds
different but so these these notes are
the same for the C major
and the e minor so that's all I have to
say for this video and in the next video
I'll be teaching some more about this
and what we can do with it so I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
