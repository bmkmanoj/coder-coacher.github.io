to this video we are going to be talking
about the varchar' 2 and n varchar' 2
data types in oracle now over the last
five or six videos i've discussed a
whole lot about the char and n char data
types as well as character sets and
encoding because of that I really don't
have that much to say good for you right
no but really I'm not going to be super
redundant and repeat everything I've
said I'm going to share with you the key
points just to make sure I don't neglect
two of the most important data types but
if you want to know the foundation of it
all go back to when I started talking
about the char data type the first thing
is the primary difference between the
varchar' are two data types and the char
data types that difference is that the
varchar' data types do not pad the data
to fit up a certain length char data
types do so if you say something like
this every single value in this column
is going to take up 10 characters even
if you only put in 7 or 8 or 9 or 1 or 0
it's going to pad that value you take up
10 characters and that is a waste of
space now in other database systems the
way char and varchar' datatypes are
stored is different so the char might be
stored one way and varchar might store
to another for example in my SQL
varchar' takes up extra space because it
has to have an extra byte or two to keep
track of how long that data is Oracle
doesn't work that way because the char
and the varchar' two column data types
are stored exactly the same way the only
difference is the padding and what that
means is you should almost never use the
char data type and always focus on the
bar chart to data type the same goes for
n VAR char - you won't want to use that
one rather than n char unless you have
an absolutely perfect beautiful case of
why you would want to use char then you
could use it in that situation please
leave a comment so I know of a good
example one other difference between the
char and the varchar' two data types is
the number of bytes it can store char
implement into mm whereas bar char is
limited to 4,000 so by using varchar' -
you automatically allow for double the
storage
once again this is bytes so if you have
single byte characters you can store
4,000 of them but if you're using you
code you want to be careful because if
you put in for example 3000 to byte
characters Oracle is going to bite your
head off and not work by that I mean
it's going to throw an error now 4000
bytes is definitely more than 2,000 in
fact it's double but 4000 is still not a
whole lot of bytes if you need to store
more than that you need to look into the
large object data type
hopefully that is something we can get
into in an upcoming video so that's all
I got for this video I know it was short
I have a whole lot to say but you know I
don't want to be super redundant so
thanks guys for watching if you like
this video be sure to click like if you
have any other useful tips or notes
about these data types leave a comment
I'll be sure to look at it and consider
it in future videos might say something
you had to say so thanks guys
