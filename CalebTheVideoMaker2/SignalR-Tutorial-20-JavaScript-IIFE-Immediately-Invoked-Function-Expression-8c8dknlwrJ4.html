got a little bit of a new environment
because I just moved and actually I've
misplaced my tripod so I literally
stacked two tables on top of each other
so the chances of something going wrong
by the end of the day is extremely high
on that note let's proceed so this is
where we left off we had the JavaScript
side and the hub the c-sharp side and
this video is going to be a little bit
about kind of a bunch of different
little things but JavaScript scoped a
couple other things with JavaScript and
then we'll probably can conclude it all
by putting this all inside of a git
repository so we're gonna hit a bunch of
different things so I recommend we get
started so the first thing I wanted to
talk about was JavaScript scope and the
idea of scope is the lifetime of a
variable so you declare a variable like
this in JavaScript
and whenever we just make a variable
like this it's in what's known as the
global scope and generally you don't
want to put things inside of the global
scope unless you absolutely need to or
if that's for some reason you want to do
that the reason being is the global
scope is shared amongst all of the
JavaScript files and there's a high
probability of you accidentally
overwriting a different variable in a
different file or something like that so
just just to kind of show how the scope
thing works I'm going to create a
function so you can create a function
just in plain JavaScript by saying var
and naming it and setting it equal to
function parentheses brackets so this is
parameters and this is what's the what
the function is going to do so in here
if we say var x equals 10 and then what
we're going to do is call that function
and then what we're going to do is
console dot log and we're going to log X
so that'll just write out X to the
browser console we'll see what X is so
let's run this we'll just inspect it to
see the console and you see it outputs
five so let's just kind of see why why
it did five it started var x equals five
and then we have this function and the
mitten the function just runs this piece
of code when we call the function and we
called that function and we reassigned
ten to the variable X but the scope of
this X is within this function so
javascript has function scope meaning
any variables declared inside of a
function only exist within that function
and it's pretty complex you can look up
JavaScript scope if you want to learn
all the details and all the different
things you need to know about all that
but this is like the very basics another
way if you don't want to have to write
console.log all the time you can just
leave it at that and then over here let
me refresh it you can just put X or
whatever the name of the variable is and
press ENTER and it will write it out to
the screen so the concept of you just
sang a variable name and it returns the
value is known as a read eval print loop
anytime you want to clear the console
you click this little button right here
and this will just give me some room so
I can show you the power of this read I
always forget the name of these things
read eval print loop so you can do crazy
things like if statements in here and
you can see that this will work yay so
that's just sorry kind of off topic but
that's still kind of useful now back to
this you can kind of start to get the
idea of how scope works in JavaScript
and there's something that you need to
know about when you start learning a lot
about JavaScript and that's known as an
immediate the invoked function
expression
now I confess my knowledge on this is a
little bit iffy but I'll teach you as
best as I can essentially what we want
to do is we want to wrap all of our code
inside of a function so that way we take
our variables out of the global scope
that way we're not overriding anything
in different JavaScript files so how do
you create one of these immediately
invoked function expressions
well the syntax is kind of funky so I'm
just going to write it out and if you
want to know the details of why it works
that way I'll give you guys a good post
so you need to create a function and
then what you need to do is you need to
wrap the entire function in parentheses
then after that you need to have an open
and closed parenthesis so basically we
are creating this function here and then
we are invoking it so if you want this
to be a little clearer we can space it
out like that so this is an immediately
invoked function expression what we can
do is we can put all of our code inside
of that so I don't need this here
anymore so I'm just gonna delete that
and then I'll take the rest of our code
cut it and paste it then just clean up a
little bit
save now let's give this a run and see
if it still works
refresh it works so you can see our
JavaScript is still working great but
the benefit now is that if we for any
reason declared a variable in here
you're looking on here let's and here
for our x equals no and then we go back
to our website refresh what we can do is
say X and you can see it's undefined if
we did not have this immediately invoked
function expression you can see what
happens refresh
and then X you can see actually does
know what X is so it's always best to
put everything inside of that
immediately invoked function expression
another thing that I noticed when I was
looking through these videos to get
ready to upload them to YouTube I forgot
a semicolon right there and also right
there
obviously it didn't cause an issue or
anything but just probably a good thing
to keep that in there we can get rid of
this variable and just kind of clean up
a little bit save it and that's it for
the immediately invoked function
expression that's all I got for you guys
in this video hopefully in the next
video I got some more great content for
you guys to consume I will see you then
thank you guys so much for watching
peace oh I totally almost forgot that
article I was gonna share with you guys
is right here just look up this title
Stack Overflow it has some really great
answers that will help you out on the
details of what I was just trying to
explain so that is all for real this
time thanks guys I'll see you in the
next video be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
