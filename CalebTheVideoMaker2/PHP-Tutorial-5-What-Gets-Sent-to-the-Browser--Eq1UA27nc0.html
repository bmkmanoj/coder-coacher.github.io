your fifth PHP tutorial it's been a long
while so if you're still watching very
good job but if you've disappeared I
mean I don't blame you it's been like
two months so yeah if you guys are still
there if anyone's even gonna watch this
in this video I want to talk about
sending stuff to the web browser so the
web browser I went back to so song that
is what users are going to view your web
page or program through so Google Chrome
Firefox Safari Opera Internet Explorer
so forth your custom browser or whatever
it whatever it is it doesn't matter but
um that the web browser is what's going
to render your code so basically we have
the server very first thing so this
little box here this is your delicious I
mean not delicious this is your amazing
server oh my goodness
anyways we have PHP code on this server
right and then this gets sent to the
clients computer screen and then within
the computer we have the web browser so
this would be like Google Chrome so what
gets sent well hTML is what's going to
be sent because all of this is on the
PHP code stays on the server so if you
don't know much about HTML that's okay
all you need to really know is that that
is how web pages are displayed the the
words you see and so forth you can check
out my HTML series if you so desire but
once this HTML reaches the clients
computer goes in the computer well then
this HTML is displayed on the web
browser makes sense so not only do we
have to worry about PHP we also have to
worry about HTML and we're going to be
talking about how things get sent
- ze browser browser
I'd be like Google Chrome or anything
used to surf the okay I don't know where
my eraser is guys okay no an old school
oh yeah I remember
I'm not having eraser duh okay so now
what gets sent to the web browser well
if you watch the last video I did a
little example I didn't really explain
it much but I used echo I think it was
this is a PHP command that you can use
and this is going to send something to
the web browser so we have this all
within PHP tags and then we have
quotation marks and we can say something
within quotes make it official now we're
in PHP cool so this is what we're doing
we're we're saying echo what are we
echoing hey so this right here this is
going to be sent to the clients computer
this over here that they're not going to
be able to see that so this is a command
that is used to send stuff to the client
anything within the parenthesis anything
between here that is sent to the client
may not really need any reason
I'll get like paper towel or something
after this so that means we have two
things to worry about
PHP rules and HTML rules rules like ru
le s ru @ yeah not like rol LS that be
like rules no not those kind of rules so
as you may or may not know when we're
writing a web page in PHP we can also
use HTML HTML just hypertext markup
language language I write way too slow
for this probably can't even read that
well that's what that's why HTML stands
for once again that those are the words
on the page well with PHP we can have
things within PHP tags and then outside
of the PHP tags we can have HTML so this
is an example of an HTML tag or I mean
it doesn't really matter what the tag is
it can be pretty much anything so I
could have I could have to do here I do
recommend you learn a little bit about
HTML before you go into PHP so then once
once we have that we could like for say
we could close this div here and then we
could open up another PHP tag whoops so
what's going on here probably a little
confusing well first we have a group of
PHP then we have up some HTML and let's
echo high if you can even see that can
sit hopefully gain and then we have
another group of PHP and I know I've
been writing PHP code but it doesn't
really matter this is just
now over here this is the clients
computer who's looking at your web
application we have a web browser ok
well now let's figure out the rules well
anything within the echo quotation marks
that's going to be sent this direction
right over to the browser anything
within these HTML tags so let's say we
say hey within these HTML tags between
here can we see it but it's right there
this is also going to be synth and then
this we're not really typing any PHP
code so that's not going to really do
much although now when we look at the
HTML HTML ignores the divs
although the divs get sent to the client
so basically this whole box of HTML gets
sent to the client whereas the PHP only
the hi is sent to the client why is that
that's because PHP is server-side HTML
is client-side so that's why we need to
draw this extra layer box that doesn't
make sense what's going to happen is
with the HTML it's going to send this
whole box everything within it to the
client so we are on we have stuff on the
clients computer now what is going to
show up within the web browser only what
was between the div tags because that's
one of the rules for HTML so anything
with within the div tags is going to
show up on the web browser so say hi but
it's not going to say did for anything
it's just going to say hi echo on the
other hand is going to just send hi but
what's the difference here all of this
over here PHP echo and the closing tag
that's going to stay on the server side
whereas all of this goes to the client
that means the client can access the
source code by right-clicking on your
webpage and clicking view
so what would happen if we did launch
this program and someone viewed our
webpage
well the websites going to look like
this hi hi this one is from PHP this one
is from HTML it's a little confusing but
it just takes a little practice and if
this doesn't really make much sense just
give some time start to start to make
sense now if you view the source code
here's what we're going to have we're
going to have div I and then we're going
to end the did but there's if you look
there's only high so what happened to
all that PHP code well as you can see
and see when I say it's server-side that
means it's not going to reach the
clients side only the high right here is
going to be visible but in the source
code the PHP echo and stuff that's not
going to be visible so that's the basics
of what gets displayed how do you know
what I said at the beginning of this
video yeah hopefully hopefully that was
helpful if it wasn't well too bad
