Caleb's video maker 2 and in this video
we are going to be talking about the
arithmetic operators and I know we've
discussed these a little bit because
we've worked with math and C but I'm
gonna try to give you a little bit more
information you know kind of keep you
learning things so to begin let's create
a file and I guess we'll just name this
yeah I don't know arithmetic operators
and in here we'll just write the
standard stuff
now the arithmetic operators there are
four main ones that you need to know
they're pretty easy
you probably already know them they're
plus/minus divide and multiply these
work exactly the same as in math class
they just might look a little bit
different than what you're used to now
this last character is called an
asterisk and you can find that by
holding shift and pressing 8 so I like
to call it capital 8 but I'm weird
now let's assign some data to a variable
using some arithmetic expressions so
let's get rid of this junk and we'll
give our variable some real creative
name X and we'll assign the value 2 plus
3 times 4 divided by 3 minus 2 this huge
complex thing here now this brings up
the topic of order of operations this is
the math II term to describe which one
of these happens first well there's
actually a computer science etern to
describe the same thing and that is
operator precedence so operator
precedence means the same thing as what
operators happen first each operator you
could say has a precedence over other
operators all right so let's try to
figure out what's going to happen here
multiplication and division happens
first and that's from left to right so
we start at the beginning and just start
going right the first time we see a
multiplication or division sign is right
here so the first thing to happen is 3
times 4 this means that we could
actually group these with parentheses
like this you can add parentheses
wherever you want as long as you
remember to close any parentheses you
open
now pretend that evaluates to some value
it'll be 12 so what we have is 2 plus 12
divided by 3 that division happens next
so we can actually group that just like
this addition and subtraction happens
after that so we start from the left and
go to the right 2 plus whatever this
evaluates to and then once we group all
of that like this we get that entire
value and subtract 2 from it
you don't have to use the parentheses
that's because the operators have a
precedence and the computer will work it
out itself but if you can visually see
what's happening with parentheses I
recommend you use them the output of
this should be 4 that's because we take
3 times 4 we get 12 and then we divide
it by 3 so basically these threes cancel
and we have 2 plus 4 which is 6 minus 2
which is 4 if you don't believe me we
can output this just like this we'll
save that let's compile this I'll put a
4 awesome you can actually use
parentheses in other ways for example if
we want to create a precedence that is
not going to happen by default we could
do that so if we wanted to say hey let's
do this subtraction first here well we
can do that first let's get rid of these
parentheses because we don't really need
them there it's kind of clear so I don't
think they're that necessary in this
situation so at the end we can add our
parentheses now all right so now what's
going to happen is any parentheses are
going to be evaluated first so we get 3
minus 2 which equals 1 then you're going
to have 2 plus 3 times 4 3 times 4 is
going to be evaluated as 12 12 divided
by 1 is 12 and then you add 2 to that so
your value should be 12 let's check out
14 sorry there we go now whether you
should use parentheses all of the time
or not is up to you if you look at this
and you think it's pretty clear what's
going to happen
then you're fine but if you think this
might confuse a co-worker or another
person looking at your code go ahead and
add parentheses here and just make it
extra extra clear now I'm going to
introduce you to a new operator which is
always fun so this operator is called
the modulus operator and it looks like
this int y equals 5 % - now you can use
any numbers you want and at first this
is kind of confusing I want you to look
at this and I'm going to tell you that
the value of y is going to be 1 and I
want you to figure out why I already
told you why but I want to figure out
the reason why is 1 can you figure out
what this operator does well I'm
actually going to be teaching that in
the next video so hopefully that
suspense will keep you ready waiting and
if you want to be notified of when I
make new videos be sure to click
Subscribe and assuming YouTube isn't a
but it will tell you when I create new
videos so thanks guys and I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
