organized all the book information it
all ties back to this you follow the bar
so to show you how they're connected you
can see this connects to the book
authors but it doesn't directly connect
to authors but authors connects to book
authors which connects to books
so these are technically connected as
you can see if you expand this a little
more and then it'll show these so now
I'm gonna move on to the next table and
I think I'll start with best friend so
what I'll do is I'll just close this one
and scoot it over here and I'm gonna
start with major and actually I think
I'll go with school right here school
someone make a new table oops expand
this a new window
and here is where you will put
information about the school school ID
because all the math to have an ID
everything needs an ID school name now
see we're over here it just has the
school nothing about the school once you
break it off into a new table it's
really easy to add information such as
school address which then can be broken
up into street address city state and I
just get rid of this one
delete
mmm-hmm then you can have type of school
which that's broad so what I mean by
that is like secondary school or like
college or post-secondary yeah you get
the point so that's where I live so
entries into the school thing will then
be tied back to the best friend so we
need to edit this and under school well
I'm sorry
we're going to change this
and then over on the foreign keys like
at school I'm sorry
ready just to school and then under this
column right here ties to the school ID
just like that and I always like to keep
all IDs and foreign key primary and
foreign keys with Lilly yd let's get it
up to the top okay as you know this is
for a college this schools will not
classify the college that we're
describing this is just side information
that's not directly related to the
College whatsoever so if you want to
label that somehow or scoot it off to
the side because the goal is College
information will not be tied back to the
school all right the next thing I'll be
doing is major and minor so I'm going to
make a new table and then I'll edit this
in a new tab like always or a new window
and I'll make it majors
would your ID use your name and that's
plenty of information then also make one
for minors
-
my ID my name right sweet so now over
here we can replace the minor in major
and if you remember how to do that I'll
give you a second to guess did you get
it right hopefully you did because all
we have to do is make four and key major
ID
my ID dragged these booths up to the top
if you want to select more than one
thing at once you can hold shift and
then click on whatever you want and then
make a foreign key major ID goes to
majors well then the column major ID
goes to major ID pretty simple stuff
when you when you first look at this
kind of thing it's like kind of scary
like oh man
learning this will take forever but once
you got it down it's easy trust me
so now you can see all these connections
okay now something sweet about this is
how it's connected to the students see
if you look at the students table it's
getting kind of crammed in here but oh
well you can see this also has a major
and a minor so we can do the same thing
for this by editing it in a new window
and I already have it open and replacing
major and minor with foreign keys it's
major Aggie
majors foreign key major reference table
major call a major ID major ID simple if
you keep all the names consistent it
makes it a lot easier
minor ID goes to the minors table
liner Coulomb goes to the other minor :
and boom now you can see how these are
connected both the best friends
major minor connects to the minor table
and major table and so did the students
so come back and see the next video and
I'll be teaching you some more
information and trust me it'll be sweet
so see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
