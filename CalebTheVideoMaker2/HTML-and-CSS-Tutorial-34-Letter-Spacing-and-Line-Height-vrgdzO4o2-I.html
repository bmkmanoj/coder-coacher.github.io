to talk a little bit more about
formatting our text within these comment
boxes and do you guys know how like on
YouTube and stuff and Facebook
everyone's like first comment but then
they're like not first comment I thought
would be pretty funny if I change this
to first yeah that's that's pretty
genius I know alright so we're going to
go over what's called letter spacing I'm
just gonna add more properties to this
selector letter spacing shows changes
how much space is between letters and
words so just type letter - spacing that
is the property and the value is a value
in pixels so it can be anything or
whatever you want let's try five pixels
and you can see now everything's super
super Spacey so that's probably a little
too high
let's try three so now the comments are
much easier to read you may not want
that so let's try to one of things a
point value point five I'm not like
complain about it now you can't alright
so pixels to pixels so I think that
looks really clear and easy to read
alright so yeah that is letter spacing
so just like we can make the spacing
larger we can also make it smaller so
the default is zero this is what it is
normally Act I'm actually zoomed in
quite a bit here so this is what is
wrong yet so I'm zooming in so you can
see nice letter spacing one pixel that's
probably good you can see it very
clearly but you can also make it
negative number so negative one so now
the text gets very small let's try
negative - oh yeah
Jim you Larry Bo Joe Swanson safety for
cats went so we talked that quercetin to
million I've explained timelines on
Shepherds on bike what up negative 332
all right okay it just makes it
disappear
so yeah let's try negative
let's go positive I think it looks good
so yeah that is pretty much all you need
to know about letter spacing we also
have a value we're going to learn that
is what pulls the element the next day
oh yeah line height is what it was line
height so this is very similar to the
letter spacing although now it affects
the lines rather than the letters so I
could say one pixel which is going to
crush these and oh man everything is so
smushed it actually looks kind of cool
but not not for presentable website 3e
oh that's a little better
let's try you know eight make it normal
okay not quite normal fifteen
we're hitting there we're getting there
hitting 20 all right so that that's line
spacing line height I mean I'm sorry
so that means pretty much beach line
this line so these see these blue bars
here we have one here so we have one
here and one here this from here to here
is 20 I mean 80 pixels right now so each
one of these blue bars is 80 pixels so
that is how we can display our comments
if you're making a easy-to-read society
I can say line spacing 2 pixels that's
actually I think one of the keys to my
opinion but then I could say something
like font weight which we learned in the
previous videos board now it's really
getting easy to read see on sides
it's just pixels that's even smaller huh
sorry I'm not very good at guessing the
first 26 so now you can easily read
these comments which look very nice so
that is all I really have to say about
these two properties we learned align
height and line line spacing you can
also use negative numbers if you really
wanted to so actually not for line
obviously because you can't go less than
zero and pixels when it comes to the
size of each line so like here zero and
then I think if we have a line with
negative one pixels that's impossible so
goes back to normal
Alliance paid letter spacing on the
other hand it can because letters the
default is zero and the default is this
so we can actually crunch those together
even more so negative one pixel which
lowers it down to less so yep that's
pretty much all I have to say thank you

youtube channel and I will see you in
the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
