be teaching you how to hide a file kind
of picture so let's say I want this to
look like picture but I really want to
hide this secret virus or whatever else
behind it who knows it doesn't really
matter it can be anything like music
doesn't matter so the first thing you
need to do is get WinRAR you can just
find it on Google that's WI n AR AR I'm
not gonna go through that because you
can figure that out alright so what you
want to do is right-click this and with
WinRAR you want to add to archive and
click ok so now you have a secret file
compress the winrar version I guess I
don't know if it's compressed but you
get what I'm saying yeah
so now you have a new version WinRAR of
the secret file so you just move that
side so then what you need to do is open
command prompt by going your Start menu
and typing in CMD it's command prompt so
yeah I know you type in this you need go
to where the files are located mine are
on the desktop - so - go there and type
in CD desktop which stands for change
directory I believe and press Enter
so now I'm on the desktop so from here
you just need to type in a small code it
looks like this now copy
/b and then you type in the file that
you type into picture plus the file and
then the third file so it looks like
this to the third file is what you want
it to be called when you're done tulips
dot jpg plus secret file dot rawr
and then virus dot jpg just for fun
boom get a new picture right here virus
looks looks like a normal picture and
like if you open it with Windows Photo
Viewer for example it works perfectly
fine but see if you work on open it with
winrar there's actually a secret file
clever I know so that's how you do it
and then you can do whatever you want
with it hot all your files and you don't
need hidden all right well thanks for
watching talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
