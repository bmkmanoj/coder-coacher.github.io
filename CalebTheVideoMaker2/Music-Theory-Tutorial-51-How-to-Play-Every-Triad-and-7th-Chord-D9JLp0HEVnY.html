to be a quick review of everything we
went through with the seventh courts
basically I've built the basis of the
major minor diminished and augmented
triads and I'm going to show you
actually I don't do the Augmented once
so forget us even said that there's no
augmented 7th chords we can figure out
the 7th chords from these so the very
first one was a major 7th chord here's
the formation of a major triad major
minor so we can guess if we wanted to be
major triad week I mean major 7th chord
we can add a major on top of it so this
will give us the major 7th now major
plus a minor if we want to have a what's
called a dominant 7th we can add a minor
which will give us the made another
dominant 7th so like you just see a 7
after things so summon and then we can
have the minor major which is the
formation of a minor triad we can add a
minor to that and get the minor 7th
minor minor 3rd that will give us if we
if we put a major here to be half
diminish to put a minor it'll be fully
diminished so let's put a major that
will give us one half diminished minor
minor minor will give us fully
diminished so here are all of the 7th
chords so I recommend you learn these I
recommend you memorize these and also I
recommend you learn these and memorize
them so yeah let's try creating one of
these and showing how each one kit it
how it can be altered so let's create a
major 7th try not try out 7th chord keep
same try it for some reasons we're gonna
start on C so here's the seed
all right so here is our major seventh
chord from here to here is a major third
minor third major third so this will
create a major 7th chord now if we flat
this note it becomes a dominant seven
right so then the next one we had was
minor which actually flattens this note
so it's minor major and then minor again
I believe so we're starting on C we take
a major third I mean for the minor scale
we're gonna take a minor third so it'll
take us to here then a major third one
two three four which will put us to G
and then one two three which was a
b-flat so that's exactly what we have
here now let's make a half diminished
which would be minor minor major C one
two three or a flat one two three G flat
so basically we're just going to flat
this note and then a minor four major
from this one two three four
B flat exactly like that now if we
wanted to create a fully diminished all
we have to do is my lower this one a
half step because a mmm fully made fully
diminished is minor minor minor whereas
a half diminished is minor minor major
the only difference between a major and
a minor you would see that wrong the
only difference between a major to minor
is only one half-step so we know all we
have to do is shrink that so basically
the process was we had it like this
which created a major seventh we added a
flat which created a made a dominant
seventh then we flatted this note which
made it minor flat of this note note
which made it half diminished double
flat of this note which made it fully
diminished so hopefully that makes sense
and now we're going to move on
to some more cool practice and stuff so
I'll see you then thank you for watching
