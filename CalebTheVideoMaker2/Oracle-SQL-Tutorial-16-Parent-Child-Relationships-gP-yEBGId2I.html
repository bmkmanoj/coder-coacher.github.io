your oracle SQL tutorial series this
video we are going to be talking more
about foreign keys now I know we've
discussed these a lot but I really want
to make sure we really grasp how to
design these and I also want to
introduce a new topic to you guys which
is known as parent-child relationships
so that's the goal of this video
hopefully by the end we'll understand
foreign keys and hey maybe they won't be
so foreign after all so as a reminder a
foreign key is just a column that forces
every row to have a value for that
column that matches a value in a
different goal often these will point to
a primary key but they can also point to
a unique constraint column so to best
walk you through this content we're
going to think of a little example we've
been using a user table a lot just
because it's really easy to
conceptualize essentially it's a table
that stores information about different
user accounts and let's say we're
building some kind of platform where
people can make service requests now
what the heck is a service request
doesn't really matter let's just pretend
like it's for a software company and if
something's not working right they can
make a service request that means we're
going to have some kind of structure
that looks like a table here for users
and then a table here for service
requests and you can think of these as
blueprints these are kind of the formula
on how to create instances so the table
has columns and when you create an
instance you have to provide a value for
each one of those columns so an instance
is essentially a row within a column now
with foreign keys if you have a row like
a service request and it points to a
user who created that service request
that's a great example of a foreign key
so just for clarity I'm going to write
the tables in here what this all means
is that a particular service request it
will have something like a user ID
column and that column has to have a
value that exists and the users user ID
table essentially the service request
needs
creator that means it has to be someone
in the user table that's all that means
so what should we use for the foreign
key well it has to be either the primary
key or a unique constraint so just for
fun let's use a user name so let's say
this is a system where every account
gets a user name and that column has a
unique constraint so then we have a user
and we'll just give them a super mature
nice user name Yolo swag man so if we
had a service request and it had a user
name that referenced the users table
that user would have to exist so we
could have Yolo swag man in here and
this would point to this user name this
is the perfect example of a parent-child
relationship the foreign key is the
child and what it references is the
parent it's often helpful to draw this
in like a up to down illustration here's
the parent and here are the children oh
how cute what a family tree that is so
these are all service requests and this
is the user and we're talking about
specific instances so this would be like
yoloswag and this will be his his three
service requests now I have a question
for you looking at this picture does the
username column of the service requests
table have to be labelled unique I'll
give you a second to think about it
alright seconds up the answer is no that
would not make sense because that means
we could only have one child per parent
and in this picture that's not the case
these would all reference yoloswag man
that wouldn't make sense in this
situation now we can do that if we want
if we did do that we would only allow
one service request I have another
question for you do children
automatically have the not null column
attribute for the foreign key think
about it for just a moment
okay time's up the answer is also know
essentially what that means is that we
could have an orphaned child I know it's
sad but that's style databases work so
in this situation we have a service
request from nobody nobody made this
service request in this application this
does not make sense any service request
would need someone to post that service
request so even though we can have
orphaned children doesn't necessarily
mean we should we don't want to in this
situation so for that column we have to
think about what attributes we want to
apply to that call what constraints does
it need
well we don't want it to be unique but
we do want it to be not null because
that means every single one has to have
a parent the seems very conceptual and
maybe not super practical but this
actually does come in a lot for example
if you try to break the rules of foreign
keys Oracle might yell at you and tell
you you're trying to make a child to a
parent that doesn't exist or something I
don't know like the exact words they use
but this will come up all you got to
really remember is that the foreign key
is the child and I always try to think
of it in this family tree kind of way so
it goes along with the whole family idea
but if you have a better way of thinking
about it go for it it's all about what
works best for you so now we got the
concepts down let's apply this stuff
practically in the upcoming videos
thanks guys please be sure to subscribe
really really appreciate that see you
guys in the next video and don't forget
