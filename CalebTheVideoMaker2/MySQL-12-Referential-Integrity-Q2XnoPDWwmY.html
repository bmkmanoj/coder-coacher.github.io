tutorial series I'm Caleb from Caleb the
video maker - this video is going to be
discussing referential integrity this
has to do with foreign keys referencing
other columns so only how a foreign key
we could say it's a reference to another
call and we need to protect our
references integrity what does that mean
though it means we have to tell the
database that this is a foreign key so
this is something we have to explicitly
do meaning there's no conventions that
go on that automatically connect columns
or anything like that any kind of
connection across tables or across
columns we have to tell the database
explicitly if you don't tell the
database huh you might think that's fine
we can just pretend there's a connection
right let's say you don't want to use
foreign keys for some reason so you have
this number over here this ID for
example and then you reference that ID
but you don't tell the database that
there is a reference then these are
separated you can't draw the line
between the two and what that means is
that there's no restrictions on the data
you're allowed to use so for example I
could make a reference to 198 and even
though there's not a 198 over here
that's okay that's because the database
doesn't know any better to the database
it's just a number it also means we can
just get rid of this row and the
database isn't going to care this 37 is
still going to exist over here this
throws our references integrity into
question because we can have a reference
but we don't know if it actually points
to anything for example this one it
points nowhere so how are we supposed to
know which ones point somewhere which
ones don't point anywhere that's what
I'm talking about with integrity if you
don't have data integrity you can't
trust your own data and if you can't
trust your own data your database is not
worth anything there might be a little
arch but seriously get your data
integrity we need to tell the database
explicitly using the foreign key
constraint we'll get into the syntax on
how to do all that soon but just know
for now that when there is some kind of
reference you have to do it manually you
have to tell the database what column
from what table
you are referencing in addition to just
telling it what is referencing what you
can do stuff such as on delete and on
update essentially what these mean is
what happens if we delete the parent or
change the parent to a different ID
which by the way should never happen but
in theory let's say it happens these are
things you can configure with your
foreign key constraint and we'll get
into how to do all that in an upcoming
video but for now I think that's good
I'm sure you guys understand what
referential integrity is it's when your
reference can be trusted you know it
references something you know it's up to
date and you know it's referencing the
correct thing that's what we strive for
it's impossible to perfect integrity in
a database but we can get pretty darn
close so that's what we're going for
