video I'm going to be going over
something quite new so this it's not
completely new but we're going over
select drop-down boxes it will look
something like this when we are done
it'll have the month the day and the
year of what you were born to select
your birthday for something and believe
it or not this actually can take a lot
of work to get this done so we're good
I'm going to explain what we need to do
we have to add select drop-down menus so
that's really not too hard I can get rid
of that sorry so let's get some space
here so we can see okay probably too
much space now and I'm going to put
everything in a paragraph and this
paragraph is going to ask for the
birthday pretty much yeah and then we
have labels and a select this is to make
a select drop down menu like this over
here here is how you do that I'm going
to zoom in so you can see really good
this box right here you see we're going
to create that here so you select is
equal I mean select name I'm sorry is
equal to let's do let's do the month
first awesome and then we can end that
select and then we create the end via
closing select tag and then we close the
label now within this select as you can
see I'm going to refresh so all this is
going to disappear we get this little
box but it doesn't do anything so in
order for it to do something we have to
add an option within it so yet option
and then we can end that option so
anything I post in here shows up if i
refresh it shows up you see so that's
that's good and all
though we still need to tell HTML the
value of the option so month January put
those in double quotes so this will make
the first month and then I'm going to
change this value to January so people
know to click that refresh
should I screw up somewhere so I
accidentally deleted the end of the
select thing right here all right so now
option I don't even know what happened
I'm sorry
option value equals January January I
think I actually deleted some of it so
the tips so this is what we have now
January that's cool and all so this is
our first select box awesome so if we
want to add another option we can just
just to make it easier we can make all
12 option boxes 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 I'm
doing that by pressing control D and
then I can put February March March
April April
you can choose to capitalize these or
now I'm going to uncap realize them May
Hey sorry this is taking forever
told you it would July July on August I
think that's what right September
October November November and finally
December December so now here's what we
have it's pretty awesome pretty
good-looking drop-down menu although it
goes upward if we zoomed out it would
pro yeah there we go there goes
downwards so if you're zoomed in far
enough it goes upward just because it
does have anywhere to display going down
all right so now let's create the next
one P actually no we're going to keep
this all within one paragraph so we can
basically copy the form above us label
select name equals Day birth date no
that's good day and then we end the
select and the label so within here we
get the options option and value equals
some yeah you get the plan I'm not gonna
put December but and the option now I'm
going to generate a list of numbers
between one two 3101 to 3163
basically I sign one to a variable this
should be 32 by I signed one to a
variable and while one is less than 32 I
want to echo which is basically print
out this right here but instead of
putting a certain number i want to pry
out the variable and each time add one
to it so that's kind of complex
especially if you don't know PHP but
basically it's going to echo each option
so when I go to this page which I can
access localhost forward slash validate
form data dot PHP and then I view the
page source I can see all of the options
values so I'm going to do the same thing
with the ear just to speed things up so
you don't to watch me make a hundred
years all right I have a source code now
we just need to create another Select so
I'm going to shrink this so I can copy
off the top one very easily and I don't
want to go below the paragraph tags once
again so label select name equals here
then we put the option values and stuff
then we end it select and the label so
that is basically how you make this and
then I'm gonna paste this code right
here and let's take a look at our page
boom we now have an awesome drop-down
menu for the birthday I want to do one
other thing I want to put the submit
button below it because that would make
more sense so I'm gonna copy this and
paste it down here and I'm gonna delete
it I could have just cut it well so now
we have our new and a newly our new and
improved form so thank you for watching
and I know I know your guys probably
thinking wow that PHP is really awesome
well heads up I'm probably making a
series over it so be sure to subscribe
thank you and I will see you in the next
