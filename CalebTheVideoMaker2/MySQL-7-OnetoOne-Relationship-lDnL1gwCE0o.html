series we are going to be moving on to
one of my favorite topics relationships
relationships are created when we have a
column that references another column in
a database this is what's known as a
foreign key a column is a foreign key if
it references another column and that
column it references has to be either a
primary key or have the unique attribute
when we do this we create a relationship
this is a relationship because we have
multiple tables and they are related in
somehow in some way and somehow really
now there are actually three types of
relationships now we can only store
these two in a database this one we
actually have to manipulate into and you
guys want to know about that I'll make
you wait till we start talking about
many to many relationships in the
upcoming video in the meantime we are
going to focus on one-to-one
relationships one-to-one relationships
are actually very easy to understand all
it is is an attribute that describes an
entity now if you don't remember what
actually you an entity is go watch the
previous videos where I talk about
terminology for databases because that's
all foundational to what we're talking
about here an example of this might be a
user and a username in this situation
the username is the attribute that
describes the user and then if you want
to get more specific we could give an
example of a user and a username so
here's a user and his user name might be
Caleb 1 2 3 that specific username
exclusively describes that specific user
if we have this other guy over here he's
not going to get that sweet name he's
gonna have to come up with something on
his own
good luck though because you cannot
compete with Caleb 1 2 3 now that we
understand that a one-to-one
relationship is simply an attribute that
describes an entity how do we store this
well how do we normally store attributes
it's simple we just store it as a column
inside of a table the table is
designated for that entity so we'd have
like a user table and one of the columns
would be whatever the attribute is in
this case the user name so we could have
a user with the idea
seven and the username caleb one two
three you're not limited to just doing
this over one table you can have
one-to-one relationships over different
tables you just have to remember that
you need to use the unique constraint so
if we had another table over here we
could reference the user ID for example
and then what we would do is label this
as unique and that means this column is
exclusive in that each row references
only one ID for example seven we could
not have another seven that would be
against the rules
so that kind of sums up how to design
one-to-one relationships you either have
it as a column inside of a table that
describes that entity the user table
would be that entity right here and the
column would be the attribute describing
that entity or you can have it over
multiple tables you just have to
remember you need to use the unique
constraint to force a one-to-one
relationship if you don't use the unique
constraint you create what's known as a
one-to-many relationship which we will
talk about in the next video so that's
all for this thank you guys for watching
