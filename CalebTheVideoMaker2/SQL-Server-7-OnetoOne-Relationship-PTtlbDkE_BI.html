now I'm back so what are we talking
about today we're talking about
relationships straight-up dating advice
from Caleb the video maker - here it is
good luck
that's all I got psyche guys you know
what I'm talking about database design
relationships oh man
that joke never gets old so we are going
to be talking about one-to-one
relationships now there are three types
of relationships one-to-one one-to-many
and many-to-many and we are going to
dissect all of these in the upcoming
videos and each one has a certain way
you're supposed to design it therefore I
think it's appropriate to separate them
out into their own videos so that way
I'm not overwhelming you I thought I
could discuss all of this in one video
one time and the video was 30 minutes
long so I decided it's probably good you
know break things up a little bit so
let's go through an example of a user
and a username and just to follow the
whole theme of relationships let's go
for an animal dating site no kidding I
thought of the most ridiculous example
and I planned a whole series around it
and then I looked it up and these things
actually exist this might actually be
practical for something anyways this
website animals can go on and obviously
they might need some help from their
owners but they can create an account
they'll have a username and they can
date other animals so a user has a
one-to-one relationship with a user now
this is talking about database design
relationships the username is exclusive
to the user meaning that if your
username is sexy chick one two three get
it because it's it's an animal dating
site chick and then this
I can't draw chicken this is the chicken
like this username is referring to there
is a level of exclusivity here and that
this chick doesn't have two usernames
and this username does not have two
chicks that it's describing now let's
compare a one-to-one relationship with a
one-to-many relationship and this we're
going to need a new design so we're
going to start with a a blogging website
so let's say this dating website also
has blogs right and you can you can post
your blogs on there now this blog post
posts the author's name up here so this
chick this is the most ridiculous
example ever this chick can write
multiple blogs but in this situation
each blog can only be written by one
individual in that situation this would
be a one-to-many we don't discuss one to
minis in more detail in the upcoming
video but essentially there is only one
side that has exclusivity meaning that
this blog is exclusively authored by one
person animal individual entity would
have this one too it just happens to be
the same animal but it could have been a
different one it has one author now
until the next video let's disregard
one-to-many relationships and let's
focus on how to design one-to-one
relationships in a database one-to-one
relationships are the easiest ones to
design that's because you only need one
table to do it this brings us back to
the terms entity and attribute in this
situation the entity is the users and
the attribute is the username so we can
just have a user table and one of the
columns could be the user now this
forces every user to only have one
username that's because when we enter a
new user we'll put a row we'll give it
one username and then the next user is
going to have one username and there's
no more columns for another username so
I won the one relationship you can just
think of it as an attribute describing
an entity
and you can store the attribute as a
column within a table that describes the
entity so for this situation we would
have sixes one two three and then all
the other data about sexy chick one two
three can go over here and a new user
would be a new row with only one user
now there is one other way you can store
a one-to-one relationship if you want
and that's to break something off into a
new table so an example for this might
be an image let's say a user can have
one image and that image is used for
their profile this image could be placed
into a new table called images and what
this will do it will separate the images
from the user just a little bit and then
this images table is going to have a
foreign key that points back to the user
what's the benefit in this will actually
just allow some separation you might not
want all of the images in the user table
just because you don't think it's
relevant or you don't want it stored
there or you're just trying to make
things faster anything like that now you
only need to use the images table when
you need an image not all of the time if
you stored the image inside of users
table like right here that data is going
to always be inside of that users table
regardless of whether you want to use
the image or not and that's just an
example either way would work you could
put it in the table you can make a news
table for it it all depends if you
really want a table separate for images
that would work fine
the only thing to remember here is that
in order for this to be a one-to-one
relationship there only needs to be one
image per user that means if you have a
foreign key every single row would have
to be unique so you have like 6 8 9 and
then if you gave the value 6 that would
be two images pointing to the same user
this would no longer be a one-to-one
relationship so to enforce that you need
to use a unique constraint and we will
talk about that in an upcoming video but
as for that that's all I got for
one-to-one relationships hopefully that
was helpful as always please click
