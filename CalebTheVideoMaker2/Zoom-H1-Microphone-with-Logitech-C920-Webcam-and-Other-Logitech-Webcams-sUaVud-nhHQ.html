bunch of videos about the launch tech
c920 webcam and I mentioned that I
record my audio with a zoom h1 recorder
and a lot of people are asking me for
asking me to show the process of doing
that a couple things real quick there's
probably better microphones out there so
if you're looking for a top-line
microphone this this might not be it
they probably have newer ones out but it
is a pretty decent microphone if it's
what you have to work with the other
thing is that when you first get a zoom
h1 it does not have the firmware to
record by plugging it into your computer
and recording it with a recording
software which is what I do so I will
show that process how to get it from a
standalone portable mic to plugging it
into a computer and using it that way
but you're going to have to update the
firmware it's nothing that's gonna ruin
it or anything
I actually updated mine but I will show
you the process as best as I can alright
so when you turn on your microphone it's
going to give you a number up in the top
corner that is the current firmware on
your microphone mine says 2.0 because I
have already updated the firmware so to
update the firmware what you're going to
want to do is go to the website which
I'll put in the description and then
download the firmware drag the files
from your computer onto the card of the
microphone so the way you can do that is
just plug your microphone into your
computer or you can take out the SD card
and plug that into a micro SD card
reader which is way more complicated so
I recommend you just take the cord that
came with your zoom or find one that
fits it plug it in your computer open
the files for the microphone and then
drag that file into it once the file is
on the microphone you can unplug it and
then what you want to do is you want to
turn it on while pressing and holding
the play button so hold the play button
to turn it on it'll ask you if you want
to update the firmware to click yes you
press the record button twice and then
it will update and then after at that
point you just shut it down alright we
just updated the firmware and if you
want to check that at work you can turn
it on
and a little two will pop up there in
the corner goes away pretty quickly now
what you can do is you just shut it back
down you will want to take the USB cord
once it's off just plug that in make
sure it's going the right way when you
poke it in it's going to give you a
couple of options right here it says USB
card or USB audio you will want to
select audio you need to select it by
pressing the record button now it's
going to flash 44 by 16 you want to
click yes great now it's ready to record
using a computer program now the other
option which was USB card I believe
that's going to allow you to transfer
files from the USB to your computer and
back so if you actually want to record
with the computer program you will want
to select audio alright the next thing
you're going to want to do is download
the webcam software now I showed you
this in the actual webcam video but I
hope the heck I'm I'll show you again so
you want to go to this link or just go
to Logitech and then find their software
or whatever and then you want to scroll
down and then you will want to go to
downloads or you just click uh downloads
right here take you there and then
there's logitech webcam software and
you're going to want to click download
and you're going to want to install that
which I'm sure you guys can figure out
so now once that's installed him just
let me just cancel that
just kidding it's not working so I'll
just X out of that yes you want to open
it
Logitech webcam software this is what it
looks like you want to click quick
capture oh now let's go home you guys
see me that's me alright I don't know if
the audio is gonna line up with this
video because I'm not actually recording
but we'll see so the actual thing you
want to do now is you want to click
controls so I'm what you're seeing is
the Logitech c920 and then for the
microphone rather than using the c920
microphone you want to click the h1 now
in order for that to show up you have to
plug it in and click audio like I showed
you in the last step you want to select
that and then what you're going to want
to do is
you want to do a test so you record okay
timer hey guys what's going on and then
you want to stop it then what you're
going to want to do is you're gonna
watch it so that is how you use the
Logitech c920 with the h1 zoom
microphone do you have any questions
comments concerns or suggestions for
future videos or how I can improve my
channel please leave a comment and also
if you haven't already please be sure to
subscribe because I'm gonna upload all
kinds of other awesome videos thank you
