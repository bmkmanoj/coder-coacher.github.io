gonna be about order by clauses and
these are pretty simple really they're
nothing to be afraid of just like normal
SQL go and you can see everything is in
a pattern that this is basically the
order you created things nothing too
fancy well if you need to change this
because if you have let's say a hundred
thousand entries in here and I do that
myself but I'm just way too lazy to make
that many and nobody else will do it for
me so I'll just pretend that there's a
whole bunch and you need to organize
that what we can do is a it's called
what you just do is say order by and
then you can say call and order by so
for example mmm last name cuz that's how
things are normally organized their last
name so basically we look at this and
now this is alphabetical order which is
basically a first Z last so ACCE J all
the way down to s so this if you need to
see things in alphabetical order you can
put it like this it makes things pretty
simple and pretty simple nothing too
fancy let me click Edit and I'll show
you this so select everything from
members order by last name what we can
do say the ESC and click go and
basically this flips everything
so now B's at the bottom SS at the top
des C stands for descending and the
other one is a sending so if I click go
you can see balls is back at the top so
this is the default a ascending
basically ascending means alphabetical
order or the first first and the last
last descending des C go flips it pretty
simple so let's let's order by something
else
birthday order by birthday so as you can
see this guy was born in the future as
of this time but that's okay hey this
guy was born in the first year ever ever
so I wonder if he knew Jesus but that's
beside the point
where'd that go we go if we descend this
click go we can see now that he is at
the bottom and he's at the top it's
pretty cool actually
so that's that pretty simple I know but
it's pretty useful sometimes so let's
say we're going to organize everything
by the membership status rather than
saying select all the members that are
gold and then do another one select
all the members that are bronze and then
all the members that are silver and then
all the members that are not a member
even though that makes no sense you can
just do this order by membership status
click go so now it is in descending
order alphabetically so yes and this
last okay well this must have been a
when you're ordering it it's the order
which you insert in the you know so if
it's like enum gold silver bronze and
then no one remember this I think this
is how I had it set up so gold was first
and silver and then bronze in the
non-member if you remember when I made
this so if we made this ascending which
is just the default so we don't have to
put anything click go we can see now
gold is at the top and non-member is at
the bottom so I actually didn't know
that when you're organizing an enum burn
enumeration it basically whichever you
created it in you always have like
something here and then
option here and so on and this will
organize it by the way you created it
and that's pretty cool so that's a good
way to organize it so we can see who's a
member who's an auto member this Caleb
all-sky is just messing everything up he
it's not he's not even a member and he's
messing up his phone number we should
just kick him out yeah delete yeah I
don't like him anyways he was a loser
well I think that's all I have to say in
this video and so yeah catch you later
live long and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
