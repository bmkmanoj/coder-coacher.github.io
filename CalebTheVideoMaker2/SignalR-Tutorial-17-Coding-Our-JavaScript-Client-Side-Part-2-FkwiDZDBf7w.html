all eager to get the signal are working
so we're gonna do that in this video
we're gonna worry a little bit less
about the syntax and won't get to that
later but overall it's not too
complicated so to start we need to open
a connection to the signal our hub so
the way we do that is put a dollar sign
dot connection dot hub dot start so this
is basically just making a connection to
signal our how do you know if it
actually worked or not well you can put
another dot and then put done and then
what if it fails you can put another dot
and put fail and then you end the
statement it's quite the long statement
but overall it's not too bad if it works
we want to run a function and if it
fails we want to run a function and just
so you know how I'm typing this out you
type function then open and close the
parentheses space open and close the
curly braces and it will format it all
for you so just make sure you got the
syntax exactly right because JavaScript
is a little more quiet about errors
we're at C sharp it won't even compile
JavaScript might not say exactly what
you're expecting it might not do
anything at all so just make sure you
got it exactly right now basically this
is going to open a connection if it
works it's going to run this function
and if it fails it's going to run this
function well right now these functions
aren't doing anything so where do we
tell the functions to do something well
we always tell the functions to do
something inside of the curly braces so
what we're going to do is do what's
known as a console log so put console
dot log and this is a method so what you
want to do is just pass in some data
passing the strings such as it worked
and there's another way we can show data
and that's using an alert which we
talked about in the last video so within
here you can say
error right so why did I choose to use a
console.log when it worked but only an
alert when it failed well the difference
between the two is that a console.log is
a little more quiet and subtle for
example if it works we don't need to
make a huge announcement hey it's
working and make a little box pop up on
the screen that's not what we want to do
but if it's failing it's more of an
issue in that case we probably want to
make a pop up so I just changed my
browser to Microsoft edge because that's
the browser I'll be using and now let's
give it a run and see how it works out
okay well it really didn't do much did
it work
I'm assuming you did that's because I
console.log the only way you can see it
is by right-clicking and going to
inspect element and then right here
there's this little console button that
is going to show us our console let's
give it a quick refresh and it worked
yes only like 15 or so videos in and we
finally connected to signal R so it's
been quite the adventure that's all for
this video and we'll continue this
process in the next video thanks guys
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
