we're going over new type of notation if
you remember notation is a way to write
music out on something
so that's notation we have learned some
multiple types of notation including
Holmes Helmholtz irony know how to
pronounce it still hold we look there is
tablature / tabs we have learned
scientific pitch notation and we also
learned the staff which is probably the
most common way so now we are getting
into what's called figured base notation
IG u our base notation and yeah so this
marker I found this marker actually
bought some too
so this marker start scrapping on me and
I'll get the ones that haven't been open
yet because this is probably really old
so this is figured base notation the way
this works is to represent chords and
their inversions so for example we can
have AC major chord consisting of C E
and G C major triad now when we write
what the positions of the notes are from
the route this is the route route then
we have a third and then we have a fifth
so now if we have the route and place
that there and then on top of the the
route we have the third on top of the
fifth on top of the fifth so now we know
the roots here thirds above it and the
fifths above it you don't have to
signify that the roots there because we
already know what the root is it's the
root we don't have to write root so
here's a way to represent
a normal Nolan inverted major triad cool
it so what if we invert this instead of
ceg we flip the C up an octave or
everything else down or whatever so now
we have a G C well we have to eat so
let's place the e here now what's above
an e we have a G e FG so we see that the
G is a third above e so we get a third
right basically we're just working from
the C major scale c d e f G a B so we're
on E
so how far away is the C from the e well
one count the first 1 2 3 4 5 6 so now
the C is a 6 above the root makes sense
so basically this is just a way of
saying C G versus e G C same chord it's
just inverted now what about the next
inversion if we took the e now we're
going to get G g c e g c e that is our
chord inversion well we start we don't
write well we start on so here we have
the normal then this is the first
inversion let's write the third the
second version over here we start with G
so here's G right make sense we don't
write what we start on for this type of
notation we just put what's above the
root and the root is G so what how far
is this note from gene so you take the
note we start on also known as the root
and we see how far the next note is from
the root Santa Steve
so from G to C we go G a B C that's 1/4
because it takes up 4 notes and scale 1
2 3 4 it makes sense so now we have 4 so
now we have the fourth above the G now
what about the next note we start on G
we go g a b c d e it's a 6th so here is
the 2nd inversion here's the first
inversion so now to sum all of this up
let me just erase all this crap we don't
write the note we start I mean we don't
write the root then we count from the
note and the bass and by bass I mean the
lowest note because bass is on the deep
side or the high lower-pitched notes
count from the bass
cool a so we have a normal chord which
consists of a minor 3rd on top of a
major 3rd so if C go a major 3rd up we
get e call a minor third up we get G
that's called relative measurement from
here to here now the way we're counting
this is absolute measurement so it's
like this C to e then C to G we're not
counting from the e so when we're
counting this way we would get a third
followed by a fifth from the see it so
now we have the E in the base for the
next inversion e G C now a G e FG it's a
third above an E so we get 3
what about a see from an e e f g a b c
fat six so here's how we represent the
first inversion of a chord now what
about the final diversion g c e g to c g
a b c it's a four g a b c d that's five
f wait
linkie so g a b c d e that's six
that is how we represent a second
inversion of a chord this works for
other chords too so let's try it with a
D major triad D major triad we have D F
sharp and then the other version is f
sharp ad and then sure now D to F sharp
is a third D to a is a fifth F sharp to
a is a fourth F F G it's a third now F
sharp D F G a B C D six make sense
that's a sixth from that sharp now a 2 D
ABCD that's 4 and F sharp a b c d e f
sharp six normal first inversion second
version makes sense if you really want
you can apply the same concept to
seventh chords so yes that's all i have
to say about this topic
so in the next video we're going to go
whenever something probably awesome
because don't we always so then I will
talk about that and then we'll move on
to something else and we'll keep going
and going and going and going forever
not really forever but it's a we serious
has a lot to it so I'll see you then and
I hope you subscribe thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
