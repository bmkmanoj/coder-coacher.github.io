video we will be discussing Google Drive
and Google Docs in fact this whole
series will be about Google Drive in
Google Docs now if you don't know a
thing about what this is this series
will be great for you because it's an
introductory series where we're going to
talk about all the basics and how to use
this awesome service so what is Google
Drive or Google Docs well there are two
distinct things but their websites you
go to and they are used to store your
data so you can put files in your Google
Drive so think of like a hard drive on
your computer well your google drive is
basically a website you sign in with a
google account you can upload your files
there and you simply store them there
they don't do anything there they just
sit there until you need them and i'll
get i'll go into the reasons why this is
an awesome thing but you also need to
know what google docs is so we have
Google Drive which is where we store all
of our files and then we have Google
Docs Google Docs is a platform that you
can use to edit documents create
documents and convert documents from one
file format to another file format so
for example if you go to school and they
give you a PowerPoint and you don't have
powerpoint at your house what you can do
is you can upload it to your google
drive account which is where you store
your files and you can open that file in
Google Docs as a google docs file and
it's going to be just like a PowerPoint
but it's going to be online that's
really awesome because that means you
can sign off and then when you come back
from a different computer even you can
still access your files now you get 15
gigabytes of free storage so this plat
this service actually is free now if you
don't really know how much that is it's
okay we'll be discussing that but that
is a lot of storage that can store
basically of years worth of documents if
they're medium to small file sizes and
you can use that as a backup for the
files you have or you can use it as just
a way to access your files from
different computers
i use google drive for basically
everything i do it because it's a great
way to manage my data it has a with its
connection to google docs where you can
edit all your files and stuff you have
access to spreadsheets uh you have
access to documents powerpoints or
basically uh slides is what they call it
and all other different features you can
draw on there you can make presentations
you can make pamphlets and you can even
install other custom apps to do whatever
you really want on Google Drive so
Google Drive is awesome alright so how
do you begin well the first thing you
need to do is you need to create a
google account so you come to like
google com and you'll come to a page
similar lists and you probably won't
have the same logo because they updated
all the time but you know you can maybe
try sign in once you're here you can
click Add Account and then create an
account and this is going to bring you
to the create an account page and then
that's going to be where you sign up now
it's kind of a long process you have to
fill out all this junk you probably the
verify your account either through email
or phone or something but it's really
cool because once you have your google
account that account can be used for
anything that is created by google so
you see here says one account is all you
need that's because once you create this
google account you can sign into google
the web the search engine Google sorry
Gmail which is the email service that
you get with your google account you can
sign in a chrome YouTube maps google
play in google+ which is Google's up
social network which if you don't want
to do that you don't have to you don't
have to use all these apps you can just
use google drive if you want and also if
you already have a youtube account you
will likely have a Google account
attached to it that you can use to sign
into Google Drive so i'ma soon use my
account so yeah so once you're signed in
you can just travel to drive.google.com
another thing you can do is I'll show
you in sec you have this little square
icon here which if you click that that's
going to bring up all of your google
apps so you can go to google
google search youtube maps play news
Gmail Drive calendar and of course more
but whatever now when you open it you
probably won't have this junk folder
that's my stuff all my important
documents so for example this is what
the dr looks like but we can add new
files by clicking this big red new
button that's going to open up google
docs now make sure you have the
distinction between the two it's not
super important but Google Drive holds
her files Google Docs creates and edits
our files in fact I'll show you real
quick Google Docs is actually a website
in itself same click docs.google.com and
it's loading now personally I don't like
Doc's I think it's confusing and they
just mess up all your stuff so I don't
use Google Docs you can access
everything from you can access all of
this stuff from your drive page so let
me illustrate this click new google docs
and this is going to be a new document
and we can save it just put in whatever
you want to call it hello that's gonna
name it and you put information in here
and it will automatically save you see
here it says all changes saved and drive
that's awesome another cool thing you
can do is you can actually invite other
people to edit files with you which is
really cool we're going to get into that
but then when you're done you just x out
of it boom there it is then when you
want at it again just open it it's
pretty awesome there's a couple of
things I want to explain real quick and
i'll go and more depth as we go in
through this course but just to get you
guys started i want to explain this you
can create a new folder if you want and
you can name that like whatever you want
and then you can drag files into that
and of course you can also import your
own files so for example i have a
documents page here and let's say let me
find a small file and i want to drag
that into docs so dr i should say boom
and you can see it's uploading and
it will it's done so then it appears
right here and this can be edited from
here you can open it to view it you can
connect it with Google Docs and then
this is what it looks like and there's
actually nothing in here yet so that's
another thing you do and you don't just
you don't just have to upload text files
if I wanted I could upload like a video
project right here boom so now if I
wanted I could upload all my important
files here and then we'll find you to
access them on my laptop when i'm out at
work or for school i could just go there
and get that now once you have one
people you might be wondering okay well
how do i download them well if you open
one you can go to file and then download
and then here are all of your different
options so not only can you use this for
uploading and downloading but you can
use it for conversion so basically I'll
get more into file formats and stuff but
if you have one file formats such as a
plain text file which is what I uploaded
and I need to download that as a word
file to send it my teacher or something
I could just do that and you can see
it'll start downloading and then I can
upload that I can upload that to my
teacher or just open it on my computer
whatever so you guys that gives you a a
brief overview one other thing real
quick is if you want to share this with
somebody you can click the share button
and from here you can enter people's
email address and say whether they can
edit comment or view now if you want
them to edit from here with their email
address if you want to put their email
address in here they will need a google
email address so gmail if you want any
money to just edit you'll have to use
this get a shareable link and we'll talk
about that in future videos so yeah
that's all I have to say be sure to
check out the next video we'll be
discussing on more things about the
interface of Google Docs and Google
Drive and yeah thank you guys for
watching I'll see you next video please
