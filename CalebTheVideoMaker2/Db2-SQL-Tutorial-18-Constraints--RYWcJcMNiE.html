maker - this is going to be an on-screen
video just talking about some of the
different constraints we can apply to
tables I'm kind of just going with it
right now so I don't really have a whole
lot planned thus if my examples are kind
of pretty awful I apologize ahead of
time the very first thing is I wanted to
talk about some of the column level
constraints essentially what that is
it's an attribute you apply to a column
that changes what kind of data is
allowed this is referring to domain
integrity so let's just create a table
and we are going to call this table
parent and you'll see why in a minute so
the very first thing you're going to
want to do when you create a table is
create a primary key which we've
discussed in previous videos but just as
a refresher you can do something like
this and then give it a data type we'll
just give it int and then you say not
null and then primary key so this int is
a data type that restricts the type of
data allowed in this column that is the
first layer of defense not null is
another attribute we can apply that
further restricts the type of data so
now we're not going to be able to insert
nothing we always have to insert a value
for this column and obviously the
primary key is going to add the extra
constraint of every value being unique
so this is an index and we haven't
really talked a whole lot about indexes
but indexes are an extremely important
part of databases and once you get the
database design down I'd say the next
thing to learn are indexes so when you
create a primary key you're
automatically indexing this column and
what that means is that it's optimized
to use this column for joins and for all
kinds of different queries another thing
you can do is just say unique so if I
run this you can see it works and this
is going to make a unique constraint
which also is going to create an index
so let's go to the administer and then
go to tables table Explorer gonna give
this a refresh and there is our table
right there so we click that go over
here to indexes and then there's a bunch
of information about this index here so
I click that and you can see this is a
unique index now if I go back to the SQL
and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
drop this table and then I'm gonna
recreate this without that index
now what I'm gonna do is go back to my
tables go back to my table do a refresh
and you can see there is now no indexes
on that table so when we add the unique
constraint we're actually adding an
index very similar to adding a primary
key slightly different the primary key
actually determines the way the data is
retrieved so to see that if we go to
this table users let's go to the data
here so here's some data we had in the
previous example often this is going to
be sorted by the user ID what that means
is if you go and select something by the
ID it's very easy for the database to
find it because it can just go to that
number rather if you selected something
by you know the last name well it has to
do a scan of the table so I'm kind of
getting a little bit off-topic on two
indexes but they're extremely important
and essentially what I wanted you to
know is that sometimes when we do a
little column attribute here like unique
we're doing a little bit more than we
might think this is actually indexing
our column but I'm gonna go back to
primary key now what I want to do is
create another table and teach you guys
a little bit more about foreign keys so
we're going to say create a table and
we'll name this one child and in here we
are going to have a child ID so this
will be in not an all primary key and
we're also going to have a foreign key
which references the parent this will be
of type int and I'm going to make it
inaudible which means I'm not going to
use the not null keyword and then what I
do is I say references and then I put
the table name parent and then in
parentheses I am going to put the column
name parent ID run that and you can all
it failed why did it fail I think it
might be because of the names so I will
name this parent table and then I will
name this one child table for
consistency and down here I will change
this to parent table okay create that
table and then create this table great
ha ha okay I got it working sorry so
this creates a foreign key constraint so
now if we go into administer
look at the tables get rid of all this
junk let's look for the child table give
it a refresh child table right there
what we can do is go to the constraints
and you can see we have a primary key
and a foreign key we're also going to
have an index because we created a
primary key so if we go under this
foreign key we can get a little bit more
information about it and you can see on
the delete it's no action on the update
it's no action meaning you're not able
to delete the parent without deleting
all the children manually yourself now
you understand a little bit more about
indexes constraints and viewing that
stuff inside of data server manager you
can also go to administer and look at
all your constraints here obviously this
is not gonna be nearly as helpful
because you didn't give your constraints
fancy cool names like the rest of these
in here what you can do that if you want
just look up how to do that if you need
but until then we're just not going to
worry about it because I think we're
doing very good thank you guys for
