this video we're finally going to start
working on the client side of our
application so we already have all the
server-side stuff and that's cool but it
doesn't actually do anything until we
implement the client side so over this
video in the next few videos that's what
we're going to be doing and it's gonna
be quite adventurous so hopefully you
guys are excited so the very first thing
we're going to do is run this
application so there's a couple ways to
do that you can go up here and click
debug and click start without debugging
or these your ways just use the shortcut
ctrl f5 alright so this is what our
application looks like it's pretty cool
I mean for the fact that we didn't have
to code any of it it's pretty awesome
but still there's some things that need
changed for example we're not going to
need any of this stuff in our
application so let's get rid of that
let's go back to visual studio and then
over here and the views open that up and
then go to home and then indexed OCS
HTML double click that to open it this
is where all of our code is that gave us
this page here so you can comment this
out or you can just delete it it's up to
you to comment it you can just click let
me see right there ctrl e comma C but
I'm just going to delete it so now if we
save that and go back to our web page
and refresh you can see that the the web
page is gonna be much more bland yeah
pretty bland so the next thing we're
going to need to do is type in some
scripts to make our signal our work on
the client side so you might think hey
let's just add a script tag right and
within here we can just put all of our
JavaScript stuff well this introduces an
interesting issue that's because the way
these web applications work and MVC is
that there's a layout page if you
remember it looks like this and if you
look through this and you go through it
you're gonna first see this this right
here render body so what that's going to
do is take all of the content inside of
the index page and basically pay
stay inside of that then it's going to
go on and then it's finally going to
render these scripts well if we put a
script inside of our index page that
requires the signal our scripts it's
going to throw a funky error that's
because if you follow the progress of
how it loads it's going to get to the
body and then inside of the body it's
going to request the signal our scripts
and they're not going to be available
that's because the signal our scripts
aren't loaded until down here so there's
a few ways to fix this and I'll be
talking about them the one I'm going to
choose is what's known as using a
section so to do that you can see it's
actually doing it right here render
section and then it gives a name of the
section scripts and says it's not
required well that's going to allow us
to do some magic so over here all you
got to do is put at sign and put a
section and put scripts open curly brace
close curly brace and anything in here
is going to be our scripts so take our
scripts and put that in there so now how
does this work exactly in the layout
it's going to first render the body but
when it's rendering the body it's going
to ignore any of these sections and
these sections are not going to be
rendered until we get to a render
section so now the body of the index
this up here which is nothing but let's
say we had an h1 up here this is going
to get rendered and then it's going to
scroll down here and finally get to this
section area and it's going to render
this and notice how this render section
comes after the signal our scripts so
that means it's going to work with
signal R now I know that's a kind of
funky setup but once you get used to it
you'll realize how it makes a lot more
sense and makes developing web
applications a lot easier so just to
make sure this works throw in here let's
make an alert
and just pass in hey it works
save that then what we can do is just
run the application it works yeah so
cool now there's one more thing you can
do if you don't like having your
JavaScript and your HTML kind of mixed
in you can create a whole nother
javascript file so to do that we can go
over here to our scripts folder and you
can see this is where all of our
JavaScript files are so right click
click add JavaScript file and we'll just
name this signal rjs right there and
then here we can say alert and then back
in our index what we can do is rather
than having a script tag right in here
we can reference that script and you can
see down here at the bottom is our
signal our script save that and go back
to our web page refresh yeah and it
works now there's one more thing I want
to do before we move on in the next
video and that's to take our signal our
scripts and move them into this script
section that's because not every single
page on our website is going to need the
signal our scripts so go back to the
layout and then take both of these cut
them using control X go back to the
index and paste them right there and
just so you know you can format it
nicely by holding ctrl and pressing K
followed by D and that will kind of
format things for you so for example if
you have all these messed up spaces
control KD boom fixed all right so let's
give it one last refresh see if it's
still working success now the only thing
we need to do is make sure that this is
working with signal are an alert is
simply not enough to know if it's
working with signal are so in the next
video will actually be connecting the
signal are and then we'll see how it
goes from there so thanks guys and I'll
see you in the next video
