counting is an extremely important
process so we don't get lost in the
music now when we're counting we don't
only count the notes we count the rest
so we'll count notes and we'll probably
count some s 2 so let's try it
we have full notes which are just very
easy to count 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
very simple and then we have half notes
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 then we have
coordinates 1 2 3 4 then we have eighth
notes Bob you G's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 so then we have 16th notes 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 oh you see it
doesn't just work out very well so we
have some conventions to help counting
I'll show you some of these so I'm gonna
count whole rest will just count 1 2 3 4
2 2 3 4 and so on
so when we are I'll get into that more
when we're counting half rest we do same
thing in quarter rest your notes same
thing because they're really easy to
count it doesn't take that much effort
but when we get into half an eighth
notes which let me draw 8 of them right
here
we count this one and two and three and
four and so now instead of one two three
four five six seven eight to be one and
two and three and four and one and two
and three and four and it's just easier
to count it because if we're going from
coordinates which are one two three four
one two three four one two three four
they're still a consistent ok I'm saying
so front 16 notes which add a bar to
that becomes sixteenth notes we actually
count these one-e-and-a two-e-and-a
three-e-and-a four-e-and-a we write that
out one E and 1 e like the letter E and
two E and three E and four E and so this
will keep the one two three and four
always on the same always on a
consistent tempo or on the beat you
could say in time so let's go from
quarter notes all the way to sixteenth
notes 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 1 &amp;amp; 2 3
&amp;amp; 4 1 e and a 2 e and a 3 E and a 4 E
and a 1 e and a 2 e and a 3 E and a 4 E
and a 1 4
make sense yes that's how you count and
you can count rest with this so let's
say we have we're gonna have a little
rest here that's my way of drawing an
eighth rest I know the proper way to
draw it would be that so okay that's our
pattern that that the way I can count
that is by I'm still counting this I
count one and two and I just don't play
on the two one and two and one and one
and two and one and two so you need to
count the rest it's very important most
people will just count when we play
they'll be like 1 and 3/4 and and that's
why people cannot stay in time with each
other or with other people so when
they're you're not playing you need to
be counting so when I'm not playing I'm
constantly 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4 pen you have to
keep the rhythm going in your head so in
the next video I'll be going over
something oh I want to go over more
thing so sometimes when you're counting
the same thing over again over and over
and over again it's hard to keep track
of how many times you counted it for
example 1 a 2 2 a 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; a 2 a 2
3 &amp;amp; 4
let's say I do that 40 times and be like
impossible so what we do is we can't
somebody came up with this cool concept
is to replace the first letter with how
the repetition of how many times you
count it so let's say 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4 and
the next time we counted it would be 2
and
two and three and four and then we would
have three and two bla bla bla
four so be one and two and three and
four and two and two and three and four
and three and two and three Street and
forth it's easier to count with
coordinates so I'd be like one two three
four two two three four three three oh
three two three four obviously I'm not
good at counting which is not a good
thing you know we're three four one two
three four two two three four - I said
two two three two two three four four
two four two five six eight nine call me
alright so yeah that's all I have to say
for now so I will talk to you in the
next video where I will be going over so
I'm really sweet called subdivision ho
it's awesome so be sure to see that and
