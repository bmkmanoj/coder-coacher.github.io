about naming chords and I know I've
talked about this some in the past but
I'm going to be over viewing everything
we've learned and also go over new style
so you may come across different ways to
write chords the most common is probably
a lead sheet where they just give you
the chord names with lyrics for a song
but another greatest common equally as
common way is on a staff so for example
right there this is AC major chord that
is one way to create chords is to write
them on a staff another common way is to
just say what chord they are G major 7th
for example or G dominant 7th or
diminished so that is another way we can
write chords and then we also can
replace the chord name or the root for
example the root is where we get the
chord its name so this this is set
called so this is said to be AC chord
it's the root or the note we started on
is there and that's where we get the
name from why we call it that it's
because we're building the chord from
that note so instead of doing that we
can replace it with Roman numerals such
as I 2 eyes IV B VI and VII so these are
examples of Roman numerals see I have
different letters C I have different
amounts of eyes or V's and I also have
capital and non-capital capital means
major lower case means minor when we
have an Augmented we will see a little
plus sign if we have a diminished it
will have a little Celsius degree
Fahrenheit sign
whenever this little dot above the note
is cold I really need to figure out
what's called because I keep saying
Celsius dot thing and I sound really
stupid especially being a teacher here
so that is another way I wanted to go
over a new type because that is
sometimes said to be classical or not as
common or not as useful as I don't
really see why I like this way but you
sometimes will see where everything is
capital I'm gonna go to red now so this
is said to be contemporary so this is
contemporary and it has all capitals and
the reason for this is because right
after the in the Roman numeral by the
way these are called Roman numerals
they'll say what it is for example dim
so a second dinner so the second scale
degree if you don't know about this go
see my other videos and then it's a
diminished chord or you might see one of
them Celsius degree sign thingamajig
East so why do they do this well this
can actually honest I don't even know
but you may eliminate confusion for
example you can have a second chord
minor and we know it's minor rather than
assuming that this is minor or rather
than having a celsius sign it's just
there so we know that this is a second
degree minor it's more specific and it's
quite common although I prefer the
lowercase concept now another thing is
you may see the eyes without the dots so
you may see like that that's just the
same thing as
this just another way to read it so that
is most of the ways we have learned to
read course we also learned the national
numbering system and this just applies
rather than having Roman numerals
we just have numbers which is really
easy but there's a problem you have is a
minor or major where you could say two
minor or you can anything any really way
to illustrate that so there's a lot and
lots and lots of ways to represent
courts and I just wanted to familiarize
all the ways we've learned and put them
into one great big video which is like
only like six minutes long but I just
wanted to remind you that this can mean
diminished
that's half diminished majors capital M
minors lower case in diminished lower
case D augmented is a capital A you may
see dim for diminished
aughh for augmented Maj for a major min
for minor and I think that's about it
then sometimes you will see extensions
to the court such as ad thirteen and
we'll get into that in a future video so
if you're getting all these fancy
freaking chords and you don't know how
to read them we will be getting into
that in an upcoming video so hopefully I
don't waste too much of your time in
this video because I know this was just
a bunch of review but I thought I'd
conglomerated all together so yeah
that's all I have to say see ya oh and
we also learned figured base which shows
the interval from the base such as three
five or three six or four six and so
forth this is most commonly shown to
show on versions but that's another way
to illustrate of course that is all I
have to say and see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
