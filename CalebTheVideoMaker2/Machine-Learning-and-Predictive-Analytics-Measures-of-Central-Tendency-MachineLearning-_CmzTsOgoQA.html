are going to have a small introduction
to statistics so if that makes you want
to throw up
I apologize I'm gonna try and make this
as simple as possible if that's exciting
great there is statistics embedded in
machine learning especially when we're
doing machine learning for predictions
and recommendation engines but I'm gonna
make it as easy as possible so all that
all the junk that you don't like about
statistics and math throw that crap out
because this is gonna be fun
so we're gonna be talking about mean
median mode and range these are formerly
known as measures of central tendency
statistics is now going to be cool
because we can apply it to something and
see why it's actually useful rather than
just numbers okay these are cool when it
comes to machine learning because the
measures of central tendency defined
what's normal and this is extremely
important with machine learning because
when we have that data set that's
actually probably not going to work for
processing machine learning and the
reason that is is because the data set
is going to be extremely messy have a
lot of stuff we don't really care about
and is not going to be a good
representation of reality and that's
what we've been trying to figure out
this whole time how do we represent
reality well very good ways to represent
reality are with the measures of central
tendency think about it this way if you
are trying to teach a computer to
recognize a cat well you're going to
give it normal cats to look at you're
not going to start with cats of weird
sizes you're not going to give it cats
that are missing legs you're not going
to give it cats that don't look like
cats or cats that are hidden behind
objects you're going to start with
what's considered normal now that's a
little bit more complex because we're
dealing with images but the same thing
can be applied when it we're talking
about numbers so for example if we are
talking about weight well there's going
to be a measure of central tendency for
weight
and that kind of defines what's
considered normal later on we're going
to take our data set and we're going to
go through some cleaning processes to
make sure that we have a strongly
defined measure of central tendency if
that makes any sense at all essentially
what that means is if we have a bunch of
data that's completely away from the
measures of central tendency we're going
to kind of crop that data off so let's
just define these real quick because
these are going to come up very handy in
the future videos and as you go on in
your machine learning adventures so the
mean this is just the average and the
way you calculate that is you take all
the values add them up and divide by
however many there are so if we had
three values you would take them add
them together and divide by three which
is going to give you the value ten which
makes sense the average is ten because
everyone has the value ten but if you
increased one of these that's going to
increase the average by a certain amount
so you know if you made this twenty well
now when you're divided by three it's
going to be a number bigger than ten so
the mean tells you the average the
median that's the middle value so that's
when you sort them so you take a bunch
of values and you sort them from least
to greatest and the median is going to
be the middle value symbol is that if
it's an even number of elements such as
nine ten eleven twelve well then you
can't take the middle that easily you
have to take the middle two elements and
then take the average on those so you
take 10 plus 11 divided by to get ten
and a half the mode is the most so if we
had nine ten ten twelve twelve twelve
this twelve would be the most so the
mode would be twelve range that's taking
the largest value and subtracting the
smallest value so we take twelve
and we subtract 9 and get 8 I'm kidding
okay let me make three okay we get three
so that is how you do the mean median
mode and range and those are going to be
extremely important in our machine
learning processes so thank you guys for
watching and be sure to check out the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
