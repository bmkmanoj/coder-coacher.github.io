explaining the inner join and I just
want you to ignore this for a minute
I'll be explaining that in a second
alright but first I want to explain what
an inner join is and that is spelled
inner join
wait ignore that noise can you can see
it but uh basically an inner join will
take information from one table and
information from another table and
combine it into another table for your
query result and it's only going to take
what's similar between them so let me
explain this a little bit further here
we had the tables the table uh customer
information and then here we have the
table strong item right here the order
so why did I overlap this well if you
remember let's say we have an order by
customer number 63 right and then in the
customers we could have a person with
the ID of 63 but let's say we have a
person with the idea of 73 and he
doesn't have any customers all right so
I mean he just sorry he doesn't have any
orders so what this does is it will take
all of the orders and all of the people
that have orders and combine them into
one so the people without any orders are
not going to be brought in to this new
table because there is no they don't
overlap
for example the ID of 64 will be in this
table and it will be in this table
that's why it you can see it's in both
tables so the ID 64 will be down here
but the idea over here 63 that's and
then 65 over here um 63 won't be down
here but if you think about it any
single person in the orders table comes
from the customers table because you're
not going to have orders by a person
who's not a customer but you can have
customers who technically I'm really
bought anything so it's kind of
confusing but you can you can come by
the store maybe uh
get
some samples or something but you don't
technically have to buy anything
maybe you're a you sell them stuff like
as a vendor right basically this table
is only to store people you need to know
it doesn't have to be customers so this
can be like a people-people table right
which is a horrible name that's why I
named it customers because most people
be customers so if we have a customer
who hasn't bought anything he will not
be in this table therefore he will not
be in this table right hopefully that
makes sense the chances are with our
table that every single person in the
customers table and also in the orders
table will be interlaced so you'll see
them in both tables but there can be
times when they're not right so when you
you need to tell MySQL which table to
take information from and this is
because you're getting you from more
than one table so you can't just be like
oh yeah I'd like the name because is
that an order name is that a person's
name is that a car's random cars name no
it's your pet's name so that you have to
use what's called a dot syntax or syntax
so on you say the table name and then
the column name so users period use user
ID so if we had a table users this would
be the table and then this will be the
colon and then just put a period between
them that's dot syntax so we put that
for the Select in this query this is how
you would set it up what you're going to
select where you're selecting it from
what you're joining on I'm so joining on
so let me explain a little bit more
we're going to select from the customers
the name the ID and all this phone all
this information and then to do that we
would put like Oh customers
and period and then any single column so
here's here's an example what we put so
customers don't use your ID
I mean customer ID and then customers
thought phone number and stuff like that
from this is what table we're getting it
from I know that's kind of stupid
because we just told it what table we're
getting it from but you have to do it so
from customers and also I forgot to say
in the Select we're also going to put
the columns that are from the other
tables so we are going to put not only
customer ID and customer name we're
going to put a customer's dot I mean a
orders dot stuff bought and orders dot
date bought and stuff like that so you
put everything you want to select up
here which I'm alright in it goes out in
the room and then from the first table
customers and then inner join we're
joining on the table orders see now this
it connects it now what does on me this
is where there is like a something
related between them like a foreign key
so where customer ID in one table is
equal to the customer ID in another
table this is how my SQL will know it's
the same person or same object by using
on so customer ID yeah you get the point
um where you did you would just say
where a customers dot customer IG ID is
equal to orders dot customer ID I'll be
showing you this on the computer because
it'll make it a lot easier to understand
and then you will actually see it in use
so subscribe see my next video my next
video will be over outer joins which are
little cooler maybe not cooler I don't
know but just subscribe and see you
later in my next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
