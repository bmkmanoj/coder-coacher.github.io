wanted to talk about logical operators
and I know you're probably sick and
tired of operators well I think they're
fun and you should too so try and show
enthusiasm because each time we go
through a new video we learn more stuff
and once we learn all this it will help
us program in PHP a lot easier so don't
think of this as mindless time wasting
because this stuff is very helpful
alright so logical operators are
interesting often times they're used for
conditionals such as within an if
statement so for example we can we often
use comparison operators and logical
operators within an if statement so I
could say 5 is greater than variable X
do this well I can also use a logical
operator such as not which we talked
about and say oh if 5 is not greater
than a variable do this which I could
just do less than but I'm just giving an
example so these things are allow us to
change exactly how the program is
working so there's four main ones here
that I have shared shared with you not
which we talked about so I'm not really
going to go over that anymore and which
allowed us excel and or and then we have
and not so both of these this can be
used like this or like this typed either
way so I just say you know both ways
that you will see it so it's important
that you know this is the equivalent to
this and this is the equivalent to this
just so you can see that you see it you
got it you got it I put I'm bringing it
down now Oh better pause it take a good
look now how do these work well we have
the end this is going to test if
multiple things are true
so five is equal to five and all caps
five is greater than actually five is
equal to the variable X and five is
greater than the variable Y well how is
this going to be tested well first it's
going to test this let's say and
basically the way it works is it's going
to see if both of these are true so this
is true to check it's true five is equal
to the variable X and five is also
greater than the variable Y then we're
going to do the conditional right here
so basically and is used to make sure
both of them are true and instead of the
word and you may cease to amber Stannis
I think they're called something like
that close enough that's another way you
will see it this is often used within if
statement quote a parenthesis when
you're testing certain variables or
values or anything like that because you
often do that to test for um data
validation such as oh is this variable I
mean is this value really what we're
looking for is this in the form of an
email
oh is this password really what they are
they trying to hack into our website so
oftentimes testing will be done so I can
say is the email valid and is the
password valid and is the that's all
valid if so if they're both valid then
sign the person in or make a connection
to the database to see if they're equal
the proper values in the database simple
stuff like that there is also or which
is very similar
we would have Oh gross sounded weird all
right we could have if the variable Y is
greater than the variable X I'm just
giving stupid examples I know they're
crappy but whatever or Y is equal to
three
well then if either one of these are
true
whoops then we're going to run this code
here so it's going to test this one it's
false so this one's not true it's going
to test this one and if it's true then
we're going to run the code it's not
then this whole code will be ignored
just cross it all out because it did not
pass the test so those are basic
examples of and and or we also had a
third type which if you don't remember
this right here XOR which is called and
not I don't know the way this works is
one of them has to be true but not both
of them so I'm not even going to make up
stupid stupid expressions so let's say
we have one here X or I have one here so
like five is equal to five or whatever
you're testing the username the password
it can be anything and we don't really
have any examples to use so I keep using
dumb ones but basically if this is true
and this is false run this code but if
this is true and this is true don't run
the code if this is true and this is
false run the code if these are both
false
don't run the code so basically one has
to be true but not not all like they
can't both be true
so this one's true this one's false
we're good this one's true this one's
false we're good if they're both true
we're not good
so both false we're not good right on
now oftentimes when you are working with
conditionals you will be testing a lot
of different things so you'll say are
you testing this and this what you can
actually use multiple hands you could
say and this and this so that means this
has to be true and this and this and
this and only if they're all true will
the test pack us in the wall it'll all
be concluded as true so that's the
basics of logical operators thank you
for watching and be sure to subscribe I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
