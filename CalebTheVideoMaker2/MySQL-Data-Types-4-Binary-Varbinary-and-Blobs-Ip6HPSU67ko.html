there's three types that we'll be going
over and that's binary for binary and
then what they call logs there's
multiple bulbs so I'm just writing bulbs
for now because I don't feel like
writing more so we'll go over binary
first binary is very similar to what we
already went over char the only thing
different is that it will take what you
enter into it and store it as it'll
transform it into binary and it does not
have a character set and a character set
is just an option of possible characters
that can be entered so binary is just
basically a bunch of ones and zeros that
computers used to communicate and
understand programs that are given to
them so an example would be get it a
little Oh but anyway so basically binary
is a byte string rather than a character
string whereas char would just be like
dawn as characters with let's say a
character set I was use this when I'm
referencing character sets utf-8 which
is a very popular character seven binary
on the other hand does not have a
character set because it's just ones and
zeros ones and zeros ones now when you
specify the size of a binary which is in
parentheses after it is in bytes not
encounters so if it's 40 that means
there's a 40 byte limit and remember how
with a char that if you didn't fill use
all of the requested
it would Pat it with spaces and then
remove the on retrieval when binary
removes spaces it just replaces them
with this which is just basically a zero
and then it retains them when you
retrieve them so it does not remove them
for you for binary it's sort of like
oops
sort of like bar char so it's the same
concept as a binary and chart just think
variable-length now now take what you
learned from var binary and binary and
apply it to tiny blob all the way up
through big blob they're sort of the
equivalent to text so we'd have text
here and the tiny text and so forth the
other thing is that on the character set
and they store everything as binary
that's all you have to know it's not
that difficult and remember I'll always
be posting uh extra information in the
descriptions below and also some links
to such as the manual which is the best
place to get this kind of information
and if you want to learn more about my
sequel you want to read my sequel manual
that's why I'll usually be referencing
everything I go over in the description
so you can click it and then back up
what you learned with the manual
information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
