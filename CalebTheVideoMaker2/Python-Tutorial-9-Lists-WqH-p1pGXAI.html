tutorial series in this video I want to
talk about something completely new
we're going to be talking about lists I
can't really say that very well list
sister anyways and a list takes a bunch
of related data and stores it in a set
so above above this cursor here we have
an example of a string and in this
string we have a chore list we have to
clean clean the room go shopping do my
homework recycle eat some food
eat some Fahd whatever that means and
clean my moon whatever that means
I was gonna try and type a room but it
came out as moon so you know it's cool
so this is awesome and all except it's
all stored as one giant value but if we
use a list it's going to take each one
of these chores and store it as its own
separate value and hold them connected
in a set as chores so how do we create
one of these we can just assign it to a
variable so we can say chores and use
the assignment operator and to start we
just make brackets within these brackets
we put each one of our separate values
within quotes and separate them by
commas so first one clean the room go
shopping do will see it forgot a single
quote do my homework recycle eat some
food
eat some fog clean my mum now we have an
established list now what we can do is
we can print this list so print sure and
it will list them all by the way I have
finally decided I'm no but longer going
to use semicolons simply because they're
not necessary I just used them out of
habit because I've programmed in other
programming languages so sorry for that
but yeah you don't need a semicolon to
end a statement unless you're putting
two statements on one line such as print
hey well that'll work but if we take the
semicolon out well yeah so I may take
this out real quick and it doesn't work
so yeah that's just some more
information so where were we
we just got done printing chores well
now this is a list and each one is a
separate value you're probably wondering
well what's so special about this well
this data can be manipulated we can
select specifically different parts of
this list rather when we had a string we
had to select the whole thing as a whole
so everything in this list has what's
known as an index which basically just
says its position of where it starts and
when we're talking about lists it starts
with 0 and goes up so this one actually
has the index of 0 this one has the
index of 1 this one has the index of if
I can grab it 2 3 4 so forth so if we
select a specific index we have to think
of 1 less than human terms because like
humans would think this is the first
item in the list and it is but it has an
index of 0 so yeah it's kind of
confusing but
oh well let's just try it we can go
print and then we can say shores and
then within brackets we can say which
index we want to choose so this will be
the second index so we already learned
that this has an index is zero this has
an index of 1 this index has this has an
index 2 so let's try it and it comes
back do my homework there are a lot of
other things that we can do with lists
and we'll be talking about those in
future videos and probably the next
video but I just wanted to introduce you
to the topic so you understood why
they're different than a string they're
different because a string stores at all
as one giant value whereas a list stores
related data individually and then
combines them in a set I also wanted you
to understand how to create one which
all we do is we do the same thing as
making a string except we put these
brackets and each individual value is
given within quotes now as for printing
it we can print the actual whole list or
we can print a specific index and you
have to remember that it's one lower
than what a human would expect so we
start at 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so forth so
yeah that is known as the index position
or basically just indexing of where it
is in the list so that's all I'm going
to be talking about in this video and I
will talk about more in the next one so
I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
