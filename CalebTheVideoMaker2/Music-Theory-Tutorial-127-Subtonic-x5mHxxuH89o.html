gosh hey guys and ladies how's how's it
going every time I talk he tries this is
getting it away okay so in this video
I'll be talking about
stop working oh I'm gonna go let him out
I'll be right back
good boy Gopi I'm sorry about that guys
where was I
we're going to be talking about the sub
tonic specifically how it's different
than a leading tone which is what we
talked about in our last video well we
will see both of these and the
difference is a leading tone has a
half-step where sub tonic has a whole
step so what does that mean in a major
scale we would have c d e f g a b back
to C well between B and C there's only
us half step wait B to C so it pulls
forth where as a sub tonic has a whole
step now let's go into the minor scale
see we have C D E flat F G a flat and B
flat back to C well now we go B flat and
for counting half steps we have B flat
to B which then goes to C that is two
half steps or one whole step so this
qualifies as a sub tonic rather than a
leading tone so this doesn't quite pull
forward as much and it's it sounds like
a bigger gap so if we're in
C major C minor would be
oh dang I messed it up but there's a
larger gap here and doesn't quite pull
forward as much so it doesn't sound as
fulfilling I guess
let me do it nay it's easier
still wants to pull forward so if I'm
like
doesn't sound quite complete and that
fulfills that unsatisfying feeling that
your ears give you I guess but if we're
in a major scale it's like way worse
because there's such a small distance
between these two notes when you don't
pluck that last one or press the last
one
it sounds incomplete and even non
musical people can tell something is
wrong with
it makes more sense
so that's just my little examples of
leading terms for sub tonic so when we
have a chord progression of an odd chord
progression oh not really I love chord
progression so we had the seventh scale
degree and I said it was the leading
tone well this would be VII it's not
always the case because sometimes it may
be the sub tonic so that's all I have to
say in this video and the next video
we'll be going over some more stuff like
always so yeah see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
