I wanted to talk about all the pros and
cons of surrogate or natural Keys so
basically we're going to compare and
contrast them here so over here on the
left side we got surrogate and then over
here on the right side we got some
natural alright we're gonna have a
little battle here right we're going to
figure out which one's the best in these
boxes to keep this important out here
alright so what are some good things
about natural Keys all right well first
one of the first good things about I was
really weak one of the first good things
about natural Keys is that you don't
have to define any new data if you don't
remember from the last video
let me just redefine them here natural
keys are used or columns used as your
key that are already defined within your
table they're natural to what you want
to store surrogate keys are just kind of
added like a user ID or a sub car ID or
a credit card ID or a comment ID their
surrogate they have no real world
meaning so natural not natural get it
cool so some good things all natural is
you don't actually have to define in new
data any new data I don't know if you
could hear me there and I'll kind of
stuttered on that but anyways you don't
really have to define any new data
because it's already within your table
and you can use that as your natural key
so you're required to store less
information in your database so you get
a smaller date you get it you have a
smaller database right so that's one
good thing so what's a downside to
natural Keys well the downside is that
sometimes you're not going to be able to
find a really good natural key because
if you look over here we want our keys
to be unique never changing and never
empty or null well if we have a natural
key we have to find one that fits all
three of these and it has to be a good
one that would make sense
as a natural key like you might not want
to use a combination of 20 columns to
make natural key but that's one of the
downsides to natural key is you have to
figure out what natural key to use and
there's not always a great option on now
optimally you should have a natural key
or at least something that can be used
as a natural key within every table to
best hat to have the best design to
ensure uniqueness not just by a
surrogate key if you use one but by
naturally what's being stored so like
just an example if we have a comments
table we could have a comment by a
certain user on a certain web page or
whatever and what what forces it to be
unique well the combination of that as
well as the day it's posted there the
time its post so that's going to be
unique because you can't have two
comments from the same user at the same
time on the same webpage it's not
possible right I mean unless you like
glitch the system some now which should
it happen well that's an example of
using natural peace on the downside like
I said you might not always be able to
figure out what to use for your natural
key that one was a good example because
naturally we could figure out a natural
key right follow me the other thing is
natural keys have real-world values
real-world meaning right so you have
connections to real world meaning so for
example in the comments the actual
comment in combination with the user who
posted it in combination with the time
it was posted and the page it was posted
on or any of those four columns to be
used as a natural key well those have
real-world meaning and as your database
develops over time the database
application might change or be updated
or new meaning is given to the database
and what it's supposed to do that means
that your natural keys could change over
time and have new new meaning or the
actual values could change
some instances and we do not want that
obviously because it has to be unique
never changing it never know if for
example we make it to where we do have
to change the natural keys well kind of
be like crossing this one out and that's
possible like we could update the values
of all the keys but that's going to
require us to update all connections
between tables and that's going to
require a lot of resources from our
server and that's just a bad design in
general so those are most of the cons of
natural keys so yeah let's move on to
surrogate right okay so it's surrogate
Keys well obviously the first downside
is you have to add and column to your
table no matter what even if you have a
oh yeah for example if it's naturally
unique well you might like if you have a
comment from a username well that
username is going to help ensure
uniqueness and you still add a surrogate
key well then you're adding unnecessary
data because you're adding a new column
and you have to store all these numbers
one of the pros of surrogate keys are is
that they're typically numbers where
oftentimes natural Keys can be words or
anything like that that's good because
typically numbers are easier to work
with but not always now a couple other
things besides the fact that you have to
add new data new column which requires
you to store more data it's that uh it
can be confusing sometimes when all
you're working with is just combinations
of numbers and have like we have a
column let's say like a comb enter for a
coments table and we just have an eye we
have the value like seven hundred four
hundred of 7460 - well this kind of
clear it's talking about the user with
the ID of seven hundred for 7460 -
sometimes columns won't be very
descriptive though and that would be
full and the designers so make sure you
name your columns right but when working
with other people you can sometimes get
confused exactly what references what
and you have to do a little bit more
and check the actual database structure
the way it's programmed or however else
like back so that's a couple things that
are confusing okay so now you're
probably wondering okay so which one am
I supposed to use well it actually it
just depends on what you want to do if
you prefer to use natural or surrogate
Keys but typically you'll want to pick
one and use that throughout all of the
database I set database really weird
there's like database I was like data
base rather than database it was like
database anyways
so like say I decide to use Sergey keys
that means every column should get a ID
or at least a combination of IDs natural
if I decide to use natural lungs every
column should try to be used as a
natural key because if we mix and match
sometimes we're going to have a
surrogate key sometimes we're gonna have
a natural key and it's going to be super
confusing we're not gonna know what's
going on so typically you want to kind
of keep one or the other the other thing
is I don't know what the other thing was
but yeah typically one of the other now
for my sake
I personally am going to use surrogate
Keys although that's not saying that
they're better in any way I just prefer
surrogate Keys because it's simple for
me because every time I make a table I
all I got to do is make an ID with it
too like if it's a user table
well like I do is make a column use your
ID and boom we're done that's all I got
worried about and I don't really have to
worry about it ever changing or ever
becoming something different or anything
it's just a random number seven thousand
two hundred fifty four well that has no
real world meaning now keep in mind
though that if you do use surrogate Keys
you shouldn't you shouldn't have them
have any real world value so for example
a student ID if we give these student
IDs out to the students that's not
really a good idea to use as the
surrogate key because it's actually a
natural key it has real world meaning
those are just some things and you can
find tons and tons of stuff on the
internet
about natural / surrogate keys it's
basically like a war between two
database sides where the natural keys Oh
where's the surrogate Keys up I'm gonna
kill you boom you know I mean to tell
you don't freak out just figure out what
works best for you there's some minor
performance differences but I mean I I
don't really know all of them so yeah
believe it or not I don't know something
I'm kidding but anyways try them both
out if you want look up stuff a look up
which one performs better or which one
will work best for your application or
your database because that's really what
matters right so yeah peace out check
you guys check this gosh I can't talk
today check out my next video and I will
see you guys then and what we learned
some other cool stuff so yeah see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
