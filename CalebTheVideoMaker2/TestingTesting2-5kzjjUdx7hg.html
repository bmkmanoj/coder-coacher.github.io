just wanted to run another little test
here so I give you full permission to
ignore this and walk away but if you
feel like watching it go right ahead
feel free to waste your time it's cool
so I just wanted to test I changed some
settings so I want to see if it's better
quality or if there's more skipping less
skipping or whatever and also like other
stuff so yeah mainly I'm concerned with
showing my screen if it's visible
because in the last video it was kind of
rough it was like it's like oh I can
sort of make it out if I can sort of see
if I like squint and like close one eye
and like imagine I can almost see what
you're trying to show me so I decided
I'd like shrink the size of my window
which might help things let's try so
right now as you can see it seems to be
a little better I feel like I can spread
out some but now it's been a bit more
larger and you can see up close to learn
about MySQL you click that and then it
has my at school lon and a list you can
read in the title then when you want to
watch it you just click it and I'll show
up at the top the only problem is it
ends at 50 hey guys fail i'll be talking
about comparison operators yeah it ends
at 50 so I need to figure out a fix for
that and I wanted to show you guys
something else that's like really trippy
it's probably gonna make everything
crash but let's let's do it oh it's so
pretty if I say something you can see
the dots at the bottom travel back to
the end into infinity see watch Powell
oh very cool all right I should probably
stop now all right well thank you and
I'm sorry about posting all these
useless videos but it's what I do
done like 300 some already so yeah see
you in the next one be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
