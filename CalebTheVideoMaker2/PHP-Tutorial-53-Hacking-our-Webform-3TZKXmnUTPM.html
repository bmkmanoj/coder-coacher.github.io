over something that I talked a little
bit about in the last video and that is
how we have another value for the sex
when there's really only two options so
we go to the newsletter and we have male
or female so I really think a lot of you
are going to like this if you like
hacking or cracking or whatever you want
to call it then I think you will be
interested in this so first let's look
at the script by itself the way we have
it now is that we're taking the value of
sex and assigning it to the variable sex
and then we're going to echo that back
out
dynamically by testing the value of sex
and you can see we have an option for
male we have an option for female and
then we have an else for anything else
well begin a beginner would look at this
and say oh we don't need that because
there's only two options here well I'm
going to show you how we can pack this
web page to be able to change that so
the first thing we can do right click it
and inspect element I'm using Firefox
I'm sure I'm sorry I'm using Google
Chrome I'm sure Firefox will have
something similar to this and so forth
but if you want exact I'm using Google
Chrome so as you can see we this is
opening our code that we created so yes
all of your code is public you can do
this on any web site you can just right
click it and inspect the elements and
with this you can modify the web page so
the actual web page does not change on
the server but it does change on the
server side I mean on the client side so
this input type equals text we could
change this to input type equals
password which is going to hide our name
and this doesn't affect everyone going
to this website it only affects us so
when we refresh the page it doesn't stay
that way just so you know well with this
we can actually modify
this radio button and change it to text
this means it will accept any value that
we want so I could take this and I could
try and hack this website by putting SQL
injections or pretty much anything they
want scripts pretty much anything like
that or just try another value that's
not accepted and then I can submit it
and it will tell us to enter a correct
value so that's an example of how we can
sort of game the game the system and
that's not the right phrase to use there
at all this is how we can hack this
webpage to allow different values
another thing is if you don't want to
custom edit this webpage you can
actually create your own webpage which
will send the content to that server
that a script so I basically just copied
the PHP code and put it on my website
Caleb curry comm and instead of using a
radio button
I changed the type of input of the sex
to a text so I can put anything I want
in here and put anything I want in here
so as long as I have the HTML I can do
this I can change the action so if I'm
on my website I would have to change
this action right here to this and then
it will take whatever I put into that
form and it will send it to this page
right here and we can see that in action
let me just do that for you real quick
so as you can see I have this page named
Caleb curry and I'm just gonna put
everything correct so just to show you
and then sex equals male oops and it
consumes submit and it will take us to
this web page with that value C and so
that's sort of a way you can infiltrate
other websites in a new way
so that's all this video really has to
cover hopefully it was helpful if you
have any questions please be sure to
leave a comment and subscribe now I got
to figure out how to stop this video
alright alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
