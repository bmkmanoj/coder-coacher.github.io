okay the mics on well welcome back
everyone to your sequel server tutorial
series this video we are going to
discuss foreign keys now I know what
you're thinking and you're wrong
foreign keys do not unlock locks from
different countries just get that out of
your mind okay this is this is databases
here foreign keys reference primary keys
or unique columns and primary keys are
also unique so you can just write unique
and that that includes both of them why
does it have to be unique though
essentially when we want to reference
data in another table in a database we
want to be able to say exactly what row
we are referencing so we have two tables
and this row on say these lines are rows
and this row wants to reference this row
it needs a way to say exactly what row
it wants and the only way it can do that
is if all of these rows are unique to do
this we need at least one column with
the unique constraint now oftentimes
this is going to be the primary key so I
would recommend you watch the previous
two videos because these discuss primary
Keys in-depth and we discussed that
primary keys have to be unique know the
word unique and also the word not and
all these are example of attributes
now when I say attributes I'm not
talking about attributes in the sense of
entities and attributes these attributes
here are a different type of attribute
so yeah totally confusing but just focus
on this kind of attribute for right now
an attribute is essentially an extra
detail we give the column to tell it how
to act
a lot of the attributes are also known
as constraints so unique and not null
our attributes but they're also
constraints now we talked about
constraints when we talked about data
integrity when we actually use these
keywords they're known as attributes now
you can call these constraints if you
want but just know that there are some
attribute
that are also non constraints and that
gets kind of confusing so I'm not gonna
go into a ton of detail with that right
now that's cuz just a little bit
off-topic still but the reason I bring
it up is that we have to consider what
kind of constraints we want to put on
our foreign keys so in this situation
this is the primary key and this is the
foreign key and the foreign key
references the primary key you'll make
this Association by column so you might
have one column inside of the table and
you say it references this column that
means a value for that column has to
match a value for this column so for
example 7 &amp;amp; 7 these values match this
one over here should always be unique
and we'll probably want to make it not
not two but these constraints are not
automatically placed on the foreign key
that means we have to decide do we want
the foreign key to be unique do we want
it to be not null that's what we're
going to be discussing in this video now
that were already like five minutes into
it to make the discussion of these
constraints easier it's easy to think in
family trees so a family tree shows how
things are related but you have to
introduce the concept of parents and
children when we're talking about
databases the primary key is the parent
foreign key is the child so rather than
drawing things this way we can flip it
this way and put the parent up top and
the child down here so we get something
like this now you can see that the child
references the parent and theoretically
the parent doesn't have any knowledge of
the children that's because the foreign
key is in the child table not the parent
table so within this parent table
there's nothing that references back to
the child it's it's alone it's
segregated it doesn't know of the child
so because of that I drew the arrows
pointing at the parent and not both ways
like that when we draw it this way it's
a lot easier to think about these
constraints first let's think of the
unique constraint if we use the keyword
unique essentially what that says is
that a parent can only have
one child from that column so if we said
unique on these children right here two
of these would be in violation sorry
guys that's because in order to
reference the parent you have to use the
parents primary key so we'll just say
it's a number let's say seven so this
child uses seven to reference the parent
and if we have a unique constraint that
column right here is not going to allow
two of the same values so if we tried to
put seven here again that would be not
okay but if we have another parent this
will might have the ID of eight and this
child could reference that parent and
now we're okay and it might make more
sense if you know we moved the whole
thing over there so let's do that this
is okay this child still cannot exist
because of this unique constraint now
what you also have to realize with this
unique constraint it's talking about
that individual column we might have
another table that references the parent
so imagine it's turning into one of
those crazy family trees with
stepchildren all that okay we have a
column over here that also references
its parent that means this parent could
potentially have another child but it'd
be from a different table so this unique
is only for that column now I'm going to
erase this a little bit so get get your
last image of it
now let's discuss not null we have this
previous relationship we have the parent
from this table one of the rows here has
an ID of seven and then we have a child
let's say right here who has the
reference 7 you in the foreign key
column pointing back to that parent but
now let's create a child every year and
when you're not going to make a
reference to anything so that column for
this row is going to be null what that
essentially means is that we have an
orphaned child as depressing as that is
you can do that in databases so when
would you want to do something like this
well if there's ever a situation where a
row does not need to reference anything
but some of them do then you would do
this it's kind of hard to think of
really good examples but imagine you had
a car dealership
my car drives fast and we are releasing
the cars right you might have a column
for Lisa which points back to the
customer well if a car is being
currently leased it would have a
customer ID such as 7 but if the car
does not have an owner then that would
be null so in this situation although
it's not the best example in the world
you can see that a null would be
appropriate so sometimes it's okay to
have orphaned children I'm sorry if you
don't like that idea though and you
don't want to orphan children you can
use the not null constraint or attribute
and essentially that is going to force
this child to have some value for the
foreign keys so you could not use an all
you have to say some value you would do
that if there is a situation when this
row over here cannot exist without that
parent think of like a comments table on
a video sharing website it wouldn't make
sense to have a comment without a poster
so you would obviously make the poster
column not null so that's a good summary
of attributes for foreign keys and how
to design those in the next video we are
still going to be discussing foreign
keys but we'll be discussing a little
bit of a new topic so thanks guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the next one thanks guys
