it is me Caleb from Caleb the video
maker - and in this series we are going
to be talking about database clustering
and managing those database clusters
with a tool called cluster control a
database cluster put simply is when you
have multiple computers that are all
used to store your data I've come up
with four reasons why database
clustering is a good thing those reasons
are data redundancy the good kind of
data redundancy and we'll talk about
that in just a moment
availability scalability and monitoring
okay I need a spell check the very first
reason I got is data redundancy now I've
talked a lot about data redundancy in my
videos and all throughout one of my
series database design I talked about
how data redundancy is just really bad
but that is a different kind of data
redundancy that kind of data redundancy
is when you have unnecessary duplicate
data that can then one can change and
one can stay the same for example and
then you have ambiguity because you
don't know are these two separate
entries or these talking about the same
thing but one of them is incorrect and
it just gets really messy and confusing
data redundancy when it comes to
database clustering is a little bit
different so with database clustering we
are essentially using three computers to
store our data well how exactly is that
data going to be stored are we going to
store a third of the data on each one of
these computers or are we going to store
most of the data on one and then just
some more important stuff on the others
or what well actually we are going to
have the synchronized to where all of
the computers store the same information
that's a great thing because if one of
these computers blows up well you've
still got two copies of the data so this
data redundancy is not a bad thing
because everything is going to be synced
or synchronized what that means is as
soon as there's a change on one of these
computers that change is going to
propagate to all of the computers inside
of this cluster the data being synced
this way gets rid of the risk of
ambiguity because all of the data is
going
the same data redundancy is one of the
features you're not going to be able to
get if you're just using a standalone
computer for all of your data because
then if this computer blows up goodbye
all your data or you're going to have to
get regular backups and store them on a
hard drivers or on something else but we
don't want to do all that extra stuff we
just want it so where if something
catastrophic happens the data is not
going to be delete and we don't have to
worry about backing up data and all that
stuff I mean obviously you should still
backup your data but there is a whole
new layer of protection when you have a
cluster now when it comes to scalability
so thing on most particularly interested
in is load balancing what a load
balancer does is it will take all of the
incoming traffic and then what it will
do so let's say there's a big bubble is
our load balancer what the load balancer
will do is it will appropriately direct
where the traffic should go to which
notice should go and the benefit of that
is well there's only one communication
point to the database cluster right here
so it's easier for the programmer the
second thing is that the load balancer
is not going to tax one particular
computer too much so you can just think
of it as balancing the demands all
across these different computers and not
taxing one particular computer too much
such that it slows down or explodes
worst case scenario when it comes to
load balancing though it can be a little
confusing because there's a lot of
different competitors and options so not
all of them work exactly the same way
this is kind of just a general example
that will help you understand the
concept of load balancing and when it
comes to scalability what that means is
that you can just expand the application
very easily if you're working with one
computer for example and you just get
like boom 4 million visitors
well that might tax the system really
bad with a load balancer those visits
are going to be distributed and when you
have spikes of growth your system is not
pressured as much scalability and
availability go hand-in-hand
essentially what availability is
is how much or how often your
application or your database is
available how often are you able to use
it and how often is it broken we want
the availability to be as high as
possible so for example let's say we
have a ninety nine percent availability
well that seems pretty good I mean it's
almost 100 but if you think about it
that means one percent of the time your
database is going to be unavailable so
if you think of 365 days in a year 10
percent would be a thirty six point five
one percent would be three point six
five so we're talking three and a half
days that your database is not going to
be available so 99 percent is actually a
really bad value how high have a number
do you actually need well that really
depends on what the database is being
used for and how many users you're going
to be getting for example if a
mom-and-pop shop can save some money by
going to 99 percent and not paying extra
for that extremely high availability you
know three and a half days down out of
the year you know that's not that bad
but if you were like Google like that's
really not that good
scalability comes in because if you're
load-balancing you're going to make your
availability much higher because you
know this computer explodes nothing
breaks because you know you can
communicate with this computer just the
same and with a low balancing it
understands all that so it knows which
computers to talk to if you were just
connecting directly to this database
here and then it breaks well that's not
good because now until it's fixed your
software system is not going to work
that's bad
the last thing is monitoring and
automation I kind of just clumped those
together so let's make sure we are all
on the same page when I'm talking about
monitoring I'm talking about looking at
the health of your database system you
can do that manually but there are a lot
of tools out there to help you automate
the process so you can write scripts
against your database cluster and say
hey if this is going on make sure you
tell me because that's a big problem and
you can have these scripts run regularly
like once a week or once a day or every
so often and that'll just help you
monitor the health of your database also
with automation another piece of
automation is doing a lot of this
database clustering honestly would you
be quiet I am making a video you can do
a lot of the database clustering
automatically with some of the software
tools out there for example you can just
say hey I want a load balancer enable
boom you got a load balancer that's all
you got to do we will be getting into
some of those tools until then I just
want to talk about theory so that's all
I really got to talk about in this video
the next couple videos will be some more
informational stuff and then what we're
going to do is we're actually going to
make a database cluster and that's going
to be cool because then we can test up
you know we can shut one down and see
how things work and all that good stuff
so this series is going to be sick and
that that's good by the way
kind of a dumb slang term because six
like a bad thing but when you say
something sick somehow it's a good thing
but goodness so just that some extra
information to help you get through the
series the best I am going to have a
study guide available at the end of this
video and also in the description
probably in addition to that I'm going
to have extra information on my website
Caleb curry comm which you can probably
find in the description assuming I don't
forget to put it back also the company
that is helping me make these videos is
called several nines they are the ones
that have made some of the database
clustering software and they decided
that they wanted to help support my
channel so that is really great for me
it's also great for you because I can
make more content so if you appreciate
these videos go check out their stuff
and obviously we're going to check it
out because we're going to be using
their stuff throughout this series but I
encourage you to go to them and say hey
I saw you from Caleb's video make it too
you should pay him tons and money you
know that help me out so yeah guys
that's all I got
please please please remember to
subscribe to this channel because
there's going to be lots of great new
content coming out and I'm also going to
go back and finish my C programming
series I know
I'll get to it just relax so stay tuned
and one last thing
check out the newsletter that will be
used to give you guys notifications of
cool new stuff going on with Caleb the
video maker - and lastly follow me on
social networks and all that good stuff
all right that's enough advertising for
like a week I will see you guys in the
next video hopefully this is helpful if
you have any questions at all please
leave them in the description leave them
as a comment and I will see if I can
help you out thanks and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
