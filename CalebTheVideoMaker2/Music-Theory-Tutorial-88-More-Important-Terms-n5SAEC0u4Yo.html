we'll be talking about tempo markings
but not just tipple markings but words
because words are important so here's a
couple of them we're going to learn you
see this yes you can vibrato I may have
said that already that's the vibration
of a sound those all sound is vibrations
and we just interpret the vibrations is
sound so that's y barato calando is
decreasing tone in speed so yeah
diminuendo see you may actually know
what this is just from the word because
we you see dem n diminished so I means
well diminished we took all this
intervals and lower them so it means
lowering something well diminuendo means
becoming less powerful so yeah that's a
way of saying the tent I'm up-tempo but
dim so if we dim the lights for example
if we did the lights we're making the
lights lower if we dim the sound or
making it quieter diminuendo you may see
da dam or something in parentheses to
represent that in shorthand version then
I don't know how to say this don't see
seem oh yeah I think that's right ah
well that is what is that that is oh
yeah this is the opposite of this so
increasing speed and tone so this is
just like- thing it this is like
plussing it or adding it adding to it
whatever marcado means emphasized so to
emphasize a certain note or piece of
music that's what marcado means Mankato
and more endo both mean to die down or
to basically just make things die down
make sense to me those are some of the
basic ones and you can also use you all
can sometimes see terms together such as
two terms which usually one means
something like more less quicker slow
slower and so forth that's
i'm going to show you guys for now and
in the next video we'll be going over
something even cooler doesn't take much
to be cooler than foreign vocabulary not
really the capillaries kind of fun makes
you it allows you to figure things out
without really knowing what's going on
for example if you see that a term such
as a Ritardando we know it's slowing
down so that means that that cannon that
allows us to interpret how the song is
going to sound or what it will be played
like so if we learn all those words we
can figure out what a song is trying to
express just by using those words and
then when we play it we can play it more
like that and allow us to sound better
to other people into ourselves so that's
all I have to say for this video in the
next video i'll be going over something
fun so i'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
