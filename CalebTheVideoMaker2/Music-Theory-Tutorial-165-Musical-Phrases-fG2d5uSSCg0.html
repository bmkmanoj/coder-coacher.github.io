talking about chord progression and
chord reading so a while ago we talked
about chord progression but we didn't
really use it we just figure out how it
worked we started with a major scale and
then when we did we did what was called
harmonizing so I took a C note and turn
it into a C chord and we got this
pattern major minor minor major major
minor diminished and we replaced those
with Roman numerals so a capital Roman
numeral such as a capital I represents
major and we take this now and follow
this pattern to figure out where we can
go from what court this you don't have
to follow this pattern this is just
recommendation so for example we start
on the tonic and just to make things
easier let's pretend we're in the key of
C so we start on C and we want to make a
chord progression well in case you
didn't know the tonic leads anywhere so
we we start here and we can go any
direction we want with this song no
matter what feel we can do it so let's
say we pick the fourth chord well that's
the F major right here it's major
because it's capital so possibly did the
harmonizing the major scale and it
follows through to the theory to make it
major
but anyways where does this chord meet
well it actually can lead to the fifth
so let's go to the fifth G where does
the fifth lead it leads back to the
tonic so here's the simple chord
progression we made you see that there C
to F to G to C and we can repeat that
that is the one four five one chord
progression and there's a lot of other
common chord progressions you will see
I'm sure so how exactly does this work
well over here on the left side
this is every single possible chord when
we harmonize a major scale and it shows
us where this thing leads musically to
sound Pleasant you don't have to follow
it remember you can do whatever you want
but the fifth musically leads back to
the tonic due to the notes within the
fifth and the tension given by the fifth
is best resolved by going to the tonic
so to make this really extreme you could
make a fifth seventh chord a dominant
seventh that is and I'm at even extra
tension because in general the fifth
doesn't have much tension to the first
but it sounds nice
to go from the fifth to the tonic I'm
gonna say tonic not first so first chord
tonic leads anywhere second chord minor
leads to the fourth the fifth or the
seventh diminished third minor leads to
the second wider fourth major or the
sixth minor fourth leads to the first
minor third minor fifth major seventh
diminished fifth leads back to the tonic
six leads to the second minor or the
fourth major or the sixth major seventh
leads back to the tonic or to the third
so here is what is known as chord
leading so if you're right in a song and
you're not sure what chords to use
before even picking a key try getting a
logical pattern of numbers such as I to
the back to I that's a very simple chord
progression and then you can replace
these with no no so we could have c GC
or we gonna have d ad that I think
that's our da de da yeah so those chord
progressions I've shown you that comes
up with the concept of Cadence's which
brings us back to a resolution which we
will be getting into those into depth
and in upcoming videos so we're not
going to go over Cadence's right now we
talked a little bit about them we had a
play goal cadence I believe is what when
I shop taught you and another one I
can't remember but that's cord leading
now another thing I want to get into a
little bit is fitting chords to a melody
so you have a melody that you recognize
first thing that's important is to
figure out the chord progression you can
typically hear it for example go onto
YouTube and type four chords 50 songs or
something like that three chords 50
songs and you'll get millions of options
of people who can play so many songs by
following these simple chord
progressions and once you learn to
recognize those chord progressions you
can figure out okay well this song is a
1 4 5 4 chord progression right and then
you can try to figure out what key it is
in so where do we start let's say it's C
well now I got C F G F now another thing
chords typically either change on the
first note of every measure or the first
and the third because the first and a
third is what gets the beat so 1 3 3 so
that is a little bit into we're at
matching chords to a melody I don't
really get much into it but I just
wanted to mention that here so we'll be
getting into some more of that in the
future that's all I have to say for this
video and I shall see you later and by
