mathematical crap first one is a
absolute value if you don't know what
that is it's a distance a number is from
zero so you've probably seen one of
these before
stupid number lines everybody hates
here's 0 here's four here's negative
absolute value is indicated by this two
little bars
this isn't math class it would look like
this so now if we're measuring how far
four is from zero it's one two three
four spots so even though it's negative
it's four spots from zero four on the
other hand one two three four oh it's
still four so basically no matter what
number is within these bars it's always
positive so this will be four this will
be 4 negative 8 that be 8 so just get
rid of the negative after so if it's
like 6 minus 8 that be negative 2 and
negative 2 1 2 it's two distances 2
jumps from zero so the result is 2 it's
always positive so that's how that works
the absolute value function and they
started up here yes ABB's I got those I
wish but um you put a number in there so
negative 3 and the result be three just
like that next one is square root square
root is what times itself equals the
number I know that probably didn't make
sense but let's say 16 the square root
of 16 is 4 because 4 times 4 equals 4 4
times is 12 4 8 16 4 ma 12 4 16 says
suck in math
so that's what a square root is what
time's itself equals it we'll figure
that out so if we have the number 25 in
here the answers going to be 5 if we
have the number let's say 28.3 it's
going to be probably something
ridiculous that I don't know off the top
of my head well I do but I don't want to
show off my ridiculous math skills so
I'm just gonna keep it a secret now if
you have a negative number in here it's
not going to work the result will be no
nothing because you can't do that for
example negative 25 what times itself
equals negative 25 you might say Oh
negative 5 of course well if we by the
rules of math from multiply a negative
by a negative it's the same thing as
adding if we so you might say negative 5
times negative 5 well by the rules of
math this is the same thing as positive
25 because if you multiply a negative by
a negative you still get a positive so
you can't use a negative number and a
square root doesn't work well it might I
can't prove that it doesn't but if you
give me a number that you can multiply
by itself and gives a negative number
then you get a cookie yes the last
function aren't you so glad we reached
the ending and then we go on to date and
time functions but just gotta deal with
it so truncate this one's pretty cool we
can give it a number and it will cut it
short a certain amount of digits so like
if we gave it three thirty six point
three three three four and we said comma
to the second decimal place the result
would be 36 point 33
Yesi so basically it'll just take
whatever the second number is and count
how many decimal places and cut your
number short by that so if I replace
this with a 3 it'll actually give me a
36 point 3
3 3 because that's 3 1 2 3 3 spots after
the decimal point if we put a negative
number in here
let's have but negative 1 like this this
is going to actually count left to the
decimal point so it'll get okay so
here's a decimal point normally went 1 2
3 now we're going to go 1 2 so 1 it's
going to cut off here so the end result
is actually going to be 30 point just 30
because we don't have any decimals cuz
they got cut off so it's going to cut
all these off and end result is going to
be 30 the reason it gave us 30 is
because that is a an important you can't
just get rid of it or we'd have 3 you
see so we need a is that called I'm not
important we need a we need a spot
holder to represent that it's not 3 but
30 that's why we put the 0 there and the
result is 30 so that is all for
mathematical functions please subscribe
because I am almost at 300 I'm at 295
and I'm like counting down and I'm gonna
throw a party by myself and make videos
because that's what I do
yeah I don't need no friends but anyways
please subscribe leave me some comments
and like my videos because that's that's
what I like I like when you like my
videos I bet you like that I like when
you like my videos and I like that you
like that I like when you like my videos
whoa so anyways subscribe and I'll see
you in the next video which will be over
date and time and a bunch of other cool
stuff don't want to miss it so yeah see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
