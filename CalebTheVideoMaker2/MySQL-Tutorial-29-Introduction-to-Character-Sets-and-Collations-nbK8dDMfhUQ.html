talking about character sets and coal
Asians so basically to start this all
out when you store something in a
database you use characters the word
characters so what is a character an
example of a character is like a just
basically a key you press on your
keyboard but there's also many others so
I get distracted um there's also many
others such as this then there's the
money sign
I'm dollar sign should say not sure what
the actual name and there's like the
asterisk saying these are all characters
all these are still our characters and a
character set is just a group of a bunch
of these characters that you can use
within your database so they usually
allow well I bet you they all do letters
that you type on on a keyboard like an
American standard like keyboard so I'd
be like a ABC and then like 1 2 3 and
all that stuff a common character set of
the utf-8 so basically this thing allows
for like a million characters bunch of
stuff you're probably never used because
that's a lot of characters and so this
allows for a bunch of them then we get
to what are called collisions so let's
say we have these fallen characters all
right here are all the characters what a
closure a collation does it tells how to
organize these characters say and like
alphabetical or anything like that so
basically how things are compared so it
might say it might want to organize them
it might come out like this all the
capital letters and all the lowercase
letters and then the numbers so one
that's 17 and then the money sign or the
dollar sign and that may be a way how
it's organized and this is defined by
the collation
so when you see collations you'll often
see something like this like utf-8
unicode and this is basically the
collation and then CI or CS c I stands
for case-insensitive
so basically a is equal to a I guess
when you're comparing they'll be they'll
be equal and then a case insensitive
case sensitive means like one is greater
than the other or let's put first one
organized in a list so that's that's
basics of collisions and character sets
and I'll go into a little more detail
here because I want to say a little bit
more about some of these characters here
we have ASCII or ASC III
which stands for American Standard Code
for information interchange which is
basically just like a character encoding
thing so it allows for like 128
characters some of these include like an
equal sign just letters so ABC a through
Z and then there's also some that are
not technically like characters such as
delete so this will offer 128 and you're
probably wondering why I'm telling you
this well you may hear about this when
you're on the internet this is what this
is it's just 128 characters that used to
be a standard for information
interchange back but anyways when you
have a character set such as utf-8 it's
there it stores the characters and bytes
so this allows for like a million
options million characters and say so
the first 128 of these are ASCII
compatible characters and these are
stored and one byte so let's say the
character a this will be one byte of
information but after the first 128
things start to take up two bytes so
this would be like 1 and then 2 would be
something else which I can't think of
any example
because uh so basically all the basic
American standard letters will be AAAS
CII ASCII compatible and then all the
others like with accents and all these
freaky things from that you may not see
as often basically this will allow for
characters from all over the world to be
used in one character set so that those
will be stored in two bytes and then the
three bytes some of them are stored in
three bytes which are just more freaky
things and four bytes finally which will
be some even more less used characters
so why am I telling you this
well basically it says how things are
stored in a database I want to explain
that a bit so if you have the word like
hey right here it's going to these are
all ASCII characters so they're only one
by each symbols that when you go onto
like phpMyAdmin you can view like all
the possible character sets and
collisions and I'll show you that in
upcoming video basically there's a ton
of collisions that there option that are
that you can use and a lot of them will
have like a language and then case
insensitive or case sensitive or binary
VI n so there's a lot of options don't
get overwhelmed because it's really not
that difficult and what if you don't
know what's going on Oh which one to use
you can look it up for what reason
to use which that's all so yeah so in
the next video I will be showing you
some character sets and collisions on
PHP myadmin and using them for our new
table and then uh I'll tell you I'll
show you how to change and update
collisions after you've already set them
so it's not like one-time thing if you
messed it up it's too late so don't
worry it's alright everything okay so
yeah see that thanks for watching and
