be talking about a new type of scale
called the natural minor scale now we're
going to be going over to with we're
going to be going over three minor
scales really shortly so the first one
is probably the most important because
you can figure out the other ones by the
first one so this is called the natural
minor scale scale now it doesn't sound
quite as pleasant as the C now remember
not see Elmo says E major scale I was
gonna say C cuz remember how when we use
the C major scale we used only the white
keys well it works like this with the
natural minor scale
when we start on a so here's a whole
half whole whole half whole half we
write this out so this is the pattern
for a natural minor scale I was trying
to do it with the half and a different
note and it wasn't working out right it
was like okay I did something wrong so
let's try this out if we start on let's
go with GE should be fine G take whole
half whole whole half oh oh so that's
the pattern I'm kind of new to I mean I
don't really use minor scales for much
so I'm still getting a thing of it but
this is the pattern for it and uh don't
worry too much about memorizing it
because you can just figure out from the
a although over time I do recommend you
memorize it but right now it's not the
big of a deal and as you can tell it's a
little bit more sad than the C major
scale the C major scale kind of pushes
if you want to finish the scale and
compare
ha ha that's coming but a minor scale or
any yet any minor scale really we find
hey it's not really pushing me to go all
the way there I mean there is like this
push but it's not quite the same feeling
it's like almost like I'm dragging along
whereas the C major scale it's more
happy kind of pushes me along okay
here's a quiz is this major or minor it
was major what about this it's minor
there's definitely a different feeling
about that one
that's actually an a minor chord about
this one major about this one can't
reach it augmented chords
alright so that's really all I have to
blabber on about I think I don't really
know what else to say so in the next
video we will be talking about another
minor scale and how it differs from this
one so thank you for watching I'm sure
to subscribe and like this video thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
