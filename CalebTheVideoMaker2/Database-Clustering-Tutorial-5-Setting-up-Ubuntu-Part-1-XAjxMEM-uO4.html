Caitlin from kids video mecca - this is
your fifth video inside of your database
clustering series now we are actually
going to start setting up our database
cluster and as I mentioned in previous
videos we are going to be using virtual
machines and then connecting those guys
so each virtual machine is going to be
one of our nodes in our database cluster
so to work with virtual machines there's
an application out there called
VirtualBox where this just allows you to
kind of install a computer inside of a
computer so to download this application
you can click this Downloads button on
the left and then figure out what
operating system you're running so I'm
running OS X so that's the one I would
use once you got that downloaded you can
install it's really simple I'm not going
to waste your time guiding you through
that process but it will look something
like this
wallah now you can see I have a bunch of
stuff already installed don't worry
about that that's what I've used to
prepare for this video series and I just
want to keep that just in case I need to
go back and reference it but what's most
important is what we are going to be
creating so we're actually going to be
creating three virtual machines the
great part is though you don't have to
go through the entire process of setting
up a machine three times with VirtualBox
you can actually just create one and
then you can just make a clone into the
second one and the third one you'll just
want to change the MAC address which
I'll show you how to do all of that to
install our first virtual machine we are
going to need an operating system you
can download an operating system in a
file and it'll be of the type dot ISO
the operating system that I'm going to
use is called Ubuntu and you can
download that on the Ubuntu website
Ubuntu comm and this link is forward
slash download forward slash desktop now
if you are working on the series for a
production environment and you have a
particular clustering software that
you're going to be using you will want
to make sure that that software is
available on whatever particular
operating system you are going to be
using for example the Oracle Galera
cluster is currently not offered on odd
versions of Ubuntu so it should work on
this one and if I scroll down you'll see
17 I don't think it's going to work on
that one so we are going to go with the
16
it and just click download and no I want
to donate cash and there you go to start
downloading give that about four days
it'll finally finish and then you can
start working on building the virtual
machines back here in VirtualBox after
you have that finished downloading you
can click this new button I'll just give
this a creative name and essentially we
want to make an operating system that we
can continually clone so this is kind of
like the blueprint for the rest of the
operating systems so if you want to
expand your cluster tough Claire come
come on seriously well as I was saying
before I was rudely interrupted by that
freak this is going to be the blueprint
for the rest of our operating systems so
you want to give it a general name such
as starter now you can select your
operating system we're using a type of
Linux specifically Ubuntu then click
continue now how much memory do you want
to allocate this is pretty important I'm
going to give it a lot more so I'm going
to go with four zero nine six continue
yes we want to create a virtual hard
disk now so for this part I'm going to
click dynamically allocated and this is
talking about the hard disk for the
virtual machine so I want to put
dynamically allocated because the
virtual machine is only going to take up
as much space as it needs and that way I
can save space on my laptop so when you
click continue this is going to ask you
the size of the virtual machine disk
this page has given me problems before
because I have a bad habit of not really
reading directions I probably shouldn't
tell that to the entire YouTube audience
but this is the max size this is not the
size that you start with so if you want
to cap out the size at 8 gigabytes you
would leave 8 but that is not nearly
enough space so I'm going to go in here
and put 50 but the thing is it's not
actually going to take 50 gigabytes it
might only take you know 10 gigabytes or
15 or 40 but this allows me to expand up
to 50 gigabytes if I need
now click create alright and it will
appear down here on this list I'm
actually just going to take it and drag
it all the way up to the top so when we
have this here we can click start and
what this is going to do is ask you to
give that ISO that you downloaded so
just click this little folder here and
now find that file click it and click
open and then start this is going to
begin the setup for the virtual machine
and this is where my computer starts
growling with the fans so if you hear a
that's what that is
when that's done loading it's going to
ask you whether you want to try or
install obviously we're going to want to
install so we can use it more than once
yes we are going to download updates
continue yes erase disk and install
Ubuntu is fine that's specifically
talking about the virtual disk that we
created when we created this virtual
machine so this does not have access to
your hard drive it's not going to delete
everything and you can go through the
rest of the installation process it's
really not too complicated
now here you're going to want to fill
out some information and I'm going to
give a really secure password continue
once that's finally done you're going to
click restart and at this screen where
it says please remove the installation
medium you can just press ENTER and
there you go the Ubuntu desktop is now
set up oh ye yeah what's up so I would
say that's probably enough information
for one video in the next video I'm
going to be talking about how to install
everything we need to install to do SSH
and how to clone these desktops it's
going to be great so make sure you check
out the next video thank you guys for
watching so much I really appreciate it
and if you don't mind just do me a favor
and click the subscribe button that will
tell me that hey this person likes my
content and that will encourage me to
make more stuff so thank you for
everything I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
