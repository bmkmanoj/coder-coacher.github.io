of the series is about so you must know
what it means
normalization as I said is this reducing
redundant information as then you don't
need your city and state and all that
other crap listed 500 times you can just
have that one for each person you have
at once
so basically normalization will help
your data stay organized and not waste
space now there's multiple forms of
normalization hopes all right so there's
there's actually six forms there's well
basically they're called normal forms so
let's make some more room normalization
that's what this is about
I know this kind of should be up here
but whatever so those are the forms of
normalization there is the first normal
form one an F that means normal form so
if you see this and you're like what
does this mean
this is what 90 to 95% of people follow
there's also three more forms but this
is what this series will cover one two
and three the next form is B see that
stands for voice forward slash Codd
normal form that is the fourth normal
form technically it's not called the
fourth normal form but in order it is
the fourth next one is the fourth normal
form and then the fifth normal form now
if you must know
you can go research some needs because I
will only be going over the basics and
that is this all right I'm not sure if
the next one is really relevant but I
decided I'd cover it anyways so this one
is calm chi is when you combine two
things to make one so earlier I was
talking about things being a tonic so
you have table and then you have curry
these are atomic because they're not
together there are two separate boxes
now you're wondering how would you put
them back together well that's when you
concatenate them so first name this
would be the name of the column so the
first name and then a quoted space so
that's a space and then last name so
that would come out where this caleb
space this right here in two quotes
anything in the quotes so caleb space
curry and that would come out as one
result now if you changed what was in
the quotes such as let's just put Z
instead of a space do ta caleb Z curry
that's just an example so that's what
kind of cat any kind of it as I started
recording the other parts I thought of a
couple more terms so I'm coming back to
this the first one it was normal no
means nothing so basically if something
is newell there's nothing there entry is
blank if you sign up for something and
you do not put your name it will be
stored as no and it will actually say no
so this is what will be injured no and
this is not a word you can't you can't
change it it's nothing it's it's not
zero it's normal it's kind of confusing
but you'll get used to it and it's not a
blank string so it's not like these are
quotation marks and there's just nothing
there it's that's all
I think that's entity relationship
diagram so I'm gonna double-check that
yeah that's right
all right so what entity let me write
that out suck at spelling I'll write
that out so you could see what was read
better deed could also be M for entity
relationship model but obviously is your
key so what an entity relationship
diagram is when you design a database
with like boxes so you know table here
books and you can find these for entity
relationship diagrams on the computer
and I'll be designing a database at the
end of the series with you guys using
this one of these MySQL workbench it's
great books and then you can have like
ID name blah blah blah blah then you can
have like a money to one-to-many
relationship to something else when you
have a soul how everything is tied
together and this is time there's like
another box just something else then you
have a box over here basically when you
draw out your database that is called an
entity relationship diagram now if
you've heard of the term a relationship
database management system or relation
or like a relational database for
example a relation comes from that and
it's just another name for a table so
relation is a table you can also have
relationships which is how everything is
connected in the table as in if you have
like students and you have student ID
name address that all has to that's all
built around the student ID I think you
can see me it's all built around the
student ID and if you have something in
there like the weather of the day that's
that's not relational because it has
nothing to do with the student ID
whatsoever and that will be addressed
when we go over
normalization and how to solve this
problems and decide whether something is
related or not and then we'll fix any
problems we have and I'll teach you how
to fix I just said that teach you how to
fix stuff yeah so that's what a relation
is it's a table the relationship is how
everything is connected in that table
all right guys as you go on you'll learn
more than what was just listed up here
but I don't want to explain them now
because I don't want to confuse you and
it'll make more sense when you learn
other parts and I promise that
everything will start to make sense and
if you have any questions you can leave
a comment and others will help you out
or I'll I'll do my best to help you out
you can also find forums and like
websites to help you out with it I mean
I'm not the only source obviously Co you
can look up other stuff but make sure
you watch this series first because I
mean obviously I want the fuse and
credit and I'm just so good at this I'm
just kidding but yeah hope you ever got
a good day and sure we watched my next
video thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
