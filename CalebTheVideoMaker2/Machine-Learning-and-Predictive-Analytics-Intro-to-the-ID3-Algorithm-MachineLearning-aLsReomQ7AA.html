the starch talking about a specific
machine learning algorithm
yeah the moment we've all been waiting
for we're going to define the id3
algorithm by the way I think algorithm
is one of the hardest words to spell for
some reason I always look at him like is
that spelled right and unfortunately I
know I'm sorry we're actually not gonna
go on the computer and program the id3
algorithm right now we're going to be
using pseudocode which means i'm gonna
make it up as I go but the goal is to
understand how the id3 algorithm works
that way when you need to use it in the
future it's much easier to pick up and
if we get to it in future videos we
already have this as the foundational
knowledge so we're gonna talk about the
id3 algorithm on the chalkboard
sorry if I'm disappointing but it's what
I got for the day maybe later maybe
later we'll get into programming it okay
so I'm gonna split this video into two
sections so we're gonna have a part one
and a part two the typical structure for
recursion is you have the base cases and
then you have the recursive goal and you
can have some other processing in the
middle here if you want but these are
the two pieces that we're going to
discuss so it's kind of interesting how
I'm going to go about doing this because
I'm going to talk about the second half
first that's because the base cases are
when to stop and I want to focus on how
we start so the base cases aren't going
to be true until after we've hit a
couple recursive calls so I'm actually
going to go through this algorithm as if
we were processing it where you're going
to hit the recursive calls first because
the base cases aren't going to be true
so hopefully that makes sense if that
doesn't make sense it doesn't really
matter to be honest let's just start
with the recursive call so before the
recursive call there is going to be some
extra stuff and this is what's going to
do the actual processing in the
recursive intro video this would have
been the call to announce a message with
a particular volume so you can think of
a recursive function as having three
pieces the base cases the actually doing
stuff part and then the recursive call
the very first thing that the id3
algorithm is going to do is choose the
descriptive feature with the most
discriminatory power if you think back
to when we were talking about decision
trees this example might be something
like age so we pick a feature such as
age and the one we've picked is
specifically the one with the most
discriminatory power which this is
requires some prerequisite knowledge so
if you're just jumping in here go check
out my video on discriminatory power
which will teach you how an algorithm
chooses the one with the most
discriminatory power and that is based
on an entropy measurement which is
basically a fancy word for a number that
represents a features discriminatory
power so this section is going to go
through all of the features in whichever
one has the most discriminatory power
it's going to pick the next thing that's
going to do is partition the data based
on the feature of choice what this means
in the example of H if we split less
than 50 and greater than 50 is it's
going to split our people into two
groups where the people who are less
than 50 are on one end and the people
who are greater than 50 are on the other
end the next thing is it's going to
remove this descriptive feature from the
descriptive feature list so we have a
list of all the descriptive features
that we can choose from we want to get
rid of H and that's because we don't
want to split on age again because we've
already done that if you did want to
split on age again such as less than 25
and greater than 25 or you could just do
it once and have multiple branches 0
through 25 26 through 50 51 through
however you want to split it you can do
that it doesn't just have to be two
partitions the next thing is to issue
the recursive call on each of the
partitions
the part where the focal point is going
to move down to a branch and and do the
same exact function so it's going to
choose the feature with the most
discriminatory power and remember it
can't choose age because that was
removed from the list of features so
it's going to calculate all of the
entropy for each of the descriptive
features and then pick the one with the
most discriminatory power once it does
that it'll split our data into two
groups into as many groups as there are
descriptive feature values so if it's
wait we could have underweight average
and above average for example and
because this is recursive it's going to
go down to the next branch and do the
same thing and it's going to do that
until it hits a base case which is what
we're going to talk about next so once
we hit the base case and we split our
data into diabetes and not diabetes
well then it's going to go up a step and
now we're back into the previous
function which hasn't finished yet
because you see here it says recursive
call on each partition so after it
finishes this partition it's going to go
down to this partition and do the same
thing and then it'll go up to this one
again and down to this one once we go
through all of those branches this one's
done and we're going to go to this one
because this one here also did it for
all of its branches so it did this
branch first once it finished with that
branch it went down to this branch
however big it may be so that's the
magic of recursion it can kind of just
go like a virus across the entire tree
issuing the same function on each of the
nodes the tricky part for this function
is actually the base cases so that's
what we're going to dedicate an entire
video to so please be sure to check that
out I really really really appreciate it
if you could subscribe to this channel
as I'm really trying to grow this
channel and that would just really
helped me out so thank you and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
