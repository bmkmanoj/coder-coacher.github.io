to re welcome to your HTML and CSS
series this video I'm going to be
talking about names IDs and so forth for
input types and why they exist so let me
just start from scratch here a while ago
and a long long long long long long time
ago I talked about some things in HTML
you can give them an ID or name so we
get asked like enter your first name I
don't enter door I got order here your
first boom close enough right now and
you have input type equals text name
equals ah sorry name ID equals name the
reason it the name is name is because we
it's basically what we're putting in so
enter your have to be like enter your
city right and then I big name city and
I make ID city whatever you want them to
put in so I want them to put in their
name enter your name internet pulling
into a smiley face so this is what we
have right now enter your name alright
but we saw these things we don't really
know about name equals name why is up
there well I'm working with other
programming languages we can often get
this element and modify it using the
name element although for this example
I'm not going to use it but you can look
and you can see this has an ID and the
idea of it is name well believe it or
not you can actually assign a lot of
stuff in HTML
Deeks pretty much anything that has a
tag so ID equals tip number one so
that's just an example and i'm going to
be showing you what you can do with this
so this ID references to this specific
division of the website i could say same
for the paragraph p equals my ID equals
comment important alright so now we can
do with CSS we can reference these
specific things and then we can modify
specifically so i'm going to get rid of
this input where is it right here oh god
Oh to reference a class we put back a
pound sign maino de as a hashtag sign
but i'm going to call it a pound sign so
once we have that we put what the ID is
called so comment and Portman I may have
talked about this already Karen remember
I remember saying that's pretty color I
think I said that I don't remember said
that around and then we can style it
with in here and also guys often times
you will indent the styles within these
but I decided not do it's okay well I'm
going to guess I'll go with the rest of
the program and not indented here so
calm it important I could say text
declaration underline and now let's look
at it it's important so we underline it
or we can um size equals 50 pixels all
right that's in your do it oh yeah font
size i always forget that what what's
going on oh yeah hope if you put a
number to this is an article so that's
an important comment so it gets a lot of
extra recognition by making it bold and
if you look it's the only comment that
was affected this is due to our ID
system which allows us to reference
cific things within the document so
that's why I DS are very important and
if you need to style like instead of
styling just did that's going to get
every single div within the entire HTML
page and oftentimes you don't want to
style every single dip the same or else
your website is going to be very plain
and you're not going to be able to do
much so for example how am I supposed to
give a sidebar or something what I put
it in I can put it in a div but then
it's going to look like this and it's
not going to look like a sidebar so I
can give that div a specific ID so
that's pretty cool but there's an even
more useful object known as a class it's
not like an object as an object-oriented
programming it's just more useful item
in our HTML and CSS so that's what we're
going to be talking about in the next
video and I will see you then thank you
