and time functions and let me tell you
there it's like a crap-ton of these I
mean I looked at a lot of them and I
mean I studied them because they're like
the only dates I can get seriously um so
yeah there's like a bunch of these I'm
gonna go over the basic ones and yeah
they're really easy to wrap your mind
around so basically you have a function
and then in parentheses you can give it
a date/time which is in this format so
let's say 2012 now let's make that 13 13
months 11 day 8 and then time would be
our 11 see these are very simple the
first one is date and it will just
return this right here because it's the
date of the given date time now these
are used to extract parts of the
function I mean part of the date time
into its own separate thing but these
can be used for a lot of things so you
should familiarize these thing with your
so you should familiarize yourself with
these because they're really simple
that's why I'm teaching them here so
this will just take this the next one
date can actually be broken up into your
ear function horrible
day so if you were to use the date
function you would get this if you're
used to use the Year function
supplementing this info right here into
here you would get 2013 month you get 11
day you'd get you can do the same thing
for the time this right here is the time
so if you were to use a time function
and then supplement this right here into
this right here so put this with this
then you could you would get the time
11-11-11 these can be broken up into a
hour with our function minute function
and then the second function it's funny
because it's actually the third one
status warble joke and then there's also
you can use microseconds microsecond
yes so basically the time breaks up into
these the date breaks up into these oh
that looks horrible but hopefully that
makes sense so if you need to extract a
simple thing from this like oh they give
you it someone submits a date time and
you want to take the x out of that
rather than taking the whole thing you
can just use the time function and then
you will have to store this garbage or
if you're retrieving it you only want to
retrieve the times you can use the time
function on the select statement there's
a function called now this will give you
the current date time so like 2012 and
then the time I don't yeah you get the
point
that's what the now will do then this
can be further broken up into Kerby
which stands for current date huh mercy
you are and then there is curb time
these are all functions by the way they
swell this will give you the current
time this will give you the current date
here are three more functions they're
represented by functions by putting
parentheses after even though you don't
necessarily always have to put something
within the parentheses current timestamp
that is the same exact thing as now
it'll do the same thing it works the
same so yeah this is this has been
another name for now and then the UNIX
timestamp is I'll go over that next this
one universal coordinated time stamp Oh
universal coordinated time timestamp
that's confusing or is UTC timestamp
this will take your current just like
now give yourself the current date and
time it'll do that but it will convert
it into the UTC format which it still
looks the same
here month day hour minute second just
like this that's it'll still look the
same but it's enough basically taking
your timezone whatever the hour is and
adding a certain amount of hours or
minutes this is to get all the time time
zones on an exact time together so you
can say oh my tum is a time zone is UTC
plus three hours and they'll give you
that time soon that's what the UTC time
stamp does unix timestamp if you
remember this will actually take your
current time or date both of them
actually it'll convert it into universal
core coordinated Universal coordinated
Universal Time and then it'll make it
into seconds from the epoch so let me
explain that a little bit better here we
have
right so if we convert this to UTC time
stamp this may be 2012 nine nine and
then we can say eight so that basically
means your time zone is three hours
ahead nine ten yeah three hours ahead
from the uniform the universal time or
the UTC time then the epoch is a time in
history that they started counting
seconds I don't even know what it was
for I can't remember but so this may be
like 6 bajillion nine thousand billion
trillion seconds from this event so if
you need an exact exact time in time
like this many seconds from that point
it's exact don't have to worry about
dates times or nothing in just a mount
of seconds from this event that's what
the unix timestamp does here's a MySQL
function to underscore days this will
take a date for example the date I just
gave you on 2012 nine nine eleven and
I'll tell you how many days from zero it
is so this may be like I don't even know
how what range would be but this is an
exact date so if you're measuring you
can say measuring the distance between
days and stuff you can use two days to
convert that way you can say oh this
one's like thirty days ahead or thirty
days before rather than having to look
at the months and dates you can just
have it all in two days and that's sort
of like sort of like UNIX timestamp but
in today's and kind of more easier to
read
I bought it uh yeah alright so I just
got into the basics of date and time
functions now the next thing I'm going
to be going over is specific
representations of hours minutes seconds
and stuff like that now I know that
doesn't really make sense yet but let me
explain it here we can have
somebody given us a date in the forum
year-month-day or we can have somebody
giving us a day in the date month year
thing format so the way we use this we
can can we can convert this into this
format by using a date format function
and to do that we need to learn a lot of
new things so that's what I will be
going over in the next video and I'll
try and make you may read this in books
and be like what that doesn't make sense
but I'll explain it so you can
understand it so stick with me see in
the next video please subscribe and like
