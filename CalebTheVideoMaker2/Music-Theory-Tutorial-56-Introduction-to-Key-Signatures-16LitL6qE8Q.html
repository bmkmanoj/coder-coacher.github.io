pretty cool now so let me zoom in a tad
hopefully you like that i scooted up my
board so now I'm not cutting my face off
and I can still see everything it's all
good
so this is an a major scale and the
reason I'm showing you this is I wanted
to show you how all of the notes with
the sharps the accidentals are the
accidentals are placed before the notes
this is to tell the music reader and
that the upcoming notes are to be played
with that specific accidental such as
rather than having C we have C sharp
which allows them to alter their pitch
soon enough when writing music let's say
this is a C and then we play a B and
then we play a G and then we play an a
and then we play a C again alright a C
sharp so C sharp C sharp here's our end
of our measure and we're on to the next
measure now this is all cool because now
they know that the C's our sharps and
yeah I guess that's cool but it gets
super annoying having to read every
single C because this isn't the key of a
which means G's also sharp and so is F
so if this is a G it has to be sharp and
there's just gonna look like a giant
splatter mess of crap so what we do if
we actually take we can we don't have to
we can take these accidentals and scoot
them down over to the side beside the
clump and what this is known is as the
key signature alright so basically this
is what the key signature looks like
here's a picture of it for a major scale
this is going to tell everybody that
every single G whoops every single G is
going to be played sharp every single F
and every single C will be played sharp
even if the C's down here it's still
going to be played sharp
because it's every single see that is
affected not just these specific three
so here's a great example of a key
signature whoa whoa whoa whoa
which is cool so now that is going to
take effect through the entire song no
matter where you're at
you will play AC sharp rather than AC
and you don't have to rewrite it you
just know you'll play a C sharp because
that's what you expect but what if you
don't want them to play a C sharp you
can give them what's called the natural
note of C so this is C boom now it's the
natural which tells them to drop it down
from a C sharp this this is a chromatic
note out of the scale but that's
perfectly fine because this is how the
musician wants it now the reason I
brought up the crap in the last video
that you probably didn't care that much
about is when you introduce a new I
forgot what it's called for a second uh
I said I'm sorry I brain for today so if
we introduce a new accidental it only
lasts till the end of the measure and my
dogs barking I just really take them out
so if we have a song this markers going
dead what a shock I'm just gonna give
and then here are the measures and we
have a key signature of a major so this
will tell us to sharp to F sharp to G's
and sharp the C's or basically raise
them a half-step
compared to the normal C it will be one
step higher one half-step love it so now
let's say we have a mm a seat right here
and it's a whole note so it takes up the
whole measure and we don't want it to be
sharp we want to be natural
horrible natural no but whatever
here's an okay close enough that's an ad
for now and it's telling us to play
every single C natural now if we have a
see over here it goes back to being
sharp but what if we have 2 C's here
half notes one of them is labeled as
natural doing play this one is natural
or do we plant as sharp well actually we
play it as natural because the natural
carries on until the end is a measure so
if we wanted to play this sharp we would
actually have to label it with a sharp
sign but I'm getting way too off track
all I'm trying to say is that we can
move these to the beginning to tell us
to play them naturally that way
throughout the song so don't have to
keep telling them keep telling them and
keep telling them because can you
imagine that every single time there was
a C and a song we had to put a sharp
sign until the end of the measure then
in the next measure there's another seat
I hope we got a push sharp sign
what if our key signature looks like
this there's going to be like 50 hundred
sharp signs in the song or flat signs if
if you were using a flat key signature
but with the mess that they have now is
you can replace these with natural notes
and a key signature to effect a song how
you wish so I think that's all I need to
say for now just keep in mind that the
key signature tells you what scale
you're in now I know we don't really
know that too much now but I'll be
getting to that in the next few videos
but as a ha as I had this this is an a
major scale that's the scale we're
playing in
I said I'm sorry
I've ran far today so if we introduce a
new accidental it only lasts till the
end of the measure and my dogs barking
actually taking about so if we have a
song here are the measures and we have a
key signature of a major so this will
tell us to sharp to F sharp the G's and
sharp the C's or basically raise them a
half-step compared to the normal C it
will be one step higher one half-step
Mon that so now let's say we have a mm a
seat right and it's a whole note so it
takes up the whole measure and we don't
want it to be sharp we want it to be
natural horrible natural no but whatever
here's an okay close enough that's an ad
for now and it's telling us to play
every single C natural now if we have a
see over here it goes back to being
sharp but what if we have to seize here
half notes one of them is labeled as
natural do you play this one is natural
or do we plant a sharp well actually we
play it as natural because the natural
carries on until the end of the measure
so if we wanted to play this sharp we
would actually have to label it with a
sharp sign but I'm getting way too off
track all I'm trying to say is that we
can move these to the beginning to tell
us to play them naturally that way
throughout the song so don't have to
keep telling them keep telling them to
keep telling them because can you
imagine that every single time there was
a C and a song we had to put a sharp
sign until the end of the measure then
in the next measure there's another seat
hope we got a push sharp sign what if
our key signature looks like this
there's going to be like fifty hundred
sharp Suns in the song or flat signs if
if you were using a flat key signature
but with the meant that they have now as
you can replace these with natural notes
and a key signature to effect a song how
you wish so I think that's all I need to
say for now just keep in mind that the
key signature tells you what scale
you're in now I know we don't really
know that too much now but I'll be
getting to that in the next few videos
but as a house I had this this is an a
major scale that's the scale we're
playing in
