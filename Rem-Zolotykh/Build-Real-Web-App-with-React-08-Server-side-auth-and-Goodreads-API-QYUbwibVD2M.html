series where we build real web
application with react and no GS first
of all I want to sorry about my absence
for than two weeks almost two weeks but
I had really serious family emergency in
shirts my mother-in-law had a stroke
while being abroad without insurance so
it was quite an emotional journey and
rollercoaster and couple of gray hairs
but all all ended well so thank God for
that
and now as everything settles down I'm
ready to continue producing content more
regularly another news is I work really
hard right now in my premium course and
it's almost ready so the I'm I'm
actually seeing the finish line so right
now I'm handling the legal stuff with my
tax office and I am waiting the green
light from my bank to integrate my pain
terminal etc so it's quite exciting so
very soon I hope in two or three weeks
I'll publish my premium course and it
will be available for purchase it's
quite exciting so because of all of this
work don't expect me to make more than
two episodes per week for the next two
or three weeks but we'll see how it goes
maybe I will have the the inspiration to
do even more so I want to thank all my
patrons for for the support I've got
money
and I will actually spend it not on
games in bubblegum but on the improving
the production quality of the videos
maybe we'll see something about some
kind of a genes or something like that
so there will be some changes I hope for
the better in the production quality of
these videos maybe I will do something
with my light and lighting and you know
green screen or something like that
always this echo I have really a room
sorry for that but can't do anything
right now to fix it so if you're not a
patron yet become one just for one buck
a month and you get the access to
private community and also I've got the
PayPal donation if you want to
be generous only once so feel free to do
that okay so let's get down to our
episode two this session in this session
we're going we have to go so the first
one is to actually complete
authentication process so now on the
server side we need to check for user
authentication on the server and in this
way we're gonna protect our books run so
not anybody can accept this and have
access to this route but only users so
we'll see how to do that and in this we
can a complete authentication and the
second goal is to actually make API
requests to Goodreads to get books from
that database okay so let's get down to
it so we're going to work most on the
server side but a little bit of on the
client side so let's go to server side
code so here I am in bookworm API so
here in books right now anybody can
access this route and that's not what we
want to do we want to allow only
authenticated users to do that and in
Express we use middlewares to accomplish
that so we're going to create right now
in a second authenticate middleware and
we're going to import it from
middlewares
authenticate hey and now to use it for
the whole router we just use router dot
use authenticate done so if we would
like to protect only specific route in
this specific endpoint in this router we
could add it right here as the
middleware so authenticate so now and
and do not do this so now in this way
only get search is required for
authentication and other routes here or
not but in our case the whole books
router is going to require
authentication so what is middleware
middleware is basically a function so
let's go and let's create middlewares
authenticate RGS and we're gonna expert
constant expert default counts
and we call it authenticate and there's
gonna be a function and this function
takes three parameters like our rouse
does do actually routes are middlewares
but that's the end point in the chain of
middle-earth
so it has request/response and next
that's going to be a function so what is
middlewares you can imagine it like a
chain of functions so we have a chain
each function it is called the
middleware because it can halt thing it
can because it does some job in it and
then passes it down to sits to the next
function and the same thing goes with
this one another option is that some of
them is going to halt the operation to
stop it and respond and no other
functions will actually execute so in
our case that's the second thing that we
want to implement so we want to check
for authentication and authentication
basically we're going to take the
authorization token and we're gonna
verify it and if it's valid we're gonna
pass the execution further if it's not
then we're going to halt the operation
and we can respond with error message
and error status so what we need to have
first of all we need to have a header so
that's what we haven't done yet on a
client each request should have
authorization header if user is
authenticated so this way we can check
if user is authenticated or not so we're
gonna access it from request headers
authorization and so now if we have such
a header we're gonna take token from it
so we'll have token that equals to
header I want to split this header
because usually by convention header is
something like bearer then we have space
and then we have some token so I want to
split it by space and then I'm gonna
take the second value which is the token
so let's define token here isn't defined
okay so if we have Hatter
then we extract token and after that we
want to actually verify it so first of
all if token exists then we can verify
it but if it doesn't exist then we'll
respond with status for a-1 and we'll
say Jason errors let's say Global global
no token provided okay if we have token
we need to verify it with JSON web token
so we'll have JSON web token JSON web
token we input it and here we can a
verified very verify token we use
process that and that jorts token and
then we'll have error and decoded
information as the result and again we
check forever
so if we have error then we respond with
status for one and Jason is going to be
errors as well global and this this time
it is invalid token
okay but if it is valid we actually just
call next so this way if ever since okay
we just call the next function and the
next function is made aware chain is
actually the router code so what happens
here when user goes to this search it
has the middle of it has the chain of
middle words and then it has this
authenticate middleware and if it calls
next this body of the round is called
also we can actually save something in
our request object so for example we can
have user email and we can take it from
decoded email so this way we can use
this user email in our routes so here
for example I can access it with a
request user email and find current user
with the help of it another thing that
we can do is actually
find user in the database and if it's
there again we check if it's there then
we save it into current user for example
otherwise we again responds with we
respond with error that no user is found
ok but for now that's enough so here's
what we do we take header we have token
from the we get token from the header
and then we verify the stop and we
respond either we respond with error or
we continue with program execution good
so let's try it out in our application
so I'm gonna make request and we have
500 that's not what I actually wanted
let's have a look we have an error here
somewhere okay what is a Const self
antique a default cost oh so here let's
just do it like this okay so let's try
it again
I'm gonna roll out the page okay so now
we have 401 that's good and we have
global error no token because we now did
not pass any token so if we go to
headers you can see that we have no
authorization token we haven't done it
yet so now we need to go to the
client-side code and make this change so
let's do this so here I am in bookworm
react code and let's go to index first
of all so here what we have right now so
if we have in a local storage if we have
the token we decode it and we dispatch
action but also we need to change our
old future API request to include this
token into the authorization header and
with access we can do it pretty easily
so let's create utils folder and inside
of it we'll get set of Rhys ation header
Dargis Herer legit is like this so I've
got an expert default function and this
function will take token and by default
it's gonna be now
so if token is provided then we want to
set this header and for that we need to
import access now we can use access
default headers defaults headers that
common dot authorization so this way we
set default header authorization that
will equal to Vera the just a convention
and the token itself otherwise if token
is now we want to delete it so we're
going to delete all of this thing here
this authorization token stuff okay so
now we can go to index here and we going
to import set of theorization of those
asian header from utils set of the
relation header and now if we have token
we go into set of relation header and we
get this local storage book one don't
token good but now now if we go back to
browser and let's make the request let's
reload the page and let's make the
request you can see that we have the
same error here but now we have
authorization header and it has the
bearer here and the token itself okay
but we have invalid token that's
interesting that's interesting why do we
have involved token well let's have a
look
header split first one Oh George secret
oh man not your token okay so let's try
it again so now hopefully we make a
request and yeah it's good we have books
back
so that happens because we have in
Harris now we have this bearer token
this authorization token in it so this
is good but still not perfect so for
example when we log out we need to
delete this token from the from the
header and when we log in we need to set
it up not only on the on the reload of
the page but just when I log in so for
that let's go back to react code and
here let's go to actions of and we here
we go on to import set of theorization
header from UTS set organization header
and now here in our logout we just use
set authorization header without any
parameter and that will delete the token
and in login we use set of transition
header and we pass the user dot token
into it so now if we go back over the
page and when we log out now when I'm
going to login you will see that here in
our I do not have authorization token
but after I logged in of course I will
get it back good so it works nice
another thing that we maybe should test
is the validity of talking so for
example here if I make it invalid by
replacement like this and I load the
page and now I'm trying to make a
request we'll have an error this time
invalid token so the verification of the
token does it work does work okay this
phone so let's go back here
so this basic user authentication check
on server side and on the clients on the
client we need to include this token in
each request that we do to the server
and a server we just check and verify it
and you can do as elaborate as you as
you need to you you can check for
expiration date you can check for user
existence you can check for user
right now etcetera etcetera cetera so
depending on the needs of your
application okay so now to the Goodreads
API and I was too optimistic about it
unfortunately it's not that kind of a
great thing so here if we go to
Goodreads comm slash API you will see
the API documentation and I already
logged in on my account and here's the
whole API stuff but the problem is so
here we have this search stuff search
search search search search books okay
so it in theory it should do what we
needed to do but in practice it's not
exactly what we want so here as you can
see we have this book search index and
we just provide query and we need to
provide key developer key and developer
key you just can follow this link and if
you have the account you will have the
key and the secret that you can use you
can generate them so you just grab it
from here and you need to provide query
and you need to provide this key and you
will get the results back sounds cool
but let's have a look at the sample URL
right here so what we get in the as a
return and the response from the server
is XML document that's also cool XML
documents are nice but if you can see
here we can the result and this the
result is water works for our search
query and this work has the best book
not they all books it only tells us that
is 222 books and it will just provide us
with the best book and this best book
has title author and image URL just one
we expected a lot of covers for
different editions but now we have only
one cover for now and the most
frustrating thing is that in this best
book we do not have page number and
that's really sucks because now we
actually will need to make another
request when user clicks and selects the
book we need to make another request to
get and not
another bunch of information all we can
do it now we should do it like this yeah
so that's what we're going to work with
unfortunately it's not this in the way
that we really wanted it to be but it's
doable it's it's pretty good for our
purposes so we need to make requests to
another server and we need to then parse
XML to JSON and for that we're gonna use
two packages so let's go to terminal and
here I'm gonna use yarn net and we're
gonna use XML to GS package to convert
XML to JavaScript and another one is
request promise request is great library
to make requests API requests okay so
now in our code here in books I'm gonna
cook I'm gonna comment this things out
just for reference and we're gonna do
everything right here in the router we
are not bothered right now where the
extraction with creating some kind of
extractions because we experimented we
did not mean we do not know even what to
be getting half at the end so first of
all let's import request from our
request promise and I'm gonna import
parser parse string from XML to GS ex-mo
right yeah okay so now we can make the
request so good I get requests get and
here where I want to have the request so
let's go back to here and we'll see the
request is looking like this so I'm
going to just base code here you can see
that we have key and instead of this
query we need to have our query and we
get it from request query peer so that's
how we making the request to our API so
in this query have what user typed in
the
search field okay and then we'll have
the response the result so let's have a
look
response Jason result I just want to
have a look what kind of data we get in
the end so if you go on back here I just
reload the page now let's make requests
okay so in the end we have results an
XML document nice so now we can actually
work with this XML document so let's
have a look what we have if we parse
yeah we need to pass it but this parse
train actually it takes the callback so
we'll have our string we parse results
train into it and the callback is error
and then the result of our parse trains
we're gonna let's call it good reads
result okay and what I want to do I'm
gonna response JSON with good reads
result okay let's have a look can reload
the page make the request and it loops
and now here what we have so we have in
the result we have good response inside
of it we have requests in the search the
search is what we interested in inside
the research so even if the child has
only one element it still will will be
parsed into an array so we have search
and we need the first one and then we'll
have the results and the results will
have works and here are our proposition
to the for for the books and inside of
it will have all of this thing that we
saw before so now we can use them use
this data and generate the object that
when you want to have so let's do this
so here is the thing that we want to
have so as say books and now we need to
map through the results
so we'll do with Goodreads results then
we'll have good reads response inside of
it we have search first one inside of
the search we have results also the
first one and inside of it we'll have
work and then these amazingly named just
in singular work but that's an array and
so we'll have work and we're is we
respond with object and we want to have
this kind of object here so I'm gonna
just copy and paste it here and I'm
gonna remove comments okay so the
problem with this is that we do not have
pages unfortunately I'm gonna delete it
and we'll have only one cover but still
we're gonna use the erase stuff here so
for the Goodreads again we need to drill
down we need to drill down so as you can
see here we'll have in this in this work
will have the best book inside of this
best book will have the title will have
the ID inside of this ID will have
underscore which is the ID so we'll have
work dot best book first one then we
have the ID first one as well and then
we'll have on the school so this is the
ID for the title will do very simple
similar similar thing we have the best
book inside of it will have title the
first one so for authors okay work best
book the first one and then we'll have
let's have a look so we have author and
inside of this author we have name and
all of these are arrays so we have
author first one and then we have name
first one as well and for covers we'll
use work best book first one and instead
we will have image URL also first one
like this okay
well let's try it out
ah let's print 90-84
we make a request and here we go we have
the results 1984 10 results for
different kind of works that was found
here so if we choose the first one the
most popular one we have the George
Orwell's 1984 but without page counts
huh that's a bummer you can still go
back to this list and look for another
book and for another book because we
actually made one request and we cashed
everything in there so that's quite
convenient but if you want to have
another book like Harry Potter for
example making requests and here we go
Sorcerer's Stone for example good looks
looks pretty good pretty decent so the
things that we can actually change and
what I propose you to do and maybe and
we will do it in the next episode as
well but what I want you to try out if
you have some time and desire to do is
to implement it manually so first of all
first idea is right here you can see
that it's quite not pleasant to look at
maybe you can change it to add author of
the book so by JK JK Rowling for example
or maybe you can even add here the
little small image of the book it should
be better for from the user point of
experience also the the most important
part here is when user chooses the book
clicks on it you need to make another
request to the server and get pages and
for example rating of the book and
Goodreads link to this book so for that
you need to read through and experiments
with the Goodreads API and have some fun
with it in the process ok so try it out
on the weekends and in the next episode
we'll
we'll see what we can do to improve this
thing and then we're gonna save this
book in our personal database and we can
move forward from it
