right well I'm back from holiday season
so let's continue where we left off we
implemented game creation but we cannot
see the result yet so that's what we're
going to do in this episode we'll finish
with index patch and also we'll talk a
little bit about very important topic
which you need to consider early in
development as possible relationships
between client application and server so
right now in games released component
all we have is a simple dummy functional
component and this component gets games
collection via props but does nothing
with it so far and we pass this data
from games page and here is where we
fetch them so basically we have
everything we need to implement index
page we just need to iterate through
collection and render it so let's do it
we go to games list component so here
instead of this dummy tags we need to
iterate and return an array of
components so let's enclose our list in
deep with class UI for cards these are
cool semantic UI classes that will align
cards for us next we map through games
and return game card component this
component will take game as prop and we
need to provide key for react so we use
game ID for that of course we need to
improve this component so let's go to
the top of the file and import game card
from game card now let's create game
card JS file and here let's define
another functional component it takes a
game prop and let's define this prop in
prop types right away its object prop
and it is required this deve has cost
you why card inside will have two lives
with clauses image and content and
inside of content will have header in
image we ran the image tag and set
source to game that cover and also will
specify else prop as well game cover and
in header we ran the game dot title and
that's it if we go now to index page we
see the game cool so let's add another
one we had seasons we provide thumbnail
and let me submit the game we are
redirected to index page and see this
game right away well that's a lie
actually and that's the segue to
important topic I mentioned earlier but
first let's go to server code and add
time out of two seconds so we can see
the problem so we just wrap our route
code in set timeout and set to thousand
milliseconds now let's go to add new
game page and add another game
quadropple is this time so press save
and now you can see the problem we make
an request to server to fetch game so it
takes those two seconds to run the game
here but we see the previous two games
right away what we missed is we didn't
add this new game to read a store right
away when we just created it but that
gives us the reason to talk about how
you want to design communication between
client application and back-end server
so roughly there are three ways you can
do it first one is traditional Ajax
approach every time we revisit page from
make Ajax request a server during which
we render loading indicator let me show
you what I mean here is a type form
service excellent service for creating
forms and as you can see when I change
page inside menu every time I do it I
see loading indicator no caching is
happening on the client well if you want
this kind of experience then you don't
need to use redux at all just use pure
react and store stating components
because you will research data every
time component mounts second approach is
the most common one for redux
applications cache data on clients in
redux store while doing the same a
Jaques request in the background in this
case we see results almost immediately
and we can be sure the data is
up-to-date because we make backgrounds
to request and if something changes our
UI will be updated accordingly and the
third approach is real-time application
approach which works perfectly with
redux with this approach server will
push data to client when it needs to and
client will get data and update UI no
need for ex the background request to
make sure that data sync just a dream
okay so most of the time for the most of
the projects out there you'll be good
with the second approach that we are
implementing here so let's fix this
issue for that let's open actions J's
file and in our create game redux func
action we need to add another than
and where we will dispatch pure action
so we are then it gets data and we
dispatch ad game action and pass data
dot game to it next let's define ad game
action create a function and it usually
just returns action objects with type @
game and game data and let's define
constant at game cool we have action now
we need to react to it in our reducers
or let's open games reducer here let's
import add game constant from actions
and then add new case for this add game
and here we return your array that
contains all items from current state
and we add new item action that game and
that's it let's try it out so we go to
new game page and create new one or get
a quest and when we per save ban we
immediately see this game added to our
collection and we still making request
to server just to be sure that data is
up-to-date acts on so let's remove
timeout from server code so back to
server digest file and remove this two
lines and that's it for this episode if
