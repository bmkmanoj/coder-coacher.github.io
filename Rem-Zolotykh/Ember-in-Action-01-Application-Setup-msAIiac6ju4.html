episode one application setup in this
episode we install ember CLI generate
amber application have a look at a
project structure and see how to install
java script packages via our by
installing bootstrap framework so let's
get started so first we need to install
needed tools first is now jazz with NPM
you can install it for your operating
system just by going to official site
i'm on mac and prefer to use homebrew
for this kind of things but you can do
anything you like and which is more
comfortable for you after you have no JS
installed you're ready to go so now
let's use NPM install dash g for global
install and we installed globally ember
CLI package and as well we will need to
install power package manager phantom GS
to run our tests right in the terminal
without the need of actual browser and
watch men that's for unix system to have
much faster file watcher it will take
some time to install so be patient ok
everything is install so we are ready to
create our application first let's check
out amber version and the lightest
version for now is 0 2.7 ok so amber new
and the name of our application will be
bookworm this command creates new
application and then installs all needed
packages via npm and Bauer so it may
take some time to complete as well ok
everything went fine so let's CD into
this newly created project and let's
open it in text editor of your choice ok
here is I just open the Brock file in
this project in Emacs and let's have a
look in the file tree so you can see
that the git repositories were already
there it's initialized for us and that's
nice we'll use get as our version
control system and code will be freely
available on github the two folders
bower components and node modules our
folders were all libraries are stores so
for example in bar component you can see
we have amber and all these libraries
and you can read the source code of this
i bruise as well yep folder is where
we'll spend most of our time here you
can see the scaffold for our future
application it is organized by types of
entities like controllers templates etc
but it's possible to organize your files
by features using port structure we will
see how to do it in late episodes here
in config folder you have your
environment configuration file where you
can specify options for different
environments public folder is the folder
which will be copied as it is into the
root of your built application and built
application itself will be found in dist
folder which will be created when we run
amber server this is the content that
will be deployed to the server and of
course we have here tests folder where
all the testing harness and test
themselves are stored so now let's run
amber server so I open terminal here and
I run amber server or just amber s ok so
now if you open file tree and let's
refresh it we will see the dist folder
here and here we have all acids and bday
to jazz and everything that is really
needed everything is compressed and
minimized by broccoli so if you go to
browser and we go to the local host 4200
you will see welcome to mj's everything
works fine which is good thing so now
let's install bootstrap framework to
install any JavaScript package we can
and should use Bower package manager for
it so I'm going back to terminal and
here i will use command bower install
that they're safe and this sigh pop shun
needed to include it in borrowed JSON
file where all dependencies for this
project are stored and then the name of
the package bootstrap so it will
download all files and now this files
can be found in bower components you can
see here bootstrap dist CSS and
bootstrap CSS here and javascript here
as well now how we include it in our
project ember CLI uses Brock
to compile all you CSS and JavaScript
files into one minimized one so i have
this brock file open here it's right
here in the root of the project Brock
file and here you have all the
instructions what to do so we have this
application instantiate it and now we
use import okay i'm going to open again
our file tree and now we need to include
this bootstrap CSS file there so we do
it like this bower components bootstrap
dist CSS bootstrap CSS and that will
include and minimize bootstrap framework
Ross another thing that we need to do
with bootstrap is to include map but to
include ma'am we also need to specify
destination directory to be assets like
this and the last thing is to include
JavaScript so we go to dist Jas
bootstrap GS let's save it go back to
terminal and let's run amber server
again now if you go back to browser and
reload the page you will see that our
Stalin is in place and that's basically
how you can install third-party
libraries into amber application of
course there are another way create
embassy light Adam but this is a topic
we'll get our hands on much lighter if
