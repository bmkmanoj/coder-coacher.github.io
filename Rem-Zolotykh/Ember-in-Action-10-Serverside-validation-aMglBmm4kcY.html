episode 10 server-side form validation
in this episode we'll add server-side
relation to the mix remember no matter
how good your client side validation is
you must validate data on server because
client-side validation can be easily
ignored so first we'll implement server
validation for booktitle uniqueness both
for creating you book or update an
existing one then we see how we can
extract function and then import and use
it in places we need it and then we'll
improve our client side validation will
run validations not on Form submit like
we do now but on focus out so let's get
started first of all let's open book
form dodge ES File this is the code of
our component and here we create errors
object in component itself and then
later we validate it on the client side
right here but our components can't
communicate with server or amber Tate
model this happens in the route so what
we need to do is to path error object
from route to component just like we
passbook object so for that let's open
ugs route and here where we set book
model we also set errors object which is
d s errors create and now at the top of
course we need to import diaz from amber
data now we need to go to new data HBS
file and here pass errors from the
controller into the component like this
so now go back to component and we need
to delete these errors from here so
let's go to New dgs route and here we
had action create book which we moved to
books GS so let's move it back we'll use
it from there so I'm going to cut it and
paste it into here so now if the book
saves we just redirect to books that
book route but if not we catch the error
response from server and it will have
some
and a response object and then we need
to parse this response object and
populate errors object from it but for
that of course we need some kind of
response from the server so let's go to
marks of our books and here is our post
route so we will introduce the
uniqueness validation so the title of
new book must be unique that means that
we need an array of titles we'll just
call it book titles and then we iterate
through books and push into book titles
we push item data title so this is the
simple map basically we just create a
new array of all titles that we have now
in database and then we need to search
for the new books title in this array so
we do book titles index of new book
title and if it not equals to minus 1
that means that new book's title was
found in books title so we need to
respond with error otherwise we respond
with all things that we had before so
let's move them and indent them in this
case though we respond with status let's
say four hundred and then we send errors
object again in JSON API format will
have errors object which is an array of
objects and inside of it we have object
which has source which is basically the
source of the error so we specify the
pointer to the source of the error is
data attributes title and then we
provide the detail about this error must
be unique ok so if title is not unique
we respond with this error so now we
need to go back to our out and parse
this error so we do respond errors for
each we iterate through it a code error
and then we need to get these particular
errors and populate it to do that we can
just define
errors variable which can be this dot
controller for this route books that new
and then we get errors so this way we
get this object right from the books new
controller and then we can use it right
here and pap you and populate it so we
do errors that ad then we need some kind
of an attribute we need to know what
attribute generated an error and we have
this information in our response and the
message is also right from the response
which is Error that detail so now we
need to create this attribute which is
basically error that source that pointer
then we split this pointer by slash and
then we take the third item so if we go
back to the mock you will see that we
have a point and the first one will be
empty string than data than attributes
and then title so the title is what
we're looking for there's the attributes
name and let the third index in an array
okay so that should do it let's go to
browser let's go to our books and try to
add new book with existing title and now
if we add book will see that we have
here the post request which returns bed
request four hundred and then we see
must be unique validation message so if
we fix it and submit it works okay we
need to do the same thing with editing
so right now if I try to change it to
this one I can update it we can't allow
this so let's do basically we we need to
do the same thing so from books here I'm
going to cut this update book back to
EDG as file in here I also need to
adhere the errors and of course to
import diaz from amber data and then
right from the new here i'm going to
copy and paste this catch block why
this and here I need to define errors to
be this control for this time there's
going to be books that edit get errors
of course I need to go to edit data HBS
file and pass this are subject to
component so now we need again to change
the server side code so we scroll down
here to the patch route and here as well
we need to have book titles but this
time is going to be a little bit
different so we have books for each and
we need to check for the current book
title so if item that ad is not the same
as percent book ID only then only in
this case we push item that title into
this book titles so this way we can
update the current book otherwise it
will not pass the validation of the
uniqueness and then we do the same thing
I'm going just to copy it from here and
paste it down here let's send nth it and
close bracket here so next we need to
change this new book two books errors
that title and we good to go let's have
a look in the browser so let's try to
edit this book and rename it to Hamlet
and when we are trying to update it it
must be unique we can update the book
with the title that already has been
taken but if you go with the previous
thing here and just change the author it
works excellent so this is very basic
server side validation combined with
client side validation of course there
are a lot of room for improvement one
thing to improve is this thing here in
you dodgy as we have these four lines of
code and in adedeji as we have
absolutely the same these four lines of
code so it would be cool to extract them
right
let's have a look how we can extract
function and then with the help of MS Li
and s6 just import it where we need it
so instead of this four lines what we
want to have is some kind of server
errors parser and then we pass response
there and errors okay so now we can
remove this from here and then the top
we need to import this server errors
parser so we do it like this import
server errors parser from and let's
place it into utils folder and we call
it again server errors parser okay so
now we need to create this file in app
utils we create server errors parser
dodges file and inside of here we export
default function and paste the code into
here so this function takes response and
errors we just create separate file with
this function we export default it and
then we input it where we actually need
to use it so let's try it out in the
browser let's have a look can we edit
the book so again let's do Hamlet and it
still works at font so now we can do the
same thing in new round here i'm going
to import it and then here i'm going to
use it response and errors and is it
this way you can extract functions or
objects and then import them in files
you need okay so the last bonus thing
that we're going to do is in this
episode is validation on blur so right
now we validate when we submit the form
wouldn't it be cool and more user
friendly to run failed validation when
user is done with particular field I say
yes so it's quite easy to do first of
all we need to go to our book form the
HBS file where we have our form and
inside of this input fields we add
action
for this field it's going to be validate
tidal action and it happens on focus out
and for this one for book author is
going to be validate author also on
focus out so now we need to define this
validates author and validate title in
our book formed RGS so here we have
actions and we add validate title and
this function takes value which is the
value of the input field and we just
call this validate title with this value
and the same thing we do with author
validate author okay so now we need to
define this two methods let's do it
right here validate title is a function
with value and we going to cut it from
here and paste it into here also a good
thing to do is to reset era before
validation so we do this get errors and
we want to remove in this case all
errors for the title attribute and then
we populate it again and here we just
call it this validate title with this
get title of course here i need to
replace these get book title with value
and the same thing with validate author
so i'm going to cut it from here these
validate otha these get author and here
at the bottom validate author i'm going
to just paste it into here and again
change this thing to value and add
errors remove author so this way we have
two methods validate title and validate
author and the whole validation is just
simple list of all validations we need
to do so we reset errors first then we
run below the title then we run
validate author and then we return the
result of it oh and I of course made
here the mistake we have book title and
book author okay so let's have a look so
now they go to form and just step out
from this title I have an error which is
cool if I type something the error is
gone and i still have my server side
validation so if i provide the existing
title and try to add book i have must be
unique era but if i provide something
else it works that's it for this episode
