take JSON web token that was returned
from server we save it in local storage
and we included in every agent request
we do then we need to store
authenticated user details in Redux
store so we can use it later so let's
get started first let's save it in a
local storage so let's open editor and
let's go to actions log in and while we
here let's rename it because it's not a
good name so I'm going to rename let's
call it our actions digest and also as
we use it in our form let's go to login
form and right here instead of logging
let's do our factions yes ok so let's go
back to action and here we have this
access request so it returns promise so
we can have our then with response data
and after we get the response we can get
token from response data token and now
we free to save it in local storage set
item and we call it short token like
this and that's it let's have a look in
the browser so here in a chrome this is
the new chrome I just updated it day ago
and it changed a little bit the name of
the tabs so before it was resources now
you can go to application and here you
can see the local storage and localhost
3000 ok so now let's try tool again with
valid credentials and here we go we have
your token saved in local storage so
next we need to include this token with
each Ajax request as authorization
header let's go back to editor and let's
create a new file with this function so
in client will create new folder utils
and inside of it set authorization token
yes so we're going to import access and
let's expert default function set off
the relation token this function will
take token and if we provide some token
we want to
Hatter's to every request and we can do
it so let's do if token and we can do it
with access defaults headers common and
we specify authorization header and it
equals to the standard is to have bearer
word plus token itself okay so if we
have token if you provided some token we
set default header of the relation to
equal to Bearer and this token and if
you pass false then we want to delete
this access defaults headers common
authorization and here have very stupid
mistake I forgot to add function keyword
here ah now it's good okay so if we
provide the token we add authorization
header to every request after that else
we delete this authorization header so
now we can use this function in two
places first when we login in login
action as well as user reloads the page
so let's go back to our our actions into
our login action let's import set off
the relation token from UTS set
authorization token and right here we're
just going to call it with token let's
save it and let's have a look in the
browser so I'm going to reload the page
and I go and I'm going to network tab
here so now if I log in you can see that
I'm making request and no header here
whatsoever that if I making another
request no matter what kind of request
you'll see that we have authorization
header excellent but again if I reload
the page and try to log in again we will
lose this authorization token so now we
need to add this function call to index
file so let's open client index and
right here after we define our store
let's call a set of theorization token
with local storage dot token
like this and we need to import set of
theorization token from you Till's set
authorization token so now if you reload
the page and try to login
we'll have our authorization token right
away and of course if we go to
application of our local storage and
remove it and reload the page and try to
log in add no authorization token here
so now we have token and we included in
each request but we also want to store
current user info in your duck store
this way we can check if user is signed
in on client and have basic info about
user like username appetite cetera so we
need to dispatch another action that
will set current user after login action
but first we need to decode your token
to get this info so let's go back to
editor and let's go to our actions and
here let's decode token and for that
we're going to import short from JSON
web token and here let's cancel the flog
Gorge decode token and if we try it now
and if you go back to our server here
you can see that we have an error we
cannot resolve module net and end module
DNS JSON web token uses some
dependencies that conflict with browser
because there are no such models as net
or DNS in this context so we need to
cancel them out in web pack config so
let's open web pack config and here at
the bottom let's add another note field
and inside of this node we'll get net
empty and DNS empty as well and now if
we save it and restart server no errors
excellent and if you go back to browser
let's reload the page and let's login in
console we see the object ID and
username excellent it works so token is
decoded successfully and now this object
this information I want to
or in Redux store so for that we need to
add another piece of store to our
relaxer also let's open root reduce them
and inside of it we're going to add out
reducer so let's copy this then here out
so let's create one in reducers out Gs
so we create reduce them and initial
state is going to be let's set it to
initial state and let's define constant
initial state here and that's going to
be just a simple object with is
authenticated field which is by default
is false and user details which by
default is an empty object like this so
now we need to add action to set current
user and set is authenticated to true so
let's start from reduce reaction to this
action so here we will have the case set
current user and when we have this kind
of action we want to return is
authenticated to be equal not is empty
action user and the user itself is going
to be action user so this action will
contain user object if this object is
empty then we said is authenticated to
false otherwise it's true and we save
user object here as well so now we need
to import set current to use a constant
from action types and let's open types
and create this constant ok good so now
we need to create action itself so let's
go to out actions and here let's define
another action that we go and call set
current user and it takes user user
object and we return that's the pure
redux function so we return type to be
set current user and user equals user
and of course we need to import set
current user
from types and I think that I made a
mistake here yep I did
so let's surround it with color braces
like this okay so now we have set
current user action that sets current
user into our store so all that we need
to do right now is just dispatch this
action from here so instead of
console.log it we go into dispatch set
current user and we provide decoded
token which is user object like this
let's have a look at the browser so now
if you go to redux right here you can
see that both is empty so now I'm going
to login and I have an error oh of
course
is empty I forgot let's go to our
producer and also import is empty from
lodash is empty and let's try it again
so I'm going to login and now you can
see that we have these authenticated set
to true and user set to user object
excellent of course if you roll the page
we lose this data but actually we we
need to store them so let's fix it for
that we go to index and right here we'll
run this code only if local storage dot
token is there so if it's there we want
to set it as well as we want to dispatch
set current user action so we call store
dispatch set current user and we have
jort decode local storage dot token so
now we need to import several things
first of all we need to import job from
JSON web token and also we need to
import set current user from actions our
actions like this so now if you go back
to browser and reload the page you can
see that set current user
is dispatched and we have in our state
is authenticated set to true where the
user details of course if you want you
can extract this code and separate
functions so the index file is a little
bit cleaner but we'll stop here so let's
commit use Georgian client and set
current user in redux store so thanks
