is to validate data on server sent back
error status and messages and display
this errors to user so first let's
create server-side route for sign up for
that let's go to server index dot J's
file and right here after we define F we
gonna use route and sign user up is just
another fancy name for creating your
user record so we need to create post
request to users so here we define that
we will have API users and we will have
this users variable and we're going to
import this route users from routes
users so now it's created we have routes
users and to create route first we need
to import Express that's we're gonna do
all the time when we need to create new
route so we import Express we define in
router as Express that router and we
expert default this router so now we can
define the post request so we do router
post and just a slash because that's
what we want to do users we want to make
the post users request
so it takes request response and we have
our function here so good we have our
out now we need to get data from post
request and for this we need to parse
request data so we need to install
another middleware so let's go to
terminal and we install with safe body
parser so now we need to use it go back
to editor to index the GS we're going to
input body parser from body parser and
here we'll add app use body parser and
as we make in JSON requests we're going
to use JSON middleware so we use JSON
here so now the data will be available
to us in request body so let's have a
look in users here I'm going to console
that log request body
so now let's run seven reload the page
go to sign up add some data submit the
form now if we go back to terminal we'll
see that we have all data passed to our
route so now we can work with it
excellent ok so now that we can parse
input we can validate it for now we'll
do this right here in our route file and
later we'll extract it so we're gonna
use validator and an input value data
package from validator let's install it
right away so I do not forget to do it
install save validator
ok what we want to do is to run validate
input function so we do validate input
and we pass the request body to it so
this validating put function will return
some data for example return Val is
valid and errors so we define constant
here to be errors and is valid and ease
valves is just a shortcut it's basically
you will see it in a minute how we use
it but it's much more readable we can
just do if not valid then what we want
to do we want to response with status
400 with Jason containing this errors so
now we need to define our function and
for now we can do it right here so we
have validate input and it takes some
data and it's gonna return object with
errors and is valid and errors actually
will be the empty object in the
beginning and when we have some kind of
error we can add fields to this object
so is valid on the other hand is just
the check for is empty so if this object
is empty then data is valid so we're
going to use this is empty from lodash
is empty ok so now we need to define our
validation rules we have 4 5
and all of these fields are required so
this is our first validation so we do if
the data is now and we take it for email
then we push errors email we define new
field email is required or we could do
it a little bit more generic this field
is required for now so now I'm giving
just copy and duplicate these four
fields here and and change email to
password as well as change email to
password confirmation and email to
timezone okay so all these fields
required and also we need to check that
we have a valid email so we do if not
validator
is email so if not if it's not email
data that email then we want to add
another error to our email which you're
going to be email is invalid so very
simple basic validation rules another
rule that you want to add is password
matching password confirmation so let's
do it right after our password
confirmation we do if not valid data
equals and we compare two strings data
password and data password confirmation
so if they are not equal we add errors
to password information that tells us
that passwords must match okay and
that's it for our validations let's save
it and let's try it out in a run server
again go back to browser I'm going to
reload the page and let's submit it and
we have 400 Terra let's have a look and
here we go
we have email password password
confirmation and timezone as errors
that's exactly what we wanted to have
okay so our validation works and we got
the error response from the server so
now we need to display these error
messages on the client so let's do this
so let's go to our signup page
sorry sign-up form and here where we
have our onsubmit remember that our
action returns promise so we can use it
in our form component so we can do it
like this then if everything goes well
we will have some kind of event handler
here and if something goes bad like in
our case we got a response with data in
it and that's gonna be our errors and
inside of it we'll just do this set
state errors to equal this data so very
simple if we get the error status we get
the data here and we set state errors to
this data okay so now we get this if we
go back here and try it out let's submit
it and now we go to react here and let's
find our form you'll see that we have
errors and all these errors are in our
state which is excellent we can use this
errors to display error messages in the
form so let's add errors here as well as
an empty object and also when we submit
the first thing that we need to do is
set state for errors to be back to am
charges so every time when we submit the
form we want to clay errors and then if
there are any errors we just relate this
state okay so now let's display this
errors in the form so let's start from
the username here and it's very easy
what we do is we check so let's just
grab this errors in a constant right
here you have errors this state ok so
now that we have this errors we can do
errors that's username so if there is
such a thing as username in errors then
we want to display span with class name
help block that's the bootstrap class
name for it and we want to display this
errors username
okay so let's save it go back to browser
now we submit the page
okay nothing happens and now that
happens because I forgot about the
username how fun is that so let's go
back to our users here I started with
email I forgot totally about the
username so let's duplicate it and it's
username here okay let's try it out
again so now if I submit okay we have
this field is required excellent we get
our error message from the server but
that's not cool enough we still need to
add has error class to form groups so it
gets all red so for that we'll use
another package class names so let's
install it then install it and p.m.
install save class names which allows us
to have conditional class names I'm
going to run server again and here in
our component in a form group instead of
using this class name form group we're
going to use class names and this form
group is actually what we want to do by
default no matter what but another one
that has error class it's conditional so
we have has error in the case when
errors user name is there
so if we have error in user name we have
this class and of course we need to
import class names from class names
let's save it go back to browser let's
roll the page and try to submit it once
more
once again click class name is not
defined another type I think class names
okay let's try it again so now if I hit
sign up we have this field is acquired
in its read nice so now that we have
this beautiful style and let's do it for
the all fields in this form and I'll do
behind the scenes like this so I updated
everything added class names to all
fields and errors to all fields with
proper
field names so now if we go back to
browser you can see that everything is
red which is awesome okay the last thing
the last final small touches let's make
the sign-up button disabled when we are
making requests and back to enable when
we done so it's very easy to do we go to
our component here and on submit will
introduce another fields to our state
we'll call it is loading and by default
it's false so now when we submit stop
before we do that we set state here is
loading to be true and when we done we
set it to is loading to be false okay so
now we can use this is loading on our
submit button
so we'll do disabled to be this state is
loading let's save it go back to browser
so now when we click it you can see it
right now because it's too fast but it
becomes disabled and then enabled so to
have a better look at it let's go back
to users here in our route and let's
enclose it in to set timeout so we do
set timeout for 5 seconds I say and now
if we try it out you can see that we
have sign up disabled all errors are
cleared and we'll be done it's back to
active excellent I'm gonna remove of
course this set timeout stuff ok we've
done for this episode so let's commit
ads server-side validations so that's it
for this episode thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
