is to rent our first react component for
this we need to install and set up react
stuff into our project as well as web
pack to bundle all our code together so
let's get down to business so let's open
index.html file here and let's remove
this hello world example from here
instead of it we're going to add deep
with ad app this is where the whole
react application will be rendered so
now let's create entry point for our
front-end application so in root folder
of our project let's create client
folder and inside of it index dot JS
file so first that we want to do is we
want to input react from react which we
haven't installed yet of course then we
want to import render from react Dom and
then we want to import app from
components app so this is the very
simple component that we going to create
in a moment and that we want to render
on a page and after that we actually
render this app component to document
and we get element by ID in our case app
which is corresponding to this app here
ok so now we need to create this
component app so we go to client we
create folder components and here AB dot
yes so it's very simple component here
we're going to go with functional
components we input react from react and
then we export default function which
returns hello world
so we hello from react ok save it so and
of course we need to install react and
react dome so we do npm install save
react and react down ok that's nice but
now we need to bundle this code and
include it into our HTML page
so let's go back to index dot HTML in
our editor so here we add script tag and
it's real point to bundle GS and that's
it that's all that we need to do here so
webpack will bundle all the things all
client stuff into one bundle GS file and
then it will serve it so now we go into
the funniest part the configuring web
back I'm excited so we'll make baby
steps as usual and only configure things
we need phone now as we use Express
we're going to use webpack def
middleware package so let's go to index
GS and seven and here we're going to
import several packages we're going to
input backpack from web pack we're going
to import web pack meter wire from web
pack def middleware package and then
we're going to use this web pack
middleware so we on our app we use meter
where web pack middleware here and it
takes a compiler and a compiler is the
web pack function which is run with web
pack config okay so we need this web
config and we going to import it from
root folder of our project and we call
it web pack dot config dev GS okay so
now we need to create this config so
let's create web pack that config dot
dev GS and inside of it we export
default object the configuration object
and the two things that we must provide
is an entry which is going to be the
client index file so we again use path
join we're going to take to their name
and client index GS and the second thing
which means-- must provide is output and
for our purposes we need to provide path
and we can specify any part here because
middle
actually doesn't care about it because
middleware will serve this from memory
instead of creating the file the bundle
the actual bundle JS file it will serve
it from memory okay so now we have
configuration so let's install NPM
install save dev and we install web pack
and web pack def middleware okay done so
let's run server and try it out okay we
have an error first of all we do not
have path which is which makes total
sense I forgot to input path from path
let's try it again
and now we have another error so we have
unexpected token because web pack
doesn't know anything about JavaScript
so we need actually to instruct it how
to handle JavaScript files so we need to
use some kind of a loader so let's go
back here into our config and right here
let's define module and module is the
object where we have our loaders loaders
is an array and here an array of objects
and here we provide first of all we
provide test so what kind of files we
want to search for and in our case it's
going to be GS with at the end of the
file so G as extension also I like to
provide include which is going to be
path join DM as usual and client so I
include only J's files from client
folder and the last one the most
important one is loaders that we want to
apply to these files and our loader is
babel also we need to provide resolve
and provide extensions for it as mt 1
and s GS with top of course so as a
loader here we specify Bible and this
loader will transpile es6 code
so if we run it now we'll see that
cannot resolve module Babel because we
actually haven't installed it so let's
do that
npm install save deaf bible loader okay
let's run it again so now we have
another well now we have syntax error
and babel does dennis stand react by
default so we actually need to provide
another press set for be able to
understand react so let's do this let's
open our babel RC file and inside of
here we're going to add another press it
we call it react and of course we need
to install it so we do npm install save
to have babel press it react okay we've
come a long way what we have now hmm it
seems like everything's working so let's
go to browser reload the page and now we
have hello from react excellent
if we open developer tools and go to
react you can see that we have stateless
component here cool
okay now our web pack config here let's
add another thing which is dev tools
eval source map so we have source map so
we won't lose our minds while debugging
and basically that's it we accomplished
our goal to render out first react
component on the page so here is the
result of our work so let's edit and
commit so that's it for this episode
