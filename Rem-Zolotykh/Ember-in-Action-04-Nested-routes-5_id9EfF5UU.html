episode for nested routes in this
episode we'll see how easy it is to
implement NASA droughts in ember.js by
creating books details page so let's get
started
so we start from the UI so let's define
links in books list component so let's
open books list component and here right
now we just have a simple links so we'll
use link to helper which will point to
books book route so that's the way we
specify nested route and this route
takes one argument the book itself
because we want to display the details
of particular book right and of course
we need to specify class list group item
like this after that we have book title
as we did before and after that we need
to close link to helper like this so now
if we go to browser and try to go to the
books you'll see that we have an error
we do not have route books book so let's
define one for that we need to go to
router file and inside of this route
books route we define function call back
and inside of it we define new route
which we call book but this route also
will take path and inside of this path
we can specify anything but the most
important thing that we want to specify
is the argument book ID so this will
lead to something like this books and ID
3 for example so this part of the books
is coming from the parent route and 3
here is the book ID coming from the
child route so now we define it let's go
back to browser we have no errors
excellent but we have some problems with
oh yeah of course not nothing like this
list group ok
so now if we go back we're going back to
normal no errors but now if we go to the
details nothing happens but you can see
that the active link is working so our
routes is working and you can see
they're changing
right here so now we need to define
inside of this books template the child
template with the books detail right
here so for that we need to go to books
dot HBS file in templates and here in
the second column will add outlet so
instead of this outlet the template of
the netted route will be rendered let's
save it so now we need to define this
template as this template is nested in
books template we need to create a new
folder called books so if we go to our
files here as you can see we we are in
templates and inside of these templates
we have books that HBS file and we need
to create new folder books and inside of
this folder will create book that HP s
so you can see that the file structure
mirrors user interface hierarchy ok
everything that we need to do in this
route template is to render book details
component and of course this component
will need to have a book and will assign
it from the controllers book which we do
not have yet let's save it and let's
define this book details component
template again we go to templates in
components we create book details dot
HBS so that's going to be very simple
one we just have this h1 and inside of
it we'll have book title and after that
small tag by book author and then we'll
have some kind of a deal with book
description easy as that so now let's go
to browser and you can see that we have
this by word that's nice
so template and its component is
actually rendering but we do not have
any data so we need to define book in
this book controller right and we do it
in the route
so let's explicitly define route so we
go to routes and again we have a nested
route and to define method route as we
did with nest
templates we need to define it in the
parent folder in our case that's going
to be books and then book that GS so
here is usual stuff we import number
remember we export the default amber out
extent standard stuff here and again
we'll have model hook which is the
function but now this function takes
params object and that params object
will have book ID attribute so we return
this store find book but now we need to
specify the ID of the book that we want
to return and we do it with params dot
bulk ID and this book ID is actually
coming from router right here ok after
that we need to create setup controller
there's a function which takes
controller and model now case model is a
book and we have controller that's at
book to be model let's save it let's go
to the browser and now you can see the
details of our books excellent if you
refresh the page it will fetch it and
display the actual book and now if we
look into Network you'll see that we
only make in one request to the server
books and it returns all books from the
server and then when we switch in and go
in from router out no other requests are
made because Amba data cache this
collection and fetch data right from it
which makes an experience very desktop
like how cool is that and that's it for
