we'll continue where we left off will
implement post request to server learn
about Express middleware and prepare
everything to catch errors from server
before we begin just a quick note if you
want me to get back to you as soon as an
later post your comments and questions
in comment section and associated blog
post youtube comment system is pretty
bad link in the description back to our
form component here if client-side
validation was successful we need to
dispatch thank action so let's define is
valid constant our form is valid if
errors object is empty and we can use
es6 object keys method pass errors
object and check its length if it's
equal to 0 then it means that form is
valid now let's check if is valid is
true then we call this props savegame
thunk action and pass game data to it
title and cover let's get this data from
state with Const title cover equals this
state
this action will return promise and we
need to react to it either redirect to
games list page if everything's ok or
render error messages that server
responded with so in our case when form
is valid first we want to display
Loudoun State I always prefer to have
visual loading indication when user
submits form like disabling submit
button or rendering Ajax indicator or
something like that and semantic UI has
excellent loading state so let's use it
to our advantage let's comment out save
game call for now let's add load into
state and default is false and then in
handle submit we set state to change
loading to true and after that let's use
class names on our form so we use class
names we keep static classes UI and form
and after that we add objects and one
conditional class innate loading which
is added if this state loading is true
and that's it let's see it in the
browser type something in the fields and
submit the form how cool is that ok so
now we need to dispatch action so let's
connect this component to redux first we
import connect from react redux and in
brut save game from action then go to
the bottom of the file
and wrap exported components into
connect function first argument is now
because we do not need to get any data
from global Upstate and second argument
is object of actions in our case just
one save game so going back to handle
submit and let's uncomment it so now we
need to define thunk action let's go to
action digest file and export another
function called save game that takes
data it is func action so it returns
another function that takes dispatch and
there we make post request with fetch
fetch returns promise that we also want
to return now we need to make post
request for that we provide second
argument to fetch function which is
options object there we specify method
to be post set body to be sent to server
fetch can only use string of form data
is body no JSON JavaScript objects so we
need to convert our data JavaScript
object into strewn with json stringify
data another very important thing to
remember when using fetch you must
specify everything in our case we make
JSON request so we need to specify had a
content type so we add headers object
and specify content type to equal
application slash JSON okay now in the
browser we can make request and we see
that it works as it should but now we
hand from UI point of view because we
don't have this endpoint yet and server
responds with error let's have a problem
as well
we want our server to be JSON API server
so we always expect it to respond with
some JSON and that's not what happens in
express by default so let's add special
404 middleware function that will
respond with jason so we can handle it
and client so let's go to server file
there we introduced last in chain
middleware so what is middleware you ask
well imagine it as a queue of functions
which are called one after another each
of these middleware functions either
pass execution further or stops it in
Express application all routes we define
are essentially middle words so URL is
checked if there is no match execution
continuous and next route and chain is
checked etc until proper route is found
in that case route code does its
business and pops out from execution
with rest that Jason Cole so if we
define middleware after all our routes
each will be run only if no other routes
stopped execution making it essentially
not found case so we define new
middleware function that takes request
response and next arguments we can omit
next because that's the last middleware
function in the chain inside we respond
with 404 status and Jason with global
era something went wrong I hate these
kind of messages and implications don't
have a do it so let's add some humor
still working on it please try again
later when we implement it oh that's
much better now users will love our
product whew we did it
we'll learn too little bit about middle
words and Express but why well because
that's a good thing to know and this
exact concept is used in redux
middlewares as well so hope that was a
time well-spent
now we need to catch it in client and
ran the errors in our components so
let's go to the action star JS file to
our fetch col let's chain then and we
use named function handle response later
we can extract it into separate file and
reuse it for every such request but for
now let's define it on the top of this
file so we define function handle
response this function takes response
argument then we check if response is
okay it means that response status code
is 200 something in this case will
convert response to jason and it will
return promise in case of error we
initialize new error object and pass
response status text there then we add
response to this object and then we
throw this error now back to the form
component we define then and pass two
arguments first function is the success
one and second function to catch era we
just through here we get response
invoked jason function this function
returns another promise so we use
another than and take errors from it and
then set state with errors and set loads
into false and let's render error
message if we have global errors so
let's add it below header so we check if
this does state that Earth's that global
is true and in that case we run the div
with class name UI negative message and
inside of it we run the P tag inside of
which we render this dot state that
errors dot global so let's write out in
browser and it's much better wow that
was a long side note sorry for that but
let's take break here and continue the
