time that I show my face here on YouTube
and that's because I want to make some
kind of a personal approach to the next
series that I'm working on and that I'm
really want to launch and this video is
interest check if you as my audience of
my subscribers are interested in this
kind of content and in this kind of
series so let me tell you what it is and
what it's all about so the purpose of
the series is to demonstrate you the
actual development workflow and how all
of these things work together what I
mean by this is that in this series
we're going to build actual web
application using react and no GS so
full stack JavaScript and we'll start
from clean slate from the empty folder
and we go to the production so the
application itself will be a little bit
simple it's not some complex stuff but
it's real nevertheless so the
application is for book lovers we call
it bookworm and the idea of this
application and the purpose of this
application is to manage your books
collection and track your reading
progress and then we can expand on this
topics on these features so as you can
imagine we'll have all essential
features of any web application we'll
have authentication and user
registration will have crud we'll have
different kind of entities and their
relationship to each other and we'll see
how to do how to develop this
application with the help of JavaScript
so what is this stack the stack is the
reactant Redux
on the front-end and a lot of other
stuff like normalizer we select etc and
on the backend will have no GS with
Express and Mongo to be for persistence
so this is our step pretty simple so
this way you will see how to use how all
of these technologies work together
and how even how to deploy all this
stuff what this series is not is it is
not an educational or tutorial like
series so this series is not where I
will explain things a lot or how react
works or what's this feature of via
sakes etc etc so this is actual
development with my commentary so if you
want to learn if you want to learn
something and you have you want to have
some kind of a progression from simple
concepts to complex ones and have some
exercises I'm working on the course for
a long time already and only two
chapters left in this course and it will
be available for you to purchase that's
gonna be a premium paid course also on
this YouTube channel I also have several
serious on-air six on functional
programming so stay tuned it's it's
gonna be pretty cool ok so this is the
gist of it so what this series why is it
special because here is how I want to do
that so every week on Monday on Monday
Wednesday and Friday I stand in front of
my computer I develop application and
record myself doing it with commentary
and all this stuff then I edit it so I
just cut down
I just I'm gonna just cut out some
embarrassing stuff or silences or
something like that but most of the time
it will be as you you know sitting
besides me and I just code and explain
you what I'm doing and then publish it
the same day and after that I do not and
I just communicate with you you can ask
your question we can discuss something
and after that and Wednesday for example
I can answer your questions in video
format and address issues that you
raised which is a cool thing also also
it's possible to have some kind of a
live coding on Twitch or here and
YouTube with with chat that can also be
interesting experience so this this
format is very new to me usually I do as
you know as you may know usually I
script my screen casts and I just do
them as as clean as possible as I can
but this new format for me staring at
the camera very new experience talking
right away from our from up bad without
script also quite difficult for me
because I'm not a native speaker and
that's also very important point because
I will make some mistakes in my speech
so yeah
bummer and that's basically it
so leave your feedback leave a comment
below what you're thinking about it
whether you like it or not and why the
most important reason is why especially
if you don't like the idea explain why
or you just can like or dislike this
video just to show me that you're
supporting this or not subscribe to this
channel you can shoot me an email or
tweet at me just let me know what what
your thoughts are also I already
recorded the first pilot episode of this
series and it will be uploaded on this
Wednesday so after that I'll see the the
feedback from you and we'll see whether
it's worth or not to continue with this
project so thank you very much for your
time and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
