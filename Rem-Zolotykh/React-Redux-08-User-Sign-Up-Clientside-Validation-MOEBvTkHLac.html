is to implement client-side validation
and in fact a form code a little bit so
now date is validated on server but
that's not cool to validate it only
there we use awesome top of the shelf
client-side tag so we must implement
validation on client as well actually we
already done almost everything for
client-side validation because for now
we need to run the same validation rules
on client as we did on server and as we
use JavaScript everywhere it makes it
easy to reuse code so let's do just that
so let's open our signup form so here in
submit I'm going to wrap this code that
dispatch actions and basically makes
this a checks request into this
conditional and I'll use this is valid
function to make sure that state is
valid okay so only in this case if it
returns true we make in this Ajax
request so now we need to define this
function and we'll reuse validate input
function we created earlier for our
server-side validation and it will take
this state object as a data and again
we're going to deconstruct it in
constants errors and is valid so now if
it's not valid then I want to set state
and populate state with errors from this
validation okay I can just do it like
this and at the end I want to return
this is valid so I can use this bool in
here to make sure that if it's valid we
make the server-side request if not we
just ignore everything from here so now
we need to extract this function we
created in routes users we created this
function here validate input so we're
going to cut it and let's create new
file in server we'll have shared folder
side of it will have validations and we
call it signup and we go into X
default dysfunction so it takes data and
it uses valid data so we need to import
valid data from valid data and here in
users we do not need to have validate
anymore
we do not need to have is empty as well
so is empty also going to be required
here all we need to do we need to import
this function validate input from shared
validations signup so we extracted this
function into separate file so now we
can require it from our component here
so let's import validate input function
from server shared validation signup
let's try it out
I'm going to save I'm going to run and
p.m. run server let's go to browser
reload the page and we have unexpected
token import and that happens because we
actually need to instruct web pack to
include this file into the bundle so
let's do this we're going to open web
pack config and we need to add new path
to include so we change it to be an
array of strings like this and we're
going to add another path join the name
and we'll use server shared let's save
it and let's rerun our server so now if
you go back reload the page no errors
everything works fine if you go to sign
up we still should have our validations
so our extracted function works fine
that's good news and as you can see we
do not making any network requests so
this is actually the client-side
validation right here to check that we
haven't broken anything with server-side
side let's remove this is valid and
we'll just return true go back here and
now if we press sign up we making the
request to server and validation works
as it would before so we've done with
validations excellent so now let's look
here in our markup we have a lot of
duplications here with this
form groups and that's not good if we
need to change this markup in the future
there's going to be a pain as we clearly
see this shameless duplication here we
can and should extract this in two
separate component so let's create a new
file in components folder we'll create
another folder called common and inside
of it we'll have text field group dot
yes so here we're going to create
functional component and we call it text
field group and first let's make sure
that we get this component API straight
so if you look here we need to pass
value we need to pass unchanged type
name and errors as well so let's define
text field group prop types
the first one is field the field name is
going to be string is required and I'm
going to copy most of them one two three
four five I'm gonna add commas here so
the next one is going to be value of
course we need value for input field
next we'll have label four from group
next we'll have error and error is not
actually required so I'm going to remove
it so it could be empty without any
errors the next one will be type because
input can be different types text
password email number etc and the last
one is going to be unchanged which is
actually not a string but a function
also most of the time input type will be
'text so let's define the default prop
for it so we use text field group
default props and type going to be text
by default so now let's deconstruct it
right here so we can easy access to them
so we're going to have field value label
error type and unchanged now let's
define the rest of the component it's
very easy it's just a markup stuff so
I'm going to paste it here like this
so we have the class name we have label
which uses label we have in
put with with all the fields and we have
error so the only thing we need to do is
to input class names from class names
okay so now back to our signup form so
here I can remove and change this for
text field groups and instead of them I
will paste the new one that we just
created text field group so and as you
can see we just declare error we just
declare label on change value and field
without any markup which is a good thing
so now we need to import it text field
group from components common components
technical group we still need class
names here because we use class names as
well in this time zone select and we
could extract select field as well but
let's postpone it until we get another
selecting the app until we get actual
duplication so let's save it go back to
browser and have a look I'm going to
refresh and it works nice so let's
commit adds client-side validation and
extracts text field group and that's it
