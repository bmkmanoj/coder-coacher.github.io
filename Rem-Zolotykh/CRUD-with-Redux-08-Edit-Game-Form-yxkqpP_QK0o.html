implement editing feature in this
episode we'll reuse the same form we use
to create new game and make it populate
fields with game data if we want to edit
a game so first let's add two buttons to
game card components let's open game
card component and add another section
to the bottom of it we define D with
extra content classes and inside of it
UI two buttons and inside of it UI basic
button twice
so first button is edit one so let's add
green clustered and the second one is
for deletion and let's add red class to
it for editing we going to create new
route for it
so let's import link from react router
and now let's change this deep tag
around edit to link tag and we need to
add prop two to it let points to game
and game ID now we need to define this
route so let's open F dash component and
here let's add another match it uses the
same component but route is different
game call an underscore ID this ID
parameter will be available to us in
game phone components props so let's
open game form component then now this
component take game ID and if it's
present it must make some additional job
first it must check if game with such
IDs present in Redux store and provided
to component next it must pin server to
get game details and if there is no ID
provided it must functional form for a
new game as it functioned before so
let's start from getting ID and look for
game in Redux store for that and connect
function instead of now we use maps data
props function let's define it and it
takes state and props as arguments if
there is a deeper am we return game that
we find in state games in call back here
we check the game ID must equal to ID
provided in params so otherwise
just set game to now next we need to
populate component state with data so in
state for each field we check if game is
defined and if so set it to appropriate
value otherwise we set default empty
value we do it for title and for cover
and also let's add ID field as well in
case of abstinence we set it to now and
if IDs now we need to create record and
if ID is defined we update record if we
go to browser now and navigate from
games page to edit game by clicking on
this edit button it works we see game
details pre-populated in form fields but
if we reload the page nothing why is
that well because when we reload page
Redux store is initialized in you and
there are no games in it let's see it by
ourselves in redux dev tools click on
state tab and you see that it's empty so
we need to make requests to server to
fetch game details by ad or we could
fetch all games like we did on games
page you're the one who must make this
choice and it depends on how you
communicate with data as we spoke in
previous episode in our case we'll make
requests to fetch one specific game by
ID so to our game form component we add
component did mount hook where we
dispatch fetch game action but we do it
only when we have ID provided in route
if there is no ID it means that there is
nothing to fetch and we create in new
game instead you can see that our phone
component becomes quite complex and does
a lot of things that has nothing to do
with form like it fetches data for some
reason that's the reason why I prefer to
use separate page components that
connects to Redux store and handle
station and mountain and just passes
data to form will reflect it in the next
episode but for now let's continue now
we need to add edge game action to
connect alongside create game here and
let's simple it from actions file so go
to action file and let's add stage game
function to it it takes ID argument and
it just fetches game by ad from API
games ID in then callback we need to
handle two scenarios first one is
is already in Riddick stole we need to
update it otherwise we add game to the
collection but we don't want and
actually can't handle it in action so we
will define another action let's call it
game fetched and let's reducer do the
logic so we dispatch game page then pass
game to it and next let's define it it
takes game and returns action with type
game fetched and game itself as payload
and we need to define constant as well
game paged equals to game touched good
so we making request and then dispatch
action so let's go to reducer to handle
it so first let's input game fetch
constant and next let's define this case
here first we search for gaming state we
define index constant and use find index
on state games to find game by ad if
index is more than negative 1 it means
the game was found in array in this case
iterate through games with map and for
element that has the same ID we return
action game for all others we just
returned item that's a common pattern
for updating objects in the right if no
such game was found we just add it to
the bottom of our collection as we did
in add game case good now we need to
create this route and back-end so let's
open server that JS file let's define
your route get API game's ID next we
need to find game by ad in database for
that we use find one methods on games
collection and provide query object with
underscore ID and here is the catch ID
that we have in our request is a simple
string but MongoDB works with object ID
objects by default so we need to create
such object and we do it with new
MongoDB dot object ID and provide string
ideas argument request parameters ID in
our case and if everything is ok we will
respond with JSON that contains this
game so let's go to the browser and test
it out hmm nothing here but if we will
look into network's tab you see that we
are making request and receive game
details back why don't we see anything
in the forum then well that happens
because
fetching game details from surveys a
synchronous section and when it's done
form component is already happily
rendered on to the page so going back to
game form here you can see that we even
run this function after component is
already mounted so if there was no game
in redux store then the game is now and
no entry is there to see we're done so
when data comes back and populates Redux
store as we can see in reduce dev tools
our component doesn't react to it so
what can we do well we can use yet
another lifecycle hook method component
will receive props it takes next props
as an argument so when it happens we
want to update state with set state and
inside we populate ID title and cover
with newly acquired props now we go to
the browser it works okay that's nice we
populate our form with data but if we
submit it now it creates new records
instead of updating existing one and
we'll handle game update in the next
episode if you found this video useful
