news I published my react course so if
you go to Jay's full stack comm you can
learn everything you need to know about
this course and it's I'm very excited
and I'm terrified because this is quite
new for me and yeah it's it scary for
some reason but I also want to give you
the coupon code discount for 10% with
just YouTube's love just use it to get
the discount on the course so this is
the first course that I want to build in
this series of full stack JavaScript
courses the second will be about Redux
so this is this part is about front-end
and the third one is going to be the
about the no GS and Express and maybe
the fourth one will be about databases
PostgreSQL amount get to be but that's
far in the future we'll see how it goes
but there's a plan that I want to build
so the success of the failure of this
course will actually dictate the whole
enterprise of this series so ideally I
want to make it a full-time job for me
and just produce content and work on
this platform full-time and this way I
will be able to publish three episodes a
week on YouTube channel for free and
produce about one course in two or three
months and yeah in a quarter I think so
yeah that's a plan but we'll see how it
goes usually it's not at all like we
planned right about the course itself I
will not bore you with details you just
can go to Jay's full Starcom and there
you can find the full table of contents
of everything that is that is in there
all chapters all episodes with
description so you can learn about it
also you can sign up to my newsletter
and get the first chapter for free
that's 40 minutes of content and this
way you can evaluate whether you like my
style of teaching and the structure of
the course or not and make a decision so
basically that's try before you buy
stuff also I give you 13
thirty days 100% money-back guarantee so
if you're not satisfied with the course
I don't want you money so I just refund
you no problem here so about the course
what is important here is there are two
editions here so we have the standard
one and the premium one and the standard
will include the the essence of the
course the most important information
here that's a chapter right now but in
week or two there will be the last ninth
chapter dedicated to deployment of your
application to webs and the premium
course is just the additional stuff it
will be content about more advanced
topics like testing and third-party
authentication and animations etc also
the downloadable content so you will be
able to download videos and watch them
offline right now the premium version is
in pre-order State so it has the
discount by itself but you also can
apply your YouTube block coupon code and
I'll get another 10% off so it's quite
quite a deal but when you purchase it
you're not getting the defense right
away you will get them gradually when
they are ready and I plan to finish all
of them this month in November 2017
otherwise if you if you purchased the
standard version you can just upgrade to
the premium one when the premium will be
completely really but without discount
I'm afraid so about the purchase itself
all the prices on the site are in
dollars but this price is actually
approximation because I'm Russian and I
build my business here in Russia and I
have to build your card in Russian
rubles so all of these prices are
approximation depending on the current
exchange rate so when you go to the
payment page you will see here in the
footnote the actual course price and how
much it's in dollars approximately and
when you click on pay here you will be
redirected to the bank payment gateway
and here you see the final
price and rubles and you can just
consult your bank currency exchange
rates to get it for your currency and to
get more information about it okay so
after you purchased the course you will
be sent the login link just follow it
and you are on the course page on your
dashboard so it's embarrassingly
simplistic right now but again I think
that the most important thing right now
is the content and we will build nice it
is along the way so here you see the the
course itself and we go into it you see
the player and the table of contents and
it tracks your progress as well
I got a usually stuff definite list of
tasks that I want to complete starting
from the content itself and ending with
the just full stacker app features to
improve the mobile experience because
right now it's abysmal or to prove
design stuff etcetera but again I think
that the most important right now is
content and we build nice it is along
the way hopefully okay so thank you
again for your support for your interest
and yeah just go to just full circle at
com use your YouTube love coupon code to
get 10% off and if you have any
questions just don't hesitate ask them
in the comments below or even better
shoot me an email thank you very much
for your time and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
