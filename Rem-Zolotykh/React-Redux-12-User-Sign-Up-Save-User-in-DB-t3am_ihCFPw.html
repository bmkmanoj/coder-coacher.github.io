until now we faked it our silent feature
is just an illusion
nothing is saved on the server and in
this episode we'll fix it I'm a big fan
of sequel databases and PostgreSQL in
particular there are a lot of no GS
related tutorials that you just mount
b2b so will be different here in this
regard and use PostgreSQL instead so you
need to install first if you're on Mac
you can install it via home brew with
brewed installed PostgreSQL or from
official website
I have homebrew version installed with
no additional settings or changes so
first let's create the database for our
project with with commands create the be
and we call it red dice we're going to
use connects next I'm not sure how to
pronounce it so this connects library to
handle migrations and seed data so let's
install it locally and globally with NPM
install save next okay and NPM install
globally thanks so now that we have this
library installed we need to initialize
it we do it with connects in it and that
will just create the connects file the
GS so let's open it up so here we have
this development section and staging
section and let's remove everything from
development and I'm going to copy and
paste station because it uses PostgreSQL
and the database is a red dice the user
is RAM and password is empty and this is
just the homebrew installed the default
username is the username you are logged
in into your computer and password is
empty all right ok let's save it and now
let's install with NPM install safe PG
driver for PostgreSQL so now we're ready
to create our first migration for users
table so we use connects migrate make
users that creates migration file so
let's open it up
migration users and it has two functions
both of these functions need to return
promise which will be returned with from
next
schema and here in the app we want to
create table which is called users and
we have the callback function that
returns table and inside of this
function we're going to define our
fields and then down we want to return
connects schema drop table users so now
here we are ready to define our table
fields
we'll have table and the first one is ID
and it's going to be increments and
let's create the ID by default with
incrementing ability and with index and
integer etc so now we need to define
four fields that we have on our user all
of these fields are strings so we have
string for username and all of these
fields are actually not knowable and
that's just another way to say that they
are required and also username is unique
and we want to do the same thing with
email also we'll have time zone it is
not able but not unique and the same
thing goes for password but of course we
do not have password we have password
digest so encrypted version of our
password and the last thing that we want
to add maybe it's usually useful is time
stamps it creates created and updated
add fields on your table so let's save
it and now let's run this migration
which connects migrate latest ok now we
have our table and by the way you can
just run next to see all the options all
the things that you can do with this
library so now we need a way to save the
user into the database and we'll use
bookshelf GS for our or our purposes to
make things simpler so let's install it
and PM install save bookshelf and
bookshelf works on top of connects it
uses connects so let's initialize it
let's create in server folder we're
going to create new file we call it
bookshelf and there's going to be our
bookshelf
so first of all we import connects from
connects and we import bookshelf from
bookshelf and we also want to import
next config from connects file then we
initialize bookshelf and we want to
export default initialize bookshelf so
we use bookshelf and it takes connects
instance which is initialized with
connects config and we take development
section front so now we have bookshelf
and now we have everything we need to
save user so let's go to our route users
file and here where we have this is
valid we're going to create user and the
first thing that we need to do actually
is we need to encrypt password because
we of course never have a stop passwords
in database so we need to encrypt it and
we'll use bcrypt for that so let's
install NPM install save big crypt and
now going back to our route first let's
import bcrypt from bcrypt
and also we're going to import our model
user from models user ok so we need to
have a model so let's define one we
create models folder inside of it user
the J's file and to define model again
with bookshelf it's very easy will input
bookshelf but not from the package but
we input actually initialize bookshelf
from our bookshelf file and then we
export default bookshelf dot model dot
extend and we specify what table we're
going to use with table name option
users like this so now back to our route
we have decrypt we have user we have
everything that we need so now we can
actually save at last the user in the
database so first let's deconstruct
variables from our body so we have
username we have passwords timezone and
email we deconstruct it from
is body then we need to define password
digest and we'll use of course be
creeped for that and use hash sync
function so this is a synchronous
function just to make it easier so we
pass we pass passwords and option for
salt to be ten that's a good option so
now we have everything that we need now
we can use our user model to forge this
object and we pass username timezone
email and password digest the second
parameter we can specify some options
and one of this option is has time
stamps to insert it to true so this way
it automatically populates time stamps
with current date and after that we just
save it so in save returns promise so we
can have our then which takes user but
it doesn't matter because with response
we just have this JSON success true and
on catch if something goes wrong we'll
have error and we respond with status
500 and JSON era to be error and that's
it
so we have bookshelf model we input it
then we get all the data so we validate
data first then we get all the data then
we hash password then we create user
model and we save it and then we process
the result if everything is ok we
respond with 200 status and JSON
response and we if something goes wrong
we'll have 500 with error so let's try
it out in the browser so I filled up the
form I sign up everything's good I have
the sign up successfully so let's go
back to Terminal A let's login to
Postgres with p SQL command and we
specify what database we want to sign in
so we have in a red dice right now I
specify slash X out option just to have
pretty table rendering and then I have
this select all from users and here
we have our user with password digest
with timestamps everything works
perfectly fine so we've done here so
let's commit saves user in the database
