is to configure how to log in so we can
enjoy magic of not refreshing page
manually and seeing changes right away
and that's pretty awesome I must say for
hot we're load-in to work we need to
install and set up another middleware
for Express if you do not use Express
then web pack dev server is your option
but we go on with middleware in this
project so let's open server index dot
JS file and right here we import another
web pack hot middleware middleware and
we import it from web pack hot
middleware like this now we can use it
should use it as usual with Express web
pack hot middleware and it also takes
compiler so let's extract this compiler
from here right here we find constant
compiler equals web pack web pack and
thick also we need to provide additional
options to def middleware and we can do
it by providing second argument to this
web pack middleware function so first of
all hot true and second we need to
provide public path which we take from
our web pack config output public path
also let's add no info option set to
true and that will eliminate noise from
web pack so now let's save it and always
go to web pack config and here in output
let's add public path which also going
to be just forward slash and then we
need to follow the instructions on hot
metal where a project so first of all we
need to add new entry here and for that
we need to change this from string to
array of strings like this and the first
one will be web pack hot middleware
slash client next then we need to
provide plugins and the most important
one we need to we take them from web
pack so we have new web pack and the
first one the most important one is hot
module
replacement plug in and as we use
webpack here so let's import web back
from web pack let's add another two
plugins which usually are added web pack
the first one is no errors plugin and
this plugin just handles error messages
in a more clean away and another one is
web pack that optimized occurrence order
plug this plugin ensures consistent
build hashes so this is it for
configuring middleware but that's not
all
all middleware does is creating this
connection between browsers and web pack
we need to teach react application how
to reload itself and for that we need to
install and setup react hot loader so
here in loaders for JavaScript files
let's add react hot loader so now we
need to install it and run npm install
site dev react hot loader and we haven't
installed web pack hot meat over yet
okay so let's run server and PM run
server and have a look okay we have an
error and that is typer here to sees but
only one are so yeah it's it is fixed in
web pack 2.0 but in 1.0 this is the name
of the plugin let's run it again okay
now we good let's reload our page and
let's try to change something in our app
component so we open a BS file and let's
sit here exclamation point
save it let's go back to browser and
nothing happens so if you reload the
page only then we have update so it
doesn't work and it doesn't work because
of occurrence limitations of functional
components so for it to work we need to
use class component at the top of
hierarchy so right now
all we have is just one app the GS
component so let's change it from
functional to class so we define class
app which extends from react component
and we need to define render function
and this function will return this hello
here and then we need to export this app
so let's save it let's go back to
browser reload the page okay so go back
to editor and let's remove this
exclamation point save it go back and
you can see that it is reloaded right
away but what about function components
then can we use them well yeah sure but
not as a top component for now so let's
try it out let's create a new
presentation component and we're going
to use it right here instead of our
hello we'll use component greetings
okay so we need of course to import it
retains from greetings and let's create
one greetings GS that's going to be
extremely simple react component so we
export default function that returns h1
hi save it go back to browser and you
can see that it is reloaded
automatically right away so if you go
back and say something high like this
save it go back and you can see that it
is reloaded nice it works so just
remember to use class components for top
components and you'll be ok so let's
commit and that's it for this episode
