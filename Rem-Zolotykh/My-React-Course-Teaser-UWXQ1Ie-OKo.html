teaser for my upcoming premium course on
react development first I'm going to
show your application we're going to be
during this course and then at least
topics this course covers if you're
interested in this course and want to be
updated on its progress readiness and
get discount for being awesome early
adopter sign up to my newsletter to do
that click on this button or find link
in the description below this video I
will not spam your inbox on promise so
here's the application we're going to
build the best board game online shop in
the world no more no less you can see
that application is actually even you
can go to BG shop Randall 3.net to try
it out by yourself here we have a list
of games we have for sale and that's
where we'll start we'll learn how to
create react component render it on page
path data' to it then we learn how to
render a list of items and analyze how
to compose your application by composing
small components next we'll implement
client-side crud here you learn how to
create your own forms and then we will
use this form to create new game like
this after that we'll reuse the same
form to edit already created games you
can see that when i click on different
games data in edit form is changed for
that to work we'll dive into components
lifecycle methods and then we'll finish
crud with the weight and gain from the
shop and of course you will need to
create confirmation for it so we'll
learn how to use conditionals in
components then we learn how and most
importantly where to make ajax requests
to stage and receive data and server so
our application can actually be used
after all of this you'll be quite
familiar with react app development and
that's where most of the courses hand
but not this one instead we'll tackle
user authentication right now i'm logged
in but when i log out you can see that i
can no longer manage game collection
instead i can buy games and we'll look
into it in a moment we'll learn how to
implement you the authentication with
jhad from theory behind it to practical
implementation also we'll talk about
things you should consider when
implementing authentication and choosing
earth method for simplicity sake all
authenticated users are considered to be
Edmonds so if you sign up you can manage
game collection by yourself
you can try it out right now if you want
to but we'll still learn about such
important topic as authorization after
that we'll implement by an emulator
guest user can click on Buy button and
as he does it you can see that data in
the cart is updated with overall
quantity of items and total song to edit
card content just click on it and you'll
notice one thing that's a separate page
and it means that time has come to learn
some react round some magic with its
latest fourth version will install it
set it up and learn basics concepts
behind it and later i'm definitely going
to create free series on youtube to dive
deep into this amazing library this
checkout page is also very responsive as
you can imagine you can change quantity
and everything is recalculated and
update it right away and if you reload
the page everything is persisted
clicking on these red clothes icons
delete items from cart and that's how
you can empty it and in the last chapter
will learn how to deploy our application
to digital ocean will learn how to do it
manually so you understand what's going
on you won't become devops after that
but you get a good an descendant of what
needs to be done to publish your
application for world to use so to recap
here are topics this course will cover
working with react components compose
them into application learning about
props and state unidirectional dataflow
components life cycle who's working with
forms complete quads implementation
working with ajax requests user
authentication and authorization JSON
web tokens react router and application
deployment to digital ocean and much
more little details along the way as you
can see there are a lot of stuff to
learn but what about back in G mask well
back in code will be provided separately
and there will be a short chapter on how
to set it up locally so we won't be
touching back and stuff in this course
though I'll give you a quick run-through
also will not be learning redux this
course is about react but I plan to make
separate course on Reddick's that is
going to be built upon this one in it
will learn about critics in what cases
we should use it and learn all details
about it but that's for another day so
what about free youtube screencast you
will not be making them
anymore well I'm glad you asked I will
still be creating free youtube content
as a complementary to the course to get
into deeper details on some topics for
example different kind of authentication
reacts router mutability year six tips
and tricks etc so nothing changes really
but you'll be able to support my work by
buying my course which is a good thing
right so again if you're interested in
this course and want to be updated on
its progress sign up for my newsletter
