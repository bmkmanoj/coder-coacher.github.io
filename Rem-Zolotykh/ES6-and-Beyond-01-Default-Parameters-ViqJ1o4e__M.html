JavaScript es6 and beyond series where
we learn latest and greatest JavaScript
features in small bits episodes in this
series are not connected and can be
watched in any order and used as a
reference and in this episode we'll
learn about default parameters
okay so first let's have a look how we
would implement default parameters in
es5 and then we'll convert our function
into es6 let's say that we want to have
very simple function say hi
it takes name and dollars for some
reason and then in return string your
name is plus name and do you have plus
dollars dollars very contrived example
but that would work perfectly to
illustrate the point next we define
result constant and assign result of
this function to it I pass my name RAM
and have whuppin $10 next I just
cancelled that log result to have a look
at what I get and I get expected string
your name is RAM and you have $10 good
so now let's say that we want to make
dollars amount optional and if it's not
specified we assume that person has $5
first let's do lead or amount from here
and we can see that now we have
undefined in our result string which is
not good so let's reassign dollars to
dollars and if it's true or to $5 if
it's false and we good there is a
problem though and you should be aware
of it every time you're dealing with
truthy faulty values and numbers in
JavaScript so let's say that I'm broke
and I have zero dollars in my account I
pass zero and nothing happens in result
string we still have five dollars for
some reason that happens because zero is
false value so we need to fix it by
complicating our condition a little bit
more now we need to compare dollars to
undefined and if it is undefined
we set it to $5 otherwise we just assign
it to dollars and that fixes it how
that's too much work
just be able to define default values
and in es6 we have this problem solved
so let's remove zero dollars from our
call an inter ammeter is list which is
the sign default value two dollars to
save five dollars and while we're here
let's convert our concatenate it strain
into interpolated one so we wrap it in
backticks and let's get rid of all these
quotes and classes and we interpolate
values with dollar sign and color
brackets for name and for dollars ah
much nicer isn't it and you can see that
it works we have expected five dollars
in result string you can assign default
values to any number parameters in any
order and also you are not limited by
values only you can even use functions
let's have a look instead of assigning
value to dollars we assign result of
calculate default amount function pay
attention that we invoke it right away
to get value from it and let's define
this function here on the top so
function calculate default amount and it
returns five dollars and as you can see
in the results train it still works you
even can use previous arguments in
default values for following arguments
so you can go really crazy with it so
let's say that for Bill you have
thousand dollars as default value and
for everyone else
Mia five bucks so you can pass name in
to calculate default amount function and
then use it in it and here if name is
Bill then we return thousand dollars
otherwise five dollars and in the result
strain we see five dollars for RAM but
if we change name to Bill bam thousand
dollars of course I wouldn't recommend
you to go all in with this cryptic
default values but it's nice to know
that this kind of power is available to
us and the last important thing you
should know about is that if you use
arguments in your function you will not
find default values in there if you look
into arguments here you can see that it
only has Bill in it and there are no
dollars in there but if we pass them
when we call this function then you get
this
argument and arguments object and that's
how you can define default values for
function arguments now it's your turn to
try it out let's say that you need to
implement function that converts a sense
to dollars like this convert 4330 and it
results in forty three point thirty by
default but user can also pass second
argument that is a number from zero to
two which tells how many digits user
wants to see after the dot so if he
calls convert forty three thirty and
pass zero is the second parameter he
gets forty three back so good luck and
have fun with it
