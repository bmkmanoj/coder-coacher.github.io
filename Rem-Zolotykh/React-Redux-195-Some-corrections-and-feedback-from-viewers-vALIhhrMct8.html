I'm excited because I started to get
feedback from viewers in form of
suggestions and corrections which is
awesome please keep it coming so in this
episode I'll cover several topics the
first one is most important it is access
update and it's breaking change that
result in some confusion next we'll have
a look at a buck I introduced in
previous episode which was called by one
of the viewers then we'll talk a little
bit about different ways to store
current user details and lastly we'll
change a little bit jorts decoding on
client so let's get started access was
updated to version 13 and it introduced
breaking change now it has different
error response that breaks our error
handling so if you just started this
series and came to this episode by call
out for clarification and want to follow
along without any changes make sure that
you use access version 12 for that open
package that JSON and here remove this
carrot character and that will ensure
that you use this particular version
save the file go to terminal and run npm
install like this but to keep things up
to date we're going to update to this
new version right now so you can read
about the changes right here in an error
handling upgrade guide you can read
about error handling and what changed
and how it works right now I'll leave
this link in the description to this
video so basically we go back here and
let's define version the latest version
is thirteen point one so let's save it
and let's run NPM install okay good and
while we here in package dot JSON file
let's change this script from server to
start this way we do not need to type
NPM run server all the time we just need
to type NPM start which is much better
so now we need to find all instances
where we use error response and we
handle errors only in form components so
let's open login form basically we have
just login form and signup form and we
are lucky that application is very small
right now so let's open this form
and hearing on submit we have this code
here where we handle error and all we
need to do is just add to this error
response object like this and that will
do for logging so let's test it in
browser just trying to log in with
invalid credentials okay so if I try to
login right now I have invalid
credentials everything works that's good
now let's go to signup form and the same
thing here in on submit we have this
code here so let's get rid of this data
here is define it to error and here
we'll do error response data so now
let's test this but before testing we
need to comment this thing out when we
making requests from client onblur so it
will not interfere with Silva
validations so let's go back to browser
and let's try to sign up so here I'm
trying to sign up with already taking
username and email and when trying to do
that
I have errors everything works nice so
from now on we'll use this new access
version and hopefully will not encounter
any other breaking changes in the future
but that's just the life of web
developer and it's fun so let's commit
this change pretty quickly we update to
access version 13 1 so now let's look
into Baga introduced in previous episode
let's open our oh yeah and of course I
need to uncomment this stuff from here
so let's open our middleware
authenticate that we created in previous
episode and right here in this block
here do you see the problem
that's what happens when Ram doesn't
test code testin is good so let's test
this portion of code and see this nasty
bug so for that we go back to browser
and let's login as existing user like
this and now let's delete this user I'm
going to open developer tools here so
for that let's open psql we're going to
use just the comment line interface for
PostgreSQL red dice database and right
here just to delete
users so that will remove all users from
the database we just have one and two
quit it
/q okay so now if I try to go to new
event and try to submit this form it
actually works as it's supposed to work
we have this error returned everything's
cool but if you go to terminal and go
back here in our server we can see that
we have an error can't set headers after
they ascend and that happens because of
course you need to put this code in L
spot like this and that will fix it so
if we try it again just create it it
behaves the same way but now we do not
have any errors in on the server so the
lesson I learned again and again and
again is always test your stuff thanks
our lack for pointing this bug out so
let's commit this small change as well
fix bug in authentication middleware
also we can get rid of all this code
from here and that will also fix our bug
and just set user ID and request object
like Nicolas proposed so instead of
making requests here all we do here is
actually making request user ID so we
create a new field here and then we just
set it to decoded ID and then we pass it
down the chain like this and this way we
do not query database with every request
which is more efficient and late in
routes where we need complete user we
can query database and handle
non-existent user there most of the time
we need only user ID anyway for example
to create relationships between tables
and with relational databases will have
constraints that will not allow us to
create records with non existing user
this is totally valid approach it's more
performant but personally I'll choose
convenience in this case I have two
points here the first by setting current
user here I'm sure that this usually
exists and I don't need to check it for
existence anymore
I immediately respond with unauthorized
and stop right
here no other code is run which is quite
convenient and the second if you have
possibility of admin blocking or
deleting user like we did for our test
here then if we don't check for user
existence this user will have access to
API until he tries something that will
at last force check for user like here
in a browser with this change if I try
to create this new event I'm getting ok
response from server ID now in router
when we create new end we need to handle
another type of error when user IDs
invalid and while in this particular
case we are not yet concerned about blog
tube and users still I prefer to make
this to be query here and make my life
easier in the future so I'm going to
return it back to cut a long story short
developing is about trade-offs you need
to think about your case about pros and
cons and make a decision and if this
decision comes to bite you in the future
no fret your smart person you'll figure
it something out so I'll leave this the
big quieren here
ah but feel free to experiment and make
up your own mind about it so thanks
again guys for your feedback
I really appreciate it and keep it
coming okay so last small thing that
we'll do in this episode we are going to
use another package for decoding jot on
client so let's go back to terminal here
and let's install and save George the
code package and all this package does
is decodes token and that's exactly what
we need
we do not need verification or any other
functionality that JSON web token
package provides we do not need this
stuff on client so now let's go and open
out actions and here instead of using
jot and JSON web token we're going to
use Geordie code and we're going to use
Geordie code package here and here in
login we're going to use this Jody code
token like this and the same thing we
need to do with client index and we
change this short to draw the code we
input dot the code and here where we use
it we change it to Georgia code they
stokin and this way we do not need to
mess with web back and fix so let's go
to web pack and fix and at the bottom
here let's delete this node stuff
because Georgia code package doesn't use
anything of it so now if we restart
server it seems to work fine so I'm
gonna just log out and sign up the new
user because I deleted the previous one
like this seems to work and I'm going to
login and it works nice so let's commit
so we replace JSON web token with jort
decode on client and on server of course
we use the whole package and that's it
for this episode let me know if this
kind of feedback episodes is interesting
for you and should I do others in the
future so thank you for your time and if
