series we're going to implement simple
crud application crud stands for create
read update and do it we'll see how to
implement this essential feature in
isolation
in this episode we'll create application
and setup redux so let's get started
first we need to install create react
app package globally with NPM install
dash G create react app next we run
create react app crud command so after
it's done let's CD into it an open
project in editor also lets start
application with NPM start command
it's amazing how easy it became to start
with new app thanks to this package so
now let's set up redux
so first let's install Redux react Redux
because we're going to use Redux with
react and redux funk middleware because
we're going to make a checks requests
great now let's open index dot J's file
in editor all it does for now is just
render in root element to the Dom to
setup Redux we need to do three things
first we need to create store and for
that we need to create root reducer
second we need to apply all required
middlewares to it in our case we'll
apply thunk middleware to create a
synchronous actions and redux dev tools
middleware to make our development
easier and third we need to wrap our
application in to provide a tag and
supply created store to it so let's do
this first let's create store to create
store we use creates tool function
provided by redux package it takes
several arguments first of which is
route to the user of our application so
let's import create store from redux and
routed user from root should use a file
now let's create a new route reducer JS
file here we compose the whole
application state and we'll do it with
combine read users function that is
provided by redux
so we expert default result of combined
reducers function and this function
takes object argument that describes our
state in our case we'll include 1
reducer
for games collection and let's input
this reducer from reducers games file
now let's create a new folder reducers
and inside of it you reduce a file games
GS so reduces just a pure function so we
expert default function games it takes
two arguments state and we set it to be
empty array by default and action which
we set to empty object by default and
then we switch by action type and by
default just return state so in our case
right now it always returns empty array
now that we get store let's apply couple
of middle words to it first one is thunk
middleware that allows us to create
thunk asynchronous actions and second is
Redux devtool middleware that will help
us while we develop stuff so first
install Redux dev tools from Chrome
extension store next we need to install
Redux dev tools extension package with
NPM installed as their save Redux dev
tools extension this extensions gives us
compose with dev tools function so let's
import it from redux dev tools extension
and also we need apply middleware
function from Redux package and thank me
to wear from redux thunk now going back
to our create store we provide second
argument which is middle words in case
when we do not provide initial state to
the store usually what we do is just add
apply middleware function and we pass
thank middleware into it but as we want
to use dev tools let's pass it to
compose with dev tools function now we
go to browser and open redux dev tools
and click on state tab you can see our
empty games collection right there in
the application state and the last thing
is to input provider from react Redux
package and wrap our application into it
and of course we need to pass created
store to provide a component like this
and that's it
we've set our products into our
application if you found this substitute

it with your friends and colleagues
thank you very much for time and have a
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
