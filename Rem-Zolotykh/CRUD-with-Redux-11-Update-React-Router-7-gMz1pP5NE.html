food for crotch with redux series things
have been changed from the first episode
the main change happened with reactor
outer which is expectable because it was
an alpha and now tune better and with
this update they introduced some
breaking changes in this episode we'll
see how to fix our small project there
are two parts in first part we'll see
how to install and use the exact reactor
outer version we used during this series
so if you just starting to watch the
series that's a good way to go in the
second part we'll update our project to
use news better 5 version of reactor
outer so let's get started let's open
terminal and let's remove node modules
folder with remove RF node modules and
then let's run NPM installed that will
take a while ok done now let's run
application with NPM start let's go to
the browser and we see that we have an
error and nothing is rendered on to the
page so let's make it work by using the
reactor outer version we used during
this series first
so let's going back to terminal let's
remove node modules again with remove RF
node modules next let's open package
JSON file here let's remove carrot
symbol from all packages no--but reactor
outer version we used in this series is
alpha 5 now is try on NPM install again
ok done let's go back to the browser and
it works no errors so that's it for
those of you who want to continue
watching the series come back to this
episode for update material when you
finish with it so quick note from now on
in my series I'm going to use the yarn
instead of NPM to install and manage
dependences that hopefully will solve
the problem with versions so there was a
big update for react router from alpha
to better versions and some breaking
changes were introduced so let's update
and fix it first lesson and soul router
version we used with NPM uninstall -
they're safe react router and then let's
install we extra to dump package and we
use version for better 5 note that
reacted um instead of react router this
package is for web applications while
for example reactor alternative it for
native mobile apps let's restart our
application let's go to the browser and
we back to our initial error nice now we
need to replace all reactor all inputs
to react Rajesh dumb and let's start
from Indus Ganges file we change reality
to reactor out dumb and that's all we
need to do here so let's move on to fgf
here let's add Dom to react router as
well now instead of match we need to
input route they change the component
name as well in render function let's
replace match with route and instead of
pattern we need to use path from now on
let's it for this part for now and let's
have a look in the browser we got error
about the tag well in component was also
changed so it doesn't recognize this
prop so we need to remove them let's go
back to editor and let's remove this
props from links we need to create
custom link component and we'll do it a
little bit later okay home page works
fine let's go to games route and we have
an error the problem in game card
component so let's have a look we open
game card I JS file and the only thing
we need to change here is add Dom to
react router so back in browser good now
let's try to edit game and we have
tramples again this time we have a
problem in game forum page so let's open
it up and first of all let's add Dom to
react router next we need to change the
way we get params from prompt in alpha
version all parameters were delivered
right in the prop so we could do what we
did here these dot prompt Rams but in
better
they were names based on the match
object so now we need to use these props
that match that brand so let's take
match from this prop and use it in a
conditional and in parameters for page
game action also let's scroll down to
the bottom to map state to prop function
and here let's take match from this
process
out and use it in conditional and in
find Kovac let's try it out in browser
and it works we fix it I'm sorry coolant
stuff so let's stain last is active menu
item now no matter what page I visit I
got no indication menu about it we can
provide props to link component anymore
like we did before instead we need to
create our own custom link component so
let's open F da J's file here let's
define new active link component we
define it as functional component that
has label two and active only one exact
prompts this props we will provide when
we use this active link component this
component instead of rendering link
component we'll learn the route
basically when route matches we want to
render linked with cross active and
otherwise we render a link without this
class so we specify path prop to equal
to two that will pass to active link
same thing with exact it equals to
active only one exact and for our
particular use case route has children
prop we can use it instead of component
like we did before it takes function the
trend is no matter if both matches or
not but it allows us to introduce our
own logic because this function takes
object that contains match property this
property is now if there is no match so
we can use it in our link component so
we define class name
if this route matches the path we use
active item class otherwise just item
then we specify to equals to two and
inside of it we ran the label so now
let's use this component instead of link
so we rename link to active link we add
active only one exact sector patrol
links and then instead of having label
inside of link will pass it vial label
crop like this home games add new game
so now let's go to the browser and see
if it works and it does good stuff so
let's make final check let's remove
again node modules let's run npm install
to install all packages and you
done and let's restart our application
now go to the browser it still works

certain in JavaScript world but I can
