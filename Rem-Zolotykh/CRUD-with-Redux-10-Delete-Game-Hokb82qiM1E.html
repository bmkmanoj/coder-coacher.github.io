last episode and crud series in which
will implement game deletion as this is
the last episode so it's time to think
about the next one and you can vote for
the topic you are most interested in or
submit your own idea follow the link in
the description so deletion of the
record is very simple because we already
know everything there is to know to
implement it properly so let's open game
card component we add delete game action
to prop types we add it to the structure
in here and for our button we add on
click handler in which we use inline
function that calls delete game and
passes game ID to it okay next we need
to add delete game to games list
component and pass it down to game cards
so let's open games list component we
add delete game to prop types we add it
to the structure in here and pass it
down to game card component and now we
go back to games page where we connect
our component to redux we pass the lead
game two games list there we import it
of course and we pass it to connect
function and let's define it in prop
types as well so pretty standard drill
by now right so we've done with UI so
next let's create this action we open
actions the GS file and we copy and
paste update game action and let's
modify it
instead of game object it takes game ID
and we use it in URL request we change
methods to delete and we do not need
body and emotional it's deleted and and
then we dispatch game deleted and pass
ID to it so next we define game delete
at action and we pass game ID as an
argument
it returns action object with type game
deleted and game ID and let's define
constant game delete it as well and
we're done here next to the reducer we
open games da GS reduce a file let's
input game deleted constant from actions
and add case section for game deleted
and in here we need to create array
without game
with such ID for that we use filter so
we return state filter and in callback
check if item ID does not equal to
action game ID and we've done with
reducer next to server where we need to
implement delete route so we open server
the GS file and let's define AB de
delete route with API games and ID
parameter in Colbeck here we used B
collection games and for deletion we use
delete one first argument as usual is
query object and we search by ad and
again we need to convert string to
object ID and we do it with new MongoDB
object ID and pass request params ID
into it in callback we add error handler
and if everything is okay just respond
with success status and empty JSON
object and that's it let's go to the
browser and let's delete this duplicated
game we created earlier and it works as
an exercise try to implement some kind
of confirmation component and we're done
we implemented the whole crud
functionality in just an episodes this
episode is a good review of how simple
feature is implemented with redux first
we create UI and add action to it to be
dispatched then we define this action
creator and then we define cases in all
reducers which must react to this action
and that's it for this series let me
