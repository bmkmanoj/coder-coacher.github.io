episode two books sliced component in
this episode we'll create book list
component and for that we'll see how to
create new route define model hook in
this route set properties to controller
path data to the component and we'll see
how to implement boots trip navigation
bar active links styling so let's get
started so here is our application that
we have now not much right so let's add
navigation bar which has a link to books
list so for that let's open application
that HBS file from templates we get rid
of this welcome to amber instead of it
we define container fluid inside of this
container will have outlet and we'll
have our nav bar component and of course
remember that we must specify dash in
the component we can do nav bar like
that and now to define the component all
we need to do is to define its template
until we really need some kind of a
special behavior for this component we
didn't need to explicitly define it
because amber will do it for us
automatically in the memory so all we
need to do is in templates folder in
components define nav bar dot HBS file
yes let's create it and I just copy and
paste nav bar from bootstrap so right
here where we have unordered list let's
define list item and link to books route
like this so now if we save it and go
back to browser of course we do not have
anything because we do not have books
route so let's go back and open router
digest file and inside of this router
that map we define this route books
now if we save it and go to browser
you'll see our nav bar but if we go to
books while we are here we do not have
this active link item and that happens
because amber actually marks the link
itself with the active class but for
bootstrap to work we need to mark the
list item tag with active class so there
is a simple work about about that so
let's go back to nav bar and instead of
using link inside of list item will
define link two points to books but with
a tag name off list item and inside of
it we define empty anchor tag with MTH
raf named books and let's close this
link to let save it go back to browser
and you can see that now we have this
active link excellent so now we need to
populate this book's route template will
have two columns on the left here will
have the books list and on the right the
details of the selected book on the left
so let's do this so for that we need to
create in templates books that HBS file
here will have row with cold small for
plus call small eight inside of this
call small will define books list
component and inside of coal small eight
we do not define anything for now okay
to define component all we need to do is
to define template so let's do this in
components we define box list dot HBS
and it's going to be a deal with list
group class and inside of it will have
an attack with class list group item and
for example book 1 i'd save it let's go
to browser and now you can see we have
this book one
okay but we hard code book one it
doesn't mean anything what we want to do
is pass some data some collection to
this particular component so what we
want is something like this we want to
iterate through books as book and this
books collection should be passed to
this component and then here instead of
book one will have of course book that
title and let's close each here okay so
now we need to pass books to this
component so let's go back to books data
HBS template here we'll have books
equals books very easy right so now we
need to define these books here and we
need to define it on a controller and to
do that we need to set up our controller
in route so let's create route in a
proud we create books that GS file we
import amber remember and we expert
default amber that route that extent so
here we set up controller and there's a
function which takes controller and
models so this models is actually a hash
that will have books as a collection
right and now if we have this kind of
models set up on the controller we can
access this books collection from the
template as we did earlier so this hash
will be returned from model hook ok
button set up control of course we do
not have this then we return controller
set properties models
and now we need to return this
collection from this hook so we return
amber RSVP hash and that's a hash
wrapped in a promise and here we define
books as a collection of objects with
title awesome book and let's create
another one with title not so good one
now if we save it and go to browser
you'll see that we have awesome book and
it's all good one so this is the flow of
the data we fetch data in route in model
hoop right here it usually you'll fetch
it from the server and then you set up
this data to on the controller as a
property then in template you'll pass
this data to the component and then the
component will use this data to render
some content so this is the preferred
way to do this until we have routable
components at that point we won't need
to use controllers as proxies anymore
