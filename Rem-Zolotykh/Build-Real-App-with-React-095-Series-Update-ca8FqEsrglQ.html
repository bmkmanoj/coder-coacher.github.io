series will rebuild real web application
with react Redux and no GS so it was a
long time since the last episode it was
a crazy two months and I at the end of
them I just caught a nasty flu that
ruined my throat and I couldn't do
anything so yeah it was fun but
everything's well that ends well I want
to thank everybody for support I want to
thank most of all the people who
purchased my course thank you very much
by the way the final chapter of the
standard package is ready dedicated it's
in the 9th chapter it's dedicated to
deployment so you will learn a little
bit of DevOps as well so yeah go to the
J's full-stack come and purchase it it
will mean a lot to me and you will get
what about me out of it so that was one
of the problem why I didn't you know
produced content but another one was
that I I was you know finding it very
hard to motivate myself to continue with
bookworm application because to be
honest bookworm app is quite boring to
build it's great application for
teaching purposes but I'm not teaching
in this in this particular series I'm
not teaching use stuff I'm just showing
you the workflow and I want to show you
the whole process with all the things
that needed to include to be included in
the development of the full-stack
application and bookworm is just very
very boring so I decided to make a pivot
and create another application so we're
gonna use all the stuff that we already
developed in this series so basically
that's you everything that is connected
with users user authentication user
signup passwords recovery so all that we
got there we will reuse it so we're not
repeating that ourselves and we'll move
forward with new features with new
application so if you know me you know
that I am a board games geek I love
playing with my family and my friends
board games I got a small collection
here and also I like to run tabletop
role-playing games and the most the most
famous one is the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons of
course I'm not a fan myself
not to play this game but it's perfect
game for you no optimization and
creating software for it because there
are lots of math in here organizational
stuff so yeah it's just that's why it
actually was used as the basis for such
games as Butler's gauge oh hi Swindell
something like that so there is a
dungeon dragons and what they do they
have this organized play adventurers
lake and this is just the way to if you
do not have you know stable gaming group
you just can go to an event with your
character play one shot get the
experience go on to a magical item some
of the solute that you got it in your
dungeons and you just you know level
leveling up your character and you use
the same courtesy in another events like
this so that's the gist of organized
play so an application that we're going
to build is this one in the adventure is
the lake basically that's the adventure
is like hub that the management
application that will help users masters
and and community organizers to organize
games and players to find games and to
intend them and and reward reward them
with experience points with gamification
inside of the application like
achievements etc so it's quite exciting
because there are a lot of very cool
features that we can actually create and
you know really leverage they react not
just crowd application that you can do
with Rails for example but something
that's really involved involved in the
front end as well and so here what I did
right now I just reuse the code that we
already have and I added a little bit of
styling on it I switch from semantic UI
to bootstrap because that's basically
the framework that I use a lot with my
clients so just not switching
you know context and that's the version
for and you can see this a beauty right
it's a beauty that's the best thing that
I ever designed
yeah so I'm going to do some kind of
design I'm prac
I'm really suck at it but I'm practicing
and I will do it off camera and then I'm
just commit and walk you through the
commits in episodes like an overview of
what I've done during the week but we
will not do CSS on camera because it's
very boring to just like seeing how I'm
struggling with this kind of stuff but
what we have here is is the main page
and we have the sign up sign up form and
you can see that I added user name field
here because now our application will be
different users will communicate with
each other we don't want to expose their
emails we just want to use the user name
like handle so other than that I just
edit user name on the back end and on
that front front end we have a login
form we have our forgot password form so
as you can see I just restored it a
little bit and if you'll again we'll
have our just the navigation bar and I
can logout that's it so what we built
but I just stripped out the books
functionality out of there and you can
find this in the get repository in the
links below and just pull it run it and
we going to start from there another
thing that I noticed that I can do you
know software development on them on a
whim so without any plan like hey I have
an idea so this is going to be our
application but I do not have a plan for
it so I just need to come up every time
with a new feature so that doesn't work
for me I need a plan and I created one
so for the last week or so I was you
know thinking about this application you
know drawing some mock-ups and yeah I
come up with a plan so this is the
public Trello board link in the
description and you can just go through
it and read through it and you will see
there are a lot of cards so each card is
quite complex sometimes very complex
feature that I want to implement that's
the part of the application and VP is
the minimal Viable Product that what I
consider to be most important features
and later is the features that could be
it's just like an idea box these
features are great to have one we
already have an application running so
and as you can see there are a lot of
stuff so user creates community and here
I have the
please you know brain dump of what is
this feature is about with the
description and some of them even have
this kind of a mock-up screens and as
you can see the complexity of the
application increased because now on the
front end we'll have quite complex data
and on the back end as well we will have
different entities communicating with
each other
and for example here I plan to do the
wizard form so form with three steps in
it and I want to persist the state so we
will use redux for form which we never
done in this in my enema of my series
before I think so yeah a lot of
conditional stuff in the form so smart
forms basically that's actually why we
want to use react to create this kind of
cool interfaces and a lot of you know
checkboxes to feel just to have an idea
of course this plan is quite flexible
but as you can see I got this
descriptions kind of my understanding of
the data and yeah it's community a
couple of marks and I will create other
marks as we go as well and another thing
is I want actually to document this
process so it will talk take a lot a
long time I think a year or so because I
haven't got time to do it you know
everyday I will just do it only maybe
four or eight hours a week maximum I do
not have time for more but so it will
take a lot of time to develop it but not
only development is what is interesting
but also launching it and contact
contact people and communities that
there are now organized how chaotically
right and you know advise them to use
this application and taking their
feedback etc and improving application
so that's what I really want to do now
another thing is that we're going to
have the little ization I can't
pronounce this internal
I can't and can't pronounce this sport
so I 18m because I want to have in the
beginning Russian and English languages
and later also Spanish and other
languages so we'll do that in the next
episode we'll just have the very simple
groundwork for localization because it's
better to do it right away in the
beginning to planet at the beginning of
the project then at the end because then
when you have when you already have
application and then hunt down all of
this thing that you need to translate it
can be a nightmare so just go to this
Trello board you can comment I think so
but at least you can read through all
these cards and yeah let me know what
you think again I want to stress out
that I want to focus on you know
development not on teaching in this
series so I want to demonstrate this
like a developer Journal and yeah if you
want to learn something like react you
can go to jail full stack that's common
low react from start to finish with all
the things that you really need to know
here I will just comment what I'm doing
sometimes explaining why I'm doing
something and answering your questions
but basically it's not really teaching
endeavor and I commit to one coding
session per week so I will do one long
session I will record it then I split it
into several episodes and I will post
this episode during the week so and
during the week I also will do some kind
of design some kind of CSS maybe small
fixes that will not be done they will
not be done on camera but I will walk
you through them like an overview like
for example if I go to the git
repository right now for react so here
you can see that what I did right so the
initial commit here is just I took the
theme that we developed for bookworm and
I script the books and renamed stuff and
from there I just added some styles like
home style and page
I switched bootstrap
etc etc so you can go through this
committee and have an idea what has
changed okay so I'm very glad to be back
that's it for this episode which is the
overview just a little bit of teaser I'm
very excited to start working on this
application so if you like this video
