learned almost everything there is to
know about react and forms it's your
turn to practice and actualize your
knowledge your task is to create crud
for publishers collection that we
introduced in previous chapter try to
implement it without your watching
content of this chapter and without copy
and paste and code you wrote already if
you followed along it's very important
to try to do it by yourself and get help
only when you can't move forward because
of some gap in understanding also quick
tip work on this exercise in separate
git branch
this way you can experiment away without
any fear that you mess up the master
branch that we'll continue to use in the
next chapter to create new branch open
your console and run git checkout - be
publishers crowd for example this
command creates new branch and switches
to it right away
now you can commit to this branch and
when you want to go back just run git
checkout master okay so let me show you
what I propose you to build first add
manage publishers menu item to the
navigation bar so user can get
publishers sidebar next play with your
interface what I'm going to show you
here is just a suggestion feel free to
come up with your own ideas of how to
design your UI when user click on this
menu item ran the sidebar bonus points
if you can also change games list here
you can see that when I show sidebar I
change amount of cards in a row to 3
instead of 4 also add clothes icon to
sidebar by clicking on which it
disappears another thing to try out is
to allow only one sidebar to be active
so if I click on manage publishers
publisher sidebar is rendered but if I
click on add new game it hides
publishers and shows game form clicking
back on manage publishers hides game
form and shows publishers you got the
idea ok so now to the essence of this
exercise here in sidebar you render add
new publisher button and table of
publishers you already have and some
action icons click on this button and it
disappears and shows the phone below
submit it right away
and we have validations with error
messages fill it in submit and we got
new publishing the table and button is
visible again click on it again and
click on cancel and it works as well
click on edit icon change and submit and
it works clicking on different edit
icons updates edit form as Trude and
clicking on trash icon deletes publisher
from the list as a bonus you also can
implement confirmation like we did with
games in previous episode so that's a
lot but by implemented it you revise and
strengthen your understanding of how all
these things we learned so far
work together good luck and most
importantly have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
