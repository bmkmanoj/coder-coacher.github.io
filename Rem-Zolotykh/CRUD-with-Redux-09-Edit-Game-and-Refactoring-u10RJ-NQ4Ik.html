will implement game editing also will
reflect a game form into two components
two separate responsibilities before we
begin though I started a quick poll
about editor you'd like to see in my
screencast the most also this series
ends this week so it's time to think
about the next one and you can vote for
the topic you're most interested in or
submit to your own idea links in the
description
it's going back to our game form here on
submit method we need to dispatch
different actions depending on presence
of game ID if it is now we dispatch
create game otherwise we dispatch update
game let's add ID to the structure in we
are making here next check if it's not
now in this case we dispatch update game
action and pass ID title and cover to it
otherwise we dispatch create game action
as for the then callback we just copy
the same code we have when we create
game as you can see we introduce
complexity and duplication one way to
improve it is to instead of making this
decision here pass this decision to
action itself and let it handle the
situation or we could introduce another
component page component that will do it
and that's the way we'll handle it later
actually so next we need to import this
new update action from actions and
lights included in our connect argument
here at the bottom next let's define
action so open actions digest file and
let's define update game action for that
let's copy the save game action and go
from there here we change URL to API
game's data that ID we change method to
put and in then we dispatch game updated
and pass game data that was returned
from server now we need to define this
game updated action so we export
function game updated it takes game data
and it returns action object with type
game updated and game itself and at last
let's defined constant itself constant
game updated equals game updated and
next let's handle this action in the
reduced
so let's open reducers games GS file and
we input game updated from actions next
introduce another case for game updated
here we return new array with the help
of map we map through games and if game
ID is the same as idea of the game
provided by action we return this new
game data otherwise we return item
without any change so basically the same
thing we did with game fetched scenario
now let's go to the browser and let's
submit the form and as you can see in
console here we make input request of
course it's not found so let's implement
route for it so let's open server digest
file so we define your route here app
put and the URL is API game's ID and a
usual koubek takes request and response
so first let's validate input and
destruct its return value into errors
and is valid constants if it is valid to
will do update and stuff in else block
let's respond with status 400 and JSON
object with errors now we get title and
cover from request body and next we use
DB collection games find one and update
function the first argument for it is
query object we search by ID and we need
to convert string to object ID again
with new MongoDB object ID second
argument is object where we specify
dollar signs set and to it provide
another object with fields we want to
update title and cover in our case third
argument options here I set return
original to false so manga will return
updated record next we specify call bed
and we handle error as usual with status
500 and in case of success we respond
with JSON object game equals to result
value and that's it let's try it out in
the browser I edit Petropolis here save
it and it works nice but let's reflect
our code and introduce page component
that will handle most of these logics
instead of making form component do it
all so going back to AB Dodgers
component here instead of using game
form for new or added game routes
we'll use game form pay
of course we need to import it instead
of game form and next let's create this
component in game form GS file now this
component will handle several fans
it will pass game data to form it will
decide which action to dispatch and it
will redirect to index page when
everything's okay as a fact form will
become much simpler and to the point so
let's open game form and split to make
transfer easier we move imports of
connect actions and redirect to page
component we also move component amount
and in page component let's create new
function that we call save game will
pass this particular function to form
component later move this code to this
newly created function and in its place
let's call this prop save game and pass
ID title Tavor in page we don't need to
handle error case instead we return
promise that we'll use in form onsuccess
we change states of redirect to true so
this component redirects us on success
and in the form we still handle in
promise and catch errors there so let's
move redirect from form to page let's
define stage with redirect in it of
course you don't need to redirect in our
form component anymore for that let's
delete redirect from state and in render
function we just ran the form itself so
let's get rid of this conditional here
next move this map state to props and
connect staff to page component and in
page component render function we check
if redirect is true then we redirect to
games page otherwise we run the game
form component and we pass game object
to it as well as save game function and
of course we need to import game form
component let's try it out in the
browser let's edit this game remove that
exclamation point and save it and you
can see that it works now let's create
new game say ticket right save it and
bam it works and that's it now we have
two components page component is
responsible for getting data and
personage to form component which
responsible to manage the form if you
