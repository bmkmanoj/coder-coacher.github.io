series episode 8 delete books in this
episode we finish with crud
functionality for books and after that
things will become more interesting also
in this episode we'll see an example of
bubbling actions from child route to the
parent round so we'll have another
button here delete book and when we
click on it will have another action
that will delete this book right so
let's go back to book details and in
here we'll have simple and Cuttack with
delete book let's define class for it as
button button danger and we define
action we call it delete book so now
when we click on this link the event
will be triggered on the component and
this component will send it to
controllers and routes in the bubble
chain so we need to define this book
details component so in ab components we
define book details that GS file and
here we define component so this
component only will have actions and one
of the action will be delete book and
then it will send action action and
provide this get book object for
deletion so as we did previously now we
need to specify this action and we use
book details in book HPS so we go to
book HBS here it is book details and we
adhered action reaches delete book so
now we need to define this delete book
so what do we want to define it so book
details is used in book route so we can
just go to route book and define the
section right here so we'll have actions
delete book there's going to be a
function which takes book and inside of
the section again we'll have this and
then we'll make book destroy record
then we'll have our promise function and
we want to make this transition to route
simple books so now if you go back to
browser on the book page we have this
delete book so let's delete this one and
it do it of course we haven't done
anything on our fake server so when I
reload it will be there so we need to
fix this so let's go back to mocks books
so now we need to find the book with
specified lady in our array and delete
it from there so again quick and dirty
right so what we need to have here is
the book ID that's going to be request /
am ID and after that we'll have four
loop like this and inside of it we check
that part send the book ID equals two
books with index i dot ID if this is
true then we want to splice the books so
we'll do books splice i won and then we
want to break from this loop so let's go
back to browser now if we go to this
book and delete it and then reload the
page it works so the last thing I wanted
to talk about is where to put your
actions so right now we have three
actions create book which is in you
round up date book wishes in edit route
and delete book which is in book route
so that's pretty good it's prevail
another option is to place all of these
actions into parent books route so if we
go to router we can see that we have the
parent route books and inside of this
book new and edit so all of the action
that are not found in this routes will
be searched for in parents route so
let's have this
let's open books route and here let's
define these actions and we cut these
actions to books update book and the
last one is create book so now all
actions on the books are stored in one
place in books route let's see if it
works so I still see the list of books I
still see the book details I still I
think I can edit them some date book if
I reload it it's still there so if i
delete the book it still works and if i
try to create a book new book cool it is
created so this is one of the options
but where to store your actions is
actually your choice where it makes more
sense for your project so and that's it
we can create read update and delete
books if you liked this episode please
