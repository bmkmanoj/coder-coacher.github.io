episode three
amber data and HTTP mark so in this
episode we'll get rid of hard-coded
lists of books and replace it with amber
data model this model will make request
a server to get books data but we do not
want to develop server-side API yet so
we'll use HTTP mark to fake server
response so let's get started so first
of all let's go to routes books route
where we define our books collection we
hard-coded into here so instead of this
code we'll use books this store find
book like this so we use Amba data store
so now let's open terminal and let's run
Amber server and see what it leads us to
switch to browser load the page and now
if you go to books in console we'll see
that we do not have model book no
surprises here so we need to define this
model and we have two options to do that
we can do it manually like we did before
in this series and basically that's how
I prefer to do it or to use ember CLI
generator so let's try out the letter
option so let's go to another terminal
here and let's generate with Amber
generate model book and that will create
the book model and unit task for the
book okay let's go back to browser and
see our changes if we go back to books
again now we see that we making get
request to the books API and of course
we can't find anything here cannot find
this API endpoint so let's define our
book here we go to model book and we're
going to define three attributes on it
with title D as a der D S stands for
datastore so a drop by default is just a
string so we'll have title the string
author as a string as well and
description of the book also string of
course it's changed nothing we still
don't have server but we have amber data
model and it tries to get data from
server so ember CLI comes with HTTP mock
library that
creates this fake server for us so let's
go back again to terminal and here we
use amber generate HTTP mock and then
the name of the resource in our case
books and that will install Express and
several other modules and will create
server directory which contains fake
server it will be run when we run amber
server next time and of course it is
used only in development and testing
because the whole server directory is
ignored on deployment so let's have a
look go to server and we can see here
mocks books you can see that we have
this Express and then routes pretty
standard rest routes so here what we are
interested in get books and we respond
with books collection so basically we
want here to return books and here let's
define this books collection let's copy
and paste it in here and just indent it
properly so we're gonna have three books
here each book has ID title description
and author attributes so let's save it
let's go back to terminal where our
amber server running and let's restart
it so now our fake API server is also
run so let's try it in a browser
if we click now in books you'll see that
it's still the same result not found and
that happens because fake server creates
routes under API namespace so we need to
make slash API slash books instead of
just simple slash books so to make it
work we need to define Amba data adapter
explicitly and set this namespace option
so for that we need to create an app
folder we need to create adaptors folder
and inside of it application die J's
file and that means that we define
application adapter which is the default
adapter for the hole and the data
application so let's create both folder
and file and here we import data store
from amber data then we export default
data store rest
adapte and we extended and now we can
specify any options we need in our case
we just need to name space option which
is API let's save it go back to browser
and now if we try to click on books
you'll see the list of books nice so all
our books have fetched from this fake
server and list it on the books page
excellent and that's it for this episode
