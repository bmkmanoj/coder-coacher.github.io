uniqueness foliation on client and the
way we do - we make request the server
when user tabs away from username or
email so let's open text fields group
component that we created earlier and we
use this component for username and for
email and here let's add another event
on blur and we bind it to check user
exists so this function will be passed
to this our particular component so
let's deconstruct it here check user
exists and of course we need to edit to
the prop types right here check user
exists and that's going to be react prop
types function but it is not required
because not all text field groups should
react on blur so these are changes for
the text field so now that we have it
let's open signup form and here where we
have our text field group for username
and for email let's add some like check
user exists' equals this check user
exists and the same thing I'm going to
copy you right here and now we need to
add this event handler check user
exists' takes event and here in the in
the constructor let's bind it to this
okay so first of all inside of this
event handler let's define field which
is e target name so there's going to be
user name or email and second of all
we'll have the value itself so we have
target value and then if value not equal
to empty string then we'll have the
action so the inside of this event
handler we want to make request to the
server so we'll use another direction
for it so we'll have something like this
props and the action name will be is
user exists' and we pass the value which
is going to be username or email and
this section as
always will return promise so we can use
then like this so now we expect that is
userexists is a function on props so
let's go to the bottom here and let it
to prop types is userexists prop types
function and it is required I'd save it
now we need to pass this is user exists
function into this component from sign
up page so inside of this will have our
is user exists imported from sign up
actions then we edit 2d construction
right here is user exists then we add it
to our component here is user existing
whole is user exists then we expect it
on prop types as well so we'll have his
user exists prop types function required
and then of course in connect we add is
user exists like this so this way we
take action we connect it with the
signup page and then we pass it down to
the signup form and it seems that we are
doing a lot of unnecessary work here I
think we should unconnect this
particular component and connect the
form component itself instead but we
don't have time for it right now so I'll
leave it up to you as an exercise okay
so now we need to define this action so
let's open action sign up and that's
going to be very simple standard thunk
action is user exists it takes
identifier it returns dispatch and from
it we written promise from access we
make an get request to API users with
identifier okay so now if you try it out
in a browser it should make this request
let's have a look so now if I blur away
nothing happens oops
error happens and that's that's a typo
in the form so let's go back here and
I'm going to fix it right here
at tea but II of course let's try it
again so now if we blur away nothing
happens but if we type something and
blur we'll have an act Network request
with this particular stuff to user API
users and our value which is exactly
what we want to have excellent let's
create the endpoint so before that we go
to route users and inside of it let's
define another route get identify so it
again takes request and response pretty
usual stuff and he will have the same
career that we did for validations of
for uniqueness so we'll have the same
user query we'll have where email West
params identifier for where username the
same thing request params identifier but
also is very important we need to select
only username or email or anything like
that because we do not want to select
password digest
that's not secure so we'll add select
and we'll take username and email
columns from it and then when it's done
we'll have we'll fetch it and it returns
promise and if there is user it doesn't
matter if the Reiser the reasons we just
respond with JSON with this user so if
there is no user it will be now if there
is user then it's going to be the user
with its username and email maybe we can
provide ID as well something like that
of course you can extract this
particular uniqueness query from here
and from our validation so right here we
have the plication of sorts
let's write out an umbrella so now if I
provide
username that is there and I blur away
you'll see that we have the user
username and with my email but if I
provide something else and blur away it
will return user now so now we can work
with it in our component so let's go
back
to form and here we'll need populate
errors right so let's define errors here
and we get it from this state errors and
then if respond data user is not now
then we have this errors with field
that's why we extracted it here and
field in this case we're going to be
either username or email depending on
which field we left and we add error
message there is user with such username
or email otherwise errors for this field
is an empty string and after that we set
state with ours let's try it out in a
browser
I provide existing username and here you
see we have there is user with such
username if I provide existing email the
same happens good but we have a little
problem here if we tab away we have this
errors but then if we press for example
sign up this errors are gone and another
kind of errors appears and then happens
because we mixed on Bloor validations
with onsubmit relations and on submit
will rewrite overwrite the onblur
validations usually I don't like to do
that but in this case I took a risk as
it's fun so how can we fix it one way to
do that is to disable button right here
if we have uniqueness error so this way
user must fix them before continuing so
let's do that
so for that in our state let's add
another field and we call it invalid and
by default it's false then at the bottom
here we have the button and it's
disabled if this state is loading or
this state invalid so in both of these
cases we want to disable the button and
the last thing we need to go back to our
event handler here and in our event
handler will have invalid variable and
if you have an error we set invalid to
true otherwise
we set invalid to false and we need to
set state for invalid as well let's try
it out in a browser so now if I provide
existing username we'll have an error
and signup is disabled so user must fix
it and only then he can actually sign up
Google cool personally I hate the
relations as user they irritate me more
than bring me value but that's not about
me but about users and many users tend
to like them so that's it for this
episode so let's commit in this episode
we added client-side uniqueness
validations thanks for your time and if
