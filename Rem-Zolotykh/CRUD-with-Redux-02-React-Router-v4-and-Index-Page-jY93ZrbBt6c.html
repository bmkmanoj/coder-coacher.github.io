we'll setup reactor out of four and ran
the empty game's collection to the page
so we want to have link to our games
collection on main page this link will
lead us to games route and there we want
to see games for that we need to use
react router so let's install it with
NPM install react router at next that
installs fourth version of react router
which is in alpha right now in the time
of recording now let's open app dot J's
file here instead of this text let's add
link to games route we use link
component we specify prop to point into
games route and we specifies some link
tags like games of course we need to
import link component from react router
now in browser you can see link that
points where we need it to point to but
clicking on it raises an error we need
to set up router and to do that we use
another high order component like we did
with redirects and it's provide a
component so let's open index.js file
and let's input component browser router
from react router next we wrap our
application in it like this browser
router ripen provider component now when
we go back to browse and click games
link it works and no errors are being
raised nice now when we go to that route
we need to rent a games list component
in red router for it's so easy it's
almost embarrassing in this router
version you just use components and
that's brilliant in my opinion so we
want to click on games link and to run
the games page component inside of our
app component for that we import match
component from react router and then we
use it where we want to render sub
component we provide pattern to match in
this case games route and component that
we want to render in this case games
page now when pattern is matched
games page component will be rendered in
its place cooler let's import games page
from games page file and let's create
this file games page GS let's define it
as scene
component games page and rent a simple
content header games list now going to
the browser you see there
clicking back it disappears clicking on
the link it appears again magic coolness
and pure awesome sauce and that's it for
out of a now to recap first we need to
wrap application and browser router
component and then use other component
to handle routes like match me so
redirect and we'll look into some of
them later also a plan to create me
series dedicated to react router later
when it goes final now that we have
routing in place let's run the content
of our redox tour to the page for that
we need to connect our games page
component with redux so let's open games
page and import connect function from
react redux next let's connect component
to redux for that let's go to the bottom
expert line and wrap game's page into
connect first argument for connect is
map state to props function that takes
some piece of state from redux store and
pass it to component as prop so we
define this function it takes the whole
state as an argument and then we return
object and for this component we need to
have games so we get games from state
and assign them to games attribute now
that we have games collection we can
access it in component but first as we
introduce new prop on this component
let's document it with prop types so we
define games by H prop types equals to
object games react prop types array and
it is required now let's render empty
message if collection is empty for that
let's render games list component and
pass games collection as props to that
component of course we need to import it
from games list file and now let's
create this file and define this
component as functional component this
component takes one prop for now games
and in render just return the element as
it takes props let's define prop types
for it as well games list prop types
games
arrey is required now in the component
we can render different content
depending on emptiness of games
collection so let's define two constants
first one is empty message and adjusts a
simple paragraph with message there are
no games yet in your collection
another one is games list for now let's
just add here a dummy text but later
we'll iterate through collection and
create games lists and now in return we
use conditional if games collection is
empty we render empty message otherwise
we run the games list now let's go back
to browser and we can see empty message
rate we set up router connected games
page component to redux and rendered
empty message when we have empty
collection if you found this video
