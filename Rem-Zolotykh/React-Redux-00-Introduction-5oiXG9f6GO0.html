opening of new series on react and redux
app development the idea of series is
very simple I develop a real application
from scratch document my process then
analyze it and create shorter concise
screencasts so this series is less of a
teaching endeavor and more like a
developer journal let's answer the most
important questions you may have what
color scheme do you use well that's the
most important one in this series I use
that am editor and cobble 2 theme
created by West boss links in the
description what are we going to build
I'm quite a geek I love playing modern
designer board games and tabletop
role-playing games and I do it in real
life as well as online and after playing
piano and runnin that's my basically
most loved hobby and there is a great
community of board game players online
called right dice so the idea is to
develop application for this club core
idea is to implement games scheduling
statistics on plane as well as system of
achievements and articles stuff what do
I need to know to watch this series you
can watch it even if you know absolutely
nothing about the tech stack just to get
an impression and how development looks
like and if you like it or not but in
general I assume that you already know
basics of es6 react Redux nodejs express
and maybe a little bit of manga to be I
will not get into details explaining how
things work behind the scenes I just
provide only enough explanations to show
you my thought process behind my
decisions if you want to learn Redux I
can't recommend any brands license on
egghead enough they are gorgeous and you
should watch them right now even if
you're not using redux seriously watch
them links in the description where can
I find source code all source code will
be pushed to github repository each
episode will be ended by making commits
and pushing it to the repository so you
can follow along as you please a link to
the wrapper will be provided in
description to each episode and many
thing else worth mentioning in this
series we are going to develop real
applications starting from
to folder we'll make baby steps and
implement and use only things we really
need to accomplish our goals in the
beginning of each episode I state a goal
and we try to accomplish it with as
little fuss as possible
well how that's a basic idea we'll see
how it goes in reality ok enough talking
let's get started in the next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
