authentication in place we need to
create protection in other words it's
useless until we use it there are two
things we need to protect API endpoints
and client-side routes when we finish
with authentication we'll dive at last
into implementing core features of this
application and one of them is creating
game event only authenticated users can
do that
so let's mock it up with very simple
form and first protect API endpoint
because that's the most important
security measure and then in the next
episode we'll use higher-order component
to protect client-side route
so as usual we start from the route so
let's define inclined routes you route
here which we call new event and the
component will be you guessed it new
event page so we need of course to
import it so we'll call it new event
page yeah but here we add events ok so
now here in components we create events
folder and inside of it new event page
that J's file there's going to be a
component new event page like this and
this component is very simple it will
just render for now
event form component so let's input it
event form from event form so now we
need to create this event form and here
we'll define simple mock form with just
one field and submit button I'm going to
copy and paste code here to save us some
time like this so we again reuse in text
field group and we define props with
just one field title and we have errors
and is loading for growth we have
unchanging on submit pretty usual stuff
that we did before and we have a simple
form with header and 1 text field and a
button so now if you go to browser and
let's go to new event here is our form
excellent next we need to make request
to server on submit and for that of
course we need to connect form with
redux and create on connection as usual
so let's do this pretty standard stuff
by now we input connect
from reactor edicts the end of the file
here we connect this component with
Redux
and we pass here create event and here
of course we need to import this create
event and we imported from actions event
actions and of course as this form
expects something so it's better for us
to define prop types so it expects
create event to be function is required
okay so now we need of course to define
our action so let's create in actions
event actions J's file and inside of
here we invert the access and we export
function create event and this function
will take event and all it does is it
returns dispatch because that's the
stunk action and then it returns access
that post we're going to make a post
request to API events and we pass this
event data to it so back in the form we
need of course to call this so let's go
to on submit and here we'll do these
props create event and we pass this
state so we skip in any validations here
because this form is not actually real
it's just a mock-up okay so now we go to
browser and let's load it and let's make
a submit we have the submit and of
course as we logged in we have
authorization header right here
excellent
so from server side point of view we
want to make sure that request is coming
from authenticated user but for that we
need to verify token and to do that
we'll create simple Express made over
but first we need of course to define
route itself so let's open server index
file and here we need to define another
route and recall it events and we need
of course to in
here as well events now we need to
create it in routes events GS and inside
of here we define router and the router
itself is going to be post request like
this so this is basic scaffolding so in
the route itself we want to respond with
success so we do status 201 so this
means created and for JSON we'll do
simple generic success true so again
this is just a mock in a real
application will create actual event and
then respond with 201 status so let's
try that in browser
save it go back here and if we make
request now we have successful response
and if I log out and make the same
request again have successful our
response but that's not good in this
case we need to respond with not of
authorized error and for this we're
going to use Express middleware so we're
going to define it let's input
authenticate from middlewares
authenticate and this is going to be an
middleware and we're going to use it
right here authenticate like this so in
short when request comes to this route
first this authentic 8 meter wave
function is called inside of this
function will check for token validated
if everything is ok then we proceed with
route code here but if there is no
talking or token is invalid then
middleware responds with error and whole
separation so routes code never executes
so basically it's just a chain of
functions called one by one so in our
case authentic edge will come first and
then our route code so now let's create
this authenticate middleware so here we
create middlewares folder and inside of
it
authenticate dodged yes middleware is
just a function the regular function
like a route function it takes request
takes response and also it takes next
which is a callback fun
that calls next function in a chain okay
inside of it we can do anything we want
so first of all let's get token so we'll
have this authorization header which is
passed to us in request headers
authorization and then let's define
token by default is going to be null or
undefined and if we have this
authorization header passed to us then
we want to get token from it because you
remember that our authorization has the
word bearer then space and then token
itself so what are we going to do we're
going to take arthur ization header and
we're going to split it by space and
that returns array and then we'll take
the second element of this array which
is going to be token so now we check if
we have token we need to validate it
otherwise we do not have any token so we
need to response with error so we'll
have status 403 JSON and we'll have
error here no token provided so this is
the basic case when we have no token at
all so let's have a look in the browser
so right now I do not have any token
here in local story because I logged in
and I when I try to create it I'm
getting forbidden status and here it is
no token provided which is exactly what
we want
excellent it works so now if we have
token then we need to verify it for that
of course we'll need to import JSON web
token for verification and we need also
to input config from our config because
in this config file we store jawed
secret
okay so if we have token we need to
verify it and we do it with dot verify
and then we provide token itself and
then of course secret chart secret from
our config and the callback function
which takes error and decoded token
decode it information from this token
so in this case if we can't verify your
token if it's invalid we need again to
respond with error so if we have any
kind of error at all we just respond
with status 401 and JSON error failed to
authenticate they just arbitrarily error
messages we'll brush them up later so
this is when we have wrong George token
let's have a look let's save it let's go
back to browse and let's try to login
with village credentials and now let's
go back to our new event form and let's
go to application and change this token
I'm just gonna delete last character
from it
so now let's reload the page and let's
try to make request and here we go we
have 401 fail to authenticate because
our token is invalid we can't verify it
on a server nice so the last step if
everything is ok if talking is there and
it's valid so we handle it in this
branch
we're going to find user by ID from this
token and add it to current request so
it can be used later in middle chain so
what we going to do here we'll create
new user
so let's first import this user from our
models so we'll have models user now we
define new model user with ID decoded
dot ID and we're going to fetch it
it returns promise so we'll have then
with user and again it's possible that
we will not find the user so if you
can't find it we respond with 404 it can
happen for example that JSON web token
is valid but user has been deleted or
may be blocked by admin for example so
in this case if we can't find user will
respond with status 404 and again JSON
with error no such user
but if everything's okay we have user
what we're going to do will define new
variable current user on our request
object and assign it to be user and then
we call next like this so as you can see
we call next
only if token is valid and there is a
valid user associated with this token in
all the other cases we just throw errors
this way we can be sure that current
user is available to us in authenticated
routes so let's test it out so I'm going
to log out and log in again to fix my
authorization token here analyze go to
new event here and let's try to create
and we have successful event with
success true which is exactly what we
want and now we have current user
available to us in route so let's have a
look so let's open our route events and
instead of responding with just a
success let's respond with user to equal
request current user just to have a look
let's go back to browser and let's try
to create and now in advance we have
user in all details about our current
user and now you can see again that we
have password digest here which is not
good so just in case let's select only
safe fields because we're gonna use this
current user late and it's it's a danger
that this kind of thing can slip away so
for that let's go back to our middleware
and instead of just making this kind of
thing here I'm gonna create a query and
inside of here this will have where ID
equal to coded dot ID and select it's
going to be an array of columns that you
want to select and it's going to be
email ID and maybe username like save
stuff so now if you go back to browser
and try to submit again now we all have
much safer user details which is very
important but still let's go back to our
route and just I'm going to undo this
change
because we do not need to return user
here and that's how we protect API
endpoints
from now on so for any route that
requires authenticated user we just add
authenticate middleware and we good to
go so let's commit our gate Express
middleware so in the next episode we'll
use high-order component to handle
client side route protection so thanks
