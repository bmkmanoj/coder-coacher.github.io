is very simple through a sign-up form
and manage it state so let's open signup
page component that we have right now
and let's introduce a little bit of
markup so we'll add row and also column
d4 and Col MD and Cole MD offset for so
this way we have our form right in the
middle of the screen then remove this
from here and let's use signup form
component that we do not have right now
but we create it in a moment
so we import signup form from signup
form okay so let's create this component
signup form that GS and there's going to
be a class component because this
component is basically a form and form
has state so we will need to manage
state so let's define it as the class
component we call it sign-up form and
here is going to be a form so now let's
create simple form so we have h1 which
is going to be just join our community
and then we'll have the form group and
I'm using bootstrap style in here and
inside of it will have label with class
name control label and that's important
for styling when we'll have our
validations and the first field is going
to be user name then let's define input
with type text with name of username and
we will use this name later on change
event and with class name form control
let's close it and let's add another one
form group and inside of it we'll define
button with button class button primary
and button large okay so this is our
form very simple so now we need to
introduce state to this component but
first let's go to terminal and let's run
our server and have a look at our form
so if we go here excellent beautiful but
of course this form right now doesn't
have any state we need to introduce it
so let's do it
as we use es6 classes we define stage in
a constructor so let's define
constructor which takes props and the
first thing that we must do is to call
super props and then we need just to
define state variable and there's going
to be user name as an empty string right
now okay so this is our state so we're
going to use it in our input field here
is the value this state username and now
if you go back to browser reload the
page and try to type something nothing
happens you can hear that I'm typing but
nothing happens because now we need to
introduce on change events so we can
update the state of this component so
let's do this on change equals this
unchanged that's going to be our event
handler let's define it right here it
takes event and we're going to use this
set state to set stage in this component
but there is a little bit of a problem
here because now this keyword is
actually referring to the context of
event not the component so we need to
bind another context to this function
and we can do it two ways one way is we
bind in this context right here when we
use it and another one is a little bit
more preferable I think we define it in
a constructor so we redefine this
unchanged as this unchanged bind this
and now we have proper context in this
function so now we need to update how
user name in the state and we could do
it like this user name equals e target
value but that's not really flexible
because this way for each element in the
form we need to create separate function
instead of it we'll use e target name
which we specified right here
so by convention we require each form
field to have a name ok let's save it
go back to browser now if you type it
works and if we go to react here and
search for form you can see that it has
staged with username and this state is
changing when we type something
excellent so we almost done now we need
to define on subdomain so every time
when we submit form we take this state
object and we will send it to the server
but for now let's just create this on
submit event this on submit and we
repeat the same thing with binding right
here submit and let's define it on
submit takes event and we of course a
prevent default and then let's just
cancel that lock this state object this
we're going to pass to another function
later which will make the Ajax request
to our server so if we save it go back
to browser and cancel here I have a gain
type on submit let's try it again and
refresh the page and here if it have
something and click on submit here we go
object username gibberish excellent it
works so basically we done but let's
finish our form we need also to have
email password password confirmation and
the timezone so for this application
timezone is essential because we'll have
game scheduling so let's add this fields
into our state so we'll have email we'll
have password we'll have password
confirmation and we'll have time zone
now go and just copy and paste another
three fields right here and they are
identical to our username field except
that we use email and we renamed name
and value we using the proper state
field ok let's save it go back to
browser excellent we got our form
and it works so the last thing is to
have the time zone and I want to make it
as a select so first we need to have a
time zones like we can sort in a
database but for now I just took it from
the internet and let's create in here in
a client folder we create data folder
inside of it time zone start GS file and
I'm going to paste it right here so all
I do here is export object with all time
zones so let's save it now I'm going to
import it from here time zones from data
time zones ok so now here I'm going to
play select so we have the label we have
select with class name with name time
zone the same unchanged in the same
value because nothing change everything
rule will still work and we provide
option the first option is like a helper
text with empty value and disabled
there's going to be choose your time
zone and all other will be options so
we'll have options here so let's create
this options variable right here
beginning here will define constant
options and we want to map this object
into array of options and for that we'll
use map from lodash so we can iterate
through objects as well so we'll have
map and I'm going to import map from
lodash map and the first argument is our
time zones object and the second is a
function the first argument of which is
value and the second one is key energy
chance option with key value and with
value as value and here we display key
itself ok so I'd save it now we need to
install lodash so let's run npm install
save lodash so let's run our selves
again
go back to browsing below the page and
we have in our time zone as well if you
choose something and we submit we'll
have our time zone here excellent it
works so we've done for this episode
let's commit sign up form and its fate
and that's it for this episode thanks
