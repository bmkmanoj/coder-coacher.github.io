and flux in this series we're going to
work on the same application we worked
in amber in action series bookworm this
way we already know what we want to
achieve and can get right to the
business and a cool bonus we can compare
two approaches and choose which ones
users better in this episodes we'll set
up our basic application and it's not so
easy as you might think because flux is
just a collection of guidelines and
there is nothing like an bacilli to get
us started instead we have to make a lot
of decisions by ourselves
starting from project file structure and
ending with libraries and frameworks we
want to use on the one hand we have
flexibility and freedom on the other a
lot of decisions to make so let's not
waste time and get down to business
first we need server to serve our
index.html file and we use this server
in the future to mock API as well so
let's open them here and let's create
server folder index dot HTML file that
is going to be very simple html5 file
and instead of it will have just a
simple D with ID react app and while we
here let's add title as well
book 1 so this is the starting point for
our react application later we find this
tag and render there our main component
also we need JavaScript but will serve
JavaScript with web pack dev server so
let's leave it up for now so now we need
to serve this index.html so let's create
in the same folder server that J's file
and that's going to be very simple
Express application let's define app as
Express and also we're going to use body
parser Jason for future JSON requests to
the server and all we need to do is to
define the main route which takes quest
and response and inside of it we just
send our index.html file so we'll use
half package gonna join with current er
name
and index.html and after that we just
listen to pour 3000 and let's console
the vlog something in console like app
listen an ad HTTP localhost 3000 like
this of course we need to import Express
from Express and import both person from
body parser and path package from path
like this
so we using es6 on our server so we need
to install Express body parts of
packages and as well no daman and babel
as a transpiler so let's do this first
of all let's run NPM in it to initialize
our package and we're just going to use
default values for all of this and now
we can use NPM install 5 Express body
Parsa node 1 and Babel ok that's done
let's go back to VM and let's open our
package JSON file and inside of this
script let's define you run command we
call it back end and that's going to use
node 1 and we execute the babel node
package to transpile everything in stage
0 the most experimental stage possible
and we specify the server file which
resides in server server
Dargis okay that's all that we need to
do for server so as open you tab here
and let's run npm run backend
ok excellent a placement at localhost so
let's go to localhost so you can see how
beautiful our application is and here we
have our react app so it's working it
serves our index.html file and now we
need to go to the front end so in this
episodes we just want to run the hello
world component in the next one we'll
change it to be react wrong
so we can have similar routing as we
worked with amber also in light episodes
we introduced flux itself so let's
create client folder and inside of it we
define fgs this is our main entry file
for our react application inside of it
we of course import react from react and
we import main component from components
main main and after that we just use
react render and we render this main
component into document get element by
ID react app which we already created in
our index.html file right here excellent
so now we need to define this main
component so let's do this let's create
components folder and inside of it main
folder and inside of it main the GS
component so we import react from react
as usual and then we export so we use in
es6 so export default class main which
extends from react component and here we
need to define render function which
returns h1 hello world ok like this very
simple so now we got everything in place
except the build system that system will
build everything to one file and we can
include it into our index.html file and
even better with a helper web pack dev
server we can do it live so we do not
use actual files we fetch data right
from the dev server so web pack is quite
a huge thing and may be in later
episodes we're gonna have a little bit
more details about it but right now we
want just the basics just to get her
application started so let's start from
the end we go to package dot JSON here
let's define new command
front end and there's going to be just
the note which runs webpack web pack
server file ok so now we need to create
this file so let's create web pack
folder and inside of it web pack dot
server dot yes so here we'll have the
simple web pack dev server so let's
define it server equals new web pack dev
server which we of course need to
require web pack dev server equals
require web pack dev server so it takes
web pack with config ok so we need to
define web pack and we need to define
config which is going to be our own
config that we're going to define in a
minute so we're going to require web
pack config def basically for different
environments we want to define different
configuration files so we're going to
create only Deaf in in our case and
after we did this we can specify
additional options for our server and
the first one is public path which is
required for our hot reloading stuff and
and I will demonstrate the hot road in
the end of this episode it's quite cool
so we just fetch it from our config
object from output public path then we
specify heart to be true and we can also
specify some stats for example colors to
be true and after that we run this
server so we listen on port 8080 on
localhost and we just leave this
callback function empty for now ok so
this is our backpack dev server but we
need to create this config file so let's
do this web pack that config dot dev yes
so forth in we need to require web pack
and now we need to export objects so we
do module exports object there are
several things that we need to specify
the first one is dev tool option which
we use in line source map which is quite
important for debugging then we have
entry points and here we specify first
of all we need to specify our
application which we already know
resides in client / app but also we need
to specify web pack dev server and we do
it with web pack dev server / client and
we specify where it should be on HTTP
localhost 8080 and for hot reloading we
need to specify web pack entry point for
hot and only dev server okay so these
are entry points that web pack will take
transpile and provide to us next we need
of course to specify output options
first of all is going to be a path which
is their name and we're going to store
our output in public /gs folder then we
need to have a file name for the output
we call it a PS and then we need to have
public path which were already used
right here as you can see public path so
we specify it to be HTTP localhost 8080
/ GS so our output will be in this
localhost 8080 /gf /f GS so we can go
back to our index dot HTML file and
require here script with source HTTP
localhost 8080 / GS / app yes so in
production will have the actual app GS
file but in development we just use in
the web pack dev server to provide us
this Abdul
J's file so next we need to have plugins
and we're going to have two the first
one going to be web pack the most
important one hot module replacement
plugin and the second one will be web
pack no errors plugin for development
okay next one we need to specify resolve
object and we're going to resolve
extensions empty and GS and the last one
very important is module and here we
specify loaders it's going to be an
array and loaders will just simply
transpile things that we need like JSX
or SAS or CoffeeScript anything the tree
you really need in our case we need JSX
so let's create tasks so we testing
against regular expression so dot GS and
acts as optional when we encounter file
with j6 or just jazz expression we want
to use loaders on it react hot and babel
loader so babel order allows us to use
es6 in our react code and react hot
allows us to use hot module replacement
and we need to exclude node modules from
this transpile and stuff ok and that's
it well if you've never worked with web
pack it may be a little bit of
mumbo-jumbo but basically what we do we
have entry points here for a web pack
and for our application then we have
then we specify the output then we use
the plugins that we really need you can
read about them on web pack site and
then we specify loaders here to use
different stuff like sass JSX
etc so now we need to install all of
these goodies so let's go back to
terminal and we install save web pack
web pack
dev server Babel loader react hot loader
and react itself and that should do it
so let's go back here and run our npm
run back-end okay good
in another tab we're gonna use npm run
front-end and that's gonna run our web
pack server it will compile everything
and you can see that bundle is now valid
excellent and now we go to our localhost
and reload the page you can see here
hello world nice so now let me
demonstrate you what is hot reloading so
here i have my code on the left and
browser on the right and if i go back to
my main component here and i just make
some change and when i save this file
you will see that on the right it
reloads automatically automatically
without reloading page it just updates
only this component and that's it we
have basic setup for our project if you
