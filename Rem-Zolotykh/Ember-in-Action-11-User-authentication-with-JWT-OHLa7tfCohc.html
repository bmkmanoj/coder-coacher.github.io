series episode 11 user authentication
in this episode we'll implement token
authentication using jort which stands
for JSON web token first we'll talk a
little bit about the theory of how token
authentication works then we start from
creating login form and that means we'll
create route template and component as
usual then we'll use simple mouth and
simple auth token packages to implement
all thent ocation itself then we'll make
mark server to provide our app with
jorge token and in the end we'll make
login or logout links to appear nav bar
depending on if user authenticated or
not so let's get started so let's talk a
little bit about how token
authentication works first thing we need
to remember is that web server is
stateless which means it doesn't store
any state like current user and such in
standard web application we used cookie
based sessions to emulate state but now
when we have separate server API we
can't do that well technically we can
but we shouldn't instead of it we use
tokens so here how it works
first client sends request to some
authentication route to server with
valid credentials like username and
password server checks credentials and
then if they are ok generates encrypted
token and return it back to client in
our case this token will be created with
jawed standard now client saves this
token and until it has one from
client-side prospective users considered
to be authenticated
from now on client includes this token
in every request it makes to the server
it can be included in many ways but the
most popular one is as a header
authorization now its server response
ability to handle authorization if API
route should be protected then server
against this token checks it for valid
nests and if it's ok provide access to
route otherwise responds with 401 status
so these are basics of token
authentication theory so let's get down
to business first
let's run Amber server and here you can
see we have some kind of error
the deprecation that I introduced in
previous episodes with actions for
validation and on it advised me to use
input focus out instead like this so
let's fix this duplication so let's go
to book form the HBS file and here
instead of action
we'll use focus out and instead of this
on focus out we just remove it like this
so now if we go back and we restart
server everything should be fine
okay so let's create our login route and
login form as usual we'll start from
link so let's go to navbar HBS file and
here we introduce another unordered list
tag with nav nav bar nav and nav bar
right classes instead of it we'll define
mu linked to and we call it login route
with tag name list item and empty and
Kotak log-in like this so now we need to
define this route so let's go to router
and here let's define route which we
call login so now we need to create
template for this login so let's go to
app templates login dot HBS here will
render login form component so let's
define Rho inside of it we'll have call
small 6 and call small offset 3 and
inside of these divs will have login
form and this form will take credentials
and action which we call authenticate so
this staff should be very familiar by
now right
ok so now we need to provide a
credentials object from route to the
component as well as this authenticate
action so we need to create login route
so let's do this in a Prout's we define
login Dodge's that's going to be amber
input route and as usual we'll have
model here which in this case is going
to be just a simple amber object let's
create one
and the credential object just consists
from email and password now we need to
set this credentials object on the
controller and the last thing we need to
do is to define action subject and
inside of it define our authentic eight
function and this function will take
some kind of credentials and for now we
just cancel that lock these credentials
like this so now we need to create this
login form components template so let's
define one and app templates components
we define login form not HBS and that's
going to be very simple form so we're
gonna have form let's define action to
be submit like we did before and we run
it on submit event and inside of this
form we'll have to form groups the first
one will be the label for email and the
input will be with value credentials
email and of course we need to provide
class form control very easy right let's
copy this duplicate it and instead of
email here we'll have password and for
password input field we need to provide
type password like this and the last
thing we need to do is button with class
button button primary login and type of
this button and submit ok very easy so
I'll leave it up to you to implement
validation of this form which can serve
as a good exercise so now in this login
form component we need to send action so
let's created in app components we
define login form yes and there's going
to be a component and inside of it we
just define actions object submit it's
going to be a function they just makes
this send action action and it provides
these get credentials so like we did
before so let's test it in the browser
we can see that now we have login wind
if we go there and provide some data
when we login we have our credentials
object with provide the data excellent
it works so now we need to make request
to server to authenticate user and get
Joel token we could do it manually the
whole thing but that's a lot of detail
so it need to implement by ourselves
like wearing how to store this token or
how to include token into each request
etc so we'll use excellent simple out
package and it's extension simple off
token which provides us with token and
short authenticators so let's install
them for that we go to terminal and
let's install NPM install save dev and
bacilli simple off so after we install
it we need to generate ember CLI simple
out and we need to do the same thing
with token ember CLI simple auth token
and generate token but without a mercy
line like this and this is just
extractions from the readme file so to
use simple out we need to rename our
email into identification and then set
our identification to be email sounds
cool right
so in our login the GS round right here
we set credentials objects with email
and password fields so this email should
be changed to identification and of
course in login form that HBS file we
need to change this credentials email to
identification so now we need to make
request to server we make in our request
and login route right here in
authenticate so instead of this console
that log will get session and this
session object is provided to us by
simple out and this object has several
methods one of them is authenticate and
this method takes two parameters first
is authenticated what Authenticator do
we want to use and the second one is
actual credentials for Authenticator
we'll use simple out Authenticator : jot
and this Authenticator is provided by
simple auth token package so let's have
a look in the browser first of all of
course we need to run server now let's
go to browser and let's try to login
with some data
and you can see that we make it post
request to API token out and the payload
of our request is password and username
y username
well because identification is username
we need to change it to email and also
we can change this API token out to some
another endpoint that we want to have so
let's do this for that we need to go to
environment our JS file and right here
after we define this environment object
as do environment simple out token and
here we define some configurations and
the first one is identification field
which we want to be email and the second
one is server token and point and let's
make it API slash tokens so now if P
restart server and in browser let's try
it again you'll see that we make an
request to tokens and the payload has
email and password nice it works so the
next step is to implement server
response so for that we need to create a
new mock file let's do this in our
server folder in machs we create tokens
da GS here we export function inside of
this function we need to define Express
and our router so we'll do router equals
Express router like this and at the end
here we'll use app use for API tokens we
mount our router so for this mock we
need only one endpoint the post request
so let's do this router post we'll have
function with request and response
that's pretty standard Express stuff so
inside of this we need to check for our
authentication so what does it mean to
check it we need to check for username
and for password so for example we can
do something like this requires body and
we'll take email and it should equal to
some user email and
requires body password should be equal
to user password so if this condition is
true then user is valid and we need to
january token and respond with this
token to the client otherwise we just
respond with status for a-1 and end this
ok we need of course to create user here
so let's define it for our user simple
javascript object with email let's make
it test at task calm and password secret
very secure one so of course in real
world we'll have some kind of a database
and password should be encrypted and all
this jazz but this is just a mock right
so now inside of here we need to
generate token so let's define token and
we're going to generate it with JSON web
token note library so we'll have it
right here let's define dot equal
require JSON web token and of course we
need to install it we'll do it in a
second but now we can use it and this
dot library has sign method which takes
two parameters first one is the payload
which is just the simple object of data
that we want to provide to client for
example it could be user ID or user
email or username
nothing fancy though so we'll provide
user email and the second parameter is
our secret key for encryption of this
token secret key and now we can respond
with this token like this but that's not
all simple oath makes simple application
slash JSON request so if we go to server
index digest we can see that we have
four body parser here we have type
application VND
which means JSON API but simple out
making simple application slash JSON
request so let's duplicate this line and
provide here just a simple JSON as well
so now we need to go to terminal and
let's install with save def
Jason web token okay let's run so uh so
let's have a look in a browser we again
try to submit invalid credentials and we
have response for a-1 which is good
let's submit good credentials with
secret and now we have successful post
request and in response we have token
here is our JSON token and this token is
handled automatically by simple oath
it's stored and can be used which is
really cool but last thing that we need
to do is to specify authorizer this
authorizer will include token in every
request to the server so if now for
example we go to books and try to create
a new book we'll see in our book request
here in headers we do not have
authorization header ok let's go to
environment dan JS file and here let's
add another configuration simple out and
we just specify authorizer
and the authorizer will be simple out
authorizer : token and this authorizer
is provided to us by simple auth token
package so now if we restart server and
try it again
let's create another book at book now if
we go back here to see here is
authorization bearer and our token which
is stored locally in local storage so we
do not need to do it manually which is
always a good thing right
ok so the last thing in this episode
let's show this login link only when we
are not authenticated and logout when we
are and we'll make a couple of small
improvements along the way so first of
all when we login we do not redirect
anywhere so let's fix this in our login
the ideas here the authenticate method
returns promise so we can use then as we
usually do and here I will have VAR this
equal this
and we'll use this transition to books
okay so now when we login we are
redirected to books route okay so now
let's go back to navbar HBS file and
here we introduced conditional
so if session is authenticated and this
is authenticated properties provided to
us by session object it just checks for
token if there is a token then is
authenticated returns true so in this
case we want to provide list item with
anchor tag let's say with action log out
log out like this otherwise we'll render
this link and let's close it block this
session object is mixed in in every
controller but we are in the component
so we need to pass the session object
into the nav bar component for that
let's go to application data HBS file
where we actually use this component and
here let's add session equals session
let's indent this line as well so now if
you go back to browser you see that we
have logout link nice
of course this logout link does nothing
so let's fix it for that we need to
create at finest our navbar component so
we'd go to components navbar da GS and
let's make this component and inside of
this component we just need to define
actions and it's going to be logout and
again we'll just use session object and
this such an object which we passed to
this component has invalidate method
which invalidates session it simply
removes the token from the session now
we go back and click on this logout then
we have login excellent and if we login
with valid data we'll have log out here
so we used three things on this session
object here we used authenticate which
takes two parameters Authenticator and
denzel's we used invalidate method which
destroys the token and we used either
authenticated property which we can use
to determine if user is logged in or not
and that's it for this episode now you
know how to implement user
authentication using jolt talking if you
