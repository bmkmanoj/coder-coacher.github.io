in place we need to add another
validations to sign-up process we must
ensure that email and username are
unique because both of these fields will
serve as user identifiers we already
added this restriction to database
schema so which will throw an exception
on that level will be tried so let's
have a look if you go to browser and try
to submit this form with existing
username you can see here that I have
500 status and an error that tells me
that key Ramji already exists it works
but nothing happens on a client-side and
the database validation database check
is always the last resort we need of
course to validate data in our code
let's start from server side validation
that's how I prefer to progress first
handle the most important server side
and then improve it on client as well so
we going back to our editor and let's
open route users and right here we use
validate input function and this
function is used both by server and by
client but client has no access to
database stuff of course so we going to
define new high order function that will
use this function and enhance it with
checking data for uniqueness so let's
rename this validate input import to be
for example common validations something
like that and here let's define our high
order function we call it validating
input and we will take data and other
validations function and the first thing
that we're going to do we're going to
run this other validation
it's a synchronous function so it's safe
to do that we're going to deconstruct
and take on the errors from it and we
pass data to this function we do not
need to get is valid because we need to
recheck it after checking for uniqueness
and now we need to check for uniqueness
and that means that we need to query
database and working with database means
and synchronous code and bookshelf
allows us to work with promises and that
means that we'll return promise from
this function somehow
in return promise and that means that we
can't use it anymore like this because
this code becomes a synchronous so it
works with promises so instead of this
here we're going to call validate input
with request body and we're going to
pass common validations to it and then
we'll have our function it will have the
same object so we're going to
deconstruct it errors and is valid and
now we just move this code into the then
callback like this
okay back to validate input here so so
we need to check in the user with email
or username existing database there are
two ways we can do that we can make two
Cruz two database separately or we can
make one only one query and then check
the result let me show you both ways so
in first case we're going to query the
database for each check like this we're
going to use this user and we construct
where email equals data email then we
fetch it
it returns promise so we have then which
has this user here and if user is found
then we set errors email to message
there is user with such email and the
second one is the same we just use user
name for it so we're making two queries
and that makes it to two promises we
need to wait when both of them are
fulfilled and then return result object
we can do that with promise that all so
we can do something like this you know
return this promise and all function
takes an array of promises so we're
going to shift these two promises right
here so I need to remove semicolon and
when both of these promises are
fulfilled we're going to use then
and inside of it is then we're going to
return object errors and is valid is the
same is empty errors where can we find
this promise all we can import it from
Bluebird so we're going to here we
import promise from Bluebird and also
let's import of course is empty from
lodash is empty okay so now I need to
p.m. install safe Bluebird okay
so let's recap what we did so we have
this new high order function it takes
our common function with synchronous
validations which I use both and clients
on server it runs it and takes errors
from it and then it makes two queries to
database and first it searches for user
by email then for by username and if
user is found then we add error messages
and then we return when both of these
promises are fulfilled we return the
object with this errors and is valid and
then when we use it we deconstruct this
object right here and so we can use
errors and it's valid as we did before
so let's try it out in a browser so here
we have our signup form and when we
click signup we'll have both of these
fields invalidated okay it works nice
but we query the database twice and
forced to use promise that all to handle
it that's really good let's try another
approach so instead of using two
promises here I'm going to return only
one promise which is returned from the
bookshelf so we have this user and we
create query for it the first one is
where email equals to data that email
and the second one is all where username
equals data username then we fetch it
and we have a problem so we have
which returns user and now if users
found we need to populate errors and we
need to check by which field it was
found so we can do something like user
get username and get is the methods
provided to us by bookshelf to access
data on our model so if username equals
to data username so then we'll have ours
that username equal to that message okay
and the same thing goes for email so if
it has email and it equals to data email
we have error message for it and at the
end when we done with this check we just
return the same object that we returned
here like this okay so we can return
this problem is that all altogether
so this way we making only one request
and then we analyze the returned user
and of course if there are no users so
errors will be unaltered and will be
returned here and also we do not need
promise library anymore
so let's have a look at a browser I'm
going to sign up again and we have the
same thing so if I change it and sign up
again you see that now username is valid
and the same goes for email of course
nice so let's commit so we validate
username and email uniqueness on server
