third episode in the series where we
build real web application with react
and nodejs live code style in this
session what are we gonna do is we
mostly will focus on back-end code to
implement you the user authentication so
we will check if you user credentials
are correct and then if they are we send
JSON web token to the client and on the
client today we're going to implement
this switching between login and logout
links depending on the user
authentication state so there are a lot
for us to do so let's get started first
of all in our back-end code here
I haven't installed es lint haven't set
it up so let's do it right now yes
lanzar see I'm using the same
configuration I just remove this JSX
because I do not need it and I'm gonna
install all of these packages as well
another thing that I need to install is
yarn ad dev Babel
yes lint okay so now if I go to okay I
got a cat here isn't she being so now
going back to our way to take we go to
index GS we should have a slant yes it
works nice so let's status it and commit
yes line setup okay so now we need to
install Mongoose we're going to use
Mongoose to communicate with our
database I suppose that she already
installed Monty to be if you not then
pause this video and go to the official
website and install it or use homebrew
for that so to install it I'm going back
to terminal yarn add Mongoose and now I
can connect it to the database so here
I'm going to import Mongoose
from Mongoose and after that I want to I
need to connect it and what we did
before was Mongoose that connect and
then we provide the manga DB URL like
localhost and then the name of the
database bookworm but now it's not
enough so if I save it and go back to
terminal you see here that this way is
deprecated so we need to pass to fix
this we need to pass another option here
and it is called use Mongo client true
itis and that's it we connect it to our
database we don't even have it yet in
the manga to be but that doesn't matter
this manga to be it's very flexible in
this way so now in this in this route
API out we're going to extract it into
separate file and there we will need to
find user by email so let's just delete
it from here and let's import user out
from routes user and next to we use AB
dot use and we mounted at API on that
user out and we mount it into API out
like this okay so now we need to create
routes out the GS file and I have again
the snippet for routes the boilerplate
so we have Express we get the route and
then we export this router and on this
router we can define any kind of routes
we want so for example we need to have
post request and response so now here
we'll have constant credentials then
shells
let me get from request body like this
and we can't do it right now this way
because we do not have this request body
because in Express you need to have body
parser to parse your body so let's
install it we go back to terminal yarn
add body parser
and in index file we input by the parser
from by the parser and then when we
instantiate application we have a pues
body parser dot JSON because we're going
to use only the JSON for now so no need
for other person to happen so now here
now out we have credentials and by this
credential these credentials have email
and password and we want to find user by
email and then check that the password
is the correct one so for that we need
to create user model user mongoose model
so we'll use user from models user and
here then we can do something like this
find one by email credentials email okay
and we will do it in a moment but first
let's define this user model so let's go
to models and create user dot JS file so
first of all I need to import Mongoose
oops
from Mongoose and then I want to expert
default the the model itself and to have
model I expert mongoose model and the
first argument is the model name it's
user and Mongoose will PluralEyes it and
it will be users and this collection the
this this becomes the name of the
collection that it will search in the
MongoDB database
so that's user and we'll need to define
schemer for this particular model so
let's define schema its new mongoose
schema capital s and then in here we
just define it so basically we have two
just two attributes right now email that
with the type of string it is required
true and let's add lower
case as well true so this way no matter
how you type your email it will be
transformed into the lower case we also
need to make sure that it is unique and
that it is actual email but for that we
need to install some plugins we will
leave it for now so let's add here the
comment to do add uniqueness uniqueness
and email validations to email field ok
another thing that I can add is index to
true because email should be changed
very seldomly very rare but it will be
the main attribute by which we go on to
find users ok and another one is going
to be password hash and password hash is
just the hash of the password this is
encrypted passwords we never ever store
passwords in our database that's insane
what we do is we encrypt it with one-way
encryption algorithm and store this
encryption in our database so this is
what this is what password hash so the
type string as well and it is required
as well like this and the second
argument that we can provide is options
and for example one of them as time
stamps true so this way we're going to
have create it as update it as handle
for us automatically
nice let's save it here we go we have
our user model so now in out here let's
use it and let's try to find email user
by email and it will return promise and
there is one actual thing that I will
tell you about the promise in a second
so and it will take it will process the
user and user will be even now if
nothing is found all the record itself
so we can check if user then we do
something here something useful else
we respond with status 400 and Jason to
be errors global errors global let's say
invalid credentials like this okay
so let's have a look let's try it out so
when I try it yeah we have invalid
credentials because there is not there
is even no database book home database
in my mom good to be right now so now
let's add some user and for that we need
to have email and password hash and
we're gonna hash it with bcrypt you can
do it with crypto library as well but we
will do it with bcrypt
as one of the way to do that so let's
yarn add bcrypt
to our project and I also got this big
ripple installed globally so I can use
it right now so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna run node and in here I'm gonna
have bcrypt
equals require bcrypt I want to I want
to get the the hash for the password so
here is big crypt that hash sink and I
want password 1 2 3 4 5 let's say and 10
is the salt round numbers that matter
here is we have our hash so I'm gonna
copy it and I go quit the node and now
I'm going to Mongo
so what I want to do here is I want to
use bookworm database and inside of it I
want to use the be users and I want to
insert new new record into it with email
my email
oMG gmail.com and password hash to be
this thing here them ok right result and
insert is one that means that we have
record there so we can check it with
users that find like this here is we
have only one user and that this is one
me with my very secure password 1 2 3 4
5 ok so I can exit right now so now we
have user so if we find it in in here
we'll have something like I just have a
look that we actually do it success sure
so it has been found right so now we do
not right now
check for passwords yet so if I do this
like this we have an error on the
client-side that's ok but what what what
matters is in network here we have
success true so the user has been found
with such email the user has been found
in the database so this lookup thing
works fine
the next thing that we need to do is to
check passwords ok so for that lets go
to our user model here and let's define
instance method on this model and we can
do it with schema methods and then the
name of the method is is for example is
valid passwords so this function that's
going to be a function function is valid
password it takes password and it will
return boolean true or false depending
on the result of the comparison of the
hashes and bcrypt gives us this
comparison so we have to import bcrypt
from the crypt and here I'll use bcrypt
compare thing sync so synchronous
compare and I have password and then
this password hash from the database so
now I can use it in my route right here
and say that if users found and if user
is valid password with credentials
password then it's ok then everything is
good and I can return something like
user equals email user dot email
something like that ok so let's have a
look in the browser then reload the page
I'm gonna 1 2 3 4 5 so that's the
correct password Pam and it works it
even redirects and if you can if you go
to out here you can see that we have
user with email and if you go to redux
you can see that we in state we have
this action user logged in and it wrote
email to it
great that's a good progress but now
what we want to do is when a user logged
in if credentials are correct then we
want to have a little bit more details
here we want to pass we want to return
email and token JSON web token for that
we need to yarn add JSON web token
library and inside of our and inside of
our model we'll add another method so
we'll have schema methods and I'll I'd
said two hours Jason so this is going to
be just a function that will create
object that we want to pass down to our
client because we do not want to pass
down the whole records we don't want to
pass down password hash and also that's
not a really cool thing to do it in the
route itself it's very noisy and if we
want to change something we'll need to
hand out it in all routes well here it's
centralized we are we know that all of
this to Jason stop happens right in the
model here so there's gonna be function
two out jason it doesn't take anything
and it returned and it returns object
and inside of it will have email this
e-mail and another one is going to be
token this generate dot token another
method so let's define another method
here so schema methods generate dot also
function generate
token and we return here the dot so
we're going to input drug library
from JSON web token and here we'll have
short that sign that's one that's the
method with which we encrypt create and
encrypt our web token and the first
parameter is the public data that's very
important here is the public data it's
not encrypted anybody can take this JSON
token run it through the decoder and get
this data so it's intentional is the
public data and we're gonna include here
just the user email so email today's
email and the second parameter is the
secret key for for encryption okey dokey
so now here instead of this we'll do
user equals user to of Jason call let's
have a look in the browser so if we go
to login here and we pass down correct
password BAM and it works and you can
see now we have token so token has been
generated and it was passed down to our
client and we can now use it on the
client right now we do not do anything
with token so nothing changes on the
page but we're gonna do it in a minute
but first you can see here that in our
user model we're using the secret key
hard-coded here it's not good and also
this thing here manga DB URL also not
good because on your local machine for
example it could be the another database
name or another URL that you use or you
can be using the hosting so service
among good to be service or something
like that so we do not want to hard code
this stuff we want to keep them in
separate file in environment variables
and for that we're going to use dot and
so if we go back to our project we yarn
at dot and done and now here we can we
import data from data F and all we have
to do to set it up we call dot and that
can fake for now that's enough later we
will tweak it if we need but the
convention is we need to create and file
in our root folder here and now here we
can define any kind of environment
variables what we want to do is we want
to define Mongo DB URL and we want to
define jawed oops
dot secret so now if we go back to here
and we're gonna cut this thing from here
and paste it into environment and to use
it to get it from environment variable
we use process dot N and then the name
of the variable MongoDB URL okay and
that's that sorry and the same thing we
can do with secret token here so I'm
gonna remove it process that and that
Gorge secret and now here in and I'm
gonna add sick secret key yeah okay so
let's have a look in the browser is it
just work are we broken anything so we
still have the invalid credentials
that's good if credentials are valid
then we have a problem
and I think we need to restart the
server let's try it again
one two three four five login and it
works good so as you can see now we we
can store any kind of variables that are
depending on the environment in the
environment variables which is very cool
and very easy to handle another thing is
that I promise you about the promises is
here we have the duplication another
duplication so Mongoose and promise is
deprecated you should use something else
and what I use usually is Bluebird so
I'm gonna yarn add Bluebird
also awesome promise library highly
recommended and here in index I'm gonna
import promise from Bluebird you can
name it
this thing here promise nothing special
you can name it anything and in Mongoose
here I'll use Mongoose that promise
equals promise so this way I overwrite
the built-in Mongo promise library with
bluebird promise library which is much
better okay so now we have the server
right so if we want to login with
invalid credentials we have invalid
credentials you can see that then the
email is the same but the password is
wrong so actual authentication works and
if you provide correct password then we
update our state with data and yeah it's
cool and we redirect it because the
promised results successfully that's
good so now what I want to do is I want
to change this log in to log out if I'm
if I'm authenticated and otherwise to
have login so conditional stuff before
we do that let's commit this change so
status and we do user authentication so
here in our react code let's go to home
page
here's where we have this login and
logout and I need to connect it so now
what does it mean that user is logged in
it means that in state in Redux state we
have user records with token okay so
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
connect this component with react Redux
right and we'll have connect here oops
and first argument is map state two
props let's define this function Maps
tape the props it takes state and it
returns the the props that will be
available on the home page and one of
them is is authenticated and this is
boolean of state user token so if
talking is undefined it's going to be
converted to false if it's something
like any kind of strain it will be
converted to true so now we can use it
we can deconstruct it here so so
basically what i'm doing here is the
component takes props but instead of
using props and then props that is
authenticated
I actually deconstruct it here it is
authenticated so now I need of course to
add it to my prop types so is
authenticated is the boolean good so now
I can use this is authenticated and if
it's if users or is if you if user is
authenticated I want to have the button
logout and otherwise I want to have this
link to login so now if I go back on
prop types yeah
types so now if I go back and I login we
have logout button cool right it works
but we have one issue if I reload the
page it will go back to login because
when we were loaded as you can see here
the state is empty we reinitialize the
whole application so we need a way to
keep talking and if it's there then we
need to repopulate Riddick's state and
we can do it with local storage so let's
do it
so when we have here in actions in oath
right here we just dispatch function now
it's not now just dispatching the
function we also need to save the token
in local storage we can create another
utility function to do that so we are
not actually connected to local storage
so we can use any kind of other kind of
storage but we'll do it dirty here local
storage and we call the name is bookworm
short book on short and it equals to
user dot token like this so this way we
save token into the local storage when
we login so to have a look let's go back
here and if you log in again here an
application you can see that we have
bookworm short token and it is saved in
the in the local storage I'm pointing to
my screen as you as you can see it so
here
yeah we have our storage and it doesn't
matter if I reload the page it is still
there so we can use it right now so
we'll use it in index digest file here
we'll check so if local storage that
bookworm dot if it's present here then
what we want to do is
want to dispatch user logged in action
but for that we need to have some kind
of a user record that we want to write
into it and one of the things is we need
to have token and the token is local
storage booked one jot token okay so and
now we can just use store
dispatch and dispatch user logged in
action and pass user object to it
of course we need to import this user
logged in from actions off another thing
that we actually need to do is better to
do is to decode our jorge token and get
the email from there and so we can have
email as well we do not need it right
now
so we will skip it so now if I reload
the page if I reload the page we have
logout
we have logout because we have this
token in in our local storage and when
we initialize our application we get it
oh we have token and we dispatch user
logged in action and it passes this set
this token in our user which is a cool
thing so now the last thing that we can
do is to when we click on this logout we
actually log out and what it means to be
logged out is just to remove this log
user record set it to a empty object we
don't need to make any kind of request
to server so of course if you have some
kind of token expirations and you want
to communicate with the server and you
can and you want to log for example
logins and log outs you will do this
this request to server just to log that
hey user has been logged out by himself
for example but in our case we just need
to remove local storage and that's it so
let's do this so here in homepage we
have this button logout so let's head on
click on click
and what we're going to do is we're
going to log out so here we'll have log
out and we get this log out from actions
log out action from actions out and here
in connect I pass it down to rappin into
the dispatch function log out like this
so now of course we do not actually have
logout and also is linty doesn't like
when we have this shadow and thing we
have log out at the top here and we have
log out here and yes line doesn't like
this so we can disable this rule or we
can change it to do it to something like
this we input all actions as actions as
actions from this file and here we
define that we define a log out to be
actions log out this way we will not
have any kind of errors like this and
yeah here we invoke this function yeah
okay now we need to edit the props
validations so we have log out to be
function now you're happy yeah now it is
happy cool so now we need to define it
so let's go to out here it's very
similar to what we have in log in but we
call it log out it doesn't have to take
any credentials it doesn't make any kind
of response here so I'm gonna just
remove it response request
I mean request and then in local storage
I want just to remove item that is
called bookworm
dot token like this and then I want to
dispatch user logged out action with
empty thing we do not need to pass here
so let's copy this thing here user
logged out
the constant also logout we do not need
to have anything here and we need to
have user logged out constant so let's
go to types and let's add this user
logged out good and the last thing that
we need to do and yeah we do not need to
have here user and the last thing that
we need to do is to go to our reducer so
we go to reduce the user let's import
user log out and when user looks out in
case we just returned empty object
okay so let's recap what what we're
doing here
so here when we click on the logout
button we dispatch in the logout tank
action so here here is logout tank
action we remove the token from the
local storage and then we dispatch user
logged out action user logout action is
just the just space sheet and we catch
it in our user reducer and set it to
empty object so we have no token in
local storage and we have empty object
in this state so user will be logged out
so let's have a look so now if I click
on this logout then good it works so and
if you go to application here you can
see that in local storage we have no
tokens here so now we can log in and we
can log out good and that's not all
because we also need to add this token
to any future request the synchronous
requests that we do into that we're
going to do to the server but we will
keep it and we will implement it when we
actually need it so now let's let's
commit this change so we have login
logout and that's it for today thank you
