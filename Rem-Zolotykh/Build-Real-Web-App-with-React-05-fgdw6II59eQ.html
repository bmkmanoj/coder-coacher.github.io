series will rebuild real world
application with react and nodejs life
coding style in this session we're going
to implement user email confirmation so
you're gonna send mail and we're gonna
confirm this mail on the account before
we begin I want to thank you all for
your comments for your discussions likes
emails that you send me thank you very
much it's much appreciated also if
you're a patron and you haven't received
yet the invitation link to the community
I sent them maybe check your spam folder
or if you do not have it contact me and
I'll send it again I also got the same
question from several people about the
deployment how to deploy this
application so we going to do that in
future episodes first I had a plan that
we implement several features and then
we have the deployment but now I'm
thinking about when we finish with the
user stuff these three features that we
have in a github right now when you
finish with that we'll deploy it to the
server and you will see how it can be
done one of the way how it can be done
we will deploy to the digitalocean
it will be just a quick walkthrough if
you want to learn more about it pretty
soon pretty soon I'm not sure when I'll
publish my premium course about react
dedicated to react sold it without Redux
and one of the things that is gonna be
there is deployment of the application
so if you want to learn more about
deployment stay tuned okay so this is
our way let's get down to it but first
but first I noticed a bug in in
application so if we go back here I'm
gonna log out and I'm gonna sign up as
test user and that was everything this
works fine but if I reload the page it
will be gone I will be redirected back
to the localhost and that happens
because in application here you can see
that in local storage we do not have the
JSON web token for this app so when I
roll the page
I'm redirected I'm not logged in anymore
so this is the problem because I forgot
if you go to a user actions right here
it's not enough just to dispatch user
logged in action we also need to have
the local storage how we call it
bookworm dot equals user that's open so
in this case we also populate local
storage with JSON web token and that
will fix the problem okay so now let's
implement this confirmation stuff so
first of all let's go to let's go to the
backend code first and here let's open
user model so inside of this model we'll
add another field that I call
confirmation token there's going to be
type of string and default is going to
be empty string so now when we when user
signs up we want to generate this
confirmation token and save it in the
database so for that let's define
another function and recall it's instead
of set password we'll call it set
confirmation information token it
doesn't take anything and here we'll
have confirmation token and it will
equal to this generate JSON web token so
we're going to reuse the same methods to
January talk and we'll save it it
doesn't matter what kind of token you
generate in this particular case but as
we generate JSON web token why not to
reuse it then okay so now let's go to
routes user and here we set password on
the user model and now we also set
information token after that when we
save it we'll have use of with
confirmation token okay so now we need
to send email with the link that
includes this confirmation token so
let's do this here we'll add sand con
four-nation email and we pass user
record
to this function so this function is
going to send email okay so now we need
to import this function send
confirmation email and we're gonna store
all the emails just in one file called
mailer in this application is very small
there may be at most five types of
emails will be here so there is no need
to create some kind of architecture for
our email stuff just one file will do it
for now so we'll have mailer the GS and
instead of here we'll use node mailer to
send emails so let's have a look so here
is no mailer and you can browse through
documentation about it and what kind of
email we're gonna use so for that for
this kind of purposes I use excellent
mail trap data yo service so when you
register you get the empty inbox and
credentials to to send emails here so in
this way you do not need to create this
email actual real world email accounts
you just create one you just register
here mail trap and send mails here so
here's the credentials that we're gonna
use and I will reset them after I record
this episode so don't worry about
hacking my account also here in
integrations you can select the node
mailer and it will say it will show you
the configuration option so I'm gonna
just copy it so let's go to terminal
and in server I'm gonna yarn add node
mailer so now the code here I will
define function I will call it setup and
here I'm gonna return the result of this
configuration so now I can use it in my
emails so first I need to import an old
mailer from no mailer also let's define
another constant from and there's gonna
be bookworm
an email in for bookworm dot-com for
example okay so now we can so now we can
export function a send confirmation
email we take user and first of all
we're going to have the transport setup
so this way we set up transport and now
we define the email itself email object
so we have wrong we have to which is
user email we have subject
welcome to bookworm and we'll have text
and HTML body for our emails so again in
this application they are going to be
very simple so we're gonna just use the
text emails but if you have something
more complex you should go with email
time templates so he will just have this
welcome to bookworm please confirm your
email and here we're going to use user
generate generate janeyah right yeah
generate confirmation URL and after that
we will just have transferred transports
and mail and pass this email object also
as a second parameter you can have the
callback function we can handle errors
for now we'll just ignore it and we'll
see how to handle this error slice in
the series okay so that's it we have
mailer what's going on here should be
listed in the dependencies
oh no mailer so now we have the the
email sending but we need to have this
generate confirmation URL so let's go to
our model and here schema methods and
define this function generate confirm
URL that's gonna be very simple we just
return
first of all HTTP localhost
so we'll reach an hop local host which
we're gonna store in in environment
variables so we'll have in host then
after that we have confirmation and then
token itself this confirmation token
okay so now we need to go to N and
define this host I'll already done it I
have the host here with localhost 3000
and also I populated email host email
port user and password with the
credentials that are supplied me that
mail trap gave me so now in mailer I can
use them as well
instead of here using hard coded house I
will have process that an email host I'm
just gonna copy it
here I have ports here I have the user
and here I have password okay like this
and that should do it
let's have a look so let's go back here
I'm gonna just remove the user that I
created so there is a monkey to be
compass software the GUI for MongoDB
it's pretty cool so check it out so I'm
gonna remove this test user from here
I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna sign
up as a test user so I'm sign up it
works let's go to them inbox and you can
see here we have welcome to bookworm
that was sent to test at task calm and
here you can see the details that it was
sent from bookworm email address that's
nice right
so we have just the text but if we had
this HTML we we would see how it works
in HTML as well oh oh yeah that's this a
silly bug so here what I did I forgot
brace it here to invoke the function so
let's try it again I'm gonna deal with
this user from here and I'm gonna sign
up again mmm and here we have our link
to the confirmation page great so now we
need to implement it so let's go to the
react code and here let's go to app the
GS file where we have routes and define
new route this one is going to be you
can confirmation and then we'll have
token so here we'll have a confirmation
page so let's import it from here
confirmation page now let's create one
confirmation page the GS there's gonna
be class component and here we'll have
this state pretty silly state will have
the
Loden that is set to true by default and
then success which is set to false by
default by by default and that means
that when we mount this component we
immediately want to show the spinner or
something like that that it is loading
and then when the loading is complete we
have the response and we render another
message so here depending on what we
have so for example when we have load in
we display message let's add icon to it
and inside of this message will have
icon with name circle notched with
loading state so there's gonna be just
the icon that spins and then here in
message that header will have validating
your email okay so this is one message
and we need of course to import message
and icon from semantic UI or react so
the second one is going to be it's not
loading and it's successful so then we
have message a little bit different so
I'm going to copy it place it here and
here we'll have the message success with
icon let's say check mark low Jian I
will remove voting from here and the
message will be thank you your account
has been verified now let's add enclose
it into a message that content here and
and here let's provide the link to
dashboard just so the user can navigate
away from this page so I go to the your
dashboard so now we need to input this
a link from red router link from react
router dom and we use in loading and
success so let's you can search here
load in success from state ok so this is
our rendering but what is our behavior
so we need to change this loading and
success stuff so when this component
mounts with the component did mount and
in this case we dispatch thunk action we
call it confirm and we pass the token
that was passed via route so we'll use
these props match params token so if
it's ok then we'll just this that set
state and we said that load and false
and success true otherwise if we have
some kind of error we'll just set state
to load and true load and false and
success false as well so now as you can
see we need to define this in prop types
so let's go here and prop types define
and redefine confirm as function we
define match as shape inside of it will
have params also as shape and inside of
it will have token which is string okay
so now we need also to provide this
confirm and this confirm is the action
so let's import it from confirm from
actions off and now we need to connect
it so we need to import connect AHA I
promise you that I will create snippets
for the connect and look at that I did
it
so here BAM how cool is that
so in my first our map stage props we do
not need to do anything but here we'll
pass the confirm and also I need to add
prop types as well
so now let's go to out and he let's
define another function
let me call confirm it takes token and
then we make an API request user confirm
and we pass token to it and if
everything is okay we have user back and
basically we just get do the same thing
when we login so we we refresh a JSON
web token and we dispatch user logged in
so now we need to go to API and define
this confirm so we have token we have
access post let's say to API of
confirmation and we pass token to it if
ever since okay we respond with we get
user data from it so now we need to go
to the backend we go to the backend code
and we go to routes user and here we
need to define router post to
confirmation request response so first
of all let's have token get token from a
request body token and now we need to
find an update user record so for that
we use find one and update function from
Mongoose it takes up to three parameters
so the first parameter is the condition
how we search for the record so in this
case we searched by confirmation token
the second parameter is the thing that
we want to update so on the found record
we want to change confirmation token to
empty string and confirmed confirmed to
true
and the third parameter is going to be
options and we pass one option true so
this option determines what kind of user
record we get in then here so if you do
not specify its to true then we'll have
the user record that is found before it
was updated but when you have new true
you have the updated version of this
record go figure
so here we have user and if we have user
if users found and it is updated then we
want to response Jason with user user to
out Jason otherwise we just want to
respond with status 400 and empty
objects in Jason so that should work
well let's have a look if you go to the
browser now let's copy this link and
let's go let's follow this link here the
date in your email we have an error API
out confirmation not found confirmation
confirmation oh I'm sorry
I included into users not into mouth so
gonna cut it out and paste it here
oops so let's try it again
roll the page validating thank you your
account has been verified nice if we
have still we have a problem if we go to
the dashboard you can see that our
nagging message is gone but if we reload
the page it's back again and that
happens because you know what we do when
we load the page from the user
perspective user authentication
perspective we let's have a look in here
in index right here
we just have the talcum we do not have
confirmed here so what we can do is we
want we can include there are two ways
to solve this problem you can include
additional data into this JSON web token
and decode it here on the client or you
can make a synchronous requests when you
load when you start your application you
have this request to get the current
user details so let's try the first
approach first that's with the JSON web
token and it's decoding so on the back
end on the user model here where we
generate JSON web token we can just add
confirmed this confirmed
so this way we included this into the
public payload of the JSON web token so
now in the client we can use some kind
of a decoder to decode this JSON web
token for that I'm gonna use it's good
to hear
bookworm react I'm gonna yarn add dot
the code package so now here I'm gonna
include it imports decode from geordie
code and now right here
we'll have the payload equals to decode
and we provide the local storage token
so now this payload is the object that
contains email and confirmed
so let's include email here payload
email and lesson include confirmed
payload confirmed so this way when we
reload the page we decode the JSON web
token and then dispatch user logged in
with these details about the user so now
let's go to the browser let's go to
manga compass here and I'm going to copy
this stuff
by the way if we reload the page we have
a bed request for some reason
yeah bed requests weird or we can look
at in the moment so now I'm going to
take this token and I'm going to change
it here add it back just to make this
confirmation works and now I reload the
page we have reload we have successfully
verified our account go to the edge but
it works
reload the page and now we do not have
this negative message because we updated
the JSON web token but we have some
problem with this thing here so nothing
happens it should actually render error
here let's have a loop I need to go to
confirmation page catch this state oh
yeah I totally forgot to add this this
message Wow I was sure that I edited so
the third message is if not loading and
not success then we'll have another
message and we'll have it negative with
icon let's say warning sign here will
have something like whoops invalid token
it seems and we do not need to have this
go to dashboard so now if you go here
and reload the page oops invalid token
because this user has already been
verified we do not need to verify it
anymore
great so it works so I've got a
proposition for you
now during this weekend's you can
improve this stuff so first of all you
can make this error message a little bit
more smart so here instead of having
this message you can use message from
the server and so repulsive determine
what kind of message to render so it
could be invalid token or it could be
that user has already been verified at
least two scenarios that you can cover
also now the fan is the bonus points for
accomplishing it you can add a link to
the message resend confirmation email
and when user clicks on it you have this
spinner and then when it's done the
message that the email has been sent and
the same email is sent to the user and
user can again try to confirm his
account okay so that's what you can do
on the weekends also if you feeling
brave and adventurous and you have free
time you can go to github and go to user
restores passwords so first of all this
user signs up we finished it yeah I can
just we send confirmation email we even
implemented the confirmation page which
is a good thing so I can close this
issue and the last thing that we left
here is user restores password and we
will do it we will implement it next
week but you can try to do it by
yourself this weekend and then compare
your solution with my solution and we
can have a discussion or something like
that but basically what we have here is
we have the forgot passwords we have the
forum when users it means the forum we
have the email sent or there is no such
email something like that
then in an email you have the link the
special link to reset password with
Jason with expiration date so this JSON
web token should be it should have the
expiration date for example one hour so
then when user follows if for example
talking is not valid anymore because of
the expiration date we display this
message and have the link back to the
reset password if everything is okay we
have another forum set new password user
set password hit the button
we sent email that hey your password has
been changed and redirect to login page
so try it out by yourself if you have if
you willing to do so you have time so
