my name is relative and in this quick
video I will introduce you to this
series and its purpose recently that's
plus published my course ember.js
framework basics and as you can see it
was published on 6th of May but the
thing is I recorded it more than a year
ago which you can see right in the first
episode version I'm using there is 1.5
and I use them bruh starter kit which is
not a thing anymore a year is quite a
time for such an actively developed
framework as ember.js which currently
near in its 2.0 release which is very
exciting here are a couple of things
that changed which are relevant to this
course we use ember CLI instead of ad
hoc approach or starter kit nowadays
controllers are go in a way and
components are taking their place HTML
bars is now part of ember so we do not
use by letter anymore testing became
much more approachable and enjoyable and
comes right out of the box no need to
install and setup it manually but
instead of updating course or publishing
boring errata I decided to take hands-on
approach I'll develop start application
I asked you to build in that courses and
exercise we call it bookworm app which
helps to track books you're reading or
plan to read but will go further than
that not only I cover all topics record
in that course but will also use this
app to demonstrate other concepts like
form validation and the data
associations testing libraries and much
more if you want to stay updated on this
