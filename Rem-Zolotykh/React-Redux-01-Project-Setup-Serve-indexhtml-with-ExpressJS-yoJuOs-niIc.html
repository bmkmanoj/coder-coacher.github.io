the goal for this episode is very simple
to serve index dot HTML file using
Express GS but we want to use es6
boughten client and observer so we'll
need to install and use babel transpiler
for that so here i am an empty folder so
let's run and PM in it with default
settings so just we have this package
that JSON file and while we're here
let's initialize git repository and open
our project in editor so let's start by
creating server folder inside of it will
create index dot GS file and there's
going to be our main entry point so here
we want to actually run our Express
server so we input Express from Express
we initialize our application as Express
call up the function and then we let's
define catch-all round we have request
and response and we use error function
here just because we can so we send back
hello world string here and of course we
need to listen to some port let's make
it three thousand and just to have it
will have console Deathlok here that
tells us that we are running on
localhost 3000 ok now we need to run it
let's try out node so if you go back to
terminal and I my node version right now
is six point two and I run server index
well I've got an error because I'm using
import and node doesn't understand what
it is so we need to install and setup
Babel for our purposes so let's install
with safety flag Babel - CLI package ok
done and while we're here let's also
install express itself so now let's go
back to editor and open package that
JSON file and here in scripts let's
define you can
and we call it server for now and we'll
use Babel node which is the part of
Babel satellite package it will run
server index
Dargis file so now if we go back to
terminal and try to run this server
command we'll have an error and we fail
because we need to configure Babel it's
not enough simply to install it of
course so back to editor let's create a
root folder we create dot Babel or C
file and inside of it we have an object
with presets defined and that's an array
of presses that we want to use in our
project and in our case we need es2015
and of course we need to install it so
go back to terminal and PM install save
dev Babel press it es2015 ok done well
now if we run server command we are
victorious excellent let's go to browser
and reload the page and here we are we
have this hello world stream so now that
we have proper response let's run the
basic HTML page so back to editor in our
index the J's file a right here instead
of sending just a string we go in to
send file and we use path package to
join it with current directory dear name
and index dot HTML file that we're going
to create now but first of course we
need to import path from path ok so now
let's create index dot HTML and in here
we just paste boilerplate html5 simple
document like this so now if we go to
browser and reload the page nothing
happens
well that's bummer we need to go to
terminal we need to kill the process and
starts over again and only then when we
go back to browser and reload the page
now we have our HTML page that's not a
good way to do
web software so let's install let's kill
it and let's install with saved a flag
node 1 and this package will restart our
server every time we change any file in
server folder so now that we have it go
back to editor and go back to package
JSON file and here instead of using just
the Bible node we're going to use node 1
but we're going to watch only server
folder because we will have another
folder the client folder and we do not
want to restart service every time when
we change something on a client side
because client side will be handled by
web pack so next we need to execute
Babel node and then we need to provide
file this index GS 2 node 1 not to Babel
node and for that we add double dash
here so let's save it go back to
terminal and let's run our server ok it
seems to work so if we go back here
reload the page everything's cool go
back to editor to HTML page let's add
exclamation point here save it go back
to browser reload and here we go
excellent so the last thing that we're
going to do here is prepare projects
forget so going back again to editor and
in root folder of the project let's
create git ignore file and first as I'm
on Mac vs store file should be ignored
as well as node modules save it now go
back to terminal I kill it and we have
git status Edel file and let's commit as
initial commit nice we accomplished the
goal for this episode so that's it for
it and see you in the next one thanks
