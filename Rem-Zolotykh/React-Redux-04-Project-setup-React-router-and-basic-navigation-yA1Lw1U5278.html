is to set up rekt router and implement
simple navigation between pages so first
we need some kind of navigation bar and
yes you guessed it I suck at visual
design so I'm going to use bootstrap to
save us time and sanity so let's open
index.html file and inside of here in
head tag let's just paste this link to
bootstrap dot CSS let's save it
let's run server go to browser reload
the page and it becomes worst of some
design reward no less so let's continue
making this masterpiece and I'm going to
copy and paste code for nav bar but
first let's create component for that so
in our app that J's component here let's
add container div and inside of it let's
use navigation bar component and we're
going to remove greetings for now and
replace it with navigation bar okay so
now I need to create this navigation bar
navigation bar da GS and I will just
paste this very simple navigation bar
component which is just a repo from
bootstrap documentation and I just
replace class with class names that's it
and as you can see here we have two
links one to the home page and one to
the signup on both of these pages we
want to have some kind of a layout so on
both of these pages we want to see
navigation bar but on the main page we
want to see some kind of greetings
message and on the signup page we want
to see the signup form so the next step
is to install and setup react router to
achieve this goal so let's open index
the GS in client folder here and we
we're not going to need AB components
anymore instead of this app component we
will use router component and we're
going to import it from react router of
course we need to install it
NPM install save react router ok let's
run seven go to browser load
each and we have some kind of error so
let's open developer tools and you can
see that we actually need to provide
history prop and we need to provide at
least one route the route route so let's
do this so here in router we need to
provide history and we'll use browser
history which we can import a game from
react return another option for us is
hash history and we need to provide at
least one route so we're going to
provide routes and we're going to store
them in separate file so I'm going to
import routes from routes and let's
create one routes yes so this file
export default one component route and
this route has a path of a slash that's
the route route so we need to specify
two things for our routes one is the
path and the second one is the path
component which we want to render when
user goes to this path so now we need to
input react and we need to input route
from reaction alter and we need to
import our app from components app so
now let's save it go back to browser
reload the page and now we do not have
any errors we have this hash stuff here
we can remove it that because we didn't
specify our history before okay that's
good
no errors so far so now we need to
implement simple navigation on the main
page here we want to see the greeting
message but when we go to signup route
we want to see signup form so let's
start with greeting so our app component
is going to be our main layout component
so it has the layout information maybe
navigation bar content maybe some kind
of a sidebar footer etc but when we
change routes we want to render route
specific content in some place in
I'd app component so to do that right
now we want to render our content just
after navigation bar and this content is
stored in these props their children
okay so now we can define our nested
route right here so I'm going to close
this right route and I'm going to defy
index route an index route is like a
default route route so when nothing else
is specified we want to render content
of this particular component in our case
there's going to be greetings and of
course we need to import index round as
well as greetings so now to go back here
let's reload the page and you can see hi
excellent it works let's make it a
little bit nicer so I'm going to open
greetings and here I will enclose it in
class name Jumbotron I'm going to save
it go back to browser and again you
notice that how to loading doesn't work
and that's because greetings component
became top component for this particular
route as a rule of thumb make all route
components as class components for now
so I'm going to quickly transform it
behind the scenes like this so now if I
go back to browser reload the page I
have this component rendered so if I
change and remove this exclamation
points everything works nice so now
let's implement sign up route so we're
going back to routes and here we'll add
another NASA trout with path signup and
component signup page so I need to
import this component and reorganize
components by pages or by features so
with the top component having suffix
page just just a convention I use in
this project so in components I'm going
to have signup folder and inside
I'll have signup page so let's create
one ponens sign up sign up the H dot GS
I'm going to page just a simple go to
service time so we define class
component for sign up page with just a
simple header sign up page and we define
it as a class component because we want
hot reloading to work because signup
page is the root component the top
component for this round so now if you
go back to browser and let's go to sign
up we have sign up page excellent it
works so as you can see the app
component is the layout and inside of
this slide we have different routes so
last thing is to use navigation bar so
we need to go to our navigation bar
component and inside of here instead of
these anchor tags we want to use link so
we'll use link to routes and class name
we need to save so we have red dice and
I'm going to close this link okay so I
don't need this anymore and here as well
I'm going to define link which points to
signup round very easy save it go back
to browser of course I need to import it
so I improve this link component again
from reacts router save it go back let's
refresh the page and now I can click on
routes and you can see that everything's
work good job okay so let's commit and
now we're ready to implement our first
real feature user signup thanks for
