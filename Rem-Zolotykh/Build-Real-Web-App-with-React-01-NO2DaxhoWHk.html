first episode in this new series
building real-world web application
using reactant nodejs
so before we begin I want to thank all
of you for your encouragement and good
comments and 120 likes I I pre
appreciate it
very appreciated yeah so thank you and
let's get down to it right away without
any further ado so here I created a new
repository for project bookworm react
we're going to have bookworm API as well
later and for now this is just the empty
project and I created one issue here
user logs in so we're gonna start with
user authentication and registration so
no matter what application we're going
to build these features are essential I
think for 99% of Web Apps so here as you
can see I created marvelous markup so as
you can see it's very easy not easy it's
simple it's what you usually see we have
a home page with the join for free and
login buttons and what are we gonna
develop right now is this workflow
clicking on login we go into separate
route here on the login route and there
we have a form and when we login
successfully user is redirected to
dashboard and there are a couple of
things that we need to implement as well
first of all dashboard route should be
authorized so only authenticated users
can go to the dashboard and here we have
the conditional content if users
authenticated we render one thing and if
he is already authenticated we render go
to the dashboard so this is the basic
stuff and that's a good way to start but
we start with empty folders so we have
nothing so there are a lot of set up and
so I think that this feature will take
us maybe about two three episodes and
first episodes I'm going to create
pretty short I'm thinking about 30 to 40
minutes something like that and when I
get momentum
they maybe we'll get a little bit longer
maybe hour hour and a half okay so what
do we need to do to accomplish it so
here is just the simple list of things
that I need to do and what we're going
to cover this project this git
repository is private now but I will
make it public when I publish this video
online okay so let's get started so
first of all let's create folder we call
it bookworm and inside of it
oops night dear bookworm and instead of
it we're going to create all of our
projects and the first one we're gonna
create react app let's say bookworm -
react because we're gonna have bookworm
- API and maybe in the future bookworm -
mobile react native so this is gonna
take some time to install at the time of
recording react version that I use right
now is 15.6 but as we go as we go along
and sixteenth version comes up we're
going to upgrade and yeah today's date
is thirteenth 30th of August so just to
be sure okay so project is ready so
let's sit into it and let's open it in
editor I'm gonna use sublime text right
now in the beginning but there is a big
possibility that I'm gonna switch to
another editor because I switch them in
real life
quite often maybe once in two months
just to keep it fresh okay so first
thing that I want to do is to set up a
slant so let's create a slant RC file
and inside of it I will use your
excellent config snippet that I have for
almost all of my reg projects and they
this config based upon Airbnb and per
year so I use pressure it's an excellent
tool and
two days ago they come up with 1.6
version that form as the the thing that
I I really like how it's done before
that I was but now it's perfect yeah and
I do not need to think about formatting
which is a huge win so yeah here I have
the other thing that I need to install
so I'm gonna just run it
these are basic things oops for that
this is basic basic things so we have a
syringe we have prettier we have config
Airbnb and some plugins and you can find
them in the kit repository in
package.json file what is important is
the version so I use 15 version of
Airbnb config and this plugin Ally is
five point one not six I had some
problems with the lighter version so I
stick to these ones okay so now we have
it installed
believe it or not it is working so if I
go to AB dad GS in our component it
should tell me that yes we have a class
while we should have a function here ok
easy to fix just delete all of this and
let's define constant app to be a
function that returns deep with hello
world and we can delete these two lines
of code and of course component so very
clean next let's remove all the files
that we do not need like this so I'm
gonna have delete file yep
test goes down the drain as well CSS and
the last one is lager okay so we needed
a yes we do not need to use this import
this index that CSS file do is it good
so now let's go to package the JSON and
here in scripts let's add link command
to have to be excellent
source so this way we can run it and
let's run it so here I'm just gonna run
yarn run yes just went good yeah
we have errors in registered Service
Worker file that was us supplied to us
by react team so I do not want to fix it
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open
it and I will just disabled yes land
disabled like this fixed just like magic
so yeah we green
so let's initialize git repository and
let's add it as initial commit and yes
mind setup
okay now we're ready to implement our
project but before we do that actually
if we go to see in my markup you can see
that we have two pages home page and
login page and what it means is that we
need to react router because we need to
navigate between these pages so let's
sit install and setup react router so
for that let's run yar net reacts router
and the version I think is 4.2 right now
let's have a look yep 4.2 now in an
editor in our index.js file let's import
a browser rather from react router done
and now we just need to surround this
app with it so we're gonna have this
browser router like this save something
went wrong
yeah that's not good
yeah and and this is the good thing that
I do not need to think about how to
format it I just added rapid save it and
pretty dissolve this job for me which is
awesome so here is linty wants us to be
more specific he wants us to specify
react Dom in retro after Dom in package
adjacent file so let's here on that
reacts router Dom just to place the
machine and that should fix it so now we
have router available to us in our
application so let's go to app and our
app component is going to be like route
dispatcher so basically it will just
render the thing depending on the route
so instead of this hello world we're
gonna have route path and path is the
home page and we want to make the exact
match for for this particular path and
the component that we're gonna use we're
gonna hope called home page like this so
we need to input router a route from
react
Roger Dom and then we need to import of
course home page from let's say
components pages home page that's where
we're gonna store all our pages and this
way we know that the page component is
old always have the things that router
provides like match etc so now let's
create one so here we create components
folder inside of it we'll have pages and
inside of it home page DRGs file so
there's going to be a functional
component without any props for now and
we gonna have here home page ok good now
we have home page and inside of this
home page we'll have the link to login
so let's add link to
in route and let's at last name our
class name yeah we need to install so we
have link to login like this so now we
need to import link from react router
down damn it's good now we need to
create this route and this page for this
route so let's go to back to home page
and let's duplicate this stuff here
called login and that's going to be
login page and here we'll do the same
thing login page and here is well login
page so now we need to create one in
components pages we create login page
RGS let's make it functional component
and just add h1 login page okay so this
should work so I hope so let's go and
run yarn start moment of truth we have
homepage clicking on login we have login
page nice and easy
ok so let's let's commit this change I
use get savvy in sublime so I'm gonna
use it in this series as well so I'm
gonna just add everything to staging
then I'm gonna commit it and I call it
react
raro setup with a couple of pages okay
so now let's also install semantic UI
I'm just really a fan of this CSS
framework I like it much more than
bootstrap and one one of the good things
in semantic UI is that it has react
component so it has react support like
official react support so we can use
very cool components that they provide
and without any jQuery
and we do not need to do anything
basically so let's install it to install
we need to install react a semantic UI
react so I'm gonna do it right here
urine add semantic UI and also cement
semantic UI CSS we can use CSS from CDN
but I prefer to do it this way in case
something wrong with my network
connection so as you can see we can use
CDN but let's install semantic UI CSS
and then we just need to import this CSS
CSS in our files so let's go to index
that yes here let's paste it here
Oh react I'll react down okay
so now let's restart our server just in
case and let's go to our page and you
can see that style has been changed to
different phones etc another thing that
it's very close to margin so it has no
margins let's add contain around it so
I'm gonna go to AB the GS here and here
just add class name ui container ok so
this way oops oops yeah we have some
margins around our content nice
so that semantic UI so let's get status
and commit this change semantic UI setup
so now we're ready to create our login
form so in our login page right here in
pages we have login page and this page
will render login form login form and it
will pass submit function and into it so
login form will take some function got
the data from the form and pass this
data into this function so the form
itself doesn't know anything about what
was gonna what's gonna happen with this
data right it just passes along and
that's it so now we have this login form
let's import it from so login form will
create forms folder and we have login
form there now we need to create one
forms login form - yes and the form
components will have state so we can
have class component here so we're gonna
use Redux in this in this application
and there are a couple of ways to do
this and some people like to store
everything in redux I'm not one of them
I do not like this approach especially
with forms I do not like to store forms
state in Redux store only when I really
need it because most of the time when
you have form you do not need to store
this data that you
user entered they're just we just
interested in submitting this data so
but only one when I need to have very
functional very super cool and smart
form only then I connect it to relax in
in login form no so we'll have login
form here with some state and the state
usually what I do with forms I have data
data and data is gonna it's an object
that will store all data the phone data
will have loading state which is false
by default and we have errors object
that is empty by default now let's also
import form and button button from
semantic UI react so instead of this D
if we're gonna use form and inside of it
form will have button primary login ok
so this is at the beginning as you can
see here we're looking form here we have
login form just with one button ok so
what do we need from the form first of
all we need we need state and this state
will be changed when users type
something in the form fields then we
need to validate this data and if this
data is okay we're gonna send it to the
submit function that is provided to this
form so in login form will have just two
fields in mail and password empty fields
and now in form itself we're gonna
create this form fields with semantic UI
will just use form field and inside of
this form field we'll just use regular
label for email I'll say email and here
we'll have regular input type gonna be
email ID is also gonna be email just to
make happy this label
name gonna be email as well and then we
need to provide two things we also have
placeholder equals two example at
example.com we want to be very specific
when I save it
you're gonna formatted it nice and now
we need to provide unchanged and value
to control this element by react so
we'll have value to be equal this this
data email and I don't like it or this
state this state data email that's a
mouthful so what I prefer to do in run
the method I just deconstructed here or
the structure I don't know what the
actual term for this and I'm gonna take
data from this state and this way I do
not need this stuff here so I have just
data that email and the second thing is
on change this unchanged so let's create
this unchanged so we're not gonna do
this every time we create the form
because I just show you in quickly how I
compose forms and in my usual workflow
and you will see it later I just have a
lot of snippets and I just do these
forms like that
okay so unchanged we get event and we'll
do this set state and we set in state we
need to change data but first of all we
need to save everything that we already
haven't data for that we use spread here
this state data and then what we
actually want to change and that stores
an e target that name and it equals to
either target dot value let's save it
and it will format it for us
cool all right cool okay so this is the
unchanged event and this thing is
universe universal for stream data for
string types so I could say like on
change email and they then do the same
thing with on change password don't
change
another thing but if I have a text field
I just use this unchanged Universal
event handler if I have something else
like numbers or drop-down list then I
create separate change handlers for them
specifically okay so this is it so now
we need to duplicate it and change email
here to password here make a password
password password here we'll make it
secure and that's it we have our form
dumb and Google just Google Chrome just
pre-populated it nice so we have form
now we need to submit this data to to
our function so to do that on Form we
define on submit equals this on submit
submit and here I'm gonna define on
submit and it will take nothing so what
we want to do we want to validate data
pass it to submit function and then
handle error cases in case we have our
cases from the server for example from a
synchronous so first of all we need to
validate to validate ie using this stuff
so I just define errors to be to equal
this validate and I pass this state data
to this function so this function that
we're going to define in a moment we'll
return errors object to us and if there
are no errors this object will be empty
so right after that we'll do this set
state errors so we update our state with
errors so if there are some you can
display them and we do not do anything
else if we have errors so if this object
is empty
then we'll proceed but now let's see how
validation works so let's create our
validate function it takes data and it's
boilerplate code so first I'm gonna
define errors typical empty object and
then I'm gonna return errors back so in
between this I'm gonna check if my data
is valid so for example if not data
password data password that means that
it's empty so I just do errors password
equals can't be blind and you can do all
kinds of validations here so to short
doesn't have any special symbols etc and
we need of course to validate email and
I use for that usually validator so
let's install it right here
yarn add valid data okay so now here at
the top I'm gonna import the whole
validator
for now the data from valid data
okay and now in myself in my validate I
just check if not valid data is email
data email so if it's not valid errors
email equals invalid email for example
okay so this is the validation so what
happens here when I submit the form I
run this function I validate data and
compose this errors object so if
everything is okay the service object
will be empty and that well that means
that okay we're gonna pass this data
further but if we have something in the
errors object then we do not do anything
else but we need to display to render
this message to the user so for that I
think I'm going to create another
component and
we'll call it inline era and we're gonna
place it in messages
yeah inline era okay so let's create one
in messages because semantic UI doesn't
have any kind of inline errors it has a
huge error message or just message
object and message components but
doesn't have any kind of small things
like I usually prefer to do with the
forms so we have in line error loggias
function component it will take some
text and it will render this text but
not and if instead it will instead it
will do it in span and in span here
we'll just use the some kind of a color
so we'll have style and inside of this
style we have color and let's let's have
a look what kind of color we want so
here in semantic UI we have messages and
in messages can open here messages we
have this red color so I'm gonna cheat
here I'm gonna take picker and I'm gonna
use this one okay now here I'm just
gonna paste it boom done as you can see
winter doesn't know what we what is this
tax so we need to define prop types
so let's import prop types and then
we'll have the prop prop types def i
have special things for this and we
define text prop type string is required
another thing is again linter wants us
to be specific so let's please machine
once more yarn add prop types
okay
so we have inline air so let's go back
to our form and we use it so right here
after input we're gonna check
so if errors we don't have errors so
let's get it from state errors so if
errors email has something in it so it's
not undefined then we want to use inline
error with text with text to be errors
that email and I'll do the same thing
for this so instead of female here I'll
have password so this way if we have
something in our state a narrow subject
we render it let's all look so I'm gonna
just clean this stuff clean it submit
and yeah we have it invalid email
another thing that we can add is the
styling for the whole component so in in
semantic UI you have error attribute in
the form field so if you have error like
this it will become red so it's boolean
right so here I'm just convert into
boolean errors that email and here I
will convert into boolean errors that
password save it dupe and now login and
you can see it changes the style and of
the component as well nice
so this is validation koozie next thing
is to pass data into the submit function
so right here first of all we need to
check if this error object is empty or
not and there are two ways to do that
maybe even more actually but usually
what I do either to use lodash is empty
method or to use a 6 or a 7 object keys
method so
let me show you so we have object that
keys and we pass errors into it and then
it will take all the keys in errors
object if this object is empty then
length should equal to 0 so this one of
the way to do that it's not actually
very beautiful
so maybe you should extract it into
separate function or just use is empty
from lodash but it works why not okay so
that means that date is valid and after
that all we need to do is call this
props dot submit and pass this state
data to it and after that we also will
catch errors from the synchronous
requests but we will do it later for now
all I want to do is just to call this
function pass data and see that it works
so now this function is not defined
anywhere so let's define prop type for
it first of all let's input prop types
and here
let's prototypes define and we're gonna
have submit to be prop type function
like this so now it is required and the
parent of our component need to pass a
submit function so our parent is to do
it alot this is login page data
this is a Russian word for this okay so
we have login form here and we need to
pass submit this let's say submit oops
submit now we need this function so
let's convert it to class so we'll have
class login page and later we will
connect it with Redux as well so it
extends reacts that component it we have
render and it returns the theme that we
have here
so I'm just gonna like this okay so now
we can define submit so let's do this
we'll have submit and it will take some
data and for now we'll just cancel that
log this data into the console so just
to make sure that we get this data and
what we're gonna do here is later is we
gonna dispatch thunk action make a
synchronous requests get data back
update our reduces in the Redux store
and then redirect somewhere in the home
page and as you can see the form itself
doesn't know anything about it the the
purpose of the form in my opinion is
just to collect data to validate and
then give us this data okay so let's
have a look I'm gonna change password
here to something Pam and yeah we have
our data with email and password so we
can work with it nice so let's commit
this change we call it log in form with
client-side validation okay so now we
need to set up redact and make a
synchronous requests and that means that
we need to set up nodejs application as
well and yeah but we're gonna do it in
the next episode so thank you very much
