is to implement user redirect on
successful sign up and there are two
ways to do that first using browser
history directly and second using react
router so let's try them both I'm gonna
open editor I switch to be my always
come back to whim and the let's open our
users route and here we just are
checking for word invalid news let's
change this to check for valid s as well
and if everything is okay we want to
respond with JSON and it doesn't matter
what we return here I just return
success true the most important stuff is
that we respond with 200 status so now
let's go back to sign up form component
and inside of here on submit we have
this empty Handler and here we want to
redirect and we can do it simply by
using browser history push and we push
the address that we want to go to in
this case route route ok so now we need
to import it so let's go up here I'm
gonna import browser history from react
router ok let's save it let's far up our
server and let's try it out
to go and sign up okay fill the form I
click on sign up and we are being
redirected excellent it works another
approach is to use reactor on temp so
let's try it out so first of all let's
get rid of all of this
browser history here and using browser
history here instead of it we're going
to use today's context we take reacts
router from the context and we're gonna
push it there okay so now we need to get
this router we do not have it by default
we need to specify to provide context
for this component for that let's go to
the bottom of this file and here I'm
going to define sign-up form context
type like we do with prop types and I
define that we need to have router where
the react prop types object is required
ok let's save it go back to browser and
let's try it again I'm going to sign up
fill it up and submit it and voila it
works and now we use in react router ok
that would do it
so let's commit redirects unsuccessful
server response and that's it for this
