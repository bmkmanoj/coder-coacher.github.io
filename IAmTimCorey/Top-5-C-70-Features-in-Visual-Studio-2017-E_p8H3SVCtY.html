things I love about c-sharp 7.0 at the
time of this recording Visual Studio
2017 has been out for about a month now
and I've had some time to play around
with it with the new version of Visual
Studio comes a new version of c-sharp
I've looked through all the changes they
made and identified five things that I
think are truly amazing new features
today I'm going to tell you what these
five are and show you how to use them so
let's jump right in the first thing I
love is in line out variables now if
you're not familiar with the run out
variable is essentially what happens is
you have a method like this tryparse
here they wants to return two values in
this case it returns a boolean to tell
us if it worked or not and an age value
that's the out variable the age value if
it did work so we have a age text which
is some sort of string we've said okay
why convert this over to an integer but
we're doing tryparse because what if in
a text instead of saying you know one
zero
it was te n well te n is not really a
number it represents a number but it's
not a number and so this dial is te n
that's not a valid age and for doing an
in top part that invalid age would crash
the application but in this case a try
parse it says did it work yes or no not
the in that is valid age variable that
holds that then if it did work the age
parameter would get that value but
here's the really clunky thing with this
we have to declare an int age but yet
whatever value we have in here in this
case you've initialized initializes a
zero whatever value is in here gets
overwritten by this as age so a
declaration here and
actual you see or a assignment here and
that's is fine if we've done but risk a
bit clunky so now this does work so
let's just show this real quick so if I
say 1 0 it says your age is 10 now if I
run again and type in te n because your
age is 0 y 0 that's the default now if
we had checked the is valid age we would
have found that second value was not a
valid age let's try the a new way of
doing things so comment this out I will
uncomment these lines alright so this is
the same thing as up here except that we
have the in line out variable so we have
out into age so that age is declared
right in line now you can still use that
age value in our scope because it's
actually declared in this scope inside
these clear braces not inside of this
method now it may seem like a small
thing to have us declared in line but it
does save a line up here and it's a
clunky line to begin with especially
since you could say well if I made the
default value to be 8 I would expect it
to be 8 if it was not a valid age but
it's not it will be 0 again so it's just
a little clunky the declaration in line
just makes a little more streamlined
smooth so that's my first thing that I
love and again small thing but small
things really add up when you're
creating code so declaration in line and
again if you hadn't notice how you do
that instead of saying out age you say
out int age or whatever the type is
you're returning and that right there is
a declaration of the variable
and the out will handle the assignment
all right so that's love number one
let's comment those back out we will
love number two love number two is
pattern matching and this is an
interesting one because uncomment this
so I have here is I have a string that I
called age from consul in quotes it says
21 and then I have age from database but
it's an int type so like this is
representing here is the idea that maybe
you're pulling a value right from the
console which cases a string but maybe
you already have it stored and it comes
from a database therefore an int both
represent an age but one is a string and
one's a number now what if we put the
one of those values in this case we're
going to pull the age from console and
put it into an object called age Val now
an object can hold any type so here
we're going to say what is that age
value so we say if age value is int H so
this pattern matching says is this
object actually an integer if it is put
the value into this newly declared age
variable now it gets even more fun in
that
we have as or here now this is not part
of pattern matching this is kind of
adding pattern matching together so this
is right here is pattern matching if an
object is int age and this I think
doesn't have any object it could be a
class type it could be a an interface
whatever you want if it is an a int or
whatever you want whatever type you want
give it if it is that put it in H but in
our case that's or now we know that age
when console is not an integer therefore
you will not popular
the age variable but we have another
option this or age valve is it's another
pattern matching string if it is a
string put that value in to age text now
we have as and as well so if it's a
string this is true but have it's and
here so this would be true and this has
to be true and what's this side in
tryparse remember tripart returns a true
or false and we say age text which we
just got from is string age text so take
that value and tries to parse it as an
integer and send it out to age which is
declared where or over here so it says
if the age text or if the H value is a
string put an age text parse that send
it out as age and then if this works
try partial turns true therefore this
whole thing is true if it's a string
that has a number in it so if it's a
number or if it's a string that has a
number int either one is true then it
goes down here and says your age is age
now maybe a little bit confusing and
this is a little more of an advanced
example but what we're doing here is
saying he patted a number I'll put that
right in age you pass in a string
I'll parse it and put in to age we run
this it says your age is 21 21 was
inside quotes now it's not now it's an
actual number your age is an integer
let's change this see from the database
instead let's run again your age is 84
so this time you didn't have to do all
this stuff it did just this so that
pattern matching can be really powerful
I want to show you a little more of a
powerful example because sometimes be
the simple examples don't really show
you the reason why you ever want to use
it I mean checking to see an inch that's
kind of cool but it might not be the
most useful thing handling a number or a
number inside a string that's a little
more powerful so that's my love number
two the pattern matching lets you see a
little more that's coming up number
three is my finally one love number
three is their powerful switch
statements now switch has been kind of
underutilized inside of c-sharp but for
good reason switch hasn't li done a
whole lot or Bend that valuable it made
a lot more sense to do an if else if
else if else instead if you have a lot
more power and flexibility there now I
think we'll see more people switching to
using well switch because there's a lot
of power here as well it at least gives
it a little more option a little better
option for a use case for using switch
so let's look at what I have here and I
just say wrath of bat that this isn't
great code so don't copy as code as
Lewis is awesome code this is example
code I don't get that by the way right
now I use object I don't use object
hardly at all in my code practically
never but in this case it makes sense
that look makes it a little easier to
show the true power of these examples so
here I have an employee
this employee is first name last name is
manager any years worked and then I have
customer and customer is first name last
name and total dollars spent
so those are two types I have had
created two of each so I have an
employee called Joe Smith he is not a
manager and I had an employee called
Sandra Jones and she is a manager then I
have customer one which is Tim Cory and
I have spent over two thousand dollars
whereas customer to DeLand greenback has
spent five hundred and fifty eight
dollars in case you're wondering the M
and the end is for a decimal constant if
I'd have the on the end you would think
as a double and so it'd have to do a
conversion which won't work and so you
have to specify no this constant is
actually a type decimal just think M for
money now I've taken these four objects
I have put them into the list of objects
called people so people the list of
object therefore can hold both employees
and customers and I have passed in
employee one to customer one customer
two so now let's pretend that later on
in the application
I want to loop through people and I want
to use the objects but the problem is
that I can't just say P dot first name
because maybe not all the objects have a
first name so for example if I went down
here I said P dot I get nothing because
it treats as an object isn't know that
it's an employee or a customer so we can
do a switch statement and
switch statement has some really
powerful pattern matching instead of
saying it has to be equal to something
now we're doing this pattern match and
we say employee e so essentially saying
if P is an employee if it is put inside
e but then I get this when statement so
if it's an employee putting e when e dot
is manager equals false
so what's saying is if it's an employee
and the is manager property of that
employee object is false then say e dot
first thing is a good employee need to
just kind of tag the less know which one
of these cakes limits rent so that's the
first case the second case is employee e
when e is manager meaning essentially is
manager equals true and it says first
name runs this company because you only
have one manager in my fictitious
example but then we have case customer C
when C dot total dollar spent is greater
than 1000 so essentially a big spender
see that first name is a loyal customer
and the last statement I have is just
customer C essentially just match on
this customer C and therefore will say C
that first name needs to spend more
money now that raises an interesting
point customer C would match both Delana
and Tim but now with switch statements
this wasn't always the case but now with
switch statements order is important
therefore if it
customer and total dollars spent is
greater than a thousand this one we run
otherwise it will continue on therefore
this one will only capture customers who
have not spent more than a thousand
dollars so organs important we have the
pattern matching and we have this
wedding statement that allows us to have
this boolean true or false return value
to find out any kind of comparison you
want so you add one here where Y dot
years work is greater than ten and only
Santa Jones would apply for that so
there's a lot of things you can do here
in our switch statement to kind of dial
in to exactly we want to see and we have
it's ordering here that's important so
it can actually sort of filter out the
ones that don't match in order to find a
final one it does so the first one it
does so that's my love number three is
the finally they've upgraded a switch
there and give it a little more power or
a lot more power number four this is an
interesting one and it's one you may not
have thought about so here I've got as
setup as create a new list of employee
into the same two employees from above
and put them into people so now I'm
going to do is find the CEO now so the
CEO is the first person that has is
manager set to true now you probably see
four people dot where X lambda
expression X dot is manager essentially
saying who has the is manager flag set
to true but that returns a list aware
returns an ienumerable
of the type employee so I said first or
default now the problem with this is if
it doesn't find one
first default returns a null value that
would crash this right here CEO dot
first name CEO got first name of a null
value for CEO crashes the application in
fact we can demonstrate that here by
just putting the semicolon right here
commenting the rest out and now let's
run this the CEO of Santa that's great
because we actually have a manager but
what if the manager goes away it crashes
the application object reference not set
to an instance of an object and that's
not a great error message so let's take
this code and put it back and we have
the null coalescing operator now no
coalescing operator what does is it says
if this value right here is not no use
that value otherwise use this value but
notice this value over here says throw
new exception
well what's saying is if you don't find
a person don't just blindly put null in
a CEO throw an exception but throw one
of our choosing in this case there's a
problem finding a manager let's run this
we have an exception but the exception
says saying object reference not set to
an instance an object it says there's a
problem finding a manager a lot more
clear so what's the benefit here well
here we can throw exceptions inside of
expressions so right in line here we can
throw an exception we don't have to and
see here's the way you would do it you
would come over here
you'd say if CEO equals null then throw
us two exceptions just copy this and
paste it and then you run us again we
get that nice error message but notice
we have an extra three lines of code
when I essentially can do the same thing
let's delete this out we can do the same
thing by just adding this null
coalescing operator and saying throw new
exception right in line so that that's a
nice feature at least for me and maybe
you say you know what I'll probably
never use that and that's fine but
there's times and it's not often but
there are times when you're working with
lists especially and that's why I
demonstrated a list where this first
default comes up and you're like yeah
but you really have to have Val you
can't have a null and so instead of just
trusting blindly or you know putting
that if stay in there for checking you
can just do it right away inline say hey
just throw exception if you don't find
something so that can be really helpful
all right so that's number four one more
to go number five is my favorite by far
tuples now tuples is a programming
specific term list in my mind I'm not
sure there's use anywhere else in the
world but tuples what essentially means
is an object with multiple values and so
the idea is we can return more than one
return value on a method so remember way
back up here
look we had this in tryparse and
tryparse won't return a boolean for it
works or it didn't work and it want to
return h and we had to use this out
variable and it's a little ugly and a
little clunky but it works and we have
now the in line which is so much more
awesome but tuple solves in a different
way by saying you know what return to
values or three or four or five now you
could say well you can create a class
object and return instance of that
object and that's true but sometimes you
don't need to create an instance of an
object to just return a couple values in
this case we have split name now again
not great code so many ways could fail
this isn't you shouldn't copy this code
itself but the idea behind it
fortunately will so we're passing in a
full name I want to get back first name
and last name in separate variables so I
split on the space and I return day zero
and value one with commas in between
surrounded by these parens and so now I
have returned to values now I could just
say string comma string I don't have to
name them but I would say for a
best-practice
named them it's kind of like giving your
variables the you know x and y and z
that works for really short things like
for loops but you really shouldn't do
that for actual applications especially
not for returning values for me from a
method so give it a name here so string
first thing string last name now I can
use this notice up here split name I
pass in Timm Cori and I put into var
name now I don't have to put in a var I
could say string well if I can type it
right
string first name string last name like
so and that work that's a lot of typing
Bart is the same thing if you mouse over
it you'll notice that it says string
first name string last name so it still
has that it's still strongly typed it's
just var is so much easier type so now I
can say the first name is name that's
our variable dot first name and the last
name is name dot last name and that's
the older is to it if we run this we'll
see that my first name is team and last
name is kori so it works if you want to
return three values from this you can
say bool it worked
and then you just return back a true or
false let's just return back true just
to show that we can do something and why
she just put a breakpoint right here and
run this we can see that name now has
three values Tim kori and true for it
worked so you can pass back multiple
values in different ways as many of you
want really all I wouldn't go crazy with
it if you really have to return a ton of
values may you want to rethink how
you're doing things maybe passing a
class back and forth is the right way of
doing things or class instance
so what tuples really is that shortcut
for one you just need to pass back two
values or three values something simple
something quick isn't half as
complicated convoluted you know
multiform multi-step process to return
these two values use my return two
values therefore a tuple is the way to
go so that's my top five things I love
about c-sharp seven point out now that
some things I haven't mentioned because
quite frankly I didn't love them as much
okay you can do things like using an
underscore and number constants in order
to separate the values I just don't care
okay and part of that has to do the fact
that I don't use that very much I don't
use large number constants where I have
to understand what they are so it's
really up to you if you think those are
example as well so I'd love to hear from
you what you think you want to add to
this top five or take away from it top 5
