place all this technology and
terminology surrounding what really
should be a simple topic storing and
retrieving data the thing is the
corporate world connects Microsoft
sequel server to c-sharp a lot that
means if you want to learn c-sharp to
use in the business world you should
know Microsoft sequel as well one of the
features of sequel I 10 talk about a lot
is stored procedures in this video I'm
going to introduce you to what a store
procedure is and how to build one
but that isn't in the most important
part of this video I'm going to cover
why you should use store procedures and
how they can make your database move to
the next level for those of you who are
new to my channel my name is Tim quarry
and my goal is to make learning c-sharp
and other related languages as easy as
possible for you if that sounds good to
you
hit the subscribe button if you want to
go further join in my list by clicking
the link in the description below that's
where you get insider information and
discounts on my courses now let's jump
right in the sequel here I'm using the
latest version of sequel sir Manta
studio which is version 17.1 against a
2016 version of the sequel server
developer edition now all of this is
free developer edition is free and
sequel server management studio is free
now guide database here called samples
into the sample database we have just
one table the dbo dot people table into
this table it's really simple as have
eight records and they are just first
name and last name of course an ID as
well so that's all we have in this
database right now just one table eight
records really simple so let's start by
creating a new store procedure and then
we'll talk through what exactly it is
now I could do it right here and I will
do it right here inside
a query window but if you want to you
can go programmability expand up and say
store procedures right here inside here
you'll see that i have a whole bunch of
system store procedures but no actual
stored procedures none that are mine now
system store procedures come from
Microsoft so these are Microsoft
provided there's a lot of them this
videos not going to go into what all
these are but it's an awful lot of tools
in here to help you with your database
okay there's an awful lot of tools in
here that will help you do different
things but for now we're going to
concentrate just on user create store
procedures so as none right now and we
could say right-click on so procedure
and say new store procedure and creates
a template for us at templates kind of
nice I especially like this right here
because it reminds you to comment on
your store procedure what exactly does
is who create it and when that's really
helpful so with this template you can
just fill in the different parts however
we're going to start from scratch so
we'll leave it open just we can see it
and reference it but we'll come over
here to this blank query window now what
is a store procedure a store procedure
is simply a precompiled bit of code so
for example normally we might say
something like this select star from DB
o dot people that's a pretty standard
pre simple query if you run that you get
these eight people so this is a standard
query if you one that would be dynamic
or easily changed now if you put some
like that's inside your c-sharp code
that can be a problem because what if
you specify the columns specified ID
first name and last name
all right so this when you specify which
is a good thing to do into a star so if
you specify these three columns and
later I add a fourth column for email
you wouldn't have that in your code so
you'd have to go over to your c-sharp
code open it up make the change and then
recompile if you wanted to have that in
your code so but that's not really green
why you shouldn't have this new code and
we'll get into the reasons why you would
do a store procedure over this later on
but for now let's look at how you do
something similar in a stored procedure
so let's cut this out well I should take
away our window down below and third
essay create procedure dbo that's the
owner which by default is dbo notice
over here for a table it's dbo dot
people that's the owner of the table so
dbo
dot that's a namespace and we'll call
this SP people underscore gets all now
I'm starting with SP to indicate this a
stored procedure versus no prefix for it
as a table so my way of doing things is
just to say SP but what you do not want
to do is you do not want to say SP
underscore and the reason why is because
SP underscores actually reserved prefix
and that's reserved for system level
stored procedures store procedures that
can be accessed from any database and so
we we don't want to use that prefix we
don't want to step on toes for a
database specific store procedure so key
takeaway there is don't start with SP
underscore SP is fine though so SP
people underscore get all and this is
the way I name my store procedures I
start an SP to indicate the store
procedure then I give it the table name
of the primary table
in question and I'd say primary because
you have two or more tables that you may
be working with but in this case it's
the people table
so therefore SP people and I have an
underscore and what does in this case is
going to get all the records from the
people table so now I say as begin and
then I'll do my actual store purse or my
actual call so select ID first and last
name from dbo people and then at the end
I will say end and that is my create
procedure statement this creates a
stored procedure so it's the same
statement as the same right there it
just wraps it in this create procedure
so let's call this to actually create
the store procedure
now if commands completed successfully
and if we refresh down here we'll see I
have DB OSP people underscore kits all
now so now if I were going to create a
new query window in test samples
database I could say exe c DB o dot SP
people on our score gets all now say
yelling because I don't it says I don't
know what that store procedure is but if
I do a ctrl shift our it will refresh
the cache of what items are available
and now it says ok no that is so calling
us store procedures a little bit
different than calling the actual code
so instead of things select from we just
say execute or exe c DB o dot and the
name of store procedure so let's run
this notice it returns the same number
of Records it's returned the same values
everything
what's the difference between a store
procedure and a direct call well this
direct call right here has to be
compiled and then run now Microsoft
sequel server is getting more and more
intelligent about how to compile these
quickly and how to remember even dynamic
sequel thing like this in memory so it's
it's compiled with called multiple times
but a store procedure is always compiled
and so if you're going to call this it
will be a little bit more efficient to
call store procedure than it will be to
call a dynamic sequel statement the
first time and again we'll cover more of
the benefits and drawbacks near the end
of this video
byline is point out a couple of those
right now now in our store procedure it
may not be obvious but down here in our
messages it says eight rows affected
that's actually a second set of data
that's returned with this stored
procedure now often we don't need that
in fact most the time we don't need that
and so even in the template by default
it adds this statement right here set no
count on that's not something we did
here so we're going to add that so we
don't return the number of rows affected
so let's change our store procedure and
say sets no count on now I can't do a
create here they've already created a
store procedure but I can do an alter if
you an alter procedure what does it
changes the store procedure to this new
value or as new setup so let's execute
this and now to come back over here and
execute this again it returns all eight
statements like before and the messages
it says command completed successfully
it doesn't give me the count or a number
of rows that have been affected so that
makes the calls that a little bit more
efficient and it helps not mess up your
your code when I'm asking for a set of
data and you're getting a set of data
and rows affected alright so now let's
look at creating another store procedure
so I close out the template and you know
I will close this out as well they'll
create a new query window I'd like a few
extra lines in my initial window let's
say create procedure DB o dot SP people
underscore get by last name we'll set it
first the same way as begin select ID
first name last name from DB o dot
people and we're going to do an end here
now I want to limit this by last name so
I just say what's the last name that I
want to limit by and that's where we
pass in a variable at last name and then
the type so at last name n varchar' 50
because at the length of my field
if you don't know like you're feeling go
to people columns see the last name is
an N varchar' 50 so I'm passing in a
Unicode variable length character string
they call last name and so in here I can
say where last name the field so the
field in DB Oh duck people equals last
name at last name which is the value
being passed in so this is a variable so
given a variables name I have to start
the axe symbol and then I give it the
variable type
which in this case is a Unicode
variable-length character or a string
essentially with a maximum length of 50
characters so now that I have this
variable populated I can use it to limit
my query in this case where last name
equals in the past in value by semicolon
at the end let's create that store
procedure and now I can call this so
it's a control shift are now comment out
this one so don't accidently hit f5 and
run it as well
exe c DB OSP people underscore get by
last name but that says you know what
you can't do that yet because it expects
the parameter last name which was not
supplied now i could say at last name
equals like so and that will work but if
I'm going to pass in all the parameters
now pass them in in order then I don't
have to specify the name I can just pass
in the actual value so this case it says
there's only one parameter so the first
value being passed in that goes in that
parameter so let's run this and notice
that this is now four people long Tim
John Chris and Maggie
Cory so I've limited my list based upon
last name which was passed in as a
variable now if I wide to I could pass
in more than one variable so for example
let's alter this and we'll actually pass
in first-name as well they put comma
after my last name and a type and the
next line output first name
varchar' 50 now usually if I put first
and then last name but I'm assuming it's
stored procedures already in place in
which case I wouldn't want to mess up
the order because remember I said it
comes in in order so if I had said you
know what I want first name first and
last name and I already had existing
called
out there they were calling a stored
procedure that would put Cory in the
first name instead of the last name and
that would be a problem
so let's alter that we'll run it and now
if we do ctrl shift our it's going to
yell us and say you need the first name
parameter so I'll say Tim and now if I
run this isn't do anything different and
the reason why I can actually use the
first name variable but it still took
both values so now I can say where last
name equals
last name and first name equals first
name we can even do an indentation here
just make it a little nicer we can alter
that and now if we run this we get one
value back so that's the basics really
of a stored procedure you have the
initial line which either create or
alter and specifies the name and then
you have right below that name you have
your variables separated by comma if you
want to do a default value you can just
equals the default value then you have
your add statement and a begin and end
and everything between the beginning end
will get executed so so the actual
statement now that means that your store
procedure can be a insert a delete and
update a join a select all those things
can have
an insider stored procedure in fact you
can have multiple things happen inside
your store procedure you can do both an
insert and delete think about bank
transaction so you're transferring money
from a savings account to a checking
account well in a bank transaction what
would happen is it would remove it from
your savings account and it would add it
to your checking account all in one
transaction so that might happen inside
of one store procedure so they're not
limited to just one call now here's the
other nice thing about a store procedure
and that's that it's a one transaction
meaning that you can say this
transaction has to fully happen or I
roll it back and when I get any
transactions into this in this video but
essentially what you do is start right
here and say begin trans and they have
to complete the transaction and so on
now what that does is allows you to say
the whole thing has to happen as one
chunk think again back to that Bank
example what if the stored procedure
crashed halfway through that process
it's removed the money from your savings
account but then it crashes before it
puts it into your checking account you
wouldn't want your mind to disappear a
store procedure allows you to have that
transaction that atomic level
transaction happen in one place you can
do it in code but the risks of problems
are much much higher so another great
benefit of a stored procedure so that's
really all there is to creating store
procedures so far I've created - we've
got the get all and I also get by last
name which is kind of misnomer now is
you have to get by last name but ask for
last and first name but oh well not a
big deal
so that shows us how to do a store
procedure but let's talk about some of
benefits of doing store procedures and
the very first bath I want talk about is
security and this is one that a lot of
people miss so if I have access let's
close us out if I have access to do this
let's run that so here I have these
eight records I just done a select star
from people well what if there is a
social security number or a credit card
number or something else sensitive in
one it columns well if I have access to
all the columns in DB ODOT people I can
see all those columns now a lot of
people say that a login to a database
essentially be an administrator and they
create all their logins
with administrative level access that's
a problem now the next thing I do is
we'll say well I'll only allow them to
have access to certain tables well
that's great but whatever they have
access to
they have full access to usually because
if you want to allow the application
they use to insert data you have to
allow them to insert data using the
login so essentially if they're using an
application unless you take great pains
even so it's kind of iffy if you can do
this if they use the application and
that the permissions of that user that
talks to the database if they use those
same permissions in sequel server
management studio they can do a lot of
stuff essentially the same stuff the
application can do now the application
may say you can't delete this record
because of this business rule in sequel
server manages to do that business rule
doesn't exist therefore you can go ahead
and delete that user there been a number
of times I've used an application where
I couldn't do something because it was
locked down but I really needed to do it
so I use those same permissions to get
in the sequel server manager studio
and go ahead and do that action now
wasn't being malicious but those
permissions really gave me more access
than the designers originally intended
for me to have so that's why I'm not a
big fan of giving out credentials that
have all this access in fact I don't
like people to even see what tables are
available or what data is in those
tables I don't like them to even have
read access to my tables now the
question is how do you do that and yet
still give them access to use your
application and this is why I love store
procedures and this is why I default to
using store procedures first before I
move away from them so let's start by
creating a new role for database Mattox
not familiar database security I'll try
and walk you through it in the simplest
terms possible but the reality is you
don't need to know a whole lot about
security in order to really lock down
your database so let's start by Korea a
database role now a role is it's a name
for essentially kind of a group where
you say these permissions are given to
this role and then anyone that has that
role has those permissions so for
example a role might be delete users and
then that role has access to delete from
specific tables then you could say tim
has the role delete users which means
that tim can delete from these specific
tables so let's create a new role for us
to use and it's really simple create
role now role is specific to a database
or at least in this case it is we're not
going to a serve a role to a database
role so create role and if you notice
down here in the security
you'll see roles you'll see DB
underscore and that name data writer DD
l admin deny data writer and all the
rest these are the standard roles so I
create a role I'm going to call it D be
stored procedure only access I won't do
DB underscore the same kind of principle
at the SP underscore I just don't want
to have that habit and I also know now
that this is my role not a role given to
me by Microsoft so now I can just hit
the execute button and that creates that
role if we come down here to database
roles and hit the refresh button will
see that I have the DB stored procedure
I pull it store not stored oops there we
go
I'll create a new role and I'll delete
that old row so let's right-click and
say delete hit OK and now we have DB
stored procedure only access so now that
I have this role I can now say grant
execute to and that role name so this
gives this grant right here saying I'm
going to give you something give you
access to something in this case I'm
going to give you the execute action to
this role meaning this role will now be
able to execute remember that when we
call the stored procedure we said exe C
and the store procedure name so that's
execute that's the permission we're
giving it and I run that and command
completed successfully so now that role
the DD services your only access role
allows a user to call the store
procedures
so now we need to do is come down to our
server not the database now the database
users but the server users so when our
security for server logins we're going
to right click and say new login going
to call this login bill now if you're
not familiar creating users I
essentially have two methods for Korean
user one is windows authentication so
I'm currently logged in under the name
Tim so if I were do a search for Tim I
would find that user I can use Windows
authentication meaning if I'm logged
into Windows then I will have access to
the sequel server I don't want to do
that I want to create a log in the
sequel specific meaning using the sequel
server authentication not Windows so
I'll say Bill the password I'll say is
Bill as well which actually the bad
password is a bad login and password
combination but I'm going to uncheck the
boxes that enforce password policy
meaning the password won't expire and
I'm not going to have requirements of a
application a lowercase letter and
number and a special character or in a
certain length so I'm not going to do
any of those I'm going with login and
password both of Bill come down here as
server roles nothing just let it be
public user mapping in the samples
database I'm going to check the box says
DB store procedure only access so I
apply this that rule to this account so
now bill will have that store procedure
only access and I hit okay so now let's
close out so I disconnect from this
server and reconnect close this out as
well going to reconnect but
say of logging and windows
authentication which is what I do my Tim
login has admin permission to this
server instead I'm no login with sequel
server authentication logging is Bill
password is Bill I hit OK I go databases
open up a sample database and look at
the tables notice there's no tables in
this list let's go to store procedures I
see to store procedures so let's open up
a new query window I'm going to try and
first of all cheat the system I know
that there is a table called people as a
select star from DB ODOT people
intellisense doesn't work but no big
deal hit f5 and it says select
permission was denied on the object
people so I don't have access to read
the people table doctor came and see it
but left it is instead DX CC DD OSP
people on a score get all their or all
the people I could also do exe c DB OSP
people get by last name pass in quarry
and at first name of john and i will run
this highlight just that one then I get
just John Cory back so I can access I
can run these store procedures but I
don't have access to do things like this
delete from DB o people nope can't do it
so you see the power here with just a
couple of commands the create role and
grant execute to that role and then
applying that role to a user I have said
that this user
these are Bill
can only call store procedures that
means that bill can't do anything except
whether explicitly said he can do so he
can't delete rows he can't insert rows
he can't update rows he can't do
filtering by only first name all he can
do is whatever store procedures I
already granted him to do now that
execute role allows me to say that he
can do any store procedure so there's a
store procedure in his list bill can do
it so if I have stored procedures said
SP people underscore delete all and
delete every row from the people table
bill could run that so if you want to be
more granular instead of giving that
grant execute two you could specify only
certain store procedures that are
granted to execute to so you'd say only
these store procedures can build access
or can this role can access so you can
get rid granular if you want but right
out of gate with two lines of code
create role and grant execute to with
those two lines of code you've created a
rule that locks down your database to
only what you've allowed people to do so
that in my mind is a really compelling
reason to use store procedures because
if you use only store procedures to
access update and delete data then you
can lock your database down very very
simply very quickly and yet fully to the
point where they can see which tables
are available so that's a big benefit in
my mind store procedures are also faster
than writing select star as far as
executing inside of sequel server not
all the time sometimes are just as
static if it has stored that same select
statement
but in general store procedures are
faster the other thing that still
procedures are benefit of store
procedures is they're clearly defined
you know exactly what's going to happen
at the sequel level because it's defined
exactly what's going to happen in one
more bit of security that comes along
with store procedures is the lessened
possibility of a sequel injection attack
it's not a complete security but it's
much much safer to use a store procedure
when it comes to protecting against
sequel injection attack so at this point
you've seen a lot of benefits of store
procedures not all of them but a lot of
them they've also kind of heard my view
on why I use store procedures the
security the speed the reusability
clearly defined protection against
sequel server injection attacks and all
the rest but you will hear some
drawbacks to store procedures so not
cover them and at least talk to you
about them and then you can decide if
the drawbacks are worth it so the first
drawback is probably one that affects me
the most the one that I wish had a
better story that it does and that is
this store procedures are not under
source control your c-sharp code you can
put in git and then you can say it's
version and under source control and you
can have different branches you can have
all this stuff around protecting your
code and making sure your code is
discoverable and making sure you have
copies of the older versions of your
code and all the rest of stuff that that
the source control provides but there's
not a similar thing for sequel server
does not get for sequel server well at
least not really now there is a paid
option you can do and that is from Red
Gate and if you can afford it it's a
great option Red Gate provides the
ability to have
source control right in our database
it's really powerful it's really easy to
use and it kind of works in the same
flow now the hard part here is databases
are radically different than code and so
there are some quirks that come along
with this so that's one option but it's
not cheap it's a little expensive
another option would be a little bit
cheaper and also has more features to it
will be going the route like the sequel
examiner suite sequel examiner will take
a different approach to source control
and that is it does differences between
your database and say your development
database or your development database
and your production database and says
here's the changes that have happened
and creates a script for you you can
actually lock that script into your
source control and run it from the
sequel examiner suite so it's a little
cheaper it's a little more full-featured
it does more than just source control it
actually does some comparison you can
does data comparison and it creates some
great statements that allow you to
recreate the changes in a new database
and the reality is you should be making
live changes on your production server
in fact approximately shouldn't be
making live changes on your staging or
even development server instead make
your changes on your local database and
then start that process early of
committing your code and replicating it
to your development database and on
through to your production database so
there are ways to do source control well
with sequel server it's not the same and
it's not the great story we have with
c-sharp or other programming languages
where source control is just a natural
part of the process but it can be done
it can fit well into your deployment
process and it will it can work with
latest third party
tools or even just manually the next
drawback that I hear a lot is one that I
have a little bit of a fundamental
conflict on and that is this business
logic doesn't belong in a database the
databases job is to store data
you shouldn't have logic in your
database and I really don't agree with
this and here's why I see these store
procedures down here really as the user
interface to my database so I do allow
the idea that business logic could be in
these store procedures now I don't
include a ton but I do like the idea of
checking the data before it goes in the
database I don't like the idea of
trusting anyone when we talk about
creating user interfaces in c-sharp one
of my tenants they always talk about is
don't trust the user if you give them a
first name field they're going to put in
their age they're going to play nothing
they're going to put in a book of
information whatever it is that's being
wrong the ground tries not necessarily
maliciously just because and users do
wacky things that I don't expect in the
same way why would I trust an
application why would I trust it only an
application is talking to my database
again let's come back to our execute
only with the store procedures if I
didn't have that and someone ran this
code right here right in SSMS it work
they could drop or delete all the people
from the people table table that doesn't
make me feel warm fuzzy so I do want to
have some sort of protection against
that that tactility called business
logic I'm okay with that
if you're familiar with building
websites especially JavaScript powered
websites we have the idea of front and
validation meaning in jQuery we have the
jQuery validate or with other tools we
have other ways of validating but
essentially if you have a form and you
say for first name field nothing else
and you hit submit before actually
submit it's going to say nope you can't
submit because you have put something in
that first name field that is
client-side or front-end validation the
JavaScript is saying you can't even talk
to the backend yet because you've not
given me the right information however
once you give the right information and
JavaScript says yes that's a valid data
and you hit submit the backend does
validation as well and the reason why is
because the backend can't trust the
front-end because you can bypass
JavaScript and you could call the form
directly instead of calling it through
the friend form and there's a lot of
ways of getting around that friend
dilation and so we actually do
validation twice especially in asp.net
MVC so we do validation on the
JavaScript side and then you pass data
in we do validation again and then we do
something that we know that data is
valid well in the same way I kind of
want to do some validation again when
you send data to the database because I
can't trust that your application fully
validated data and I can't trust that's
an application that's sending their data
so that's why I kind of push back on
that idea of no business logic in the
database and the last drawback I hear
sometimes is that tool like entity
framework and other large ORM s don't
like to use too
procedures they can they don't like to
they like writing their own select and
insert and update statements and here's
my deal I really push back on the idea
of using entity framework if you've
watched my other videos you'll see that
I really don't like entity framework now
it's a really amazing tool like itself
done some amazing things with it but at
the end of the day it doesn't allow me
to secure my database it's slow and it
writes the sequel for me instead allow
me to specify exactly what I want in my
sequel now it does save a step in that
you're not coming over here to SMS and
writing queries but the drawback there
is you've got this black box of I ask
for data and it comes until it doesn't
once it doesn't I've got a probably got
a debug so at any framework add a lot of
complexity at it slows things down
tremendously and it doesn't allow me to
secure my database the way I want so
that's why I don't really care that you
can't use any framework to its full
potential with this method now you could
use entity framework still just doing
only in-store procedures but it's not
really benefit there so those are the
drawbacks source control story isn't
great business launching the database if
that's a concern for you it's not for me
and again not really good story for
entity framework but personally I am ok
with that
so those are drawbacks the benefits
they're fast reusable they're clearly
defined they're safer when it comes to
sequel injection and it's much much more
securable from a database perspective so
those are store procedures I think it's
a really compelling reason to use them
and I think they're actually pretty
simple to do but I'd love to hear your
feedback on have you used them
what do you think have you seen any
other benefits or drawbacks oh you'd
like to talk about or giving our
questions so leave all those those
questions and comments down below I'll
try to answer every single one that you
post don't forget if you haven't already
