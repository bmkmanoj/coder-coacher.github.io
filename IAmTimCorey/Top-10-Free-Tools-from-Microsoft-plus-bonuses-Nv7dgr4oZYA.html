for free
the problem is that not everyone knows
about everything they offer in this
video I'm gonna show off 10 free tools
that are especially helpful for
developers at the end we'll look at some
bonus features that might apply to you
as well hi my name is Tim Corrie and is
my goal to make learning software
development easier if that sounded
something that interests you hit the
subscribe button and also join my
mailing list by clicking the link in the
description also down in that
description you will see links to all
the tools know that some ions have the
same URL alright let's jump in a tool
number one and 2 right off the bat again
this is for developers so we're gonna go
with the Visual Studio IDE also known as
Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
alright if you go to video studio comm
again the link is down in the
description you'll see that there's
these four buttons here in fact if you
hover over the first button you'll see
community 2017 this is the one you want
this is free in fact it's not a it's not
a time delay thing it's not a you know
90 day free trial this is free forever
there are some restrictions on it but
essentially as long as you are a small
business that it has less than a million
dollars in revenue a year or if you're
an individual either those cases you can
use Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
for free so that's by far the number one
recommendation they have just click here
and download you can find out more
information about the IDE like a click
clicking more information you can see
here that it lists all different things
you can do but then up here at the top
you'll also see under I believe it's
offerings compare offerings you'll
notice the difference is between the
three editions
if you've watched my c-sharp videos
you'll see that I use and I sometimes
mention it Visual Studio Enterprise
Edition I'm recommending you get
community addition you get community for
free now I get Enterprise for free and
I'll talk about that a little later but
for me for everybody else community
edition is free for pretty much
everybody unless your company has to pay
for it because of their size so the
difference is aren't really huge now
there's some missing bubbles here you'll
see and we can expand out to find out
what first of all this right here says
well if Community Edition is not for the
enterprise and then it means for large
organizations organizations that earn
more than a million dollars in revenue
and have more than five users of Visual
Studio so under the integrated
development environment IDE it's missing
a few things here the biggest one that I
see that be kinda nice to have is code
lens and will probably cover that in the
future video but but that allows you to
gilmour quick view into your code but
that's not the end of the world so
that's the biggest thing I see there
under advanced debugging you don't get
Intelli trait intellitrace or code map
or the memory dump analysis which again
those are nice things to have they're
not absolutely necessary in fact you
probably won't use those until you get
to an advanced usage of Visual Studio at
that point yes we should probably move
on to enterprise when people are asking
about you know community versus
professional versus enterprise if you
can use community use it because I
recommend you go from community right to
enterprise alright testing tools this is
the big area where there's a lot missing
in community versus enterprise and
notice it's the same amount missing as
professional the biggest one that I see
that we're really missing here is this
first one right here lie
unit testing that's a really handy
feature where unit tests just run
automatically whenever I make changes to
my code so if I were to change my code
in a specific method and that method was
being tested in my unit test software as
soon as I make that change and I believe
it's when I hit the debug or the compile
button that it actually triggers that
live unit testing to test just that
method so it's there's a nice stuff
there this extra stuff right here the
test manner is kind of nice but for the
most part that's the biggest one I see
the live unit testing to be nice to have
in the community edition and
cross-platform you're missing some
xamarin stuff the inspector and the
profiler that is not mean you're missing
xamarin notice down here xamarin forms
xamarin instant player native iOS and
Android UI designer and shared code
between Android and iOS with xamarin so
you are getting all those it's just
you're not getting some extra stuff with
xamarin unless you have the Enterprise
Edition so with that being said there's
a few things missing but those are like
peripheral things they're definitely not
the build code build applications build
websites all that kind of stuff is baked
in the Community Edition community
Community Edition is a full-featured IDE
it's not the top of the line but it's
not the the basic stripped-down model
either it's a it's a pre full-featured
IDE there's very very few things that
you're missing and those are more nice
to haves versus have two halves I don't
fit as anything you have to have an
enterprise
they're just niceties everything you
need is in Community Edition so that is
what I recommend relegate if you're on
Windows download Visual Studio for
Windows
and I do say for Windows and that's a
community community edition
don't forget but I do safer windows
because it's actually number two in my
lists it's separate I call a different
thing in that's Visual Studio from Mac
this is a little bit confusing because
they put it under the same title notice
the Visual Studio IDE if I have was on a
Mac right now it would say download for
Mac but under to learn more if I go down
Mac it showed me more about the Mac
version the thing I want to highlight is
it's fully featured that's great for
Android iOS Mac OS web and cloud
development notice what it's missing
Windows desktop which kind of makes
sense you're on Mac how you develop for
a Windows desktop what that means is
anything that you've you're familiar
with in the Visual Studio IDE is that
uses the dotnet framework the the full
dotnet framework can't be done in Visual
Studio for Mac it's just he doesn't have
that full framing because that full
framework depends on a lot of stuff in
Windows so a lot of c-sharp code you're
used to writing you can't write in the
Mac version of Visual Studio because
you're compiling Exe Xand dll's
neither of which will run on a Mac
machine so it couldn't even debug it now
you can write C sharp that's let's not
let's be clear here you can write C
sharp in the Mac version we just don't
forget the C sharp has dotnet core stuff
well dotnet core works on any platform
lay backup not quite any platform but
dotnet core does work on the Mac
platform
there's the dotnet standard will work on
any platform because it goes across net
core and it goes across the xamarin
platform and other things but dotnet
core will run on on mac and
so so there is a difference and that's
why this is actually number two here
which is Visual Studio for Mac not
something I'm really familiar with just
because I don't use a Mac and any of my
development but if you're on a Mac
obviously you can't install the Windows
version of Visual Studio but you can get
this version community as well for Mac
and you can find all the nice features
they have there there's a lot of great
stuff here it's just not the same thing
so I'll make sure I clarified that there
is a difference but they are both great
products they're just different all
right
let's go back to visual studio comm and
look at the next thing you're actually
gonna skip over one and come back to it
and that is right here this third button
here I can't really highlight because
it's actually a link but Visual Studio
code so Visual Studio code is different
than the Visual Studio IDE the first one
Visual Studio code still has versions
for Windows Linux and Mac let's go learn
more think of Visual Studio code
primarily as a web editor it will do web
great and it does it for on any platform
so Noah's Windows Mac and Linux and
there's a different installer versions a
little stable and insider if you want to
get the cutting-edge versus the I
recommend stable which is stable so you
can get for any platform and it's really
good at being a web editor so if you
want and it's free again these are all
free tools so if you want a great web
editor that works on your Linux box or
on your Windows box even Visual Studio
code is a great option it's designed for
the web is designed with allows tools in
mind it's integrated with git and a
couple other things so you can learn
more about that down here it has
intellisense and all the rest again free
so really nice little feature feature
app it's really growing in popularity
personally for web development I use
webstorm but from what I'm hearing this
is a real run for its money I pay for
webstorm webstorm is not free but but
this is becoming the equal to Web Store
know a lot of ways and so that's
something that I'll probably taking a
peek at again down the road a little bit
and see
well maybe I can replace webstorm with
this so that's number three is Visual
Studio code again different than Visual
Studio community vision IDE because this
is just for the web and that's number
three and it's this four section list so
we have Visual Studio for windows we
have Visual Studio for Mac we have
Visual Studio code which installs on
Windows Mac or Linux the next one on
this page the number two item is
actually not a installable tool but
instead it's visual studio team services
now don't get confused here you may
think well I'm not on a team it's just
me and solo development this is still
for you you may think well we've got you
know four people in the office how much
does it cost
it's free for you so this is up to five
users for free and it follows a lot of
the same rules as the Visual Studio IDE
so if you have again I believe it's less
than a million dollars in revenue you
should be good let's let's see if it has
I don't see the listing down here but I
believe it's ways is less than million
dollars and revenue you're good to go to
use this for free so this is the the
details page on this and what this is is
it's an all-in-one support system for
your code so rather bat you notice on
this page right here we have this image
of what it looks like
now of course they've got the more
full-featured we're doing a lot of stuff
here on this page dashboard up because
it looks cool
my dashboards never look like this
they're never quite this complicated
because for my development personally I
have myself and so my dashboard is just
me so it's not tons of users not I'm not
submitting tons of bugs and having
burned down charts and all the rest but
it's still useful for me for my when I
work for a company
my main job we have only a few
developers we have three right now and
so we can still use this and it's a
little more complicated than my personal
one but it's it's kind of the same thing
so what this does is this is a dashboard
and that's just kind of overview what's
going on but then we have the code
section if you can see my cursor up here
on this image there's a code section the
code section what it does is it's a
full-featured git client and so you can
if you're not familiar my my youtube
channel I put it's called introduction
to get GI T and what that is is a way of
versioning your code it's a really
powerful tool that if you don't
understand it already you need to learn
it it's one of those if you want a job
in the software development industry you
really need to know kit it's the number
one source control system used by
developers and even if you don't use it
at the company are gonna go to it will
give you a good idea of how source
control works so that when you go to use
their sort of control you at least have
some fundamentals down they'll be
different but you have the fundamentals
down so that's where your code lives is
in that tab and it has you know all the
commits history and you can do
comparisons you can actually even modify
your code on the web you can modify your
code and check that code in or commit
that code so that's that's all right
there then there's the work tab which
allows you to do things like have bug
reports
and have you know feature requests and
start putting those towards commits the
really cool one is the build and release
tab they've worked a lot on that
recently the building release allows you
to have a build system in the cloud
again for free that will take your code
compile it bring any packages in the
need to modify in any way you needed to
do and then publish that compiled built
code wherever you want as we go I use
this personally I use this in my
business I recommend my customers use
this it's amazing for doing builds and
at first when I thought about that I'm
like you know I first started I'm like
why would I ever need a build service
because I hit build on Visual Studio and
I'm done
there's a lot more to it that you can
get into but even if you have it the
very simplistic version it does it for
you
so right now for me when I commit my
code to get in a certain branch it takes
that it builds it and it puts on to
whatever servers I need to be on so
that's really powerful test if you have
unit tests you can test them being the
build process and they can say okay
these are failing therefore the build is
gonna fail we're not gonna push the new
code and clicking your report
you can also have a wiki page where or
series of pages where you describe what
happens in your application how it works
so it's an awful lot of stuff here in
the visual studio team services this is
a whole platform that does a bunch of
stuff oh you can even have a private
nougat server server if enough made
nougat that's the package management
server that the visual studio uses to
bring code snippets or code bits into
your your project and you can have a
private server so you can actually
publish your own libraries as nougat
packages which again I recommend doing
so these keep private so that no one
else in the world can see these things
and and yet you can bring them in your
you are packages in your your projects
on that build server or locally as well
so and all of this is private so github
offers open source projects free github
repository so you can create a github
repository for free just like you could
on visuals with your team services the
difference is github is only for public
unless you pay for the private
repositories
whereas visual studio team services is
private by default it's much more
enterprise friendly and yet also small
business friendly in that it's free for
us as long as you don't get too big and
let's see if too big we have to pay for
it which makes sense so really great
platform I I recommend that you at least
check it out like I said I do it for my
personal projects so even something is
small the first thing I do is I create a
new repository on visual studio team
services and then commit all my code
there and do all my commits there and my
builds everything it gets done through
there because once you set it up
it's fire-and-forget guys commit my code
and you know if the website project the
website gets updated within about five
minutes with the compiled built code
that is committed so really great stuff
all right so that's tool number four
number five is also on Visual Studio
calm and that is the visual studio app
Center now this is not one that I've
used personally because I don't really
get into building iOS or Android apps
using xamarin I've used other tools to
build Android and iOS apps but I have it
used amarant for it and so I don't
really use this tool this is actually a
newer tool but the Visual Studio App
Center is your one-stop shop for if
you're building those those kind of
tools
so you're building iOS apps or Android
apps or stuff like that even web apps
you can use this tool kind of like what
we're doing in the visual studio team
service is where you have you know the
build and the test and the distribute
and all that kind of stuff but they've
added a few app specific things for
example the crash reports the analytics
push information and also down here they
actually allow you to test on real
devices so you can actually push your
app at different devices and see how it
looks and see how it interacts on the
different screen sizes so if you're
getting the app development and you're
gonna use xamarin this is the tool for
you so definitely check that out they
said does Swift objective-c Android
xamarin iOS and even react native so and
that react native is for creating apps
on the phone it's not react for webpages
so a whole bunch of good stuff here this
stuff you used to be expensive okay when
I was getting into App delimit just just
for some customers it was expensive to
do stuff like this and I had to kind of
patch some things together because I
want to pay all that money when I wasn't
gonna do it long term I was just doing
it for a customer and so now the first
place I'd probably turn is the visual
studio app center and the Samer and
tools because it's just there's so much
here and it's all free
alright so enough about that I'll leave
that for you app developers to look at
some more but definitely check that out
Visual Studio App Center alright so
those are the five on this page right
here so it's four buttons this Visual
Studio IDE has Windows the underneath it
also has four Mac so check out those
five obviously not everything applies to
everybody but I recommend everybody get
at least one IDE either the actual IDE
or the visual studio code if you're
doing just web stuff but then also get
visual studio team services no matter
who you are because if you're writing
code you should be putting into source
control if you're putting in a source
control you should have that source
control be somewhere external to your
own computer even though you can do get
on just your computer that's great and I
did it for some projects the reality is
if you have a second place off the
computer then if anything happens to
your computer you could corrupt files
whatever it's still in a remote
repository so team service is great for
that it's also great for like I said
that the package management and the the
build cycle and the testing and all that
so I'd recommend at least the Visual
Studio IDE or officials with your code
or both and this for sure and if you're
into app development check out the app
center okay so those are the first five
now let's move on to sequel server so
this is the link is in the description
down below but essentially it's
Microsoft comm /e and - Us / SQL -
server / SQL - server - downloads which
is really easy to remember right I don't
know why I do this they kind of bury
their stuff I have to Google it every
time ironic I know that I'm googling it
I should probably Bing it but but I have
to find it to figure out you know where
it is and I know what the names are so
it it's not the greatest but sequel
server is very expensive sequel server
even standard edition is very expensive
but for developers there are two options
for us that are free forever okay the
first option and the one we're gonna
look at as number six is the developer
edition so this is the latest version of
sequel server sequel server 27
developer edition this is free its
full-featured it's essentially the same
thing as the Enterprise Edition of
sequel server the differences are very
very minor between the developer edition
and the Enterprise Edition and they
mainly revolve around just commenting
sure that you follow the rules with
developer edition because the rules
about developer edition are you can't
use this as a production server now that
doesn't mean you can't create production
databases it just means that you can't
install developer edition on a server
and then point production applications
at that developer edition that's a no-no
but put this on your your desktop or
your laptop and go ahead and create
databases if you want to create a
production database that's fine it's
just that when you actually go use it in
production you have to make sure you
transfer that database to a real
production environment again for my day
job I do sequel server development and
so on my machine I have visuals to or
I'm sorry sequel server 2017 developer
edition I do all my development there
but when it comes to deploying that to
our production server our production
server has I believe it's standard
edition made its web edition mighty web
edition so we deploy it there and that
has a different license and that's fine
I did all my development on developer
edition that's what it's for but
actually cuz they use it it's on a
licensed production already server so
that's just you know the be careful how
you use this thing but this is amazing
it's full sequel server it does
everything you ever wanted to do and
it's great for development so I
definitely recommend that you get
developer edition now the next one I
want to point
and this is number seven in our list is
the Express Edition well for here on the
right
Express edition is also free the
difference is we can use this in
production now there are limitations and
we can look at what those limitations
are but I believe they have to do with
the size of data basically it's a happy
ten gigabytes are less and not every
feature not all the advanced features
are enabled and so there aren't some
limitations and they recommend it for
desktop apps or small web apps or small
server applications so essentially just
think not huge applications that have
hundreds of users pounding away at a
database at the same time which makes
sense but probably for everything you're
doing in your development environment
and everything you're doing for you know
a small business or small client those
type of things this will work great and
it's free so you can feel comfortable
deploying this you can feel comfortable
using this in a production environment
and not have to worry about the
licensing issues of it so those are the
two number six number seven developer
edition put this on your laptop this is
where you do all your work in in working
on sequel server and then Express
Edition this is where you would deploy
to if the environment is small or
doesn't have a lot of load and and you
want to have a production ready app so
those are the two right there there is
kind of a bonus one down here there's
they're just starting to get sequel
server 2017 on Linux using docker and so
that's that's a nice feature it's just
on the is the cutting edge right now
what that'll allow us to do is move off
of a Windows Server
requirements which will reduce our
licensing cost which is great so this
kind of goes hand in hand with the idea
of the asp.net core asp.net core can
work on Linux Nicole can docker and
which is great and you know people
clamoring teach me core teach me core
the problem is a lot of times the the
number one database we hook up to from a
dotnet application is sequel server
well if sequel server is on Windows why
we have a Linux machine
yes we're saving a little bit of
licensing costs but what we're also
having problems with is the idea that
now we have a Linux machine and a
Windows machine in the same environment
and that can cause problems so a lot of
enterprise users a lot of businesses are
saying it's one or the other so if I
have sequel then I have Windows and so
even though dotnet core is out there
saying that's great don't need it
because I have Windows
well now that sequel server is gonna be
on Linux with docker that means I don't
have to have a Windows environment in
order to have my full stack applications
from from web through API through
database so this is a big deal and you
can read more about that and I just kind
of bonus one but but those things are
out there all right so I've had a couple
big ones Visual Studio IDE is huge the
visual so your team services is massive
and sequel server developer edition is
is massive as well there's another one
that's even bigger I'm going to show you
next
and so that's number eight and that is a
sure if you have not heard about a sure
yet this is a zu re called a jerk if you
heard about it yet or maybe you've heard
about you're not sure what it is or how
it works this is one that you should
probably get to know
and that's what Microsoft thinks too and
so they've decided you know what we're
gonna give us away for free for a
limited amount and which I really
commend them for because there's so much
here it's so powerful and they kind of
say have fun and which I love but let's
start off with what a sure is a sure is
Microsoft's cloud if you're not familiar
with what cloud means or kind of
nebulous essentially what cloud is is
just a whole bunch of servers that run
somewhere else okay Yass is a little
more complexity to it and yes there can
be they can do other things but the
reality is it's essentially just a whole
bunch of computers that run somewhere
else that I have access to it's a fancy
name but for a sure what they allow us
to do is to tap into those computers and
do different things so for example I've
created whole websites in about five
minutes uh nazzer
I uh say give me a website and here is
the URL and it says okay I'm gonna build
it for you five minutes later you're
good to go and that's just really
convenient in fact I can then hook up my
build system with visuals of your team
services to connect directly to a sure
and push those websites so it's it's all
kind of integrated it's great in fact if
I wanna skip the step of the build
server I can actually in visual studio
hook up my Asha account and say I've got
this asp.net MVC application build me a
website when I compile and push it it
will build a new website on Azure and
take your coat and put it on that
website in about five minutes so you
know from nothing to an actual test in
the cloud
running on cloud servers
the really cool thing is then if I start
using that website and I say man I'm
getting hit hard you know twice a year
let's let's say from it that's a college
registration website
well college registration only happens a
couple times yeah let's just say to fall
in the spring now it's probably more
time than that but those are the big
ones so fall semester and spring
semester that's when everyone registers
and so those two times you may have lots
of traffic but then other times you
don't well you can actually set it's
really simple it's essentially a
checkbox you can set the setting in
Azure says scale my website as needed so
as more people request your website and
the Khan gets pounded on they'll spin up
copies of that website in a clustered
environment that'll do the you know
passing people off to the right server
but pretend they're all the same server
and you know just reading that load
automatically and that's one of the best
things about adjure is everything is
simple now when you first get into it
you you're gonna be overwhelmed it's
it's overwhelming to look at all the
options all the choices and you may
think this is not simple but as soon as
you have an overview of what these
different parts do it'll make a whole
lot more sense and I'm gonna do some
videos on Azure the last of an azure
coming out in the near future but for
right now you can go ahead and poke
around in Azure and kind of get a feel
for what it is and what it does now
everything has a cost so not when I say
freeze be careful that you understand
what I mean by free by free I mean they
give you $200 in credits for exploring
the first 30 days so if the first 30
days you get $200 to buy their premium
services and they'll tell you when you
start building something
here's how much this is gonna cost a
month and so you can they'll be taken
out of $200 after that month is up if
you have not elected to put a payment
method in and if you've not elected for
the pay for overages then what'll happen
is your systems will turn off so if
you've purchased premium content and you
get past that 200 hour credit or past
the 30 days and you have not put a
budget in for your credit card then
what'll happen is we'll just turn
everything off
that's premium and just wait until you
have credit again which is really nice
it's not gonna bill you hundreds of
dollars accidentally just don't turn on
the pay-as-you-go option which is very
clear about what that does so they do
$200 a start but they also give you 12
months of their popular free services so
twelve months to play around with their
popular free services which they're not
free after twelve months but then you
always have certain services for free
twenty-five of them alright so here's
the free products free each month for a
year these are the things that are free
you get a length virtual machine and a
Windows virtual machine that's 750
compute hours and I believe it's per
month so if they do the math on that
it's not the entire month I don't
believe but it's pretty close maybe it's
you know one hour I think it might be
one computer and that's it you know so
so if you have one length machining of
one Windows machine I believe that would
be the 750 hours not positive you have
to do the math on that but if you had
two Windows machines that's fine
you just get only half a month before
you run out hours
so that's just something you know this
storage you have 64 gig times 2 for
managed storage blob storage is where
you put you know images earlier
unstructured data that's 5 gigabytes
file storage 5 gigabytes sequel
databases 250 gigabytes of sequel
databases I use their ads or sequel a
lot it is so simple a spool of an azure
sequel server especially compared to
actually installing sequel server
installing sequel server can be daunting
I actually have a whole course that
starts off with here's how you install
sequel server because and that's
developer edition because it is somewhat
complicated
whereas this it's a couple of minutes
because everything is automated and
behind a menu I don't deal with the
actual configuration Microsoft does so
they have cosmos DB and they have 15
gigabytes of bandwidth transfer or data
transfer but there's a free anytime
products app services functions
containers that before your docker
containers service fabric Active
Directory there's a whole bunch of other
fun stuff that you can do in Azure for
free so this is all again tremendous
it's amazing and for testing purposes
especially it's easy as a website test
it for a few hours then delete it Aguila
the same as sequel server or a number of
other things you can actually spool up
an entire Windows or Linux machine in
the cloud and get RDP access Remote
Desktop Protocol you can get RDP access
into that server in about I've under 10
minutes it depends on your connection
speed and how busy they are but it's
pretty quick how fast you can get server
up and get into it on remote desktop so
really powerful stuff
again most the configuration unless you
do a full Windows desktop or a full
Linux desktop most the configuration is
handled by Microsoft so if I say give me
a sequel server an azure sequel server
they're gonna handle the installation
they're gonna handle where the the log
files go that I handle how to balance
things out how to speed things up and
optimize things all the rest all that
stuff that we used to pay people just to
handle so a sequel server DBA a database
administrator their job would be to do
what asher does for you now that's not
to say that as your eliminates the need
for a DBA but what it does mean is that
you don't have to learn how to be a DBA
when you're doing development database
developers sure but database
administrator not so much let Azure do
it for you so really big fan of a sure I
use a quite a bit I have free credits I
get every month which again nice feature
I'll I'll tell you how you can get
access to those yourself but I sure has
some great tools in it it's great to
understand how they work
because it might be something you can do
for a customer or for a work environment
as well where maybe you don't pay for a
lot but you pay for a certain
circumstance a financial benefit for you
so check it out
learn it get to know it take advantage
of the free 12 months of some services
always free 25 plus services and a $200
and credit for the first 30 days so
that's a sure again I'll have some more
videos on that in the future number 9 is
probably one you're gonna grow net but
it's documentation now you may say ah
documentation it's always horrible well
it's not anymore ok doc stop Microsoft
comm Microsoft
lies that MSDN was awful and so they
said we're gonna scrap that idea and
we're gonna come up with a new system a
new way of doing things
and that's where Doc's don't
microsoft.com comes in this is a much
better system for documentation it's a
much more intelligent documentation
system and it even allows for people to
contribute their own documentation
articles to this site to make it even
better so there's some really powerful
stuff in here but this is much much more
clear than we used to have now it is a
growing platform it's new and so there's
not documentation everything on
everything
but for example asp.net is versus core
that's core this is asp.net if you want
to look at AP ice you can click on API
and there's some really good articles on
step by step how to do it with pictures
and it's way beyond a MSDN head if you
ever look at some MSDN documentation I
used to laugh at it because I would look
up a function made of functions called
load image file you say okay well as
load image file do in the description
would be loads image file yeah look at
that and go well yeah I got that much
that's why I came here one more but
really all to put in there is a name of
the function that's not helpful you know
so this is not that this is tutorials
that have pictures to have step by step
that even has some downloads to them you
know the references the the resources at
Doc's top Microsoft comm are really
tremendous and best of all they cover a
wide range so it's not just one little
thing
so if you want C sharps office he sharp
stuff in here if you want dotnet stuff
Visual Studio nougat even box services
sequel xamarin if it's a lot of its in
here
again it's not everything yet they're
still putting more stuff in here you'll
see a more more focused approach on the
newer stuff versus the older stuff but
that's a good thing so so just know that
if it's in here it'll be great it'd be a
lot better than what you're used to so
check that out so that's number nine is
the documentation from Microsoft number
10 is the Microsoft Virtual Academy the
MVA
so MVA Microsoft comm in what this is
designed for is to help people
understand their different platforms so
with its mobile app development or
Visual Studio or C sharp or database
development they've got something in
here for you in video format so for
example there is the c-sharp
fundamentals for absolute beginners that
course right there has a lot of good
stuff in it now is it perfect no of
course not nothing is my content is not
perfect but there's a lot of good stuff
in here you can you can learn from if
you wanna get into JavaScript there's
some JavaScript for absolute beginners
and the nice thing here is a lot of this
stuff is stuff that I would teach and
that's something I'm very sensitive
towards is I don't recommend just any
training platform you can go udemy you
can go to other sites like that and get
training courses on some of the same
stuff that I teach and there's a reason
why I teach it and that's because I
haven't found the resources where they
teach the way that I think as we taught
okay I had some opinions on that after
having developed for 20-plus years
professionally and so I've seen some
things I want
make development easier make learning
development easier and so there's
certain ways I want see it taught to
make that easy but I see a lot of times
people go right into drive students
right into pitfalls and that concerns me
and that's why I teach things a little
bit differently well in the MVA for the
most part they don't do that they don't
drive into those pitfalls and they teach
the way that I want to see things taught
maybe not my style maybe not in the
depth that I do may not showing you all
the different parts but they do teach
good content and so that's why if people
ask me where can I find content that's
not on your YouTube channel and that you
don't sell this is where MVA Microsoft
com I trust that most of the stuff on
here is of really high quality and
that's because Microsoft is very
selective and what it puts on here and
who it promotes so I definitely meant
that if you're missing content from me
or if you want to hear what I say in a
different in different way or you know
kind of that second voice I say there's
a little bit differently and maybe I'll
click this is the place to go for that
video training and again this is mostly
video training they do have learning
paths and they call them certifications
I believe I'm not positive or at least
you know completion certificates but
it's not an actual certification don't
confuse the two now I do advertise I
don't if you saw it down here one of
these there you go they advertise you
know the the exam as they do for
certification for the most part these
these video courses don't teach to a
certification
it's just that they offer certification
Microsoft does on their platforms so so
that's kind of a misnomer there is not
they're not directly related to each
other
it's just that they both come from
Microsoft okay so that's number 10
now if you've watched am i my top 10 top
5 videos before you'll know that's I
never stopped at the number I give you
because there's always something else I
want to show you in this case would call
the bonus one the one that everyone can
use and should use in my opinion is this
one Microsoft's onedrive if you're not
familiar with onedrive you need to be ok
this is the equivalent and I kind of
cringe here it's the equivalent of
Dropbox so if you're familiar op box
it's a similar thing in fact it installs
the same way it works pretty much the
same way in the the foundational stuff
it allows you to put a folder on your
computer somewhere and then everything
in that folder gets synchronized to the
cloud backed up version and you have
access to it anywhere and if you're just
using those basics it's great so I have
all of my important files like all the
files for these videos that create and
all the the stuff that goes around these
videos they all get put into my onedrive
account and then and that's normally I
start from my desktop this is where I'm
recording on my desktop so if I jump on
my laptop and one tweak a recording or
do some editing of a recording I can get
on my laptop my laptop synchronizes down
those files and I can work on them but
then if I'm on the road I want to pull
something up in though that onedrive
folder somewhere I can do so on my phone
or on the web really convenient this is
all free now I want to show you the
plans because again this is a series
about free things microsoft offers to
help developers but I do want to point
out the paid versions for this
particular one because that might be
something that could benefit you
the free version gives you five
gigabytes of storage in the cloud that's
awesome
five gigabytes for free for doing
nothing so just sign up you get five
gigabytes you get the mobile app the web
access the searched photos you can
synchronize your iPhone or I believe
Android so whenever you take a picture
in your phone it gets uploaded to the
cloud automatically that's really nice
so you get all that for free for 580
bytes worth of storage but if you want
to take one step up and pay two dollars
a month or $24 a year you can multiply
that five gigabytes by ten to get 50
gigabytes of storage space that's that's
nice
$24 gets you 50 gigabytes of storage
space but and here's what I do is one of
these two options now for me I use this
top option here because I have a whole
family but for you it might just be the
personal use you only have one account
one account $70 a year which seems high
but you get one terabyte of storage
that's a lot but you also get office
Microsoft Office the full office suite
Word Excel PowerPoint outlook OneNote
you also get Microsoft teams and Skype
for business and some other things as
well all of that is included in this
Premium Plus you can expire links so
when you share out you can share a link
from your onedrive you can actually have
connects expiration date on that you can
have offline folders offline folds a
nice multi page scanning and more
sharing options so but the big things
here are you get one terabyte of storage
which is a lot and you get the full
office suite that's for a year now like
I said I use this higher one which which
is $100 only $30 more
but I get five user accounts each with
one terabyte and then five accounts
worth of Microsoft Office
oh and don't forget I didn't mention you
four but you also get the tablet and
phone version of office as well for
either these two plans so I'm not trying
to sell anything here I'm not gonna get
a commission on that's not gonna put a
you know affiliate link I could
technically probably get some extra
storage space I put an affiliate link
but I'm not going to I'm asking a link
right to onedrive dot live.com I'm not
getting anything for this Microsoft not
pay me or anything like that but I want
to point out because when I started
looking at this I actually started
looking at well may I should pay for the
premium version of Dropbox and I started
doing comparison realized hey wait a
minute
this is $100 a year and I get my whole
family office and I get my whole family
one terabyte onedrive accounts yes
that's exactly what I want so that's
what I do I have I think right now I'm
actually using four out of five I had my
wife and my two boys each on a one
terabyte account and I have a full
office suite for them so that's that's
definitely going to look into but again
I'm not trying anything what I recommend
though is the free 5 gigabyte version
it's it's an amazing easy to use system
so check that out sign up for I can't
it's free so just sign up for it and try
it out
get the phone app see how it works
pretty simple put all your stuff there
you're good to go ok so that's like the
bonus one for everybody but then I want
to talk through a couple of different
options depending on your circumstances
option number one is if you are a
student so if you go to imagine
Microsoft comm
and a college or even a high school
your IT staff probably has access to
give you a imagine login and usually
called DreamSpark but I guess they've
changed that name so what this is is
Microsoft gives you access to certain
things including Azure so if if we go
over here the catalog they give you a
share for students starter they also
give you parallels Desktop for Mac the
pro version it's a three month trial but
that allows you to run Windows on your
Mac they give you Community Edition of
Visual Studio which that's great already
has communication but they also give you
some other things including some access
to plural site for training
I believe it's six months something like
that and they give you a few other
things as well so depending on your
school depending on what license they
bought from Microsoft they'll have
different levels for you with a whole
bunch of software so a lot of this stuff
comes for free anyways because Microsoft
is really small business friendly sole
proprietor or you know hobbyist friendly
and so that's kind of what we get and
the you know the same level as well a
student or would normally get but
students do have some extra stuff in
this imagine account so I take your
student check that out with your your
school's IT department information
technology department so just talk to
whoever's in charge of buying the
Microsoft licensing to see if you have
access to anything like these call it
dream spark but now it's Microsoft
Imagine now if you are a small business
especially small business that's just
starting out or that is small like I
said small in the small business
check out startup stop Microsoft comm
they have a whole bunch of stuff they
give away for free typically for three
up to three years when a business is
newer
in the the process there's a some
limitations but usually it's you know a
small team or no team and not ton of
revenue meaning against it's either you
know five hundred thousand or a million
dollars something like that or less
you're making so it's it's a pretty high
number for a web call small business but
they give you a short credits every
month they give you access to to Windows
versions and to things like that and I
believe they'll even give you visual
studio professional edition they might
give you enterprise not positive so
there's there's two different areas
there is the getting started area and
it's also the scalar business so they
work with tech stars and Y Combinator
and some others to give businesses a leg
up and so they give large grant certain
businesses and other things so just
check out this startup stop Microsoft
comm and depending your business kind of
browse through here and figure out what
applies to you not everything will but
but doing so I think will will
definitely benefit your business so
check that out the final one is kind of
what I would encourage you to aspire
towards and that's the Microsoft most
valuable professional award and that's
something that I have and it's it's for
giving back to the community for people
who say I'm not gonna just hold all my
knowledge to myself and give it away I'm
going to teach those who are below me or
help those out who might not know
everything I know and it's not for I've
arrived
it's for the I want to help out in some
way it's a lot of ways you can help out
whether it's speaking at local meetups
or organizing local meetups or is
contributing to open source code or it's
even that you know doc stop Microsoft
com
you contribute to their that will count
towards an MVP there is not a magic
number that you have to do is just they
look at the community as a whole and see
you know are you are you stand out a
contributor in your area now this is not
a payment and this is not a you're
supporting Microsoft this is an award
and what it's for is from Microsoft's
say because you do this we would like to
recognize you and along with that
recognition comes a bunch of software
and so this is where I have access to a
sure every month and in fact if I need
more access to teach measure you know so
if I needed more credits in order to
teach some advanced stuff or to do a
class or something like that I could
just call my representative and say hey
can I have some more this month or this
the six months of this year whatever and
they will give me you know potentially
thousands of dollars in extra Azure
credits just because I am an MVP and a
lot of other businesses third-party
businesses also give their software
weight of MVPs for free and so I don't
recommend that you try to you know just
get free stuff but this is a way that
you can get some of those extra stuff
that's made outside your price range but
but you do have the opportunity to give
away the community you do that and you
can be awarded the MVP and you can get
some of that kind of free stuff they'll
help you do even more for people so
again it's not something that you know
you do it for the stuff you do it
because you want to help people but if
you do there may be some benefits there
for you as well so kind of three levels
of extra stuff student small business
and community leader so any of those
three levels will give you extra stuff
beyond we've talked about so far
so that's why they're not you know
including the top ten because it's only
based upon certain circumstances in your
area but but there definitely something
to look into
if they apply to you all right so we've
covered now the top ten plus the bonus
plus the three extras you know the first
five we're all about visual studio this
vigil studio.com page we're talking the
IDE s for Windows and Mac we're talking
code for all versions of desktop
software we have visual studio team
services which everyone should use for
the code and App Center which is for
mobile app developers then we shift it
over into sequel server and got into
both developer edition and Express
edition and the difference is there and
when we should use each a sure which we
should definitely check out and see all
the power that is there great
opportunities there and then also the
doc stop Microsoft comm which will help
you out when you get stuck somewhere
check this out first
and finally the Microsoft Virtual
Academy for all of your video training
needs that I'll provide you know if I
provide them I recommend me first just
because I think I'd you know I'm more
biased towards myself so you can be
biased either way I'm fine also the
bonus of onedrive so check that out and
see which plan works for you but
definitely start with a free version and
make sure you like it but there's a lot
of stuff there that you can use and then
of course those three bonuses if you're
a student if you are a small business or
if you're an MVP so I hope this has been
helpful this is just the top ten there's
other stuff that Microsoft provides
they're kind of you know hidden away in
little nooks and crannies but these
these are definitely ones that as a
software developer these are the kind of
the top ones you should know about and
make sure you take advantage of so if
you have any suggestions for other ones
that you want to point out other people
definitely live in the
comments below I'll try and highlight
them especially if it's something I
think people should know about and I
might put it in the description if it's
something valuable everyone should see
and also let me know you think and I'd
appreciate a thumbs up in the video as
well alright so that's it for this video
as always I am Tim quarry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
