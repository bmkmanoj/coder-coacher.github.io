backend of our application remember we
have this list of requirements which
also generate us list of questions and
then we created these two classes based
upon the requirements so let's now jump
into visual studio and start creating
this application now in our requirements
we call this the meeting journal
application that's what our boss called
it let's go ahead and stick with that so
we're gonna start with building our
class library since we're developing the
back end of our application let's call
this our journal library and we'll give
a solution name of meeting journal
so now I've create a class library to
hold our two classes we called it
meeting our journal library just to make
sure you put library in that child so we
we know that this is a class library not
a console application not a windows
forms application not WPF application
let's go ahead and delete class one and
then let's add our classes now I'm gonna
go ahead and resize this window a bit so
that we can see our our classes while we
develop them because this right here is
our blueprint we don't want to just
guess it what our design should be we
should already know in this case we do
so right click on your project say add
new item class and what's the first
class well meeting we changed the class
T public because we want this to be
accessible outside of our class library
and then we need to add five items to
our lists or to our set of properties
and a property we're going to do auto
properties so we use the prop snippet
tab tab the first one is a list of type
person and it's called people met with
okay now that's already starting to yell
at us and you should always pay
attention these red squigglies in this
case is saying I don't know what that
type is you know if we go look at our
error list the type or name space person
could not be found
okay the type or name space person could
not be found
what does that mean well it can't find
it that's what it means in this case we
know that person is a custom class we've
created only we haven't yet we only have
meeting we don't have this person class
over here go ahead and just ignore that
for now we'll come back and create that
person class in a minute
so in this case I'm actually ignoring a
red squiggly that's fine
because before I'm done I'll take care
of all those but I've intentionally
looked at it addressed it and said I'll
come back to it
so we need to create our next property
again prop and tab tab this is a date
time it's called
meeting start time okay and that's again
it's straight from our requirements so
the next one is going to be meeting end
time prop tab tab date time meeting end
time
String meeting notes
and lastly whoops prop string title and
I forgot to do my capitalization here
remember that properties should be start
off with the leading uppercase or Pascal
case just like methods and class names
only private variables should have a
lowercase or camel case okay so I have
people met with I have meeting start
time meeting end time meeting notes in
title let's go ahead and move on to the
person class so I right click on my prom
my project I say add new item class I
name it person I changes to be public
and I say prop first name
last name
email
phone number and again there's no
thinking involved here okay because I've
done everything I need to already since
I have both of these in there in my
system I know that I've met my
requirements how I know I've met my
requirements
well because over here in my design I
verified this design met the
requirements so I don't need to worry
about my requirements at this point I
just follow my design to the letter now
if we go back to this meeting class
notice that person is no longer has a
red squiggly that's because we've
created that person class let's go ahead
and save all here and we can't do
anything you can't run this application
but we can do is go build and build
solution if there were any errors it pop
up here in this error list but notice we
have a ready which means the build
succeeded and there are no errors in the
error left the last thing I do is any
cleanup work on these classes well the
person class doesn't need any cleanup we
just have four strings there's nothing
special needs to happen but over here in
the meeting class remember this list of
type person needs to be instantiated to
a new list before you start adding to it
so let's go ahead and add a constructor
to do that remember constructor just
says public and the name of class so it
would say public meeting and then you
can specify any parameters you want to
pass in and then it acts like a method
there is no return type that's how you
can tell it's a constructor not just a
normal method okay if instead you want
to use the snippet you
ctor for constructor tab tab and that
fills in which class name you need and
it starts off with no parameters you can
add the parameters that you want so in
this case in our constructor let's say
people met with equals new list of
person okay that initializes this people
met with list to be a new list that way
we can go ahead and add to it right away
besides that there's nothing else needs
to be initialized so we're good to go we
have now created a class or actually two
classes that handle all of our
requirements because they implement our
design we've used one of our classes the
person class or use this enable as a
type for one of our variables in a
different class the meeting class so
this list right here will contain a list
of people each person will have first
name last name email address and phone
number on this list so you'll have Bob
Smith at you know five five five one two
one two and you know and Bob at
yahoo.com and they also have Suzy Jones
at five five five one two one three and
Suzy at hotmail comm you know will both
be in this list possibly of people met
with okay and that is how you take your
back-end and translate it into classes
we have now built our class library and
we're done we hit this build build
solution just to be sure that the build
succeeds and that no
errors pop up in our error list if
errors did pop up we need to fix those
before I move on always make sure that
whatever step you're on before you move
on there are no errors for example if I
had a mid the semicolon here a little
red squiggly pops up here and if I hit
build build solution the error list pops
up and says ooh there's an error right
here if I double click it takes me right
to the error and actually even tells me
what the error is in this case a
semicolon is expected to resolve that
put a semicolon save it build it again
if the build succeeds you can move on if
the bill does not succeed fix it and
that is how you translate your
requirements into your design into
actual classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
