it right that's the question that
worries a lot of people and should
probably be at least something that
every developer thinks through design
patterns are best practice concepts that
we can implement into our code to make
it better in some way thing has
guardrails to keep our code safe in
today's video we're going to looking at
the fifth and final entry in the famous
solid principle the d stands for the
dependency inversion principle we're
gonna dive into what that means how it
should change our programming practices
and how far we should take it for those
of you who don't know me my name is Tim
quarry and it's my goal to clear the
confusion and frustration around
learning c-sharp because learning
software development shouldn't be so
hard if that sounded something that
would interest you I think you'd benefit
from two things first of all subscribe
to this channel and second join my
mailing list the million lessons we're
gonna get exclusive content and insider
access you'll find the link in the
description below also in that same
description you'll find a link to my
blog post on this topic where I'll
include links to the source code at the
beginning this video and also at the end
so let's start a conversation on
dependency inversion principle which I'm
not called di from now on by looking at
some code I could do a nifty PowerPoint
for you and show you the fun pictures to
try to represent this issue but I found
best to look at this in a practical
manner here I've created a project in
Visual Studio in c-sharp now the
principles as video actually apply to
any software development language but
since this channel focuses primarily on
c-sharp that's the language we use the
code here I have is rather simple
it's a console application that
simulates a really simple chore
application in fact I've oversimplify it
in order to hopefully make it easier to
understand di we start off with our
static void main which is the entry
point for a console application where I
create a new person object and new chore
object I assign the person object which
I call owner
to the chore object as the owner so the
chore is simply has the
take-out-the-trash property or turning
and it has the owner and I do three
things I perform work and say three
hours of work was done I perform work
against a 1.5 hours of work was done and
finally I say that mature is now
complete
now if we look at the actual code of
this in the chore class we see the chore
name and owner properties and we have
the hoursworked property as well which
is actually a private set because we
actually set that through the perform
work method and that way we can do more
than just perform work we can also do
other things now I could have made that
into a full property and put this stuff
in a set but I actually wanted it into a
method so we add to the hours worked we
write a new log or create a new logger
instance and we log out that we perform
the work on and the chore name when we
complete again it marks the property is
complete done and it creates a new log
instance that says we completed this
chore and then it creates a new email
instance which sends an email to the
owner saying the chore is complete so
let's look at those two classes let's
look first through the logger it just
does a console.writeline
that says hey i'm i'm logging this it
actually so does the send email these
are just simulations are not actually a
full application I want to try and keep
it as simple as possible okay so and
finally have a person class which is
just a really simple first name last
name phone number an email address so
that's it that's our entire application
if we run this I'll drag it over here it
says we perform work which that's our
first one we perform work again that's a
second one and then we completed taking
out the trash and we're simulating
sending an email to Tim I am Tim quarry
calm all right so that's the entire
application that's all it does
now the propolis application is it
totally violates di so now we have some
code and from us let's talk about di
what is di states that high-level
modules should not depend on low-level
modules but rather both should depend on
abstractions and those abstractions
should not depend on details now that's
a whole lot of fun words that kind of
heat glaze over a bit so let's talk that
through and what it means so in this
instance a high-level module means
anything that's calling something else
okay so for example static void main it
calls into the person class it also
calls into the chore class okay so it
depends on the person class being there
and the chore class this would be a
high-level module the static void main
because it depends on something at a
lower level now that your class is
actually a high level module as well
because it depends on the logger and the
email or class the email I depends on
nothing and you notice a logger be to
what we call a low-level module so the
high level modules chore and program
depend on the lower level ones meaning I
couldn't just change out how the say
logger works because that would break
chore which and break our program does
so yes if we depend specifically on that
specific class so that's the dependency
that we have these high level modules
depend on the low level modules and
that's what di is saying we have to
invert okay we have to have
have a Changes story so that the low
leveled modules depend on the
higher-level modules and in fact it's
saying that both should depend on
abstractions now there's a couple ways
of doing abstractions but the simplest
way and the only been doing a lot
throughout this series on solid is with
an interface and an interface works
doubly well in this case because the
fact the second part of the description
of what di is it says that both the high
and low level modules should depend on
abstractions and those abstractions
should not depend on details meaning
those abstractions shouldn't have to
know about how things get done they
should just say these are the things
that will get done that's a really clear
interface and so interfaces are a clear
way of doing di well now let's start our
transition to a DI type system by first
working on this person class it's really
easy one it's a simple one
if I just right-click on the person and
do quick actions and refactorings and
say that I want to extract an interface
called AI person and I want all four
properties that's great there you go
really simple I now have a interface
called
AI person so now what we could do in
theory you might think we come back over
here instead of saying person here we
could say AI person and now it's a panel
interface right yes yes it is now I did
break chore so let's fix that real quick
before you go on where we say it's
actually an AI person so and email
sender see how and I have a change
everything now because everything is is
tied to the person
class and that's a dependency we want to
kind of break we want to invert that now
I have made this now and I think that
should be about it if I build that that
should probably build and did with no
errors so I've now gotten interphase the
person but here's the deal I'm still
depending on the person class I haven't
really inverted the dependencies because
this high-level module still depends on
the very specific person class even
though I'm assigning it to an interface
instance or an interface variable and
that's a problem because I'm still
having to have that dependency at this
high level module which is what di is
saying I shouldn't have in fact whenever
you see yourself doing new so new person
nooch or a new logger new email er all
these are tightly coupled dependencies
on lower-level modules that's we're
trying to break we're trying to break
those dependencies on those lower-level
modules and instead work off interfaces
so what we do is have some way of not
having to say new person now this is
going to this is going to start covering
territory that gets into a different di
and so we're calling de pen see in
version di but I'll probably lot of you
have heard about dependency injection in
fact a logical get confused on the D in
solid thinking is dependency injection
and it's not it's a different thing
dependency inversion is the principle
dependency injection is one of the ways
you make the principle work it's not the
only way there's other ways as well but
it's probably the most common
way and it's the way that I would
encourage you go but for the sake of
this video for a sake of clarity I am
NOT gonna cover to pan C injection in
this video I'm gonna do it in a one
coming up very shortly but I want to
cover just dependency inversion because
I don't want those two things to be
associated too tightly together in your
mind there's other ways of going about
this depending on your situation with
that being said this is where it's going
to get a little trickier or a little
muddy if we're not careful so they'd be
very clear here at some point you have
to new up an instance so it's going to
be that somewhere in your application
but with here and here and all over the
place that's a problem
so what dependency inversion expects is
that you will centralize that into one
place that you can easily swap things
out and so what we're going to do for
simplicity sake is we're going to create
one class in console UI which is the
opposite of I normally do I don't
usually put classes here but I'm going
to for this demo I'm gonna put one class
here I'm gonna call it my let's call
Factory like a public static class and
what its job is going to be is to new up
instances when I need them see one place
that has all the dependencies so I will
make a public static person create
person
yeah bring in the using thing for that
and I will just return a new person now
sometimes a fact early hassle more
complicated Matt but this is a very very
simple place in a very very simple
example we're going to do here public
static chore public static well and
here's where we actually need to change
this to an I person and will have to
have an ID chore as well so let's it's
actually wait on that I'll comment it
out for now let's go to the chore and
create our interface for it as well
looks good does everything we need to do
I'll save that and return a ID Shore now
I can do that right away because when I
create that interface and also assign
that interface to the chore class which
is a really handy little little step
there
now before I create one for email or
what's let's create it but actually
we're going to rename pretty much
everything so let's create it instead of
ie mailer I
I message sender I'll rename that and
let's say send message okay
and now if we come back over to email
our we have email or is an I message
sender we have send message I use that
that rename in the interface to rename
this as well and the reason why I did
that is because maybe I want to send a
different message via text message or a
message through the database or
something like that well I can do that
now because it's more generic as a
message sender now longer is pretty much
a logger I mean you can have different
things that doesn't logger
but still do the same basic action of
logging therefore this interface will
work great so I'll be an ilogger they'll
have a log good to go go back to the
factory and we'll create those last two
whoops I'll logger create new logger and
a public static I'm message sender
returns new for it now and new email er
okay so what I done here well I've
create a static class that news up but
if for different types of class
instances that I need to have and I have
accessed this now at the very top level
at programmed ICS so now when I need
something like a new person
let's go ahead and comment this out for
right now so I'll just comment it out
instead of doing
yes new person I can say factory dot
create person and now I can just do
owner dot first and all the rest
so let's uncomment this again and I will
do owner dot first-name and yes it's
going to be only quit a bit until I get
this all the commas train are
transitioned over into semicolons okay
so there we go so now I have called this
factory dot create person that's the
same thing with this new chore so
instead of chore it's going to be an H
or and we're going to say instead of new
chore we're going to say factory dot
create chore and again we ready to the
same exact thing here we're going to do
chore dot short name and chore dot owner
and make the semicolons okay so nothing
else at this level has changed
okay so we've just gone interfaces
instead of the actual implementations
and to get our implementation we have
called the factor to get for us so now
let's go through the rest of our
application and extract out the places
where we have a or we have a new and
change that over okay so let's start
with our our logger has nothing it just
logs that's great
our emailer has nothing it just logs or
writes the console so that's great
and our person as well has nothing so we
just have to go look at the chore class
now a short class has a owner which is
the I person that's fine but we have as
new logger now we could do is have this
call the factory but that would then
create a dependency that I don't want I
want that high level to just give me
what I need so what I'm going to do is
actually create a constructor for my
chore class so ctor I'm gonna say give
me an eye logger let's call this log or
logger loggers fine and also I want a
emailer which is an eye message sender
let's call it message sender anthalie we
pass these in as a constructor then I
can do is create private variables so
I'll create a a logger underscore logger
why the underscore and an iMessage
sender on ask or message sender and then
in our constructor we can say underscore
logger equals logger and underscore
message sender equals message sender so
now we have two interfaces passed in at
our constructor level what does that do
for us well instead of mooing up a
logger
we just instead of saying logger or
create log I should delete that and we
say underscore blogger dot log we the
same thing here so underscore log or log
and for here we say underscore message
whoops underscore not + honor score
message sender dot send message so what
have we done well we passed in two
interfaces into our chore class we use
those two interfaces to then make calls
to both send a message and also to log a
message so there are no more newing up
of class instances except in that one
factory class
now it's yelling us here because it's
saying hey I don't have the parameters I
need which is not a problem because we
actually have access to the things we
need in this class in this Factory we
can pass in a first we need a logger so
create logger and we also need a message
sender so create message sender ok so
we're going to pass a new logger
instance and new email email or instance
into our chore class so what happens now
well now there are no more dependencies
except at the very top level I have to
actually ask for that factory dot create
person everything else is taken care of
for us by the factory so now if I run
this as you can see nothing has changed
ok so I didn't break anything everything
still works the same way except let's
look at our application where do we have
a new instance or a newing up something
nowhere except factory right why is this
new for us well it disconnects us from
everything so that if we came along and
say you know what I want to create a new
class instead of emailing It's Made
texting so I'm going to create a new
class so we'll add that
new class we'll call this the texting
class not testing texting class well
it's called text or since we have email
a texter public class texture which
implements the eye message sender will
implement that instead exception we're
going to say let's go a dollar sign a
couple of double quotes and in here we
will say I am texting person dot first
name to say message okay so now we're
going to know that it's texting this
first person to say this instead of
emailing so instead of sending that
seemingly guys sending an email to this
person we're going texting one more note
it still says ie mailer in the clap and
the actual file name the even those
iMessage sender let's change that little
details are important okay so now it's
it's very clear what that is okay so we
haven't changed I think yet and in fact
let's run us again it still says
simulating sending an email to Tim I am
Tim Cory but what if I come to this
Factory and change this from emailer to
texture and I run it again I am texting
Tim to say the chore take-out-the-trash
is complete you see how my application
changed it changed immediately with
nothing broken I have to worry about
breaking anything because I have no
direct dependencies I depend only on the
abstractions not the
commentation so let's talk with those
benefits of doing it this way and the
first one I just pointed out is the fact
that we can make a change to our
application in one piece where we
replace say emailing with texting and
nothing breaks we swap out that part and
everything still works the way it used
to because we did not depend directly on
that instantiation remember I changed
the person to an i person and I broke
the chore in sense I had to go to chores
and fix that and all the rest that is
broken now I don't have to do that
broken in a good way I don't have to
worry about that because if I swap out
this create person into the person class
maybe they have an employee class
instead no problem as long as it still
has the same contract we're good to go
so that's benefit number one benefit
number two kind of links into that and
that is now my application is not this
one big monolithic application it's a
bunch of really little parts and this is
where solid really takes us as a whole
is it takes us into having lots of
really tiny little parts things that do
only one thing things that don't have
dependencies things that are just
self-contained tiny and against an
interface so that I can unplug and plug
in something new without problems so for
example if I look at the longer class
and I say okay I need make a change here
to do something different no problem I'm
making one little change to one little
piece of the application I don't have to
worry about the implications the rest of
my application as long as I still
fulfill its contract and of course as
long as they don't change the logic in a
way that the application was expecting
or rather wasn't expected
okay so it does allow me to really just
work on this piece rather than this
project or this solution just this
little piece and it kind of breaks it
down so that I can make small changes
and tweak my application without having
big issues to concern myself with I
imagine if I had to change its
application this is a small one but
imagine if I had to change this
application before when I started to say
nope it's an employee class now I have
to changed multiple places just to make
that work and then to make sure that I'm
breaking anything in those multiple
places now I don't have to the another
thing it does this is a third benefit
third major benefit to allowing this or
doing this and that is I'm now set up
for dependency injection remember I said
essence dependency inversion but the
dependency injection is the
implementation of this principle or one
of the implementations as principal and
so what depends the injection does is it
takes away the need to do this
that create that factor that create
person or the actually creation of the
factory dependency injection what it
does is when it comes across a class
like sure it looks and sees oh the
constructor has it says it needs two
classes no problem I'll go get those
classes and it goes and gets them for
you so it kind of handles all that stuff
for you
and along with di or dependency
injection actually also comes the
ability to have ioc or inversion of
control which again is more of a talking
about how this principle applies but
also a lot of ioc containers will allow
you to not only have depends the
injection which is where it finds these
items here and replaces them with the
actual instances but also the fact that
it can dynamically change those ends
scissor get different ones to panic
either circumstances or once you provide
it for example I use a tool called MEF
in the past
that's the managed extensibility
framework and it's what Visual Studio
was based on and if you notice Visual
Studio has this ability to add things to
menus and it kind of plug in extra stuff
right individuals to do well how does
that work well what they do is we have a
tool called math where it actually has
again depants the injection but it goes
and looks for certain dll's and says do
you have more things I could add to my
di pool so it's kind of having this
right here but you a tool goes out and
actually looks for DLL with more of
these and says oh you have three more
loggers I can add and so it brings those
three as well so there's some fun stuff
you can do and that's kind of a guess
benefit number four is that once you
have this dependency inversion you also
have the ability to have de penser
injection but also the ability to then
inject dependencies from other sources
in a plug-in type framework or a really
dynamic application style now that's way
down the road that's way on the
complicated or endgame type levels but
even if you didn't do any of that even
if you didn't even do depends the
injection and you say you know what I'm
just gonna do this factory thing that's
all I'm going to do your create my
factory cool if you do this then you
have an application that's disconnected
from each other where nothing depends
directly on either the higher level or
the lower level classes and instead
everything depends on interfaces and
that means you can swap out parts as
needed to upgrade your application
that's huge
and this is a the next benefit is not
only can you swap these things out but
benefit number five is you can unit test
this thing that's huge
we looked at unit testing all ray a
little bit on my channel we're gonna go
into it in further detail and soon
because once you understand how to do
this then you can unit test all this
stuff without affecting anything
let's firm it think that look remember
back at this application before we had
this injection of these interfaces
before he had any interface we had new
everything up if I was going to create a
unit test where I create a new chore
instance I added the chore name and the
owner and then I said I want to test to
make sure that the complete chore works
every time I ran that test it would have
nude up nude up a logger instance which
would have written to a log file or
written to a logging database whatever
it did and also new up a message
instance an email a user that's a
problem I mean I might run my unit test
50 times in a day well if I did that I
don't want my inbox filled up with 50
emails and I don't want my log files
filled up with a whole bunch of tests
either so that's just not a good idea
but because we're so tightly bound to
the new email ER and new logger that I
couldn't separate this out there for the
complete shore method was untestable
so was the performed work method for the
same reason so therefore I couldn't
really test this class hardly at all now
since I passing in an ilogger
and a I message sender I could create my
own class instance that would
apply this ilogger insta interface and
what would do is just say yep I logged
it and yep I emailed it and that could
pass those in to my chore instance
instead of the real ones now I can test
the complete chore and just make sure it
called my loggers log method and also my
send message my message senders send
message okay so I can check those things
now I can test those things without
having to actually affect real data
without writing real log messages
without really sending emails may you
may think man has something an awful lot
of work creating new class instances and
they can't really implement the contract
and all the rest and yeah that would be
if it had to do it manually but I don't
it's a thing called mocking and we'll
get into that but essentially what it
does is allows me to create really quick
implementations of any interface that
pretend to work so I can test to make
sure that my real code which is this
this chore class these two methods here
we perform work and complete chore that
could test to make sure those do their
what they're supposed to now you might
think yeah but you couldn't test then
the logger because a longer probably
writes to a log file well guess what
instead of actually passing in an actual
log file we're going to try and pass
that in as an interface as well so there
there's a lot of ways we can go down
that rabbit hole but essentially when
you think about it if you ever see a new
somewhere you've got tight coupling we
don't want tight coupling we want loose
coupling we want talk to just interfaces
and so if we do that from top to bottom
or from bottom to top either way if we
do that through our entire application
then we can break up our application
into little pieces we can test each
piece we can replace it
peace and we can use something like a
dependency injection framework to
actually assign actual instances to each
of those interfaces so that's what the
dependency inversion principle is all
about the idea that we don't have new
anywhere in our code that the program
DCs does not depend on chore and or
person and that chore doesn't depend on
the logger or the emailer instead
everything is disconnected so that's it
that's all dependency inversion
principle talks about is just that
disconnecting and everything talking to
interfaces all right I hope that you've
understood this I hope that you can
grasp the concept got to tell you what
if you can implement especially this but
really all the solid principles they're
really great and if you implement all
them together they kind of form this one
larger way of thinking about
applications where your applications
become more disconnected to become
easier to maintain an easier test and
easier to work with down the road you're
going to thank yourself if you do that
because your applications always gonna
need to be upgraded think of this way
what if your boss comes tomorrow to you
and says that big huge application you
work on for you know the past six years
I know it runs on sequel right now we
need to run Oracle if you had properly
implanted solid not a big deal and it's
not it's not tiny but comparatively yes
it is because if you haven't if my solid
you got calls to sequel everywhere think
of that he said you know what we're
going to change out our logging
framework from say a log for net to end
log and you go
well sure but that's gonna take us
probably touching every piece of code
and testing it and it's gonna take you
know six months to do and he says you
had a weekend
that would be awful but with
implementing solid properly you go
weekend sure I can have it done the next
three hours because I've only change it
in one place I'm only changing a few
methods and since I'm writing against
interfaces no problem
I asked matched I create a new class for
end log and I write I to a same
interface and implement it within log
and just say here's how it works instead
and I'm done everything still works as
long as you test that one small new
class secret you're good to go
so that's why the power of solid the
idea that evidence is connected
everything's replaceable everything is
modular so you don't have one large car
to replace you can just replace a spark
plug or you can replace just the hub cap
or the wheel all right so that's that's
why I'm so so much with a fan of solid
and why I wanna make it as clear as
possible because once you get it
it really makes you code better and
that's again coming back to that are you
doing it right when writing code and if
you are implementing solid you're much
closer to doing it right so that's it
let me know you think in the comments
below if anything was confusing I'd love
to hear about it and I will be doing
follow-up videos on other principles
because there's more than just solid out
there for design principles so we're
