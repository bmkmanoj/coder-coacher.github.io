start to finish today we're going to get
our scenario and start our initial
planning of the project so let's jump
right in
before we get started in the lesson I
want to remind you to subscribe to this
channel if you are subscribed click the
little bell icon make sure you're
getting the alerts when I add a new
video
and while you check on that could you
also give us video like I know that
we're just getting started but liking a
video is a simple way that you can make
this course more popular and that helps
everyone it increases the visibility of
my videos on YouTube which generates
more income for me it helps others out
because they get introduced to this
valuable content and it helps you out
because I'm able to produce more free
videos ok so let's get back to the
lesson so here's our scenario we had a
friend come to us and say I want you to
create a tournament tracker we've got
its office pool and we want to play each
other in a way they can determine who is
the best so we're going to create a
bracket system and we're going to add a
computer tell us who to play in a single
elimination-style bracket so at the end
the winner should come out on top the
purse is won all the games so the model
is the NCAA basketball tournament
bracket for March Madness so that's the
basic scenario that our friend comes to
us with and that isn't enough to start
the application but it's enough for us
to start planning the first place you
should always start is with requirements
then you may say I understand what the
application is I should just start
figuring out how the codes going to work
that's really the first rookie mistake
that you'll make is the idea of I know
the application should do so I should
start by coding and really we're going
to put off coding for about 5 or 6
lessons and the reason why is because if
we set a good foundation now it'll make
coding so much easier and we'll have
less bugs so trust me this is important
so let's start off the requirements and
kind of flesh out what we've been given
so far
so so far we know we attract games plate
and their outcome so who won so imagine
you have four players playing and we'll
have two games played and the winners of
those two games play each other and then
that winner would be the winner the
overall bracket that's how we're gonna
do where I track those games have been
played and their outcome so we know who
once we know who goes to the next round
we're also going to have multiple
competitors I mean that sounds obvious
but you really need to have it down on
paper next we're gonna create a
tournament plan who plays in what order
it's not that we're given a list of
who's going to play we have to determine
who gets to play and win and then we
have scheduled games how we schedule
games that's not been specified but we
not only have to have some kind of list
of these are the people to play in what
order we do know that single loss
eliminates a player from the tournament
we also know that the last person
standing as the winner so after all the
games have been played we should have
one person left standing at the end
that's the winner and that's really all
the requirements we've we've built so
far there's not a whole lot more to it
yet which means that the next thing we
should do is ask a set of questions we
need to find out what the full
requirements are because here's a deal
any project whether this is a personal
project a project for a friend or a
project at work there are always more
requirements than what I've specified
your friend is not trying to hide
information from you but they have an
idea in their mind and they don't always
fully communicate it in fact they never
fully communicate and so you have to
kind of pull out what those requirements
are and also what the things they really
don't care about so let's go through and
I'm going to give you my list of
questions that I have out of this
scenario let's start with question 1 how
many players will turn a handle is it
variable so it's not so much been
specified they said we wanted to a
tournament you know we want to have a
number
people play but if it's a fixed number
of people that's important now the NCAA
tournament is a fixed number of teams
it's 68 teams actually the brackets 64
but they put four more on so they have a
fixed bracket but I'm thinking maybe
this might not be a fixed bracket but we
don't know for sure we need to make sure
by asking the question number two if a
tournament has less than a full
complement of players how we handle it
for example if in my previous example I
said you know four players play then the
two winners those games play each other
and that final winners that is the
overall winner but what happens if we
had three players how do we do that or
in the case of the the NCAA bracket what
had they had 67 teams or 63 teams again
I have an idea of how they can handle
this most tournaments like this have the
idea of a club by which means that
certain teams don't play in the first
round instead what happens is they have
a first round by it's called where they
get free pass so they automatically get
put into the next round
now we can explain more how that work if
that's we're thinking we're going to do
but again this comes back to
requirements maybe they come back and
say you know you know what we're always
going to have the correct or the full
number of players if you're not familiar
brackets what that would be is a
multiple of two so two people we work
for people at work eight 16 32 64 128
and so on numbers outside of that could
cause a problem unless we've prepared
ourselves for how or to handle it or
just say we don't allow it number three
should the ordering of who played each
other be random or ordered by input
order this is another key thing to think
about when we're looking at who plays
who may be the tournament organisers
want to put that in some kind of order
or maybe some randomize it I would think
we'd want to randomize it but we really
need to ask number four so you scheduled
a game or they just play whenever so
here's the idea if we have say two
first round do we just say you play them
whenever you want to play them and when
both of them played then we do the next
round or do you say the first game is
played at 9:30 a.m. on Friday and the
second game is played at 9:30 a.m. on a
Monday we have to understand what
they're envisioning for a system alright
next if the games are scheduled has a
system know when a scheduled games for
do we say the game to 20 minutes long
and we're going to start at this time in
N word done a tournament or do we say
here's the open available time slots we
have and the games are this long fill up
where you can and then continue a day
after day until the turn is done how is
that work with that question is only
valid if we're going to schedule games
okay so that's the first five but guess
what I have more questions if the games
are play whenever can gain from the
second round be played before the first
rounds complete okay so this won't work
real well my example of two games in the
first round one key no second round but
what if we had a pre round you know with
a true first round is four games and
then the next round is two games and
around that is one game so in that case
if two of those four games are played
already and those two winners happen to
be playing each other the next round
can they go ahead and do round two
before the other four teams play each
other to determine who plays the other
game in that second round we got to
figure that out in order to know what we
can allow people to do and now if it
will do if they can play ever again if
we're going to schedule the games this
doesn't matter
next question does the system need to
store a score of some kind or just who
won so this is what I'm thinking maybe I
have more than just you won or you lost
maybe we want to have some kind of
information about what the score was
maybe for it you know more prizes at the
end say you know highest point
differential or closest win or luckiest
player you know something like that
or just to have here's all this course
do you want to store that or not all
right question eight
what type of front-end system half is
that there's a form like a wind form
application is it a website or webpage
is it a phone app of some kind for those
of you that want to jump right into
coding that'd be your first hurdle is we
never really specified and the
temptation is rookie mistake number two
which is assumptions as a huge mistake
don't ever assume if you don't have to
if we just jump in started coding we
have to assume what type of front-end it
is or we have to ask the question what
you are doing here it's just we're being
intentional about it instead of the UPS
we have to find out more information
next question where is the data going to
be stored that's really important to
know we're going to generate a lot of
data we're assuming and again it's an
assumption we're assuming that the
application won't be running the entire
tournament maybe it will maybe won't
store any data but that question will
spark that thought in the mind of the
owner the person who asked for this
project also known as a stakeholder and
we'll call that person stakeholder from
now on so the person that that wods this
tournament tracker created is our
stakeholder and they would know do you
love story and either tell us where they
want it stored or say can you help me
determine where to store it but that
question will generate that conversation
all right next question will this system
handle entry fees prizes or other
payoffs usually when you have a
tournament you have some type of reward
now may that reward is just hey you won
but maybe is something more substantial
for example if every player paid $10
then the winner could have say half of
the the overall income from the
tournament so eight players in the
tournament they each pay $10 winner
takes $40 the second-place person takes
$20 and we can go on down from there so
the question is are you going to do that
we're going to add entry fees or you
have prizes we could have prizes without
entry fees would you have entry fees
without prizes we
have other payoffs but the important
thing here is we ask the question all
right so that's question number 10 we're
done right now we got even more
questions okay next question what type
of reporting is needed we're going to
win this tournament the person to go
through and win this tournament do we
tell them a one do they just know do we
have some type of scorecard or do we let
everyone know here's a result of the
tournament what we tell them like it's
just Bob one or is it the results of
round one or in and here's the wins and
losses with the scores willing you know
so that's that's that questions pretty
broad question but again it's the spark
that conversation that needs to happen
who can fill in the result of a game or
you'll allow anybody to say who won who
lost are we going to lock it down - you
can only report on your game or you can
only report your score or the
administrator does everything and isn't
allow anybody to touch anything what's
this going to be like next question are
there varying levels of access and that
kind of goes along with question 12 but
or athle here is do we have some people
who can do certain things or see certain
things and others that have more access
we have to have someone who has
administrator access the ability to
create a tournament and then also to
enter information but do you want to
have a user that can just see the
tournament maybe want a view that's just
the read-only view that'd be a varying
level of access so we need that or is it
just that whoever uses the application
can see and do everything number
fourteen should this system contact
users about upcoming games now think
about it how would you know that you're
out playing a game how do you know that
we're always through or mostly through
round one and your games up next we have
to let them know somehow maybe the turn
administer just let everybody know
manually that seems counterintuitive
especially since we're creating an
application right now and this is
probably one of those questions that
your friend doesn't even have thought
about yet
they haven't thought oh how yell at they
will no Bay's want to create a
tournament tracker so this question is
probably going to spark a discussion of
what's possible what's available and
from that you can kind of flesh out more
of these requirements or maybe more the
features that are nice to have or would
like to have in the future but aren't
really necessary for now and the last
question I came up with is each player
on their own or contains uses Turner
tracker so for example if this was a
doubles tennis tournament there's not as
one person there's two people on doubles
team so we're going to record that or it
adjust the team captain or the random
person who came in first that we put
team in their name that's a question
that could be asked my thought is again
they use it the example of the NCAA
basketball tournament the March Madness
bracket well a basketball team isn't
just one person it would be all 12
people are all at least the five
starters okay we're talking up probably
an office situation or group of friends
so maybe it's not you know 12 people to
a team but maybe it's a three-on-three
basketball tournament in which case a
team of three or maybe it's just a
ping-pong tournament and each person is
on their own so the question is can this
tournament tracker handle both should it
handle both do you why to handle Bowl or
are we saying that going to lock into a
certain Avenue a certain type of setup
and that believe it or not is all the
questions that I came up with now are
there more that I could probably ask
probably I'm sure that as we get into
this application we're going to find out
all we should ask that I want to go back
to the stake holder but those are the
questions that I camp with I thought you
know these are the things that I'd ask
right away up front to get some clarity
on how its application should be built
and what general direction I need to go
now and this is probably multiple times
throughout this course but don't stress
out about a half-day perfect here but do
work hard to get as much as possible
upfront the more you have up front the
more likely it is that you set yourself
up for success down the road and with
that we're done with all the questions
and we're also done with less than one
we've gone over the requirements you
kind of asked those questions to expand
the requirements to what we need to know
in order to get started now coming up
next in lesson two we're going to do
that call overview planning which is
we'll have the information back from the
questions that we asked and then we'll
start taking a look at what does that
mean to the application and the end
we'll have a good general direction for
where we should take this application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
