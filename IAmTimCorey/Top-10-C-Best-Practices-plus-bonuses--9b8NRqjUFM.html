top 10 best practices for c-sharp
developers now these are things that I
do on a consistent basis to make my code
better now I've got a lot more than 10
best practices but I think that if you
master these 10 you'll set yourself up
for success on the other hand if you
ignore these best practices you will
almost assuredly get into trouble in
fact when students approach with a
broken application the most likely cause
for their issue has to do with not
filing one of these best practices
before it started though I want you know
to stick around till the end when I
built this list I actually identified
two more best practices they're very
important they are a bit different
though so I've added them on as bonus
best practices so let's jump right in
with best practice number one name
things well here I have the new product
window which will actually create both
the product and the solution you get
this by us hitting the new project
button here now in here by default the
name of the project is console
application eight and the solution name
is console application eight those are
horrible names and the reason why is
because you don't understand what that
really does so for example what's the
difference between console application
eight and console application six you
just don't know and so instead we need a
name this something more intelligent so
I start with the project name let's call
this console UI now what does that
project name tell us what it tells us
this is the console part of the
application and that it's a user
interface now does it tell us what that
user interface does not really we know
it's a console we don't know what it
does so for example it's not the
guestbook console user interface but in
this case we're doing a demo and so we
don't have a real specific purpose for
our application so I can call that
console UI in fact console UI can be a
fine name for it if you like good naming
is hard to do but I encourage you to
take the time to really think
what's your piece or whatever you're
going to be developing is going to do in
this case it's our project and so what's
our project gonna do and start thinking
that through and develop a name out of
that that makes sense
next is our solution name and a solution
name really should not match our project
name one of the most basic reasons why
you shouldn't do that is because then
you don't know what's the solution
versus what's the project two different
things shouldn't have the same name I
know Microsoft defaulted this way I I
wish they wouldn't but because they do
we have to make sure that we pay
attention and change the solution name
in this case and I call this solution
c-sharp best practices and also notice
my naming convention I'm using what's
called Pascal keys here which means that
every word gets a capital letter
so c-sharp best and practices so CSB P
that's a great naming convention that
most people seem to use in the industry
and it's also encouraged with Microsoft
and what we do we use Pascal casing for
our project names our solution names our
class names our file names and most
other things the only thing we don't use
pascal casing for is our variables and
our parameters and we'll look at that a
minute and there are of course other
little exceptions but we talked about in
general now the other end note here is I
did not say c-sharp and put the the hash
tag of pound sign here like that and
that is identifies one more thing you
should do in naming and that is you
shouldn't include special characters or
spaces in some instances they will allow
you to put spaces in there and not throw
an error but just avoid it because it
will cause some headaches down the road
that you just weren't
so no spaces no special characters avoid
numbers if at all possible try and use
words instead there are cases where
numbers are appropriate I wouldn't lead
with numbers and try to avoid numbers in
general so that's solution naming and
project naming I'll hit OK
and now notice that Microsoft uses these
same naming conventions with a capital
first letter for each of their class
names their namespace names and their
method names will see more naming as we
go I'll point out as we do some naming
but that's pretty much wraps up the
naming but before we go I want to add
one more project to our solution and
this time to a class library again I
will name it well in this case I
actually named it library at the end and
the reason why is because it's a class
library and so my personal convention
this is not one that is necessarily best
practice but it's it a good idea at
least think through my personal
convention is to add library on the end
of every class library and here's the
reason for that if I go into console UI
and add a reference to this helper
library the project's solution helper
library
I will only check this box here to add
that reference if the name includes
library you see it doesn't say in here
anywhere this is a class library it just
says here's one of the projects in your
solution so if I were to do is in
Reverse the wrong way and add a
reference in my class library to my
console application which is something
you shouldn't do but if I were to do
that it says console UI now that UI
tells me it's a user interface I don't
add references to user interfaces
therefore
the wrong place and I had canceled so if
I'm in the right place for references in
the console you I had a reference it
says library I know it's just a double
check to make sure that I know this is a
class library the other thing I note is
when I created that class library it
automatically create a class for me
called class one now I really dislike
that Microsoft does this we don't need
to have a default class in here
especially not one named class one
whenever you see a one at the end of a
name your first instinct should be to
make sure you get it out of your
application so in this case instead of
trying to rename this I just delete it
and the reason why is because if there's
ever a problem with which way I rename
it I don't want to end up with a file
name called class one even if the class
itself is something different or any
other weird issues therefore whenever I
create a class library I delete class
one and that's the basics for naming my
second best practice is to add one class
per file let's look at what I mean over
here in the helper library if I right
click and say add class let's add the
person class I like a public now this
file here person dot CS holds the person
class but what if I wanted to add
another class let's say the ghast class
I could say public class guest putting
the guest class here is possible this is
fine as far as c-sharp goes it's valid
code but if you look over here on their
right where does the guest class reside
you can't really find it now you can
argue well but this makes sense for me
because but here is what I would
encourage for a best
just don't do this instead create a new
class file for every class so now you
have a public class guest once an egg
apology a public class guest in the
guest file now just by looking at the
file structure we know that the person
class resides in the person file and the
guest class resides in the guest file
this also illustrates one of our naming
best practices again notice that I call
this guest a singular and person that's
also singular that is because this class
represents one instance of a person so
for example if this class had a first
name and a last name value that was
storing per person each instance would
represent one person so Tim quarry would
be one instance of that class whereas
Joe Smith would be a separate instance
of that class
therefore the class name is singular so
we have good naming conventions and we
have one class per file let's move on to
best practice number three use
properties not public variables let's
take a look at our person class we have
open here if we want this class to store
data and when I expose that data to the
outside world we want to create a
property now I use this snippet prop
brop and tab twice to create an auto
property
this is the proper way to create a
variable type object that will present
data outside this class so for example
if we're in the program CS project and
we were just say person let's add the
using statement there so person first
user equals new person first user dot
first name equals
Tim we're now using that property now if
you wanted to you could say public
string last name that is a public
variable if you want back we're at
program dot CS and said first user dot
last name notice first of all that the
first name has a little wrench next to
it whereas last name has that little
blue square next to it because these two
are different the first name is a
property the last name is a public
variable now you can use these in a
similar manner and some instances you
couldn't tell a difference between a two
in how you use them however this is not
a good practice do not use public
variables the entire explanation of why
is the bad thing is outside scope of
this video however I can tell you there
are instances where you'll run into
where you can't use a public variable
the way you want to instead you need to
create a public property
so now first name and last name are both
public properties and also takes care of
the basics of our person class all right
best practice number four methods should
do one thing the key there is they
should do one thing and one thing only
let's go back to our example and move
over to program CS and let's scope out
what this program should actually do
it's going to wipe out our test data
from our previous example let's cope how
this program is supposed to do it's
going to start by capturing a number of
users let's go of people's capture a
number of people's names and then and
loop through and say hide them so it's
first going to capture a bunch of names
and then next it's going to loop through
each name and say hide them really
simple stuff but that's the overall goal
of this program and in fact let's put
these comments let's move these up here
instead
and we'll also fix that formatting
now it is a sample application so it's
not going to do a whole lot of
real-world stuff but instead it's just a
demo to show we could do with it now the
temptation here is to put all the code
inside static void main in fact let's
just kind of demo that so first let's
create a list of person I'll call it
people and again back to our naming for
a minute this is a variable it's a
private variable and so I name it using
camel case and camel case says that the
first letter the first word is lowercase
but every word after that the first
letter is capitalized so for example if
I had two words here say people who I
like that would be how would be written
now since it's only one word it's all
lowercase
also note that it's plural people as in
more than one and the reason for this is
because this variable is a list of type
person zero or more people next let's
add a couple of sample records now
typically this is where you actually
capture the people's information but
we're going to beginning stages of
building this application and so you
want to have sample data in there try
things out so let's just go ahead and
create some sample data so people dot
add new person
and we'll just copy that row a couple
times and there we go we've had three
people to our list next we'll create our
for each loop and we're going to say
let's just do a console.writeline that
says hello person that first name space
person dot last name and so it's going
to happen with that is we're going to
first create the list of people add the
people to the list and then loop through
each person to list and say hello and
their full name of course just
completeness consul don't rely on the
end so that the application can pause
and let's see what's on the screen and
let's again this is the bad way of doing
things to the poor example but let's go
ahead and demonstrate what this would
look like so hit start and it says hello
Tim Corrie hello Sue Storm and hello
Jill Jones
but I said this is the Badly of doing
things the poor way of doing things and
why is that well again our best practice
is that methods should do one thing and
one thing only
well this static void main right here is
a method
what's its job well right now it's job
is to create a list and people the list
loop three person say hello to each
person and then pause the operation that
seems like more than one job so let's
refactor this in order to make it a
little easier to work with and also so
that this static void main only has one
job and that job will be to quarterback
the application you see the console
application static void main is where we
start and where you finish meaning the
application starts by calling static
void main one static void main is done
the application closes so its job is
just run the application and so what
we're going to do is take out any tasks
or pieces that don't align with that
just running the application let's start
here with this list of person let's
actually take this out of here and put
it above and we'll actually be specific
here and say private so this is a
private list of person called people but
it lives at this level it lives the same
level as static void main only to make a
static as well so now we have our list
outside of static void main declared so
that any method can call this people
list and use a people list well what
methods need to call that well let's
create a new method for these three rows
right here
let's call this private static void
meaning we only want people to call this
that are inside this same class program
this is we do for all of our methods
instead of a console application void
means it returns nothing and we'll call
it set up sample theta and this goes
back again to our naming we keep coming
back to the naming best practice notice
I call this setup sample data now what
do you think the method called set up
sample data does well it sets up sample
data in this case these are the three
sample records we'll put them there and
now up here we can call set up sample
data next let's get rid of this loop
here so let's create a private static
void I'll call this greet all the people
again why you think this does well it's
going to greet each person so we'll take
this for each and put it down here and
then up here you will say greet all the
people so now our static void main is
just the quarterback
it calls methods until it's done calling
methods and then it says okay paused let
you see things and we're done so that's
its job the setup sample data method has
one job setup sample data the greet all
the people method has one job loop
through the people and greet them now
this is a simplistic example but notice
how easy it is to read what static void
main does set up sample create the
people done and then look at each method
and see how simple each of these are
they're very very simplistic because
they have one job and they do it well
when you break things down as it may
seem simple it may seem silly but the
reality is it makes for much easier to
read code which makes it much easier to
debug also note that right now I'm using
sample data well I won't be using sample
data all the time in the future I will
capture user information so instead of
deleting this code or commenting it out
I just comment out this method and now
it's no longer being called I can call a
new methods called ask for people
information or something like that but
then if I want to test this application
maybe I found a bug and I don't want to
go through and add all the data in order
to populate it in order to then try out
the bug all thing to do is come back
here and say let's use a sample data
again it makes it very easy to switch
from debug mode into a production mode
just comment or uncomment a method and
you have or don't have your sample data
and this example really leads into the
next couple of best practices so let's
look at best practice number six that's
practice number six is keep it simple
and what I mean by that is you really
shouldn't write complex code in fact if
you find code that's really really
complex and you think man is really cool
pause for a minute think it through is
there an easier simpler way of
accomplishing the same task so for
example in this code here I could have
had all the code inside static void main
like I used to that was a little more
complex because you had to read all
those lines of code to figure out what's
happening in the application whereas now
it's very simple to know what each piece
does let's look down here as well down
here I'm using a four
each well if for each is a very very
simple statement it says for each person
in the people list that's pretty
understandable whereas you could say for
I equals 0 I is less than people dot
count an i plus plus and then do a
console.writeline say hello people I
first name space people I last name like
so this right here and this right here
are really the same thing the difference
is that this one down here is a lot more
complex
I'm creating a new variable I'm counting
on making sure it's less than the count
because the count is zero based and so
if you have three items in the array
it's 0 1 2 therefore if the count is 3
then really we have to go less than 3
because the 1 says 3 isn't actually 3
it's a 4th one
give the complexity okay try to figure
out which place here in the array all
this kind of stuff is complex there's an
easier way of doing this that's simpler
it's also easier to read what's even
worse is when people get these great
ideas on how to make this for loop even
cooler for example saying things like I
is people dot count minus 1 and where I
is greater than or equal to 0 instead of
I plus plus is I'm is - guess what that
would work too it actually count through
the array backwards or through the list
backwards but guess what that's even
more complex we don't want to do that if
at all possible
let's stick with the very simplistic and
easy to use for each so there's there's
simplicity in making small methods that
do one thing and it's also simplicity in
what you choose to use or not use and I
get this question a lot from new
beginners in software development they
asked me questions that are really
questions that only a a senior level
developer should even be thinking about
a simple example might be they ask me
about abstract classes and they might
say well how do I use an abstract class
and generally my advice is why are you
even asking because typically if you're
asking about abstract class it's because
you read about it or learned about it in
some type of type of tutorial but you
have no clue why it's even useful and it
is good to learn about these things and
learn their usefulness but that really
isn't something you need to do until
after you've mastered a lot more topics
my advice is master the basics because
the reality is the basics are what
you're going to need to use most of the
time the complexity that somebody's
larger or broader topics bring in like
abstract classes or virtual interfaces
the complexity they bring in often
doesn't help you and sometimes it really
hurts the readability to
understandability of what's going on in
your code so for the sake of the next
person who's going to read your code try
and keep it as simple as possible it
makes it much easier to understand and
much easier to debug the next best
practice is number seven be consistent
this is one that often gets
misunderstood the first part of
consistency is doing things the same way
you always do them for example down here
I have a for each and I said var person
in people I could have said
person person and people either one
works so if I was going to do another
for each loop
I wouldn't say person like so now
obviously I wouldn't have to 4-h loops
right after each other to do the same
thing but notice how this one uses var
and this one uses person that's an
inconsistency if I'm going to do it one
way I'm going to do that same way
each time the same is true for how I
name things for example helper library
well if I am going to add new class
library I will call it something library
I won't call it something code file
because I establish that I always name
my class libraries with an extension of
library so that's the first part of
consistency and programming especially
in c-sharp is all about attention to
detail so that's one of those details
that really help in the process and the
reason why is the best practice is
because that way it's much easier to
visually spot an issue if something is
different that normally is you can look
at that and see why is this different
and may identify a problem but the other
part of consistency is conforming to it
ever standard you are working with so
for example if you're working in a
company where you're working on an
existing application you may love my
idea of this library being the end name
of any class library but if your company
already has three class libraries and
each of them ends in code bin that you
can't you shouldn't name your class
library with a ending of library you
should name it with the ending of code
bin now sure that's not what I recommend
if you're starting out fresh but if
you're working an existing system you
need to pattern your code off of the set
standard for the rest of the code
so as consistency first in how you do
things doing it the same way every time
but then part of that consistency is
doing the things the same way that the
rest of your team does and so sometimes
you actually do things in a way that's
quote/unquote worse then what you know
you could do and that's actually better
and it sounds wrong but really fitting
in with a current code base is more
important than forcing your way or your
style in the new parts now that being
said I do say that if you can enact
change it's a good thing so for example
if you can say hey I've looked at our
coding standards and these things bother
me or these things should be I think
should be different if the whole team
gets on board with that that's something
you can work to evolve your codebase to
take into account but don't just blindly
make your own choices and say well I'm
following best practices because you're
not so be consistent but be consistent
inside your organization or your code
group now as next best practice is going
to ruffle some feathers number eight is
use curly braces for if statements and
what I mean by that well let's let's
take this example here actually I cut
this out for now and I'm going to say if
person dot first-name equals Tim
I'll paste it back in and say instead of
hello Tim quarry I'm going to say hello
mr. Corey I could say else just use the
regular hello first space last name so
hello is through store more load Jill
Jones now notice that I don't have any
curly braces after my if or my else
this is accepted practice in a lot of
areas the idea is that if you don't have
curly braces the next line and only the
next line is attached to that item so
for example this line right here is
attached to the if whereas this line is
attached to the else
so if person dot first-name equals Tim
we're going to say hello mr. Corey
otherwise we're going to say hello Sue
Storm or hello Jill Jones now here's the
problem with this and this is where it
really bugs me especially when you're
first starting out but even later if you
decide you know what I want to say
something else - Tim wears a Hello mr.
Corey and then the next line we're going
to say how you doing
typically you think well I'm going to
say how are you doing now you may notice
that the indentation is weird and you
say well I'll just go ahead and tab that
the eat if you don't doesn't really
matter notice is red squiggly here it
actually tells me expected a closing
curly brace and if I were to run this I
have build errors and let's what those
errors are curly brace except expected
well even if it put one there that's not
like a help me because it still says
I've got something else expected because
I just closed the for each and that's
not right so what's the problem here
well the problem is that this is no
longer associated with the if statement
it will always run
in fact if we didn't have this else
statement here we'd have no error and
let's run this
hello mr. Cory how are you doing how are
you doing how you doing I have three how
are you doing I have three people why is
that well because if the person's first
name is Tim I say hello mr. Cory at
first line but this next line isn't
associated with the if statement it runs
every time therefore I ask everyone how
doing including Tim Sue and Jill if I
had curly braces it'd be very easy to
understand that I'm only asking Tim how
am i checking to him and if it is Tim
that I ask I say how are you doing
so I do that I only get hello much to
Cory how are you doing once because the
other two Sue and Jill don't get asked
how they're doing
with curry races is very easy to
understand what the scope is of that
particular statement now you may say
well I only have one line and that's
true but maybe tomorrow you want to add
that second that second line in and I
know this there's some controversy I
know some people really love having that
one-liner with no curly braces in there
my thing is this it doesn't hurt
anything
now I know it's a little less typing to
do it the one-liner way but here's a
thought
use a snippet I have tab twice look what
happened
it gave me not only my parens but also
my curly braces in fact if I were to say
person dot first name double equals Tim
and I hit enter now my cursor is even
between those curly braces and so I
didn't have to type without anyways so
my encouragement to you is to use the
curly braces for every if statement
don't try and shortcut it and do the
one-liners again these aren't
requirements these are best practices in
fact these are my best practices it's
definitely an opinion our next best
practice is number nine concatenating
strings with dollar sign so what I mean
by this well I've already demoed it once
here and what this does is it takes the
this part of the string hello mr. in
space and then it adds in using these
curly braces it adds in a piece of
c-sharp code so all of this gets joined
into one string because I put a dollar
sign in front of the double quotes a
different way of doing this let's do
this right above I could have said
double quotes hello mr. space and double
quotes plus person dot last name
and that is functionally equivalent as
far as the outcome at least with this
the difference is the memory consumption
that this takes versus this this right
here is an efficient process this right
here is a very inefficient process
whenever you're talking about adding
strings together my encouragement is if
it's all in one line so for example if
you were going to say string test equals
hello
space plus person dot first name plus
space plus person dot last name plus
excellent exclamation point like that if
you're doing some of this we are
building a string in all in one line or
in a couple lines and then you are
splitting that back out or using that my
encouragement is instead to do the
dollar sign methodology so string better
test equals dollar sign deep we'll hit
double quotes then you semicolon just to
complete that line then come back and
say hello space curly brace person that
first name pretty race closed space
curly brace person dot last name close
curly brace and then exclamation point
now first of all this is a little easier
to read but it's also more efficient
than this is now we used to use string
dot format we still can but this dollar
sign method has really taken over the
string dot formats place it's just
really easy to do it's really efficient
the other part though strings being
efficient or inefficient is in loops
let's just create a private static void
string demo method this is just for demo
personal purposes let's say we're going
to create a string we call it just ass
not a great name but it's good for demo
we'll start it off with this empty
string and then we have this for loop
where we're going to say that let's go
to 100,000 so this is obviously a
contrived example but in this example
we're going to loop through a hundred
thousand times and add to string just a
simple high hill plus space the end of
it will say it's going to say hi hi hi
hi hi a hundred thousand times this will
be horribly inefficient just to prove
this let's just do a console.writeline
where we say date time dot now dot -
long time string now this is not the
most efficient way of timing your
methods is just for demonstration
purposes but if we were to run this so
let's go ahead and put this method up
here now actually even comment out my
other methods just so we're doing a good
test
I'll call that let's make sure you have
everything taken care of it's going to
write out the start time and it's going
to write out the end time in between
we're going to do this for loop where we
append something to s if you rerun this
and still thinking there we go
it took approximately six seconds now in
computer terms that's forever especially
since this application is very very
simple it doesn't do a whole lot now so
you may say well this s equals s plus is
private problem instead we could say
plus equals and that does something very
similar it takes the value of s adds hi
to it and stores that that new value
back into s it's the same rule same
basic thing if we were run this it's
still about six seconds so that wasn't
the problem so instead if you're going
through a loop like this the better
practice if it's very very large now if
you're going through a loop of five
things eight things this prize isn't
worth it but if you're not sure or if
the loop might get larger use a string
builder a string builder now go into all
the details of string builder but
basically it's a instantiated class and
so you say string builder the name
equals new string builder and then here
instead of doing an hour plus equals you
would say SB dot append hi now this is
going to take hi and append it to our
string our string will look the exact
same as this s variable would have
looked now the only difference of string
builder is when you want to be an actual
string you have to say dot two string so
if down here I want to say SB dot two
string in order to get the string
equivalent
but we're not printing out we're just
storing it let's run this application if
you catch that same exact time let's
just show off let's do a million so 10
times as many as this method right here
10 times as many it still doesn't show a
difference in our start and end time so
whereas this method will have taken
approximately a minute probably this
method still does it within the same
second and we keep going adding zeros on
here and I'll tell you a while before
you see any difference there's a little
bit of a difference there with 10
million let's do a hundred million okay
so a hundred million it took two seconds
that as compared to a hundred thousand
taking three times as long so as you can
see how you deal with strings and adding
strings together is important in the
case of just adding a string together
for one line use the dollar sign
methodology if you're going to do a loop
where as a number of strings you add
together like this as example instead
use a string builder and that will make
your application much more efficient and
the last of our top 10 best practices
for c-sharp is avoid global variables
I'm not only going to demo this but
basically the idea is that when you
first start out you think man I have to
have this information everywhere and so
you make everything global meaning you
allow everyone to see your variable
across all different classes and
programs because you think well I need
to I need for the person cloudlet guest
class to see my list of person called
people and really the answer is no you
don't if the guest class for whatever
reason need to see a list that was
somewhere else you can pass that list
along it will even pass efficiently so
if you get tempted to
a global variable think of how you can
do a different way now there's some
times you say well but I have certain
setup information for example where my
text files are that I store log
information in that kind of information
needs to be accessible across the entire
application well in that kind of case
you would use the app config file and
store information in here there's two
reasons for that one is everywhere has
access to this file and two you can
change this file at runtime meaning you
don't have to recompile your application
to change the values here now the bonus
here is that this information doesn't
live in memory see if you have a lot of
global variables you clog up a lot of
memory that really isn't necessary you
need to adopt the idea of just in time
meaning I don't worry about information
until just when I need it and then I ask
for it I get it I use it I throw it away
that's how Microsoft deals with all of
our variables for example this variable
s right here if I were to be using this
and let's just uncommon stew pretend
like I am let's take out a few zeros
just in case I accidentally run this if
I were to use this variable here by the
time we get to here that variable is
gone Microsoft had said we declare it
right here we use it in this for loop
but by the time are done for loop we
don't use it again therefore I can get
rid of it at this point in the code
right here line 48 might that's very
efficient about that kind of thing so if
we create a public variable a global
variable that everyone can see the whole
application can use Microsoft can't get
rid of it therefore it stays in memory
and clogs things up now before we go on
there are some of you I they're going
nuts right now you've probably yell at
your screen and saying you missed one I
went through the entire top ten list and
didn't do number five so let's get back
to number five number five is use the
public modifier
only when necessary and this actually
ties into our global variables idea
notice here on my methods I have private
static void set up sample data private
static void string dental method why are
these methods private well because
there's no need for them to be public
what's the difference well a public
method can be seen by other classes
outside of this class right here if I
make them private only this class can
access them well as no need to set up
sample data for this class outside of
this class
therefore it's private and what I'd
encourage is you think a private first
mindset the idea that by default you
make everything private and then only
change things the public when you say
yep
I need to have access to that outside of
this class for example in the person
class we have this property first name
and it's been called last name well we'd
have access to these properties outside
of the person class therefore they're
public so those are my top 10 best
practices for c-sharp developers number
one name things well
number two use one class per file number
three use properties not public
variables number four methods should do
only one thing number five but when we
skipped use public modifiers only when
necessary number six keep it simple
number seven be consistent number eight
use those curly braces for if statements
number nine concatenate strings using
that dollar sign method and number ten
avoid global variables but wait don't
forget I've got two more they're really
bonus best practices and these two
aren't really code related necessarily
but I find that they're very very
important in our first bonus best
is never trust the user I know that
sounds pessimistic I know it sounds
antagonistic but trust me don't trust
them if you ask a user for their age you
will expect back a number so if you ask
a person for their age and they say 21
you expect the number to 1 but some
users and not all of them but there will
be a user they will type out twe and T Y
space o ne now that's a number and
that's their H but it's not a numeric
value they've given you back it's a
string that represents a numeric value
so if you were expecting a number back
in you're going to be disappointed
this is the type of information that
blows up projects if you trust that the
users are going to give you good input
you will only test your application
using good input instead to build your
application as though the users are out
to get you and try to figure out what
they might do that's unexpected and then
make sure your application can handle it
so that's bonus best practice number one
never trust the user and the second
bonus best practice is plan before you
build whenever I demo a full application
where I build out from start to finish a
project and I've got one coming up soon
for this channel but whenever I do that
I spend a lot of time at the very
beginning laying out the plan now I know
your first instinct is to start coding
in fact that's often my first instinct I
look at a project and I say ooh I know
how to do that or I know how to do most
of that or I know how to do this part of
that and so I'll go off and start
writing code the problem is that you
back yourself into a corner
if you don't plan before you build I'm a
certified project manager it's one of
the things that I am and the project
management guide the guide that tells
project managers how to manage a project
in general has this layout for the five
major steps of a project and those major
steps are initialization and then
planning executing monitoring and then
wrapping up or closing the project so
onto those five major areas the first
one is just saying things up or you know
getting the initial requirements but
then number two is planning under that
the project management guide lays out 21
steps that have to happen before you can
move to the next phase which is actual
execution of the plan so 21 steps have
to happen before you execute when you
execute there are only seven steps now
you see that relationship as private
managers we've learned that in planning
you make the project easier this is
doubly so when it comes to writing code
if you just start writing code you will
not think through all of the different
areas in my start-to-finish
projects or demos I go through the five
steps of planning before we even start
writing code before you open up visual
studio we go through the five steps of
planning and if you want to see that in
more depth I would say subscribe to this
channel but also get on my mailing list
and you'll link down below in the
description to get on a mailing list
because on the mailing list
you'll get first-hand updates of when
new things come out and one the new
things that's coming out really soon is
my start to finish mini course for
YouTube and in that I go through
developing application from an idea all
the way through to a fully working
application and in there we'll go over
those five steps to plan out your
application these are the same five
steps I use in my day job these are the
five same steps that I've used for years
because they're that important and of
all the best practices in this entire
video the one that's most important the
one that I would encourage you if you
take away one thing it's this plan
before you build so that's it that's my
top ten they're a bonus too and like I
said these are only the top ten I have a
lot more best practices but these the
top ten I look back at all the time so I
have a question for you which best
practices do you think should we add
this list or which ones do you think man
that one really helps me out go ahead
and leave a comment down below and let
me know I love to start a discussion on
that also don't forget to subscribe if
you haven't already and make sure you
get on that mailing list and I really
push that mailing list not because I
want to spam you in fact I really try
hard not to send any more emails than is
absolutely necessary but what I do is I
give out bonuses every once in a while
to my subscribers to my email
subscribers one of the upcoming bonuses
is that when I release that
start-to-finish course I'm also going to
be giving away or releasing a bonus
package along with it and that bonus
package will allow you to download the
videos it will give you a companion
guide and a whole bunch of other fun
stuff now that's gonna be a small cost
but if you're on my mailing list you'll
get a discount so just make sure you
keep an eye on that make sure you sign
up and also start the dialogue via email
if you have questions if you have
suggestions for new videos please let me
know that's all for this video I hope it
was helpful for you and as always I am
