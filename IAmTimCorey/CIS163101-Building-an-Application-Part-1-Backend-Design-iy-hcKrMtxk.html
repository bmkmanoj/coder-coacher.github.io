of an application and by back end I mean
the classes that contain the information
we need to work with now what we're
going to do is we're going to take a set
of requirements that our boss has given
us and translate those into code design
now when we talk about designing an
application the first place you go
should not be Visual Studio even though
this is a c-sharp application instead
we're going to spend our time today in
Microsoft Word in Microsoft Excel this
is where the foundation of our
application gets built in real life when
you work at a company your boss may come
to you and say here are a set of
requirements go ahead and build me this
application and that's what we're
simulating here so our boss has come to
us and said I need some sort of meeting
journal that can track information about
the meetings that I have coming up and
also keep track of the meetings I've
already had and what they were about I
also want to keep track of who I met
with and who I'm meeting with and some
basic information about them now I've
taken those requirements and put them
into fairly clear language as three
requirements in the real world you don't
usually get requirements this clear but
I've gone ahead and said that this is
how we're going to work to build our
application I don't want to start from
an unclear or the set of requirements so
I've given you very very clear
requirements that way we don't muddy the
process so let's look at this set of
requirements and figure out what
we need to do well the first step that I
like to do is break out the different
pieces that I need the different data
pieces
because really this application is built
upon data it's built upon creating data
viewing data and modifying data we want
to create a media appointments we want
to look at those appointments we want to
modify those appointments change those
appointments and also create complete
appointments so let's go ahead and start
going through our requirements in
breaking out those pieces of data
requirement number one says keep track
of who I meet with when I meet with them
how long I meet with them and what that
meeting was about
well let's create a class called meeting
that seems reasonable in this meeting
class when you attract bits of
information well who I meet with that
sounds like a person so we could say
well it's probably a string you know
just their name but if we peek ahead a
requirement three we know that we need
to keep track of their basic contact
information as well that sounds more
like a class we the class holds multiple
pieces of data in one object so it
sounds like a class called me person so
let's create a class called person or
imagine we have a class called person
and we'll call this person met with okay
now that's a new class so let's go ahead
and create a placeholder for that called
you know this is the new person class
but instead of filling that person class
out we're gonna come back here and
complete
one the person class is important
information but it's not currently
relevant we don't really care what's in
the person class at this point because
we are working on requirement one not
requirement three and that's an
important point to keep a hold of is in
order to keep on track
you should only focus on doing the one
thing you're working on that doesn't
mean you ignore things that come up that
aren't directly relevant what you need
to do though is in some way make a note
of those things and move on so for
example I'm keeping track of who I meet
with and I assumed that be a person but
maybe that would be people too it
doesn't really say and who is kind of
hard to determine does that mean who was
in which person or who as in which
guests or which which invitees so I'm
gonna put that on my questions list I
say something like are all meetings on
one or are there sometimes multiple
invitees okay so that's a question I
have but again it's important
information but not currently relevant
because I'm still working on requirement
number one I can move on and come back
to that at a later point so when I meet
with them well when is a point in time
what variable is best for holding a
point in time well that would be a
variable of type date/time date/time
specifies both a date and a time for an
event now you can ignore the time
portion or you can ignore the date
portion if you want to capture just Pete
a part of it but in this case we want to
capture both the D and the time of the
event so date time and we're going to
call this mean time okay now the next
thing is how long well how long is
talking about the meeting and that's
kind of subjective because we could be
saying well how long in hours one hour
half an hour two hours eight hours we
could be saying how long in terms of
minutes 30 minutes 60 minutes 90 minutes
120 minutes or it could be saying well
you know how many days for a multi-day
retreat for example and so that could be
an integer the trick though is what are
we going to track in there we got a trek
minutes well that works great for a lot
of situations half hours 30 minutes an
hour is 60 minutes but gets a little
unruly when you're talking about an 8
hour or a 12 hour appointment or even
that's that five-day retreat or two-day
retreat that's a long time so we could
say well let's do hours but that gets a
little unruly we're talking about small
numbers for example a 10 minute
appointment how do you show that
well it's 1/6 of an hour well that's a
little ugly on the other side how about
a five-day retreat well that's you know
120 hours well that's the little ugly so
you say well let's do days then yeah but
that makes it even worse for that 10
minute appointment
and so we're we're getting a little
confused as to which the best number of
store when there is another way we say
how long well if we captured the end
time then we could figure out later that
we want to see hours or mins or days and
we can do those calculations at that
time because we have all the data so
instead of saying how long let's change
that to when does it end or when is it
scheduled end and so let's go ahead and
put a date time and call it meet meeting
end time now before we move on we see
that meeting time and meeting end time
gets a little confusing
let's change this to meeting start time
these variable names and even really
these types are fluid don't feel like
you have to have the perfect name for
the perfect variable type right away
sometimes it's better just to put it
down on paper or put it down
electronically and look at it and say
that just isn't right and tweak it it's
better to get something down and change
it later then not put anything on a page
and get stuck so let's look at
requirement r1 are we done well we're
tracking who we met with when how long
is handled by the start time and end
time but this what the meeting was about
isn't covered yet so let's go ahead and
put some meeting notes in and that
should probably be a string
and that covers requirement 1 in that
case we move on we're done so required
number 2 says keep track of my upcoming
meetings so the first thing that you'd
probably think is okay so let's create a
new class and we'll call it upcoming
meetings but real quick what pieces of
information do we need well we need who
were the who where I need to meet with
so that would be person met with and
we'll leave off a variable types from
now we need to know when the meeting is
going to occur may mean start time we
know when the means going to end
you know from three o'clock to four
o'clock whatever it is and we probably
need to anything else when you capture
probably not now let's compare this with
our first class one of the things to be
careful of as a programmer is not to
create very very similar classes if one
class can do both jobs the reason why
you don't want to create very very
similar classes is because if you put
logic in one and you may find yourself
me to put logic in the other one that's
the same then you're rating two methods
they're the same but down the road you
find out there's a bug in that logic I
have change it well if you change it in
one but not the other you have this
weird case where some things work and
some things don't it just creates a mess
down the road and it creates a whole
bunch of code you don't need so whenever
possible look to consolidate as long as
it makes sense
don't sacrifice the functionality of
your code because you're trying to shove
everything into one bucket that's not a
wise idea but in this case meeting and
up come meeting seemed to be about the
same the difference is this meeting
notes wouldn't be filled in before the
meeting necessarily now you might say
well yeah but sometimes you want to have
notes about what that means give me
about true and so that's a question I
could ask do we need me know it's about
upcoming meetings okay
a move on but in the meantime we say you
know what these two classes are the same
or close to it
so I'm gonna go ahead and delete this
class and use the meeting class for both
aapki meetings and also means they've
already occurred
so now you've we accomplished
requirement number two requirement
number three says keep information on
the people I meet with well that's the
person class we've already got that
class started it's just blank so keep
information about the people I meet with
including basic contact information this
is where knowing the context of the
application really helps the the
application is not about having this
appointment book I'm sorry it's not
about having a contact list in our
playbook the focus is the appointments
the meetings and so what we probably
need out of the person is their first
name last name and then basic contact
information would be the email address
the phone number and
that's probably it this is just basic
information to get a hold of the person
first and last name and email address
obviously there's strings phone number
while it's you know it has number in the
name fit not really a number because we
store things like the parentheses around
the area code we sort of dash between
the three digits and the four digits and
we try and keep that formatting you know
consistent throughout our database so
that's also a string but the question is
well do we need more information like
between address well that's an asked the
boss so let's go ahead and say
so I've asked this question do we need
more information about the user
addresses additional phone numbers
additional email addresses you know
because this email address and this
phone number they could actually a list
of email address list of string for
email address and a list of string for
phone number if you wanted to have
multiple email addresses or multiple
phone numbers for the user I don't think
we need that but you know what it's
better not to assume assumptions are
what kill applications the requirements
were not clear so instead of assuming we
know and then disappointing the end user
which may be our boss and disappoint our
boss is never a good thing instead of
doing that we go ahead and write a
question that will go ahead and ask our
boss at the appropriate time so now
we've we've met requirement three in
reality we're done with the initial
design but before we sign off that's
design I want to step back and actually
look at and say are we missing something
and this is where you know long term
development you know develop multiple
times we've done this a hundred times or
more this is where that helps but the
other thing that helps here is having
similar things to look at for example
where else do we come across the idea of
capturing meeting information you know
what other applications capture meeting
information well if you think about it
you know if you use Microsoft Outlook
they have a whole section for calendar
information and meetings and meeting
requests you know if you um google gmail
user they have been a requests you know
a non dental list it goes you know
whatever your your business or
or school or you know personal email
system is or your phone even there's
applications that capture meeting
information take a peek at those
applications and look at the data they
capture and then look at your
application and say what am I missing
you know for example let's look at this
meeting and say well what does Outlook
have that I don't have well one of the
things outlook has is it captures who is
attending who has said I'm not going to
attend and who said I might attend we're
not capturing that so let's ask the boss
if he wants us to capture that
okay and you know another thing that
outlook has is the idea of a meeting
title we don't have a meeting title we
have notes about the meeting you know
maybe for and definitely after but we
don't have that short you know 50 100
character title
we also not capturing where the meeting
is going to occur
and it could go on from here but I think
you get the point
if you look at what outlook does or
again and the other applications and you
start looking at the data they capture
and then look at your list you can see
the question is to ask and instead of
assuming you know put those questions on
a list and let the boss the person that
requests into this application let them
figure out whether or not they want to
capture that information
so we've now generated a list of
questions about our meeting what about
our person well same thing goes here you
know your phone has contact information
the same goes with Outlook again with
contact information or Gmail or and the
list goes on pull up one of those those
contact forms and again look through
what they capture they capture multiple
addresses multiple email addresses
multiple phone numbers they capture a
note section or the person you know and
so those may become questions in our
case we're going to skip that step for a
person because we know that the person
needs just very very simple and we have
already asked the question about making
it a little more complex so with that
being said now is a good time to go meet
with the boss we have our compiled list
of questions we're done meeting the
basic requirements in our rough draft of
our back-end application now I can go to
him or her and ask the intelligent
questions to get the answers to flesh
out our application so we go over the
boss and answer questions and I'm going
to go ahead and simulate the boss
answering these questions
okay so now we have got our answers to
our questions and if you know what this
is done is it actually created more
requirements so let's go ahead and
translate the answers to these questions
into requirements
okay so now I have added three new
requirements based upon the answers to
our questions so now our design is
incomplete because we have not met all
the requirements we've met requirements
one through three already but these new
requirements have not yet been met so
let's go ahead and review them meeting
should capture one or more attendees
besides the boss was assumed so we have
this person met with but now we need to
capture multiple people possibly well
this person now becomes a list of person
there a list can store zero or more of a
given type in this case a given type of
person and let's go ahead and change
this name two people met with okay that
takes care of requirement for now note
since I was creating requirements I went
ahead and put one requirement per line
as opposed to this multiple requirements
per line requirement that just makes it
easier for me as a programmer to make
sure that I check that box off and don't
miss a piece of the requirement so
requirement under five says up payin
meetings should have a place to put
notes for discussion well we're using
this meeting for both upcoming meetings
and also for meetings they've already
occurred so we already have a notes
section so without doing anything
we now meet requirement over 5 and then
requirement number six says meetings
should have titles well let's go ahead
and put a title in there
and now you've met the requirements
again if we didn't generate any new
questions and we haven't then at this
point the backend design of our
application is done and ready to be
coated right now we have our two c-sharp
classes pretty simple but at the same
time we thought through our requirements
we made sure that we expanded on the
requirements based upon the boss's
answers to our intelligent and pointed
questions and we have met all those
requirements based upon just those two
classes now we're ready to start coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
