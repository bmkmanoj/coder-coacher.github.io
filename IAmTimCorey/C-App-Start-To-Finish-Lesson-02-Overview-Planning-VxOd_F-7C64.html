c-sharp from start-to-finish course my
name is Tim quarry and today we're
looking at the overview planning the big
idea or a big picture of our application
kind of laying out just foundation of it
really this should be a pretty easy day
except for one thing we've got first
review those 15 questions we asked so
we're going to simulate like I went out
and talked to our stakeholders but
people to ask to the application and
said what do you want here's these 15
questions I have what are the answers so
of course I ask myself because I'm also
a stakeholder in this demo but let's go
right into question number one and look
at the answer before you get started in
the lesson I'm going to remind you that
if you'd like to get all of these
lessons right away plus all these other
bonuses click the link below in the
description to purchase this course for
just $67 and when you're considering
that don't forget to hit the thumbs up
in this video I'd really appreciate it
ok so let's get back to the lesson so
the question is how many players will a
tournament handle is it variable and the
answer is the application should be able
to handle a variable number of players
in the tournament pretty straightforward
basically what they're saying is we
don't know how many players we in the
tournament could be 2 could be 4 could
be 14 16 whatever question number two if
a tournament has less than the full
complement of players how do we handle
it so the idea here is a 14 person
tournament well 14 is not divided evenly
the ideal will be 16 in that case so how
we do that well a turn less than the
perfect number should add byes in
basically certain people are selected at
random and to keep them there at random
to get to skip the first round and act
as if they've won so need to figure how
to do random assignment of bias question
number three should the ordering of who
plays each other be random or ordered by
the input order
and the ordering of a tournament should
be random so when again we're not going
to take in players and say he came in
first you get the first slot she came in
second you get a second slot that's not
how we're going to do it we're not
randomize once all the players are in
the list question number four she's
scheduled two games or they play
whenever and the games we played in
whatever order and whenever the player
wants to play them so that answers that
question for us it also is going to
answer one of the follow-up questions
and that is question or five if a games
are scheduled how does the system know
when it scheduled games for well we're
not going to schedule it therefore we
don't care
question number six but if the games are
played whenever cannon gained from the
second round we played before the first
rounds complete nope each round to be
fully completed before a next round is
displayed if there are four games in the
first round if the first two games are
played and done that will determine the
next rounds one of the games but those
two teams can't play each other until
after the other two games are played in
the current round question number seven
does a system need to store a score of
some kind or just who won and it's a
little more variable from our
stakeholders they're saying store a
simple score be nice just a number for
each player that way a tracker can be
flexible enough to handle a checkers
tournament where the winner would have a
one as in they won and losers have a
zero mean a loss or a basketball
tournament where the score might be 110
to 95 so question number eight this is a
big one
what type of front-end to system half is
the windows form web page and phone app
and the answer came back as it should be
a desktop system but here's a keyword
for now but down the road our
stakeholders might want to turn it into
an app or a website now what the answer
is question really
means is we have a short-term solution
which is a windows forms application but
we have to keep in mind the long-term
possible goal of moving this to a
different user interface platform so we
should be designing our application with
that long-term goal in mind while still
living for today so we'll probably push
a lot of our code into a DLL or some
type of storage where we can disconnect
the user interface easily and put a new
one on all right let's keep going and
when I kind of wrap up at the end with
with all this information in our head
now we can start looking at how to put
it all together so keep keep these key
details in mind you might even want to
take notes question number nine where
will it data be stored well ideally the
data tree started Microsoft sequel
database but please put an option to
store in the text file instead so the
what the stakeholder is I would love to
say we're going to have a sequel server
but there might be instances where we
don't have that luxury and so I want to
fall back plan something it's simple
that we know we're going to have which
would be a text file so have to write
our data access logic in such a way that
it either stores to a database or to a
text file or maybe it stores the bulk we
have a backup system
we'll see question number 10 will this
system handle entry fees prizes or other
payoffs now before I go into the answer
let me talk real-world because this
application is designed this whole
process I'm trying to get as close to
real world as possible in the real world
answer will probably be
that first sentence yes now as a
developer you should look at that and
say man is that not helpful
and that's true but sometimes you ask
questions and the users just don't
understand how to communicate back to
you what you really need so in this case
they see the will this system do X and
their thought is a yes or no question in
this case yes but we're really asking is
will this system handle it and how will
it do it or what will it do
what will it handle maybe a better way
of saying is question would be if this
system handles entry fees prizes or
payouts
how will it handle it what will it what
part of those will handle some we can
draw out a user more of an answer now in
this case I've simulated the idea of I
went back as the developer went back to
the stakeholder and say okay you say yes
what does that look like so that would
be the rest of this quest the answer so
that answer is the tournament should
have the option of charging entry fee
prizes should also be an option and
that's where the administer you get to
choose how much money is awarded to a
variable number of places meaning it
could be first place only at the first
and second place first second third
place and so on and so forth the total
cash amount should not exceed the income
of the tournament so if a tournament
takes in $100
you can't award $1000 and it is also the
thought of having a percentage based
system and that's a nicety
that would look something like where you
award the first place player fifty
percent of the overall take so is a
tournament brings in a hundred dollars
first place gets fifty but the term it
takes in fifty dollars the first place
is twenty-five that way it is dependent
on how a tournament does we began to
remember these tournaments in theory
could be less than full so in a 16
player tournament we may only have ten
players which means that we have six
people not paying those six by weeks or
by players in that case if you were
basing your cash prizes on a $160 income
ten dollars per person you would only
bring in $100 that'll be a problem
now notice that it doesn't say we have
to divide up everything to the winners
one use case this could be where we do
some kind of fundraising today we're
going to you know kind of a 50/50
drawing or something like that where
we're going to have this tournament
we're anticipating bringing in $200 the
the top prizes and get $50 second place
can get 25 and a third place is also you
get 25 and then so that's half the money
and the other half would go towards Toys
for Tots or or whatever so we could do
that in this existing system or could
divide everything up or the tournament
owner that guys running at him it could
just be taking his cut so he says I'll
give out half of the overall income of
the tournament I'll plot the other half
as my fee for Ryan a tournament who
knows it's important
think through those ideas but we don't
have to go so far down the rabbit hole
there are whole application changes we
should just think through would this fit
these different scenarios that are
possible or probable and we're not sure
and something will change our
application we should talk to our
stakeholders all right question number
11 what type of reporting is needed well
the answer is a simple report specifying
the outcome of games per round as well
as a report that specifies who won and
how much they want I'm assuming at the
how much they won who won would be at
the end of the overall tournament these
reports can be just displayed on a form
or they can be emailed to tournament
competitors and the administrator so the
idea is we don't have a full robust
reporting system with PDFs and layouts
and all the rest of stuff instead we
have is either we just display our form
and say here's the daily status or we
could be emailing the competitors and
the administrator these updates you know
the the round report as well as the end
report of who won how much all right
question 12 who can fill in the results
of a game
the answer is great for us it makes it
simple anyone using the application
should be able to fill in the game
scores that means we don't have to have
us varying level of access or have this
whole way of creating users to use our
system and having passwords and all the
rest we just to say if you're using the
application you have rights to and of
course the nice
question is are there varying levels of
access and the answer we know because
we're allowing everyone to do everything
but here's a kicker we could say that
competitors or the administrator could
say competitors are not allowed into the
application instead they do everything
via email now remember this is a desktop
application this could reside on the
administrator's desktop and not anybody
else's which means that if they'll have
access to the desktop of the
administrator they don't have access to
the tournament which is actually kind of
a two-level system one level just gets
emails the other level is the one that
has full control so in theory it could
be we wouldn't call it a two-level
system just because we're not doing any
kind of varying level access inside the
application all right question number 14
should this system contact users about
upcoming games and the answer is yes the
system should email users that's with a
third fourth time an email has come up
we're going to have to make sure we know
how to send and reversibly send emails
from the system so if I were taking
notes that'd be a big one I write down
star underline and put a big arrow to
make sure you know how to do email so
the system should email users there due
to playing around as well as who is
scheduled to play so every player who's
actually playing the current round will
get an email saying you know you're
playing game number three it's tim
versus bob and that's probably probably
about it maybe some details that the
administrator sets up about options or
Landwehr those kind of things but this
is going to be a an email goes out
automatically and not manually so
we can't have Gennaro herb sorry we
can't have specific answers to where and
when but instead we get to rely on
generic options or generic text to tell
them that finally question 15 is each
player on their own or canteens use this
tournament tracker and the answer is the
termit tracker should be able to handle
the addition of other members all
members tree tree is equal in that they
can all get terming emails teams should
also be able to name their team so the
idea here is we're not going to pick a
team captain we're not going to it all
information goes through one person if
you're in a five person team all five
people get the same email saying here's
your game this week or this round also
we're going to call that team something
you really don't want refer to a team as
Tim Bob Sue and Mary's team you're going
to refer to it as team snicker bars
whatever that's actually probably more
information than a steak hole or Mele
would give you unless they're really in
tune with how to give information to
developers but I simulate here the idea
of me I went back and forth a couple
times play fine and give us full answer
again the real world is kind of messy
and communication is a very difficult
thing to do well the key here is to
learn to ask better and better questions
so that users understand what you need
and also to go back and get more
information and more information kind of
really dig deep on your general question
or your first question in order to get
the information you really need
so those are the answers to the 15
questions that we had so now we have the
initial requirements and we have the
answers to our 15 questions which really
give us more requirements and so now we
can move on to the big picture design
the big picture design is where we look
back at a high level or application and
say okay what should this in general
look like he's an example if we were to
design a picture to draw a picture of a
ocean with sunset over it the big
picture idea for that would be we're
going to need some some tan force and
we're going to need some some blues and
some greens for the ocean the sky we're
going to need some red suicide and
probably have some birds in there and
maybe some washed-up flotsam on the eye
make sure that's a big picture look at
that painting there's a whole lot more
detail to go into it in the future but
for right now that gives you a good
rough outline of this is what kind of
time do in the same way with our
application we're going to develop that
that big picture view that doesn't get
really specific on anything but it gives
us those initial guardrails or
boundaries for how we're going to design
its application the first broad
brushstroke of our application is a
structure in our case the structure is
going to be a windows forms application
and a class library and I point that out
whenever I build an application I try
very hard to put all my my code or leaf
line models into a class library but I
want to point out very clearly here
because we have to think back and say oh
wait the windows forms application
should not be our complete application
because
we want to take that off at some point
and put something different on top if we
have all of our code behind the forms
that's not going to work now it's not
great application design anyway but I
want to specify here just to make sure
that we have that brushstroke in place
okay the next one is data in that case
we're going to look at sequel and or a
text file for storing information what
that data looks like or how it's been
designed or if we use one text file or
20 all those questions we're not going
to answer here that'll be when we dive
deeper later but for now we just know we
need sequel and text file storage
next is users and what this represents
is who's going to use our application
and win in our case is very very simple
it's awesome one at a time on one
application we're not looking to have 50
users using different applications at
all point to the back to the same sequel
database or text file we don't have 18
different levels of security and all its
authentication system going on we just
have one user at one time on one
application so that's the broad overview
of our application it seems very very
simplistic but it's actually really
important that you identify this because
it puts some boundaries around you now
those boundaries are pretty broad you
can do a lot inside these but what it
does do is it keeps you from saying well
maybe I should make this user interface
a web application nope it's a Windows
forms application well maybe I should
just go ahead and design an app now nope
windows form application well maybe I
should just store that the information
in memory now
OBE sequel and text file see all those
questions you might think down the road
or might start wandering down the path
you can say nope these are my boundaries
and we will make these boundaries even
tighter as we go but for right now it's
a great place for us to start before we
start laying out our more detailed plan
now the other thing I like to do at this
point is identify the big concepts in
this application that I might not know
everything about so let's look at these
key concepts for our application email
how do we email from c-sharp I'm going
to have to figure that out at some point
so they keep that back of my mind maybe
I should learn about that before I go on
or maybe I should do some research and
do a trial app to make sure I understand
how to do that and the best way of doing
that is in our case you don't have to do
this kind of stuff because we're gonna
walk through it as we go and I do know
how to do concepts but again I just want
to simulate the idea of real world in
the real world this is exactly what I do
identify my key concepts and I say I'm
going to build a small dental
application to make sure I understand
this not to have the code than to plop
in later but to have the idea of how it
works so that my design takes those kind
of things into account
all right so emails one sequel it's
pretty important to know how to access
our data next is when you might have
missed that's custom events and the
reason I said do we need to understand
custom events is because I started
thinking about the application I'm still
in big picture wrote here but I'm
thinking when one game
is complete and it's the last game in
the round how are you going to know to
check to make sure there's no more games
how do I know if there are no more games
to move the next round and how you going
to know to trigger those emails that go
out saying here is the overview of round
one here's what happened and that's
sound an awful lot like custom events
and so I say you know what I think it's
custom event I'm not going to lock into
that right now but I probably should at
least learn a little bit about them so I
know how to use them if I need to the
bonus here is if you learn a little bit
about them and kind of brush up on them
even if you knew something before but
here's kind of rusty if you know more
about them before you then go into
further planning steps you'll know if
they're a good fit you'll know kind of
how they're going to fit in there in
your design and the more information you
know up front the better your
application will be in a long run the
next key concept is error handling we're
going to take in information from the
user we really shouldn't trust the users
to give us the right information all the
time so we need to have some total error
handling in place to scrub that data to
prompt them to give us better data and
to make sure that we don't have any
problems as we go so error Hamley is
important interfaces is our key concept
and this is one that if you're like what
are interfaces don't worry we'll get
there but I know from experience of
building this type of application that
it's getting kind of important to know
how to use interfaces
because where I use those to pass
information back and forth from form to
form also random ordering we've
mentioned four or five times in the
answers to our questions the idea of
random we have it's random who gets what
in what order it's random who gets a buy
for the first week if there is one and
so this idea of random or randomizing
information it's getting important it
will have to look at randomizing in a
couple different ways maybe we have to
figure out random numbers or maybe it's
just how you shuffle a list in a random
way and really shuffle a list is random
numbers kind of stepped up a notch so
let me keep that idea in our minds and
this last concept is one that really
wasn't mentioned in our requirements
anywhere but it's an idea that I have
for a possible adding or possible bonus
upgrade for this software and that's the
idea of texting we alert people via
email about upcoming games and when
games are done and when rounded on and
when the whole term is done maybe some
users are going to want to have their
notifications texted to them as well
it's not something is going to change
our application as far as structurally
really all it is is we're going to add
this on top so we capture their first
name and last name and email address in
order a mail them will also capture
their phone number and then they you'll
put something in place where they can
have the option of getting a text as
well or will have some other mechanism
in place to determine should we send a
text but that's really a bonus or an
extra it's not something that's really a
part of our requirements and it's okay
to have these bonus ideas as long as
they don't affect the overall
application if this were to change how
we do things for example if I had to
capture now a team captain instead of
just capturing team members that would
be a problem because that was something
specified in the requirements so I need
to go back to the stakeholders and say
do you want this and this is what it
will take or Israel do to one of your
other requirements but if it's something
that's really just an add-on or extra
that might be something you could plan
to do or even do if you're pretty
confident the customer or the
stakeholder would want it one area that
can be important or even really helpful
to you is if you are in business
especially a small business we're
building something for someone that it's
not quite as defined as maybe a a big
company might define an application it's
really just this this loose structure
like this one was maybe it's nice to
give them a little something extra so if
they see that you're not only hitting
your goal for the application which is
the goal would be to meet all
requirements but there you're going
above and beyond but the key here is to
know when to do this and when not to do
this it's definitely not a good idea to
do something like this if you're not
going to meet your deadline in fact I
would say do everything else first and
if you have time make it better and this
key one way to make it better so that's
really it we've covered all of our
questions and the answers we got back
from our stakeholders and out of that we
built
one big set of requirements and from
that we were able to develop this
big-picture design we were also able to
develop these key concepts that we might
need to go out in research to understand
better now normally if I were doing this
in the workplace environment and I was
unsure of something in my key concepts
list this is where I'd go out and start
researching that but again we're
simulating as though we know all of
these because I'm going to teach you all
these so therefore we can kind of skip
that step which means that in our next
lesson we're going to cover how to
design our data we're going to map out
what data we need and how it kind of
groups or fits together make sure to
check that out before you go you'll see
a link on the left to BIOS course check
out the intro video on this playlist for
more information what you get if you pay
also if you are ever wondering what you
could do to help this channel out
without paying money I've listed six
things that really help I appreciate if
you consider doing one or more of these
thanks again and don't forget to keep
practicing what you learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
