start to finish course my name is Tim
quarry and today we're going to start
debugging our broken application I love
the fact we can work through a
real-world demonstration of a broken
application this isn't some contrived
example I made up this is logic that
doesn't work and the reason I love is
lesson so much is because we need
develop in the real world you're going
to have these issues you need to know
how to fix issues like this every
semester I teach c-sharp and classroom I
see students delete their entire project
because it has a bug you can't approach
development that way you have to learn
how to track down bugs and squash them
now I could have fixed the issue
off-screen and then just told you what I
did but that really wouldn't help you
learn I could also tell you what the
problems are and again pick up right
there and start fixing them but that too
isn't going to help you so today I'm
going to walk you through my process of
debugging this application so follow
along and if you think you see mistake
feel free to shout out to the screen
let's jump right in by way of review to
see where we're at let's go ahead and
hit the start button to launch this
application now bring it over here and
I'll also bring over our files right now
we have the person model the prize
models and the team models are the only
three files we have so let's create a
new tournament this is the broken test
the entry fee is $10 we're going to add
all three teams and you know what we're
not going to create a price we don't
need to create a prize for a tournament
so I hit create tournament and this is
where the bug is going to happen and
there we go the bug says input string
was not in the correct format so that's
the first bug all right
what does that mean well let's debug
this first before we go on
so we're converting to a matchup model
and we've said hey the winner now wait a
minute the winner we don't know who the
winner is
when you first create a tournament and
we haven't gone in further than create
determines therefore we don't know who
the winners are so convert to a matchup
model we don't have that we can't
convert the winners team ID let's look
at the calls here and see the calls to
we're looking at is an empty string so
the very first thing to do before we go
any further is we need to figure out how
to deal with reading information in so
it can I take these errors as we see
them because here's a little clue
usually you have an error it's not just
one thing it's easy three or four things
especially with all the code we wrote
and all the logic I wouldn't be
surprised if we have five six or seven
errors that are all kind of contributing
to that perfect storm of issues so let's
say if calls to dot length calls to the
string therefore the length equals zero
s double equals if a double equals zero
then P dot winner equals no we don't
know who the winner is else we can move
this line into it before I move this
line I never move a line that's
currently highlighted in yellow so let's
move that yellow up to the beginning of
this evaluation and then we can move
this line into our else data
so what I did here was said okay I can
see that calls to is an empty string
therefore I can't look it up by T might
look up a team by ID it doesn't have an
ID therefore we just say if the length
of the ID is zero mean there is nothing
there as an empty string then put the
winner model to be no don't even do a
lookup alright that should solve that
problem if I could be step through that
solves the problem now I hit continue
and we'll catch the next problem alright
so this is the problem that we saw quite
a bit last night and we've played around
different ideas for how to fix this but
essentially the error is Stack Overflow
exception which means we've got some
kind of infinite loop going on here and
it even says that in the the details is
going to say hey look for an infinite
loop and it's in here somewhere so we
don't have a hole that information
though about who called this we have a
load file and we're loading the person
models so that's all we really know is
that we've got this error that causes a
continual loop now we could step through
our application line by line and if you
don't know where to start
that's a great place to start so if if
you're going to do that what I would do
is go to this form go to create
tournament and put my breakpoint at a
place where I know it works until this
point so I'd probably put it right here
because we did the create rounds logic
in the last video and that's when it
stopped working we think now may have
stopped working for that because we
didn't test it in the previous video so
really it might not work even to here
but the great thing is I don't have to
do it I don't want to I can take a guess
at where
we might have the issue and so I'm going
to look at the text connector processor
and say you know I noticed loop in here
let's find it we loop through the turnip
model down here come down to the rounds
and there's a lot of looping going on in
the rounds so that might be the area to
check out but converts turn models so
it's one place I might go yeah that
might be it
but if we look at our files over here we
have a matchup entry model and a matchup
models we don't have a tournament model
yet so that's probably not it because
we're not loading any tournaments we're
not converting to a current model
because it's an empty list so we'll come
back to that one is to make sure it's
right but it's probably out there but if
we come down here to save rounds to file
there's more looping a for each of for
each and then inside here we have some
recursive lookups as well so that's
where I'm going you know what that might
be a place where we have an issue so I'm
going to take an educated guess and this
is just going to save us some time now
if I'm wrong we can start from the
beginning
and you don't know where to take an
educated guess start from the getting
step through it using the step into and
step over commands trying to educated
guess and say probably in this loop
we've got some issues because these are
double loops and the saved a matchup
file does a lookup for matchup file
lookup a matchup file entries and so
it's a whole lot of lookups and saving
and lookups and saving to look up some
savings going on
I would guess somewhere in there we have
some sort of infinite loop so that's my
best guess where to start so let's start
this again
oops
before I started I want to recreate this
scenario in its most clear format
meaning I'm going to delete these two
files because that's where we started
and had the problem so I'll make sure
that I don't cause problems by having
half-formed files that might throw
errors that otherwise wouldn't be there
so essentially I'm resetting my
environment to the same every single
time I test this so I know what changes
I make affect how the outcome occurs so
if you have you know files in weird
States they may cause other errors that
aren't really errors and start tracking
down things that are really just a wild
goose chase so let's run this
application again now those files are
gone I'm going to do the same thing not
working ten add three teams I'll ignore
the prizes don't need to add one every
time now I'll say create tournament and
it comes here and hits the breakpoint
now what does this tell me well it tells
me it's so far I haven't blown up my
application because I can get the error
first I went right to this line first
therefore the error occurs at least
after this line or at least after the
first time to run because this is in a
nested for each loop so let's step into
the code here and just see first of all
what the data looks like and if it's any
issues we can look up and so here the
first thing it does it saves the match
up to a file all right so it's going to
grab all the matchups and load them into
the matchup model so we're actually
going to step into this code we're got a
file path first and this is a good
insight into how c-sharp actually steps
through your code so you can see that
this method right here is called first
now we're back here and now if we step
into again which is f11 where did a load
file and so that's called next so next
will be called the convert to match up
models and it's going to say you know
what there's no lines in here it's an
empty file therefore I don't return
anything therefore my output is just a
new empty list of match up model so
we're back down here to save match up
file we've moved on to the next row we
see that match ups has zero entries it's
fine it's the first time we've ever
create a match up so now we say if match
ups is greater than zero well it's not
therefore the current ID is still one
therefore the new match up that we're
saving gets an ID of one we're going to
add that to our list and now we're going
to do what we did last night which was
this whole idea of saving and then
loading and then saving and actually I'm
not a big fan of this hacky code going
to move the cursor up one I'm actually
going to highlight this code and take
out this hacky Cody wrote last time and
the reason why is because when you were
trying things out you're saying well
I'll get back to that and make it
prettier but for now let's see if it
works and kind of you know just figure
out and trying different things without
really having a deep understand what's
going on that code shouldn't stay there
long term if it doesn't fix the problem
and I didn't fix the problem so let's
actually get rid of this code I don't
like it so a wait and see if we really
need it now we identify the issue why
but maybe can come up a better way to
solve the problem so let's skip over go
back down to edits were made and
have an issue so let's do an edit and
say list of string before I take that
off if you declare it up here so now we
can add that and keep going you can't
have you can't introduce a compile-time
bug in your code and expect to keep
debugging so now I have added a matchup
to my matchups list but I have to save
those entries first before I go on and
save the actual matchup to the file
because I need the IDS the matchups so
I'll step in I'll grab the first I'll
grab the first entry so that's entry
right here we zoom in has an ID of zero
has a score of zero it has no parent
matchup and the teams competing are the
team members are these two right here
Sue Storm and Joe Smith on team the best
team ok threat save is entry we come
down here and we have to get the
matchups now interestingly we are doing
the matchups up here and grabbing them
and then down here we are grabbing the
matchup entries set colleagues at the
same pattern so let's just skip over
that mostly there's a problem with that
there shouldn't be a problem of that and
note there's no problem there's no
entries at this point and we can keep
going now you may be on man this is
boring we're just kind of stepping as a
code it's all working don't get too
antsy here unless you go you know what I
think I can go even further place down
the road and still not hit the error I
would leave it at step into the code
even if you do step over instead of step
into and the reason why is because
and you defined where that error is
first that's our first priority and
sometimes you spend more time monkeying
around with trying to guess where the
error is rather than just walking
through the code and waiting to see it
pop up so in this case we're keep going
as we are we're going to save as entry
to file it grabs the idea of one because
we don't have any current entries going
to add that entry and then for every
matchup entry model it's going to do
this now I've got these two safety
checks in here if you put in the last
video anywhere we said the parent
matchup is not equal to null then put
that ID in otherwise the ID is empty
string so we'll step through this we
know that works as we tested it and in
fact if we look at the parent the parent
is blank the score is zero the team
competing is ID number one and the
actual IDs I dealer one so add that line
there's no more entries because this is
the first match of the first round which
has a by so now we can write this match
up entry to our file let's skip over
that and keep going now we comes the
next match up entry in our matchup file
ok so we can continue on and now we can
save our matchups all right so we have
this new list of lines and that's going
to store all of our text representations
of our matchups so that before we do
let's examine the matchups we only have
one so far and
it's match up it has one entry and
that's this team right here team idea of
one no parent the team ID is the best
team so that's the team that is in our
matchup the other one is the bi so you
only have one matchup for each matchup
we want to see if the winner is null
that's me check you put in and now we
need to grab the winner the round which
we have and we convert the matchup entry
list to string there's one matchup entry
list and let's do a skip over that's a
little bit dangerous because there may
be an error in that code we then know
the save match up to file is where the
actual error starts and it worked
and in fact lines right here has one
value the value is 1 comma 1 comma comma
1 that's perfect the next match that we
don't have we write all these matchups
to our file and so we've gone through
the entire iteration of this without an
issue so let's do this
we'll leave the breakpoint here and
we've said this seems to work so far so
let's run to the next time we go through
this loop it will put a breakpoint the
very end just in case we get out of both
of these for each loops so I continue
and we come back here the second time
the third time fourth time and the
fourth time it seems like we have an
issue there's
Stack Overflow issue and so we know that
we can run this
let's hit stop we know there's a
breakpoint right here in the in the this
bar over here scrollbar we know you hit
this three times safely and the fourth
time seems to have the problem so I'm
going to do is actually modify my
breakpoint going to right-click on it
and say conditions and I'm going to say
the hit count is greater than or equal
to four so will happen is the first
three times this breakpoint would be
touched we're going to skip over if you
know those three work and then we'll
touch on it you know stop on the fourth
and we can actually start stepping into
the code to find out what the issue is
next I'll come over to my files and I
will delete those two files that is
created again we're starting from
scratch I'll start up my term again
let's call it term team name closer add
my three teams and hit create tournament
and oops you know Stack Overflow
exception so it looks like our
breakpoint should have been at three not
four so let's do condition and let's
change this to three when I started
again and will actually delete those
files before we continue now I'll do
another test and create tournament and
now we're paused at this breakpoint
and it is the third time they've hit
this breakpoint now we can start
stepping into this code and find out why
it is different in the previous
iterations that worked so step into or
if f11 and let's step over this but
we'll know that if it throws an error
here that that was the issue okay so you
read our matchups and our matchups
currently we have two we have round one
and round one remember that for this
current iteration we're going to have
three matchups total we have two in the
first round one between the persons by
week and themselves in the second
between two different teams and then the
winners of those two matchups go to the
second round where there's one matchup
where the two of them face off and the
winner is the winner of the tournament
so it's the last matchup so let's start
stepping through we're going to look for
the current ID the current ID is three
that's the the max ID plus one so that's
the new ID we're going to add that match
up to our matchups list and now we're
going to save this entry to a file and
this plant a little bit cautious but I
know that if I if I mess up and go too
fast I get least start over here so I'm
going to step into this safe and now I
will step over the load of the matchup
entries
I have three matchup entries so that's
good
next we'll grab the ID and the new ID is
only four that's great I'm going to add
that entry to our list of entries and
here is where we're going to do our
actual save of the entries we're our
file write all lines so let's step into
this we have four entries two to load so
first where I check the parent ID and
that's null this first one team
competing is null therefore oops I'm
sorry a team competing that was the
string vert before I populated but edik
team competing actually has a value as
the okay team so grab the ID of that
team that's three we're add this line
now to our list of lines the ID of one
team competing of three the score of
zero and the parents of nothing empty
string
next the parent matchup is null team
competing we actually have a value the
worst team so we'll step through these
and now our line says ID of two team
competing of two score of zero and
parent of no now we
parent matchup of null team competing
value the best team so again same thing
all over again parent of empty score
zero team competing of one and the ID of
three our parent matchup has now changed
it was no now it's an actual value so
we'll grab that value parent ID of one
cool team competing we don't know who is
competing
therefore we know therefore the empty
string so ID is for team competing is
unknown score is zero and the parent is
one that's all of our for each for
saving its entry to a file now there is
this other command step out and so what
happens is here if it during debugging I
get into a method not only one line long
there's no reason for it but if I could
get into a method where it's a little
longer and I didn't want to care about
what happened in this method
I want to care what happens to the
parent that I could do is step out and
that return the back to where I was and
now you've written all those lines for
the the matchup entry model we've
written all those to the text file in
fact that's right here so that's good so
we've saved that entry and we have a
total of two entries so we got one more
let's skip over that because it seemed
to work the first time and wouldn't you
know it that's where we break alright
it's going to happen don't panic and
don't get too frustrated by it
that's what happens we now know where
that issue is and so we can come down
here and say okay I at least know where
to put some breakpoints in our case is
right down here where this was the issue
saving match up to file where the second
time we had an issue so let's go back
over here well delete these again this
is a process you have to be patient for
just keep pulling a thread
don't try and conquer the world in one
step so I run this test twelve add the
three teams and now notice I haven't
gotten to my breakpoint here three times
yet and I know that I have to hit three
times before is an error in fact right
now it says if I mouse over this
breakpoint it says the hit counter is
currently one so I can actually continue
and continue and continue and now my
breakpoint says yep you're three I can
continue one more time and now I'm down
to the save entry and if I look this
entry right here is entry ID zero score
of zero and the parent matchup is one I
have two of these the ID is to the
second one so the first one seemed to
work
I hit end I hit continue so now we're in
a second one this is where last time we
hit step over and it broke the
application so let's step into instead
and we'll grab the entries whereas step
over that and immediately I go you know
what that's the air so
no worries we'll do it again delete
these two this is where again patience
comes in play so I start this again
and now I'm going to move us back over
the right window test
I'll hit 10 add the three teams now
create tournament I'll continue on until
I hit this I'll continue down to here
I'll do it one more time and now I step
into and I know this right here is my
offending line this is the problem so
let's figure out why let's step into it
I don't need a configuration information
that works I don't need to know how it
loads the lines I know that works but
now convert to match up entry model that
must be the problem so here I have four
lines now so it four lines of code 1
comma 1 comma 0 2 comma 3 comma 0 3
comma 2 comma 0 I'm sorry there's a
trailing comma at the end of all these
well then this one down here is
different this is one of those things
where if you watch Sesame Street as a
kid you know you notice that one of
these things is not like the other and
code when you have a bug usually it's
caused by the thing that's different
not the three things are the same so my
guess is the issue lies in this last
item I am number three so the fourth
item the list so let's step over create
a new list that's this empty list and
then probably what I could do and again
this is a little bit rushing ahead a
little bit but I can say you know what
it's probably the first three lines
I continue that's the first line
continue again that's the second line
continue again that's a third line
continue again now there is that unique
line the one's a little bit different so
what now now we step into our code match
up entry model a new one okay first we
parse the called call zero so let's look
at our values here call zero is four
that part's just fine so team competing
is just B Nobi call one we don't know
now if you're not familiar this is
actually our match up from the second
round we don't know who is in the
matchup we just know where it came from
who the winners are going to come from
or where do I was going to come from so
now we know as no team here it's just a
null that works the score you can mouse
over that and say it scores zero yep
that's fine now the parents ID so let's
step in here and see that yes it's found
a parent ID the parent ID if you can see
that says one as the value so now we're
going to look up match up by ID I'm
going to step into that now
where did I come from if you notice down
here oops not here we've got up here so
we came from right here which is in the
convert to match up entry models right
now I am going to call the convert to
match up models if you remember the
convert to match up models has to call
the convert to match up entry models
because it needs to know which teams are
in
the matchups so that right there I go
wait a minute that's a circle we're
calling the matchup models in order to
get the matchup entry models which we
call in the matchup models for that
seemed like a one big circle let's
confirm that's actually the case instead
is guessing or assuming so I'll step in
to tell me we're about reading the lines
we know that works now convert to
matchup model and that's right down here
and now they come in here we step to the
code we say for each line lines and
there's going to be two lines we're
going to load our matchups the ID for
column for ID the parses it parts of
column zero is one that's fine now
convert string to match up entry models
that's it right there if we do that look
at that convert to match up entry models
for call not again well but we know that
we call convert to match up entry models
that it calls this lookup where we have
a problem now let's just look up right
here look up match up by ID so we're
trying to find the parent ID of a match
up I'm sorry with match up entry of this
trait this is the match up entry and so
we're trying to find the apparent ID of
that match of entry and so we're saying
well give me all the match ups and I'll
find the one that matches the ID but
then in the process of looking up those
matchups in order to populate the model
we have to look at the match up entries
and part of that process is calling us
convert to match up entries model
and again we're loading the entire file
so guess what we're going to come down
here and have this parent ID equal
something other than zero and start this
loop over again so as soon as we have
parents to look up we get into it an
endless loop of looking up and
populating which cause it to look up and
populate which cause the look of and
populate now the reason we do this the
reason we have its error is because
we're not using databases in a database
we look up just the entry we need we'd
say lookup ID number five and I wouldn't
have to look up and match all the
records we just need to look up and
match the record that has the ID that
we're looking for so we need to adopt a
similar principle with our file lookups
we can't look up and load every single
record when really what we need is just
one record so I think we identify the
problem let's stop right now now I'm
going to leave my breakpoint here we
know how to get from here and get into
this error I'm going to take my break
point away down here and then come back
up here and look at this whole lookup
idea now we can escape out of loops and
not have this dangerous situation of an
infinite loop by only looking up the IDs
we need because you will never have a
parent ID of your ID so if your ID is
three the parent ID will never be three
as well so therefore it shouldn't cause
a problem where we're looking up
something and it's getting back the same
record we're looking up and that's where
we have the air right now we're looking
up a record and it's saying load every
record and
cluing the record you're currently
looking at which causes a circular issue
where Peter we keep looking up the same
record and it's asking to that same
record again and keeps going so let's
change our lookups to not look up and
populate the entire model for every
record but just for the records we need
so let's start address now you guys it
looks like probably about three
different places we have to make this
change and the first play type C is
actually right in front of us so let's
get rid of em you can see the whole
method right here this one right here
the converts string to match up entry
model this is one of the ones in our
chain of calls we do the convert to
match up entry models to allo the entire
list of matchup entries just to figure
out which ones have matching IDs add
that to the list return that list but we
can do this better so let's start off by
not converting them to match up entry
models instead we'll stop at our string
so a list of string entries and the
reason why I did that is because even
just loading the list of string for all
of our match up entries I know that the
call 0 we split that up by our comma I
know call zero is always going to be the
ID well we can match IDs right here
strength this string ID equals the call
zero ID call zero value so I know that
if we if we do just a string we can look
up and find the IDs that match the rows
that match in this list of string based
upon the ID then we can convert just
those rows over to match up entries so
let's do that
it kind of helps us see it sometimes so
before I do let's actually wipe this out
and then let's add one more thing up
here
a list of strings which is going to be
our matching entries equals new list of
strengths so when I loop through these
IDs I'm then going to loop through every
one of these records and find the row
that has the matching ID to start now
take that row and put it into matching
entries so for each string entry in
entries I'm going to say let's split
that apart oops string array calls
equals entry dot split a char comma and
if calls zero double equals ID knot is
ID now why am I just want a direct
comparison well call zero is a string
but so are the IDs they've been passed
in so each one the string therefore it's
a direct string comparison really simple
if the two match that means that this
row is the row I need therefore matching
entries dot add entry now we're not done
yet
once we've looped through all of our IDs
then we say output equals matching
entries dot convert to match up entry
model see this up here this right here
this piece was at the end of this
instead we waited and only put at the
end of our list where the matching
entries were the ones we actually needed
we're not going to load the other
matchups we don't need the other
matchups therefore we shouldn't have a
problem with that loop at least for this
method but if it keeps scrolling down
here we know as lookup
team by ID and look up match up by ID
well that's the same basic issue so
let's follow the same pattern for our
lookup team by ID so in here let's
instead list of T model will have a list
of string and it won't do as last
convert and now we'll actually get rid
of this line right here and redo it and
some that we'll do is we're going to say
for each string team in teams we're
going to do a string array oops
equals team dot split on the char comma
and now if calls 0 equals ID that's the
ID passed in by the user but that's an
int and this is a string so one of these
hath we converted and it's just easiest
to do a to string and so now we're going
to say loop through all the teams you've
loaded in a string fashion move through
all of them find the one that has the ID
which is a column 0 the ID that matches
the one we're looking for
alright now when you find that matching
one we're going to say list of string
equals we're call it matching teams
equals new list of string why do we
create a list of string we only have one
string we're passing in one ID well we
are expecting to have a list of string
passed in in order to convert each of
those records back out to a team
therefore we have to say a list of
string and then matching teams Dodd and
we'll add this particular team so we
look to see it the IDS match if they do
we create a new list of string called
matching teams we add just that team so
it's we're looking for one ID that's all
we need to do once we've add that team
we can actually say return matching
teams dot convert to team models global
config dot people file dot first because
it returns a team model so I have to get
the first one back from our list of team
model which we know we're only asking
for one therefore should only get one
back there for the first is perfect now
it's still yelling up here because it
says not all code paths returned of
value that's because we're inside if
statements and that might not always be
true and we're actually in tooth for
each statement which might not run but
down here at the end we could say return
no why well if you don't find the
matching ID then you've got a problem
return no team found now this might be
something where we come back and say
nope not null throw an exception because
we've got a problem but in this case I
may return no now I do the same pattern
as up here right down here again
patterns are a friend so I will change
this to be a list of string I'll get rid
of this I'm going to do a for each
string we'll call this match up
in matchups and then inside here we'll
do our string array calls equals matchup
dot split on the char comma and then if
calls zero which is always the ID equals
ID to string then we're going to say a
list of string called matching matchups
equals new list of string matching
matchups dot add not to string dot add
match up and then return matching match
ups dot convert two and this is the
match up model and this isn't requires
to pass anything in but we do need to do
that first and now we're done that and
we come down here and say again return
no so now we fixed these three places
where we were looking up more
information that we actually needed or
requested that should cut down on the
number of loops we do and a number of
unnecessary lookups they make so already
fix four different things is that enough
well we're going to find out will delete
those will run us again
adda three teams create the tournament
we're going to continue off this and it
leaves it and blow up so something
happened let's go back over here and
check this out match up entry model
great match up in I'm sorry match ups
model match up 10g model both create but
also tournament models CSV we have yet
to create one of these so open that in
notepad now we created the file that's
amazing but that looks hideous and is
probably not what we're expecting in
fact I know is not we want to do
therefore we did something wrong so
we're getting closer it's saving the
tournament and it looks like these are
probably okay because these files CD
well forms but this tournament model
isn't so let's delete all these and
start over I'm actually I'm not going to
pause this so have all the information
filled out instead I'm going to go take
away my breakpoints here and find out
where that break point should be so
let's look at this create tournament
create tournament right here and here's
we actually save this to the file so we
need to figure out what this does so
here's our actual writing the file the
lines to the file let's go to our break
point here right before we save the
actual tournament record to our file and
now I'm going to hit create tournament
it gets here no problem let's look at
lines we have one line and that line
looks like this
/ r / n that we returned a new line
now let's space why is that well I can
tell you why that is right here this is
the one place again one of these things
is not like the other this is the one
place where we're saving to our text
file where we use this @ symbol and do
multiple lines it isn't like that
so actually hit stop right now and
address this the quickest way to address
this is just to delete all of these
extra returns and put it back onto one
line one huge line remember is no spaces
between the curly braces in the commas
so now it's on one huge line let's go
back to our files delete the two matchup
files just for safety's sake we'll run
it again and now we'll call this
tournament it might work and our three
teams create the tournament nothing
seems to happen
but in our tournament model file to open
this with notepad that looks a whole lot
better now let's not delete the files
but let's close out a tournament and
launch it one more time and now say EA
the name 14 for the entry fee we'll add
three teams and let's add a prize just
because we haven't done that in a while
and create tournament you thought you're
done didn't you well we're not done and
so again this is not trying to throw
your hands up in the air and say I'm
done this is awful because actually it's
a pretty simple one so the issue is
input string was not in the correct
format what is the input string well
it's ID and if you notice ID is an empty
string how do you parse an empty string
well you don't it crashes your
application so if we look at prizes
we'll also know that prizes would be
empty as well so let's stop its
application and we're going to a check
here for the prizes because even though
we didn't have an entry for prizes ID is
an empty string that is technically a
string therefore we can go through this
one time and try and parse an empty
string which is nine number so let's do
this let's surround all of this so right
click and say surround with if and we're
going to say if calls for dot length is
greater than zero because if calls for
was we're splitting on here
it calls for is equal to zero we
shouldn't add any prizes let's try that
logic so now
adda three teams we can skip the prop
you know it let's add a prize just we
have it we'll call this place number one
first and for 52 for the prize Mount
Pitt create tournament no crash this
time so let's look at our tournament
model file open up notepad and now we
have two entries the first one for it
might work and the next one for now
question mark that's when we just did so
we actually have valid information for
both of our tournaments now we should be
completely done and if you notice my
testing seem to cover different values
different ways so I had no prizes and I
had one prize and I had you know an
entry fee of zero and I had an entry fee
of a value and I changed different names
and actually names had special
characters in them so I was tacking
different ways once I felt comfortable
the system might work because I want to
shake out those bugs now you may still
have a bug or two lying in wait and the
best way to find those is to do
everything in your power to make this
application break and so for example I
would do no turrent name i blank out the
entry fee I would remove the teams I
remove the prize and click create
tournament now right now it's going to
blow things up is not put validation in
place but that's something your users
will do and so the best way to make sure
you have your bugs iron now is a try
things that are against what the
application is supposed to do don't just
try and debug by do what the application
should do do all the things that it
really shouldn't do and make sure they
don't work and make sure you don't crash
the application but they actually tell
the user gracefully
don't do this so that's how you do an
application now it's a little bit of
work and there's a lot of guesswork in
where the issue actually was especially
for that stack overflow error because it
wasn't right underneath our cursor but
that's the kind of saying you need to
practice and so if you were to get a
source code for this course which is in
the paid version this course create a
source code you can look at our previous
lessons and where all the code is broken
and you can try stepping through it and
looking at the issues and so you can
actually see how to debug from a broken
application now you've seen what I did
to fix it but try and step to yourself
and see how that works
debugging is a very very important skill
to pick up and the best way to pick it
up is to practice it and so I encourage
you to practice debugging a few times to
get the hang of it get the hang of the
guesswork of it but also the the
investigation side of things we had
tracking things down looking at
variables and putting breakpoints in
even using those advanced breakpoints if
you have any questions questions with
those advanced breakpoints I do have a
video on my youtube channel that talks
about all about breakpoints I know it's
not a really you know a subject you're
enthusiastic about necessarily but
breakpoints are one of the most powerful
things to use because you'll use it all
the time
so I encourage you look at that alright
so that's it for this video we're done
debugging now we can move on to wiring
up our last two forms so stick around
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
