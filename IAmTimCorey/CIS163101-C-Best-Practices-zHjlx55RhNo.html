best practices in c-sharp now best
practices are really up to the person
doing the development however if you
follow certain common best practices it
will make your life easier
and it'll make the life easier or the
person who comes after you so let's look
at a few of them first is naming
conventions Microsoft has adapted a
couple different naming conventions
based upon the type of item for example
if you see in my console demo here we
have console demo capital C capital D
this is what's called Pascal case Pascal
case capitalizes the first letter of
each word in a name this is used for
namespaces for classes for methods and
also for solutions and projects okay
when you create a variable so for
example string my demo string you start
you do camel case camel case starts off
with a lowercase letter and then
continues on with uppercase for every
word after the first word now if you are
going to add an underscore for example
in the private variable for properties
you still leave the first letter of the
first word lowercase so Pascal case for
namespaces classes methods solution
names program names and then camel case
for variables
now if you notice my variable here
string my demo equals an empty quotes
this is another best practice it's a
best practice to initialize all
variables this gives you a starting
point a known starting point for every
variable when you're developing
application you should also leave
comments to let the next person know
what is going on for example if I were
to create a new method here
okay we have a public static void call
me method that takes in a name well
first of all our naming is not the best
here call me doesn't really describe
what this method does string name could
be okay depending on what type of name
were asking for but it would probably
probably be better to ask for a more
specific variable name so let's clean
this up a bit
instead of saying call me let's call
this
execute database upload that's a much
more specific name and string name let's
call this user name okay
just by doing those two changes we've
made things easier but let's go ahead
and comment this method two comma entire
method put your cursor above on the line
above the method now in this case I am
using Visual Studio 2013 so you will
notice this zero references right here
in your visual studio version it will
probably not have that that's okay this
works the same way in your in 2012 so to
put code comments over the entire method
type slash three times this gives you a
code block inside his code block or XML
comments the first one is summary this
is a summary of what this method does
for example I could say this method
start and describe it so this method
this method uploads data from our class
into the sequel database and if you get
too long in your comment line you can
always hit enter and go to the next line
and Visual Studio will put the three
slashes in for you next you have
parameter name okay so user name this
describes what the user name is and how
to use it so let's go ahead and put
something meaningful in here besides
this is the user name how about the
username of the person calling for the
upload okay and again if it gets too
long you can go ahead and press ENTER
wherever you like and still get the
triple slashes okay now what come on
change this void to a boolean now it
didn't change our comment block but we
want to describe what the return value
is and why it's significant so let's go
ahead and hit enter after the last
parameter and start with our angle
bracket now here's a list of different
options you have for xml comments and
one of them is returns just close it out
and it creates the matching clothes
returns inside here we can say something
like returns true if the upload
succeeded
okay
now this method right here doesn't
really do much in fact it's a pretty
useless method however we might want to
document the fact that it's not really
actually use useless so you could put a
comment inside of our code to describe
why we do what we do so
okay there we go this explains a section
of our code which is confusing so if a a
new person were to come in look at our
code they would see return true with no
extra logic and they say why do we even
need this method let's just get rid of
it so what you're doing here is you're
describing why I did something confusing
now if you were to have some really
straightforward code you don't need to
comment it if it's straightforward
people will understand it and leave it
alone you don't need extra comments just
to have comments but if something is
confusing or might be confusing
make sure to specify what it does and
why so that's code commenting now let's
look at what one of the side benefits of
comment in the code this way with the
external comments yes let's go into our
static void main and call this execute
database lookup corrupt the execute
database upload I'm sorry so we start
off by opening our paren and notice down
here user name is highlighted and it
says the username of the person calling
for the upload that's the exact wording
we used it took the accidental comment
and put it here as intellisense
that can be very very helpful for
understanding what is going on and why
now notice I'm mouse over this method it
says this method uploads the data from
our class into the sequel server sequel
database well that's right here okay so
it's also taking information from the
summary this makes it very very helpful
when you are working with custom classes
the other thing you should note here is
M of my spacing I didn't put everything
right next to each other for example if
you look at this it's much harder to
read because it blends together if I put
a couple simple enters where I need to
then it looks much cleaner and much more
easy to read personally i group things
together so for example if I had
variables
I would group them together like so
no ENTER but then I go to my next set of
information or set of commands I group
them and group together this is based
upon what you feel is most
understandable but I would recommend
that you put extra line feeds in to give
some space to your methods and so that's
it
naming Pascal case camel case code
comments both code blocks and also
explanations of difficult to understand
code bits and good spacing and also
don't forget to initialize your
variables simple stuff small things but
they can make a big difference when it
comes to debugging your application or
the application of someone else and that
is a few of the c-sharp best practices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
