video I'm gonna go over some common
controls in WPF for this demo I'll be
using Visual Studio 2017 which you can
get for free at Visual Studio comm as a
starting point I'm reusing a simple WPF
project I created in my intro to WPF of
the video if you missed that video you
might want to check it out I'm going to
assume that you've watched it so I can
skip over some of the things that
covered in that video all right so let's
jump right in here we have the project
open that I create in my intro to WPF
video and it's pretty straightforward we
got our grid here with our column
definitions and row definitions and then
we have two text blocks a text box and a
button and you won't really cover those
controls to cover them pretty thoroughly
in previous video but that's what we're
going to start now let's add on to this
because typically you have more than
just text boxes that's probably our our
bread-and-butter control for entering
information but there are other controls
as well so let's look at a little more
complicated one the combo box now combo
box and list box are pretty much the
same thing so I'll just cover combo box
but this really applies to both so if I
were to say combo box and give it a name
so X colon name and we'll call this
combo box something like my combo box
and let's put in the grid dot column of
one and the grid dot row of four which
is right below the you run me button and
that's one of the things that to think
about when you're designing your form is
that you have to give each of these a
row number and so now I have a combo box
if I want to put that you for the rummy
button I have to actually change this to
a three change this to a four and kind
of swap them around that way I can do
that it's just a little ugly if you have
multiple things on that line
so now let's call this good and close it
out now we're going to put in this combo
box let's actually make that day a call
spent to sew grid dot column span of two
and what's column span do remember
column span says I want this control to
live in two columns look at the two
instead just the one and that two
incorporates the first column you
specify plus the next one so it's not
the current one plus two more to include
the current one all right so now I want
this combo box to have a list is now in
my code behind for my main window exam
about CES I've actually already created
a public class person now don't do this
here this is just for demo purposes you
should really count a class somewhere
else but for dello purposes just keep it
close i actually declared it right in
line with my main window class so it's
really simple first and last name
properties all there is and then in my
main window class which is actually code
behind for this form i said outside of
everything else outside of the methods I
said let's declare a list of person
called people and then inside a
constructor right here after the
initialize component I said let's add
three people to that people list and
that's all I've done so that's that's
this close actually from the previous
lesson so this is all I've done is add
three people to a list of people and
actually to clear that class so let's
assign this list that combo box we
called it my combo box item source
equals people pretty simple but
now over here if we were actually to run
this let's do that we get DP F del dot
person and that's not we want but if
you're familiar with wind forms when we
do this we do the same kind of thing if
we don't specify the the binding source
that the display member and value member
so how we do the same thing in the EPF
well it's a little bit different in fact
it's a little bit more in some ways more
complex but in other ways more
feature-rich
we do is inside the combo box between
the open closing tags we say combo box
dot item template so this is the
template for displaying a specific item
or single item we say it's a data
template inside here we can specify
anything you want
in this case let's start off with a
simple one text block you familiar this
text equals we're going to do curly
brace binding and then the property name
now I'll explain this in a minute but
what this does is says okay we need to
for every individual item this is a
template we're going to use this is a
data template and inside here we say I
want a text block to say this value but
instead of an actual value we say
binding bind to this property in this
case first name the property path so
first name right here is one of our
properties so now if we run this Tim
joensuu all right so you've bound to
that value so that allows us to
one of our properties and display it in
this combo box now well he wanted the
full name well the way you had used to
do it in wind forms still works in DPF
in that we come down here and create a
full property or part of a full
read-only property except it's something
like public string full name get and
we'd say return dollar sign double
quotes curly brace first name space
pretty breaks is last name like so then
I call it the end and then here instead
of first name we'd say full name we run
that we now get Tim Cory Joseph with and
Sue Storm great so our combo box now has
full names in it we have control over
what data goes in there now I'm going to
leave this here because when I come back
to this after I show you a different
control because this is the most
simplistic thing you can do with a color
box we could actually be a lot more
full-featured in how we do things
including adding things like images here
if you want to or sets of data so look
at that a minute but for now we'll leave
this as is and again if you want to
movies around if you want to say this
goes in row four and this goes in Row
three now I'm not sure we caught that or
not but one can override the other I
mean they can both live in the same spot
which is ugly but it kind of works
also notice that we've got a spacing
issue man which we can deal with
by adding a margin unless today here so
I'm gonna puts on the next line and say
Marge and let's just say 10 for now and
put 10 all around it and now if we start
this and look at it we now have our
combo box a rummy button first name
field and we're all set so the other
thing I do here is actually I'd cut this
out and come here and paste it back in
in the right order otherwise you get
confusing as to okay this down here is
actually this up here and this up here
is this down here and just it's all
confusing visually for me it's up to you
if you want to do it or not but that's
that's what I do alright so now I'm
going to show you some I guess more
interesting controls when we could say
it let's look at the image control so
let's say grid dot row is one grid dot
column is for wrap this to the right of
the the information right here and let's
say grid dot row span at row row span
let's say the row span is six alright so
what it's going to do it says we are in
row number one wrap here but column
therefore this is one two and three here
so column four and we're going to span
six rows so all the way down here now
the actual image we have to give us
source this is where your your image is
located in this case I'll give it a hard
code spot you can give relative paths
that you wanted to
but I'll give hard to it pass and that's
a self-closing slash at the end and
there we go got my image on this form
now here's a real fun thing I have not
given it a size for my picture this
image is actually quite a bit larger
than this so if I were expand this as
the form gets bigger so is my image
which may be a little scary for you but
sorry so this is one of the features of
DPF the idea that we don't have to
specify this is how big the image is
going to be it can adjust based upon the
real estate you give it notice that that
image can get really small or if I make
it really big expands all the way it
makes it very very big in my form is
still over here so that's an image
really simple to do like I said just
image and the idea to do is give it a
source you can give it a height and a
width if you wanted to or you can give
it a max height and a max width meaning
resize all you want smaller but you
can't get bigger than this and we'll see
that in a little bit so that's the image
a comment that's out actually I'm not
going to add instead a media element now
a media element let's give it the same
parameters as my image so grade dot rows
one grade columns for grid dot row span
of six and again it's a source but this
allows you to play video
so again it's a self-closing tag and
there's a video I have my hard drive now
if I run this it takes a little some
recording but there you go you have a
video which again resizes based on a
window size so you get large you want
can you maximize it we can shrink it
down and that really is my son mowing
for the first time we're actually just
riding the tractor so but based upon
this the video can get bigger or smaller
and yet it still runs the background
I've done now and I haven't looped it
but that's again the power of DPF to not
only have a running video but running
videos that can be resized dynamically
based upon size your form so again let's
comment that out but that's media
element not video which I wish would be
called video but it's called media
element let's put that in turns wish
list and poised it now number four I'd
love to see it be called video so if you
have image but whatever all right so now
there's some times you want to have
multiple things kind of grouped together
now I mentioned in a last video but you
might not have caught it certain things
can only have one thing inside them but
there are other items that can have
multiple items inside them for example
the grid control is one of those things
they can have multiple things inside of
it but let's look at stack panel now
stack panel what it does is it stacks
items so if you put four items in it's
going to stack them on top of each other
or side-by-side depending on the
orientation
the key word here is orientation and you
have two choices horizontal or vertical
so let's draw office horizontal and the
other thing I do is I need to put it in
that same spot as before so I put in row
number 1 column number 4 and row span 6
so I'm going to stack over here and
let's give it 4 images now use images
max Heights for now now I'm max width as
well whoops not max height I want max
width and my source is going to be again
hard-coded all right so there's my first
image right there and I will copy this a
few more times and just for variety I'll
add different images and so now if you
notice there's actually a little bit of
a picture showing up here if we start
this it look as one picture but if we
actually open this up there's multiple
pictures in a row okay so it's a
stackpanel notice that they in half the
same size in fact this one's oriented
differently it's oriented in the
portrait instead of landscape which is
has no problem I'll just put them
side-by-side with no margin misses
there's no margin there but when I drink
it down it Clips the dog clips off
whatever is left which isn't ideal but
there is a solution for that but first I
want to show you if we change this
orientation to vertical
now you run this you see that against
clipped off the bottom now and they are
oriented in a virginal mode so that's
nice but it might not serve all your
needs what's nice for is if you want to
keep a form together but how to be
dynamic so you could say you actually
nest these stack panels so have a
vertical stack panel and then inside of
it have a horizontal stack panel that
has the text block and text box so first
name and text box then the next stack
penalty have last name and text box so
on and so forth and so you have a this
form that kind of recites a little bit
but it still kinda keeps together but in
our image case it doesn't lis utilize a
space well we can actually change this
though to a rap panel so that was stack
panel now let's look at rap panel and if
we start this notice now that I have
four pictures side by side but in a more
of a cube fashion nothing happens if I
resize this way but if I resize down
notice it actually moves this picture
down below so what's happened it says I
don't want to clip off any of the images
if I can help it
and so I'll do is I will use all the
vertical space I can but if I can't put
another picture below I'll put it next
to me so this case it has two pictures
where this third picture is if that
portrait mode net really can't be put
down below and it also can't have one
below it because it would also clip
therefore we actually have three columns
give it a little more space and now I
have two columns
we go so that is a rap panel and we can
switch the orientation again from
vertical to horizontal and now it's
going to try and lay us out horizontally
and if it can't it puts it down to the
next row down so that's the ideal for it
but it starts putting things in the next
row when it runs out of horizontal space
so that is a rap panel which is great
for images and other things now let's go
back to the stack panel for a minute
also notice when I change my opening tag
it closes much it changes my clothing
tag as well which that's a nice feature
so we have this and let's make it let's
make it vertical we have a stack panel
that's kind of great but it does clip
the bottom we don't want that alright so
we want to see all of our pictures we
can't scroll here in any way so you only
see all pictures is to actually expand
it out
so let's instead I'm going to
temporarily cut this instead put a
scroll viewer now I've done to put a
scroll viewer and then inside a scroll
viewer I put a stack panel now it's not
showing up over here why is that well
because now scroll viewer Tassie put on
a grid we specified grid that row column
column span for stack panel but it's no
longer on the grid it's inside scroll
viewer so we actually have to cut this
out and paste it in here and now scroll
viewer is in this spot in stack panel
doesn't we have a spotnik grid it just
lives inside scroll viewer that is
parent
now scroll viewer is one of those things
it can only have one child element
you can't put multiple things inside
scroll viewer you have to have a
stackpanel or something else inside of
it so let's start this up now I have a
scroll bar where I can scroll through my
images but if I were to make this taller
let's make this tall enough notice the
scroll bar is no longer enabled because
it has nothing to scroll and that works
as well with the wrap panel so there you
go there's the wrap panel the only
problem with this is that the wrap panel
doesn't necessary work the way you want
to because it's inside this scroll
viewer which is why we don't put a wrap
panel inside a scroll viewer because it
ends up being more like a stack panel so
that's stack panel that scroll viewer
that's wrap panel so there's a few more
controls you use now let's look back at
our combo box and note that we can have
some fun with this for example instead
of having this full main property let's
go back to first name let's take this
out cut it instead going to put a stack
panel orientation of horizontal put
first name I'll paste a few more times
but instead of binding here I put space
and then I'll make this last name so
we have a stackpanel which it's
orientation is horizontal now this is
one of those things that kind of messes
the up once in a while
visually in zamel it's arranged
vertically but since it says horizontal
it's laid out horizontally it is one of
those things that messes me up a once a
while just note that that even though
it's arranged vertically it was as
horizontal it's horizontal so just one
of those things so I have first name
binding and a last name biting now if we
run this and look at our combo box it
still says Tim Cory Joseph Smith and Sue
Storm we can have even more fun of this
by saying what if I did an image with a
source equal to my picture and now we
just drop down its massive but notice
Tim Cory Joe Smith and Sue Storm not
quite we had in mind so let's do this
height we can do height or we can do max
height go on - well let's do is - height
and let's say our height is about 20
pixels let's save it with
and now our drop-down we have a little
image of me next to all three people we
can even go further and have as image
rebound to a property and have a change
based upon which person was selected so
it's important to have it combo boxes
are a lot more powerful now because we
can add all those new fun things
including having things like checkboxes
inside them and other things in fact we
can even have a video playing next to
each item a different video playing as
each item do you want to have that
probably not but maybe you have you know
top three videos which one do you which
one you like and have instead of words
you have just a videos playing they
select which video they want to see in
the color box so isn't fun they didn't
do there but one thing I point out that
you may have noticed and I did point out
a little bit down below but there is no
grid column grid dot row or column span
or row span for any of these items here
and the reason why is because they're
not on the grid directly that's not
their parent it's their grandparent but
it's not their parent instead these
items here all live inside stack panel
stack panel lives inside combo box
well technically data template but
inside call box combo box is directly on
the grid therefore it has the grid
column span grid column grid row so just
know you don't have to add these
elements in fact you shouldn't add these
elements unless they're directly on the
grid also note that you can stack these
things so a stack panel can a stack
panel inside of it a grid can have a
grid inside of it so you could have a
grid inside here and put multiple things
in a really weird and funky layout and
that's fine so
that might mean you could have you know
big and bold my name then down below a
mighty title in a smaller font counting
a signature does a really great things
can do if you just get a little creative
with your layout and don't get locked
into if wind forms did this way I have
to do the same thing in de PS again
utilize the power of WPF by taking
advantage of these extra features if
we're going to deal with complexities
that come with jpf like this right here
they might as well get the benefits as
well if you're not getting the benefits
don't use the EPF these wind forms so
that's a basic overview of the controls
we've got text block text box
combo box or list box buttons scroll
viewer stack panel and ramp panel as
well as image and media element with
those you can do a ton of cool stuff I
would definitely recommend that you play
rallies try them out try different
things take an existing form you have in
wind forms and just try it out and APF
now coming up I'm going to have an
add-on for my course my c-sharp
application from start to finish course
where I take my existing completed
application and say ok let's remove the
wind forms UI and add in a duppy fui and
how is that going to look at how they're
going to be different so keep an eye out
for that if you're not in a million
lists definitely there's a link down
below definitely jump on a mailing list
so you can be alerted when that comes
out and also if you have already
subscribe I definitely appreciate if you
also hit the like button if you like
this video and want to see more like it
also let me know what you want see more
of alright or what you stroll with
right thank you as always I am Tim
