programming that you just couldn't
figure out sure we all have the question
is where do you go for help unless
you're fortunate enough to work with a
more senior software developer who is
willing to help you out it can seem
daunting to find the right information
online then if you post a question more
often than not it seems like people get
mad at you for asking a poor question
which is even more frustrating in this
video I'm gonna walk you through how to
get real help from people on the
internet without them getting mad at you
now in case you didn't know me my name
is Tim quarry and it's my goal to make
learning software development easier
especially for c-sharp developers if
you'd like to know more about how I can
help you out click on a link in the
description to join my mailing list as a
bonus you'll also get insider access to
special discounts and courses when they
come out so if you have a software
development problem where do you start
your instinct might be a start here at
Stack Overflow calm now if you haven't
heard about Stack Overflow
it's the largest online community for
software developer to get help and that
sound like the right place to be right
well yes and no yes in the sense that
this is we're gonna ask the question if
you really need help but know in a sense
that's net that's not the place of start
the place to start is a start by being a
good citizen first and what I mean by
that well if you ask for help is the
first thing you do online it looks like
all you're interested in is how can
everybody else help me and that
immediately puts people on their edge
because people who just say me me me me
that's not something you want surf
that's not someone who seems like
they're they're just kind of stuck and
they need help so let's start by
creating a account on Stack Overflow not
when you need a question answered but
right now create an account on Stack
Overflow now I have my account here
there's
I've been obviously on Stack Overflow
for a while Stack Overflow gives you
points for good answers for good
questions
for a whole bunch of things but those
are the primary ones and so the more
points you have the better your
reputation is online and the more likely
people listen to you now that's not to
say that if you've a low reputation no
one will listen to you that's not true
I'm gonna work you through how to ask in
a way the even if you have a reputation
of one as then just started people still
listen to you most likely but again you
price it as a question if your
reputation is one you haven't given
anything back to the community first so
how do you give back to the community
once you create your account go over to
questions and start looking at the
questions now this is all questions and
they're the newest right here now
there's tons of questions on Stack
Overflow and a lot of them are very
detailed ok system data sequel client is
not support on this platform there's a
c-sharp asp.net core maybe you don't
know anything about asp.net core and
sequel server so that's not the right
question for you because it's this
angular possibly maybe you are a c-sharp
person but you're more of a c-sharp
WinForms person now what I do is when
this whole list is up here again I proud
know most of these but I could click on
my favorite tags which is C sharp
because I know a lot about c-sharp and
even if you don't know a lot about
c-sharp but you know the most about
c-sharp of any language for example you
click on this and now this is the newest
ones that are tagged c-sharp now a tag
is just an indication that this question
relates to this tag this question right
here relates to c-sharp and sequel
server and asp.net core and database
migrations this one c-sharp and PHP so
you can kind of look through this list
well here's one c-sharp parallel dot for
eh using async/await
alright so here's a question there's
some code and there's no answers yet so
you could read through this inmate's if
you understand it you could post an
answer okay now the question the
important thing here is don't just put a
simple answer instead give as much
detail as possible in your answer
not as a link so if you have a link
instead say hey you know I think this
link answered your question that's great
and put the link there but also put the
answer that answers our question below
it and say hey I got that's right from
this article so you make sure you give
credit where credit's due
but that way the answer is in the actual
answer here not just add the link
because link expired links expire over
time or they go away or whatever and so
you want the actual answer here because
don't forget you're not just answering
this person your answer the next person
was the same or a similar question so
that's kind of step one is whenever
possible answer questions but I first
started out on Stack Overflow what I did
was I spent about half an hour and night
for you know two or three nights a week
for probably six months just answering
questions I'd come out and search
through you know all the the ones for
c-sharp and I go okay you know count
exhaust of that mail search for log4net
I know log4net pretty well as well and
look for any without answers or without
except of the answers and then that's a
okay I kind of answered those now let's
look for sequel and then JavaScript and
then you know angularjs or whatever and
have my list of favorites which you can
edit so you can add more tags if you
want but I have that list I go through
and click on them and read through the
questions we look at when it comes to
angular it's just angularjs no I'm sorry
JavaScript so JavaScript s has a
question and asked three minutes ago
four minutes
go set up meant to go 13 minutes ago 17
minutes 21 minutes 20 there's a lot of
questions in the past half hour
okay one two three four five six seven
questions in half an hour that means if
I'm gonna work on the couch for half an
hour
they'll probably set more that come in
in that time so I can go through a lot
of questions and again just answer the
ones I understand but that way I can I
can put answers right away so ya askin
you know three minutes ago I could
answer that question and have it up for
them within 10 minutes which really
makes Stack Overflow happy because
people are asking questions and getting
answers right away and it gives you
first of all a satisfaction of helping
somebody but it also allows you to get
that reputation now notice one
reputation one reputation one reputation
three reputation okay so a lot of people
are asking this is the first step they
took I would encourage you not to be one
of these people because again when you
look at that you say oh the first thing
you did was ask me for help okay
so that's step one become a good citizen
answer some questions now so that later
when you have a question people are more
likely to see you as trying to work
through this and trying to help out and
give back okay so now we have this
question we need to get answered the
next thing to do is not to ask it okay
there's this big blue button that's
begging you to push it ask question
don't push it yet instead you need to
identify specifically what you need in
that word specifically it's really
really important so if you ask the
question how can I get information into
c-sharp that is an awful question and
the reason why is because so generic I
can't answer it so if on the other end
of
this I can't give you an answer it's
gonna help you so instead you have to be
very specific you have to identify the
keywords that question you have to
identify supporting information so let's
talk through this let's say that I am
working in WPF in c-sharp and I'm trying
to get information into a data grid and
I'm using calibre and micro ok so these
are some things that you know I do okay
I work with calibre micro and I'm
putting information data great now I
just can't figure out how you get this
data grid to work all right now again
that's still kind of general but there's
some important things specifically that
can pull out of this this need first of
all let's list them I'm in c-sharp
that's important because you're not in
Java you're not in JavaScript you're not
in sequel you're not in go or anything
else you're in c-sharp second of all I'm
using WPF okay so I'm not using winning
forms I'm not using console and not
using asp.net okay asp.net has a data
grid well it's not the same thing as the
one day OPF what else
well I'm using caliber and micro which
is an mvvm framework okay those are
important pieces well be there again
we're drilling down to a very very
specific situation here and finally I'm
looking at the data grid okay so now
just with those five words and phrases a
person coming in knows exactly what
you're trying to do at least as far as
the technology you're working with now
you ask your question they have it
framed in a very very specific bit of
technology you're working a c-sharp do
PF calibre and micro which is an MV mm
mvvm framework and you're trying to use
the data grid okay that's your
specificity so now you can start looking
at your question which is how do I load
data into the data grid
okay but again that question is a bad
question it that's all you ask when you
have a supporting information it clicks
okay so that we've identified some
specifics we had which are the keywords
and now we should identify a supporting
information okay and by supporting
information I mean this question on its
own doesn't show that you've made any
type of progress in searching on your
own so the first thing to do is actually
start the search on our own okay so what
I would do is that go to Google actually
probably Bing was I use Bing so I would
say c-sharp D F Caliburn Micro and I put
that in quotes and I'll leave nvvm off
because people know caliber micro
knowit's and bbm framer datagrid load
okay so there's my specific C sharp to
EPF caliber Micro data grid and the one
other key word is I'm trying to load
information so that's those are the
keywords let's see what Bing comes up
with all right I don't know if he
updated it agreed guess what
that's Stack Overflow com okay and
here's four more stack overflows alright
and as you can see this was a purple one
we did actually clicked it already all
right okay this person has a question
about how to get information into a data
grid all right this probably answers
your question so if it does not one of
the things I would do is especially
since the Stack Overflow is I would copy
this and I'd paste this link in here and
I would say you may be right above it I
tried
this but it does not work in my
situation because and explain why okay
that way when people look at your
question they're gonna go oh he actually
did Google this he tried in from you
know tried some that seemed like it
might work and it didn't because of this
and it gives them more information but
it also shows hey you're trying
something alright so I would go through
and I would do a couple different
searches I'd searches made I could that
seemed like it made sense how load data
and the data grid into a PF application
that might work I can it's Stack
Overflow so here's a little bit of code
but it looks like this is not mvvm and
so it's not Caliburn micro but is DPF so
this might not work but it might give
you a little bit information to try the
key here is you need to try first your
first response should not be ask
somebody else to do it for me because
that will take people off like nothing
else you look at your question downvoted
you'll get you know you'll lose points
on Stack Overflow because even if it's a
valid question if you haven't tried
something first it shows no effort on
your part and the question becomes why
should I do
work on your part when you're not
willing to do work on your part so make
sure that you do some work alright the
other thing I would do after I'm done
this Google search after I looked
through it exhausted at least the first
two pages I'd say hey there's my video
read that and see if it has he done
datagrid it you know hint it doesn't I
didn't cover datagrid that's one of the
questions people ask about and that will
be coming up in a future video just so
you know but both have a good question
to ask so you know if you exhaust the
first Co pages
and it seems like say you know all these
are not relevant then probably page
three won't be relevant but if you get a
couple in here that are relevant then me
try page three but if you're if you're
in page five six and seven you're pro
not getting good results okay it's
probably not covering what you needed to
but you know what it might be who knows
so do what seems like it's okay but
definitely go through at least two pages
may three be four you even consider
stopping all right so that's one part
you've googled the question using your
specific keywords you pulled out and you
didn't find information or you didn't
find the full picture the other thing
you should do is you should show any
type of code that you have that you
tried okay so I'd write that down
there's no pad as well you know any kind
of code that you did not just you know
simulate insert code here that you tried
so you can show people hey this is what
I'm trying and it's not working okay
because then again it shows effort on
your part it shows like you know I
didn't just say you know someone tell me
how to do this I worked at it I you know
I I discard it in work I googled and
they had some code but that didn't fit
my situation because of this so now you
ask the question how I load they in the
data grid again you have supporting
information you have good keywords and
you showed that you have really worked
hard at this so now that we've
identified a question we're just
simulating here because I don't have a
question yet because honestly if you
like to stack overflow there's 15
million questions on Stack Overflow a
lot of which have been answered so if
you think that your question about a
topic is unique most likely you
wrong most likely someone else has an
stit that's where these good keywords
come into play because if you use good
keywords you're more likely to find
those answers these there's an awful lot
of answers on or questions on Stack
Overflow they get closed because they're
like a similar question that's already
been answered so that's my first
disclaimer is just make sure that you do
a really thorough search both of Google
or Bing whichever you want to do and
also in Stack Overflow itself because
you'll find there's an awful lot of
answers here that probably fit your bill
but if they don't in your rate up to ask
the question click the button and then
it seems simple there's three spots to
fill in but it really isn't quite that
simple
okay the first thing you have to do is
craft a really good title even though
this is the question that's not a good
enough question again it even tells you
be specific so I might say something
like in c-sharp how how do I load data
into the data grid in WPF using Caliburn
micro okay now that's like when I type
that question and there's the question
mark when I type that question it pulled
up some potential questions that have
already been asked the next step needed
to do is check through these and make
sure that you've already looked at all
of these and that none of them satisfy
your question if none of them do then go
on and fill in your question body this
is where you're going to ask a more full
question this is the summary question
they're really punchy short I'm trying
to do this now note I did put a few
keywords in here do you piaf caliber and
micro c-sharp but you want to have the
more full question here this is I'm
trying to do this is not working and
then you bring in your supporting
information I did try the information on
this post but it didn't work because of
this and that's where you've documented
here and then here's the code that I'm
using and it didn't seem to work then
down here you have your tanks
well c-sharp now it's gonna
automatically that then Caliburn micro
woops Caliburn and notices Caliburn dot
micro that's the one you want again the
most the biggest number all right and
that will tell you more about it so okay
it's questions that it's been tagged in
so it's been tagged in 1600 questions so
yes that's the one and then also mvvm
again 20 almost 22,000 questions and
finally datagrid alright and that's
13,000 questions
there's datagridview that's probably
different it's not the one that we're
working with with windows form I said
it's probably the either the data grid
or WPF data grid but that only has two
thousand questions but that is the new
improved one alright so the question is
which one do you use we'll use that one
so tags 5 up to 5
use as many as you can all right but
don't use non descriptive tags so don't
put windows on this question
don't put I don't know programming you
know those are way too broad you want as
specific as possible even that means the
number of questions are tagged in as
smaller that's okay because the people
who can answer those are patrolling out
those smaller pools okay so so that's
you know the five tags I'd put on this
question and I can fill in a whole lot
of details here so be very specific in
your title be very very specific and
clear
don't say I need help don't you know
just that don't say can you fix this for
me say specifically in one sentence what
your problem is and you just use
keywords to kind of narrow that down
especially your programming language
because again every language is on he's
on Stack Overflow so this would be
different if it was Java or if it was
JavaScript or if it was you know
something else
so be very specific there then have all
the relevant details possible in the
body
make sure it's neat and clean don't just
paste junk in there and have the all
over the place
okay format it this little editor here
is great for making sure you make nice
neat formats now if you have some code
that you know it's kind of a bigger
block what you can do is create a gist
so your just G ist github.com and what
this is is you give a description so I'd
call me you know non-working Caliburn
micro data grid code or something
like that and then paste your code here
and can paste mobile files so you can
give a file name paycheck code if you
want to add another file you can once
you do that it'll create a link for you
when you either say create public gist
which is what you want or a secret gist
secret gist he probably want especially
not for Stack Overflow since you're
asking someone for your help
when do you do that so here's what I
created this is a while ago six years
ago so I created this you know little
gist just to kind of show some
information I create and now I can share
this link okay so I can do the embed
code or I can do the the URL I believe
the embed code will work with Stack
Overflow I'm not positive what you can
do is put it in there and see if it
works if it doesn't use the share code
either way just copy it come back over
here and paste it in and that way people
can go to that gist and make sure you
mark as a link like so and then they can
go this link and they can see your full
code all right so that's one of things I
do again gist github.com or if you've
got JavaScript it's something like that
that runs in the browser HTML CSS then
you'd go to code pen oops which is code
penny oh right and it's the same kind of
thing it it creates a gist the only
difference is that it actually allows
people to run the code and see how it
works since this is a HTML CSS or
JavaScript so that's kind of nice and
you can see some some working pens here
if you wanted to or you can create your
own and then you can just link that
right into your post so those things you
can do and again finally add really good
tag
really specific tags and yet the biggest
one of them so I used it Ygritte not do
PDF datagrid and make sure you use five
if they're all relevant if they're not
relevant don't use five now I want to
show you one that I asked because I
think that will give you a good picture
of a question format and I'll leave a
link to this down in the description as
well but this is a question that I had
so I was in a juror and I was with an
azure blob put command and it was
generating errors when it when it used
to work okay so that's the issue I'm
having now notice how formatted this
this is the initial problem I divided
the process as best I can but I see me
stuck so here's the process I'm going
through here is the error I'm getting
here's the request that I'm making of
the server is the actual put command and
here is the SAS key that it generates
which is an important part of it and
then here is the code ok c-sharp code
and I JavaScript code and then this is
what's happening and here's any other
thoughts I have I'm not sure if it
generate the error if the container
existed whatever okay and then my five
tanks JavaScript C sharp cordova asher
and azure storage blobs all right so I
asked this question again I format in
such a way that it's very clear that I'm
not just saying help me I'm saying I'm
stuck and believe it or not people on
the internet love to help others okay
it seems like they don't when they get
all angry and downvote you and and yell
at you and say your question is bad but
when you ask a good question and when
you show that you're willing to put the
work in it's just you're over your head
in something
they are willing to help you out and are
happy to do so so what I did I post this
question no notice I posted this on
November 11th at 1943 and 2006 so we're
talking 23 minutes later I get this this
is a comment now notice this is 2006 at
2011 so five minutes later I respond to
that comment then I get another comment
nine minutes later one minute later
another person posts a comment as well
and then four minutes later another post
and then about thirty minutes later I
actually responded okay now what that is
showing you is when I posted this I was
ready to be available for questions and
that's another important thing you
really should not post this right before
you go to bed because if someone thirty
minutes in or even five minutes in but
again remember when you're being a good
citizen you're kind of watching those
early posts is it just they come on and
trying to answer them quickly so if
someone's doing that for you and you
wait a day to respond you kind of lost
that and me that person who doesn't have
time to come back or maybe they're on to
the next product or they're on their
weekend now or whatever so I always
recommend that you dedicate between one
and two hours not where sand they're
watching it because you can get the
alerts in your phone or in your email
but that you're at least checking in
every 15 minutes or so and you're
available to try things out and to
respond to questions the first hour -
after that
it's okay to wait a couple hours or even
half a day if you're kind of you know
either out of the office or you're going
home to go to sleep or whatever but
don't post this at the end of your day
before you leave work or before you go
to sleep give it some time
so that you can make sure you're
available so what I recommend is if
you're working late at night get the
post ready but don't post it until the
next morning that way you're available
now we went through this and a couple
different people had some suggestions
for me and one of them seemed right this
person's right here I respond the
comments yep that one says right so post
this as an answer I'll give you credit
for it because here it resolved my issue
I was double encoding a string now I'm
not double encoding it and it works
again so this person took their comment
and post it as an actual answer when
they did I accepted the answer now
that's important when you get the answer
you're not done you have to come back
and accept an answer this is one of
those things that again will give you a
bad reputation online if you ask
questions people answer them and you fix
your problem and just go away never come
back then you have not given them
reputation because this gives them
reputation you have not told others if
it worked or not and you've not given
any kind of vote which again gives them
reputation so I said hey I can't mark
this comment as the answer or that touch
this one I had mark it up but I can't
like us as an answer so you gotta
actually post as an answer so I asked
him to do that once he did or she I'm
not quite sure once I did then I marked
as the answer
and I posted down below in the comments
what I did and how it was resolved and
then I also uploaded that way everything
was very clear that this is the right
answer at least in my situation and I
have given this person as much
reputation as I can as a thank you so
that's how you respond once you've asked
the question you monitor your post you
respond to comments as soon as possible
and then when you get a possible answer
like this one I went and tried it okay
that's again that availability I didn't
just say that sounds right I didn't say
I don't think that'll work I actually
tried it when it did work I came back
and said go ahead and make that the
answer and I'll recommend or I will vote
it as the correct answer now there are
times where you post a question and then
you say oh I found the answer but no one
really helped me with that I just found
out on my own in fact let's go - I'll
leave that and delete that post I've got
a question this one right here so I had
this question about angular dragula
without using requirejs now if you don't
know what a is where it's made no
problem
but I had this question again it's a
smaller question and so I didn't have
all supporting information because it
wasn't really necessary so I had the
question here's a little bit of
supporting information the author seems
to think it's simple and there's the
link to that discussion and shut down
similar questions as well but I've
looked at the code and don't see how to
load the module so can you help me well
in the meantime I was still working on
the problem and so I can't the answer on
my own mostly but what I did was I
posted my own answer
and gave all the specifics and then
marked my own answer as the correct one
now I would not do this if somebody else
had come close but no one else really
came close however I did mention that
other people had helped me okay so it
was very clear that I'm not just doing
my own I mentioned that yeah this is
kind of helping us that kind of helped
me and and you know here is the
resulting full answer so if no one
answers your question er comes close to
it but you do find the answer you answer
your question and then market as the
suggested answer because notice 22
people have voted that this is a good
answer so it's not as me I've helped a
22 people at least with this answer
which means that if I didn't post this
and I just posted my question I figured
the answer out myself and just went away
then 22 people at least will be going
well what do I do now they have the full
answer okay
so that's again having a good citizen in
both cleaning up your questions by
answering them if no one else does and
you figure it out and also by giving
full explanations with code when
relevant alright so we've gone through
Stack Overflow and we've seen how to ask
the right question okay by asking a full
question by using our keywords by ask by
making sure that our question we asked
also has good keywords in it and making
sure we have good supporting information
we've also seen how to search through
Bing or Google to make sure that we
can't answer our own question there's an
awful lot of information out there
they'll probably help us we've seen how
search
Stack Overflow as well and also have you
a good citizen on Stack Overflow before
we have these problems that come up that
we really need help on because when
we're helping others others are more
willing to help us okay now when you
sign up for Stack Overflow you will not
have access to do everything that I can
do okay because the more reputation you
have the more trust of you are but if
you go to the Help section go to help
center and go to privileges right down
here and select the full list of
privileges now mine are kind of fade out
because I've achieved all these only
three left but when you start out you
can post questions and answers but it's
not until you get a 15 reputation you
can vote up alright and you can't
comment everywhere until you hit 50
reputation so there's going some
limitations which means that you want to
get through at least 50 reputation
before you have that first question
because you want to be able to leave
comments the the key here is if you
can't leave a comment don't leave it as
an answer and say well I don't have the
reputation to leave it as a comment
that's not okay so make sure that you
have at least 50 reputation reputation
comes quickly every time a person votes
up an answer it gives you 10 reputation
every time a person who votes up one of
your questions say it's a good question
you get five points so getting 50 not
really that hard if you've got a few
questions on there and maybe or I'm
sorry a few answers and maybe even a
question or two but you want to get the
answers in first because you want those
that reputation to move you up to 50 so
five good answers is what you want okay
and if they select your answer as a
correct one you get more reputation as
well I'm not sure how
watch it forget but with that you'll
quickly move up the ranks now if you
leave bad answers or have asked bad
questions and by bad I don't just mean
inappropriate it may be a question like
you know help me do my homework those
kind of things you'll lose reputation if
we go to questions right now we'll
probably find a few that have negative
reputation there's one that had negative
one it's like that one so first of all
it's not in English which that in itself
is not necessarily a problem but if at
all possible
post it in English because that's where
the majority of developers will be able
to understand okay I understand there's
a large communities of developers who
speak another language but a lot of them
also speak English which I find
incredibly impressive especially for
speaking English in a tech field but
that's another story so if you can't
post it in English but whatever reason
at least one person thought this was a
bad question now I can't read it so I'm
not I can't comment on that so that
person lost reputation because of that
so just be aware of that I can't show
you I don't think I've lost
interpretation in a while every once in
a while I do and it's not the end of the
world okay someone says nope that's a
bad answer yep here's one
so 117 people said this is a great
answer one person said no it's not okay
guess what it's the Internet people
gonna be negative it's okay it's not the
end of the world the key is to not give
them fodder by doing something poor okay
so don't don't give them the opportunity
don't give good people the opportunity
to have to down vote you because I have
downloaded questions I've said you know
what that's not a good question and I
downloaded it I feel bad but the reality
is in order to keep Stack Overflow clean
we have to get rid of bad questions and
inappropriate or bad answers and so just
make sure that you're asking good
questions okay so to recap start off by
being a good citizen join Stack Overflow
answer some questions wrath of bat just
spend a little bit of time over time
answering questions whenever possible
number two when you identify you've got
a problem and you don't understand how
to fix it start by identifying this key
information what the keywords are with a
specific question you have is figure out
any code that goes along with it what's
not working then google it or Bing it
and look through all the answers if you
find a post for example this post right
here don't just read the top answer read
all the answers including the windows
negative one and also all the comments
because sometimes the the little nugget
that's gonna help you will be in a
comment not in the answer okay so go
through all those if there's ones that
are close especially on Stack Overflow
but aren't quite right but they'd seem
like the right make sure to put that
your supporting information say I tried
this it doesn't hit my situation exactly
or it doesn't work in my environment
whatever once you have all of that and
once you've searched there Google at
least two or three pages in if not more
then go ahead and craft carefully your
question on Stack Overflow great title
with keywords great tags are specific
and then all the information about your
questions separate in those sections
like I said this is very easy to read at
least in my mind because
it pulls out these different pieces so
that you know exactly what you're
looking at okay here's the error that
I'm getting okay here's the request that
I'm making and so it's very clear these
are the different parts of my question
that's the supporting parts okay once
you have all of that make sure that when
you post it that you post it at a time
when you have time to wait for answers
or wait for comments so that you can
respond to those and if poss if if you
need to you can even edit your question
okay so if you don't have reputation to
post the comments or if someone post a
comment that seems relevant but it's not
really what you have to explain more
edit your question put down here you
know edit and then explain why you're
editing it say okay adding this
information because you know the
question was raised will either this but
but that doesn't work because I'm using
calibre Micro not just straight DPF or
whatever and they give you know some
supporting code for that so your
question if possible or if needed once
you get an answer that works and you've
tested it out and it works make sure to
mark it as the answered question and
give it a a positive reputation of one
at least you know bump it up so you push
this button it'll highlight this you
know give them one more up vote okay you
can't get more than one up vote is one
per person
don't try and game a system okay but up
vote that if there's other answers that
gave part of the answer or that gave an
answer if you were a different situation
give them out though if it makes sense
okay but mark the correct one for you
with the check mark okay mark is the
answer so make sure you do all of that
and you are much much much more likely
to get help on the internet and not get
the angry torts not get the down votes
not get the negativity that a lot of
especially newer developers associate
with asking for help online now if you
have a specific c-sharp question or
maybe it's you're learning something
you're just not quite sure what it means
it's not really a specific question as
in this is not working and how do I get
them to work but more like you know what
is an interface or you know what is unit
testing how does it work in that case
especially if you are a subscriber to my
email list go ahead and either post it
in on my youtube channel under you know
the appropriate video if you're working
through that video or email me directly
if not and I will do my best to answer
you now obviously I can't answer the
entire world's questions but I've kept
up so far with the questions you guys
have been asking and believe me I get
oppai a dozen a week or so larger
questions more than just a you know
appreciate your channel which I I love
those as well but what I've started
doing if you go I am Tim quarry calm and
go to the blog so I am Tim core comm
slash blog you can follow this if you'd
like I'm also gonna start putting out as
a newsletter but what I've started to do
is when I get a question I'll go ahead
and answer it as a blog post and link to
that blog post either in the email or
the the YouTube comments section or the
you know my Facebook group comments
section and so this way you get a more
full explanation of your question so was
a full-stack developer mean this is what
I answered today and so I explained it
you know so here's what you know a
friend developer means a back-end
developer and now we know those two
here's what a full-stack developer looks
like
you can leave a comment down here as
well but this way you the more full
explanation if a co-worker asks you will
like you can send them the link and just
makes it simpler for everybody and it
allows everyone to have access to these
questions because if you're asking the
question or if you're thinking the
question you're not alone there's a lot
of people that have a same question not
everyone asks these questions so if you
ask it and I answer it we're not gonna
help this one person we're a help
multiple so again if it relates a
c-sharp and it's either you know on one
of my videos that I'm talking about
something you have a question on or if
it's you know not really related to a
video but you had a question that you
can't find online or don't really
understand ask me I'll do my best to
answer and I'll probably create a blog
post for this I've got a schedule
without north thirty or so that I've
answered in the past that I'm putting
out but if something comes up in the
meantime I'll go ahead and create a
one-off post for you and shoot you that
link okay so that's again if you're a
c-sharp developer and have some
questions I don't answer questions about
other languages necessarily just because
I don't use a whole lot of other
languages I'm mostly c-sharp and
JavaScript those are my two big ones as
well as sequel so I guess that's a third
but I have dabbled in other languages
but I'm definitely expert in you know
say objective-c or something like that
so with that being said let me know what
you think down below let me know if you
have any questions about this video
ironically and let me know how you make
out when asking questions again go
through the whole process don't just go
right to asking the question but let me
know how you make out and hey you know
what in the comment below link to a
stack overflow question that you have
that you've asked they may we'll look at
I'll look it over and it's a good
question I'll vote it for you give you a
hand that way I'm not finished
though any question but well it's a good
question and may if I have the answer to
I could even answer it so we'll try that
as well
all right so until next time I am Tim
