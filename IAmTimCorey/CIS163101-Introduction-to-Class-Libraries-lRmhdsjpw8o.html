library project here I have my windows
forms project already started and have a
solution called garage software I'm
going to add a new project called a
class library there right click on my
solution and I say add new project and
let's choose class library let's go
ahead and give us a good name like autos
and this will be my autos class library
everything to do with automobiles the
first thing I always do is I delete my
class one CS file
I don't like renaming it because I'm
always afraid I'm gonna miss one of the
places where class was referenced let's
go ahead and delete this and let's add a
new item called the class ok instead of
calling us class 1 let's call this car
and this is our simple car class the
first thing I do is I change it to be a
public class again I'm using Visual
Studio 2013 so you will notice the
little pop-ups here but this will work
just the same in Visual Studio 2012 so
let's go ahead and create a simple class
with a few properties and methods
okay I've named it the make of the car
and I will also do the model now if
you're not familiar that's syntax this
is the what's called an auto property
where you have the get in the set
there's actually nothing here with a
semicolon
what Visual Studio does and what c-sharp
does and the compiler does is it assumes
that you want to create in the
background a private variable and assign
to it and get it okay so it's a very
simple property you can't also do a full
property if you'd like instead but for
this demonstration we're just going to
create a couple of oil properties and
we'll call that good for our class so
this is basically a class library we
have the actual project and then we have
one or more classes if we want to create
a second class we can go ahead and
right-click add new item or just go
ahead here at class so now that we have
our class library the question comes up
why well the class library can be used
in multiple different projects if you're
in the same project same solution as a
user interface project you could go you
your forms UI for example right click on
references and say add reference in
reference the autos class library under
solution projects and that will allow us
to access this class and other classes
in this same project however if you are
not in the same solution as this autos
class library you can reference the dll
directly so for instance if I were to
build this project and then right-click
on a solution and say open folder in
File Explorer go to I autos the bin
directory and debug you see an auto DLL
this gets created for all class library
projects now if we go down here and
let's go back to our forms UI
the bin-debug you'll notice that same
otto's dll has been copied here because
of a reference to that project now if
instead of doing a direct reference we
take this reference away for now
and rebuild our solution let's first
check to make sure that DLL is gone and
it is gone now
if this was not in the same solution we
could references add reference go down
to browse hit the Browse button search
for our project which in this case is
individuals to a 2013 projects garage
software autos bin-debug and there's the
autos DLL I select that I hit OK the
same thing happens as if it were in our
project that allows us to use the same
DLL in multiple projects now to actually
use this reference let's go to my main
cs and let's look at the code behind
right now I just have the public main
event on a form I have this button
called process so let's add an event on
the click and reference this class
library so we'll say autos dot car car
equals new why was that car now notice I
said autos dot car that's because the
namespace
for our car class is autos however I
could add a reference in my using
statement up here so that I don't need
to do autos dot car let's go ahead and
delete the autos dot and the first
you'll notice is he hit that red
squigglies if you select that and hit
control dot it'll drop down menu of
options of what you can do to resolve
this problem the first one is a day
using statement for autos and that puts
it right the top using autos now we can
do car dots make and car dot model
like we normally would so this separates
our logic into class libraries outside
of our user interface class libraries
are a very important part of developing
in c-sharp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
