c-sharp Here I am in Visual Studio 2013
but don't worry if you're using 2012 all
these things still apply I'm in a
console application just because it's
the easiest way to show you how to
interact with code okay the first thing
I want to create is a variable let me
create one then we can go over what it
really means what I'm doing string which
is the type of the variable demo which
is the name of that I give to the
variable and then the initial assignment
in this case two quotes with nothing in
between which would be an empty string
so the type of variable indicates what
the data looks like that we stored
inside of this variable in this case any
string did it they can have numbers in
it it can have letters in it it can have
special characters like exclamation
point or asterisk when we assign to it
if we are typing directly in the console
to assign to it we need to make sure you
wrap things in quotes you can also have
an integer variable for example that
hold only whole numbers or a boolean
variable which holds only true or false
the variable type determines what can be
held inside of the variable the name of
the variable is important in the fact
that it ascribes what the variables job
is however you can name your variable
just about anything the one thing I'd
caution you with is to try to avoid
keywords so for example I would not name
this string because that would conflict
with the type finally you want to assign
an initial value to your variable in
most cases you don't have to but this
gives you a common starting point that
you know
what the initial value is you could for
example put test data inside your
assignment but typically for a string I
like to do just two quotes justice will
show you the differences let's create an
integer in a boolean
okay so here's an integer my number and
I set the initial value to zero notice
no quotes because it's a number then we
have a boolean value which again boolean
is only true or false and I assign it
the keyword of false now there are many
other variable types that you can get
into including custom variable types
that you create but for the sake of this
demo let's stop there the next thing I
look at is the if-then statement if you
come from a visual basic background you
will typically think of if as if then if
something then I do this well in c-sharp
it's a bit different in the fact that we
type if we put our comparison inside of
parentheses and then we put our curly
braces if this is true do this okay so
there is no then showing up anywhere is
no then here but the function is the
same so if whatever is in here evaluates
the true okay so right now I have one
equals zero which would always be false
okay but there's a couple things I want
you to note first I have two equal signs
here the reason for that is because one
equal sign is an assignment that is
saying that one should be filled with
zero well one is not a variable first of
all and second of all we should not be
doing assignments and if statement
therefore we need two equal signs if you
would like to do not equals if you
replace one of the equal signs with a
bang symbol
this now says if one is not equal to
zero now comparing constants like one
and zero isn't typically a good idea
because this will never change however
if we change this to say if my number
remember up here we've started off at
zero if my number is not equal to zero
then do this this would be more useful
so for example we could say
console.writeline you entered a number
of
and there we go so now I should say you
enter a number of and put your number
this right here gets replaced by this
variable so that's the if statement but
what if we want to say otherwise
so if my number is not equal to zero do
this otherwise or the key word here
would be else else
you can write this so if my number
equals zero we're going to assume that
my number has not been changed from the
initial value therefore we write you
have not updated my number so the if
statement works by saying if a statement
in parentheses that evaluates a true or
false if it's true whatever's inside the
curly braces gets run and if you have an
else statement which is optional you do
not need to have it if this statement
evaluates to false the else statement is
fired in this Co is read run
that's our if statement now let's look
at a bit more complicated statement in
the switch statement and I'm gonna use
the snippet here by typing a switch and
then typing tab tab let's do it again I
start typing a switch you know us here
in this drop-down menu I have this
little white paper icon and I mouse over
and it says code snippet for the switch
statement
press tab twice to insert so I press tab
and there we go a switch statement is
similar to an if statement in that
evaluates something inside of
parenthesis however it does not evaluate
for true or false
instead it compares what's inside the
parenthesis to each case let's see how
that works I'm going to put my variable
demo which remember is a string variable
and put demo into the parentheses then
I'm going to say case and I put a
constant here let's put John
and say you are my son okay so if you
type in John or if Jonah is contained in
a demo string variable then let's write
this out console.writeline and then
every case needs to have a break at the
end of it
this tells the compiler I'm done with
this case note that we have to have a
colon semicolon after the constant so I
have case I put my constant John and
then a colon this is going to compare
the demo variable to the John constant
if a two are the same it's going to
execute all the code after the colon
right here before the break
so unlike the if statement that has the
curly braces this has a colon and a
break to separate out the code now I can
have as many cases that I want for
example I can say case charity
and say you are my wife and again I have
my break statement now what if the
person types in Bob well Bob is not John
and Bob is not charity
so both comparisons will fail so it will
fall down to this default case this is
the catch-all for a switch statement and
it is very important that you can taint
you have a default case if you don't and
no case matches you get an exception a
error exception thrown so let's go ahead
and put a console.writeline here it says
I do not know you and break there okay
this default acts just like any other
case except it does not have a constant
to compare and it always runs if nothing
else is matched think of this like our
else statement here these are all if
statements if John equals the value of
demo then do this if charity equals the
value of demo then do this else do this
okay so that's our switch statement
that's our if statement and these are
our variables with that you have a good
start to Visual Studio and c-sharp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
