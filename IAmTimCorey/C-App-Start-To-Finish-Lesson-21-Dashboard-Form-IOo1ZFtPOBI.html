start to finish course my name is Tim
quarry and today we're going to wire up
the tournament dashboard form this will
be the form that starts when our
application starts it's a fairly easy
form so it shouldn't take us too long to
get this running let's jump right in and
get started here we have our form and
it's really only a couple things it does
first it loads the list of tournaments
we already have existing in our system
and if one of them meets the desire for
what you want to open you would select
it and then click load tournament
otherwise if you want to create a
tournament you click this button down
here now we haven't actually wired up
the load tournament button yet or the
form yet so this button won't really do
anything yet but the create tournament
we already have that form already set up
so we can go ahead and connect to that
form and loading this list right here
we've got most the code for that already
so we can definitely go ahead and do
that as well so let's start by wiring up
this drop down so we can go in the code
behind by hitting f7 this is a code
behind for our form now in here we want
a list that supports this drop down this
drop down is for tournament model since
called load existing tournament drop
down so let's create a list of
tournament model
the control dot and I either spelled it
wrong or we have something else wrong so
yes I butchered it Wow
I can spell today that'd be great using
tracker library dot models alright so
that works now and tell assigns is
wonderful it saves me from a whole lot
of spelling errors so let's call this
tournament's equals and let's not do a
new list yet let's actually say global
config control dot and the using
statement here two dot and we need to do
connection but it's not finding that yet
so let's find out why and the reason why
is I have an equal equals global config
dot connection dot and there's get team
underscore all and get personal
underscore all what we want is going to
be the get tournament underscore all and
that doesn't exist yet
so let's create that so in our IDE
connector or connection we're going to
create a list of tournament model called
get tournament underscore all so let's
implement that let's go a sequel
connection or connector first and we'll
do a control dot and we'll implement
that interface now if we scroll down
here we've
should find something similar like this
right here in a copy this pattern and
then down here I'm going to paste that
pattern so it's gonna be a list of
turnip model not person model and so
everything else looks correct except for
the fact that we have to get a store
procedure to look up that tournament
information so we need to do is we have
change this over to be our tournaments
are down we have here we have a SP
tournaments on a score get all and what
that does it just grabs the tournaments
table and grabs all the active ones in
this case we have just one tournament
here so we're gonna take this name right
here we'll copy this we'll come back
here and replace this so now note that
back over here in our database is the
tournament name the entry fee and
whether or not it's active and the ID
and that's it that's all there is to the
tournament record but we're filling a
tournament model which has so much more
stuff in it if we look at the model
itself we see we have the ID deterrent
name
the entry fee which we haven't covered
yet that's not the apart of this
tournament seems like let's go back and
check Oh yep there's the entry fee okay
the entry fee so we have the idea
tournament named the entry fee we don't
care about active we're leaving it alone
we may change that ID later or add that
that field later for your side we need
it but we have the entered teams we have
the prizes and we have the match up
rounds and all of these we null or empty
begin with
it'll mean all the empty so you populate
those as well so this is just step one
so
once we have our list then we need to
populate prizes populates the teams and
populate rounds so how you gonna
actually do this job well it's actually
not that hard
I'll put right above these these
comments I do a for each we're gonna say
tournament Model T in output so for
every tournament in the output which is
our list of tournaments we're going to
do this code and here's why on each one
of these tournaments we have to load
these things individually only to pass
in the ID for example up here in our get
team on our score all we load all the
teams but then for each team we loop
through using the team ID we got the
team members by team ID and load that in
the team members list we're doing
something very similar where we're gonna
loop through the prizes where I say
here's the prizes for each tournament by
term ID and then the teams and we'll
need it actually for the teams go to
layers deep and get the team members by
the team ID and then from there we'll
also get the rounds and have to go
through and get all the different levels
there so it'll be a little bit bigger
but nothing really terribly scary it's
stuff we've done a number of times
already in different formats so let's
start with a prizes let's go to our
database
and we're going to say SP prizes get by
tournament let's modify this and look at
it it's a little slow there we go okay
so you pass in a tournament ID and it
gives us all the prizes based upon the
tournament ID and so he goes back
essentially a list that looks like this
so we just need a call this that's
really all there is to it for prizes so
we're going to say
TDOT prizes equals connection query this
is a prize model query DB o dot ASP
prizes underscore get by tournament ID
and the end of this that say dot two
lists and now our prize is we populate
for each tournament model inside of our
list next we need to load the teams so
let's first take this comment and cut
out I'm gonna paste there just so we
have that identify what we're doing now
for the prizes I'm sorry for teams it's
gonna look similar to this where first
we load our teams to list not all of
them but the ones associate with this
tournament and then we take that list
and look for each team member based upon
that team ID so let's actually copy that
it'll paste it down below and just
change the values as necessary so T dots
teams it's not teams entered teams
equals connection that query team model
but it's not SP team on our score kit
all to go back over to our sequel we'll
see we have a SP team underscore get by
tournament
yes you passing the tournament ID and
will come back is a list of teams for
that tournament so we'll change that and
now we'll do a for each non output but
on T I entered teams and so now for each
team in the entered teams list we'll
find all the team members using the same
query because that works that's looking
at by team ID which we have and so
therefore I'd say for each team the
members should be this return value
these people so that should take care of
populated teams again just using a
reusing the same code we had and just
tweaking a bit we had to use a different
store procedure to get just the teams
for this tournament versus all the teams
but that's the only difference between
get team underscore all and this one
we're got just by the tournament so that
leaves us with the more complicated one
which is the rounds let's just paste
this in up here and we'll get rid of it
down below and so this is where we have
to populate those rounds let's look at
our database first and see we have we
have SP matchups get by tournament and
SP matchup entries get by matchup so
that's we're going to need to look up
and use so let's modify to match up
first and what this does is it grabs the
matchup information based upon the term
ID and so if we were pass a tournament
ID in of one and run this we get back
these values
so that's that's good so let's just we
won't actually save that change I may do
the query so let's grab the espy
matchups get by tournaments and let's
look before we do at our matchup model
we have four values ID the entries which
either populate later the winner which
is a team ID without seeing a team model
which don't have a team model for that
either figure that out and the match up
round so if we were to do it again
the winner is either going to be in a
sequel it's gonna be null or it's going
to be an ID now just a couple of things
to note here first of all the winner is
coming back as a winner ID but yet in
our code we just have a winner but
that's a whole object so that's a that's
being a problem we have to resolve is we
can't populate an object from sequel a
nested object we have to populate it
afterwards like with this list of
matchup entry model will populate that
after we've loaded this object and so we
can't put it there and not even call
this in it's called winner versus winner
ID and we have this extra column here
called team name which that's joined on
the winner ID and so if we have a winner
in the winner ID column we'll have a
team name as well which is it's a nice
thing for us to have it's not necessary
for us for this lookup so I'm think we
might actually just get rid of that
let's take that out and take out then of
course this t dot t name and let's run
this again and just see
yep it still gives us the same
information it's just that now it gives
us no extra information so let's do the
alter on that which is already set up
for altar procedure so I'll run that so
now I make a slight modification to our
our store procedure nothing too big but
we do know that it's returning a winner
ID and so we're gonna handle that over
in our code the best way I can think of
right now to handle this is actually to
add new property the only time we'll use
this property is we're bringing in from
sequel
so the winner ID is going to be the ID
from the database that will be used to
look up the winner or to identify how
about that okay so we're gonna pass in
this winner ID but winner won't be
populated but we need winner t populated
for everything else and so we'll go
ahead and get that populated once we've
loaded up the data so let's start by
just having a list of matchup model
called matchups and that's all it's
going to be well say equals connection
dot query match up model I've been dbo
dots let's go back to our store
procedure and grab that name and there
you go paste it in and we'll grab all
the rest of stuff as well
just we keep that that same format and
we're not passing in anything for a
parameter so we can actually take that
parameter off and now it should be good
oops we are passing in a parameter let's
change that we need to create this VAR p
and pass in the tournament ID and that
is from t dot ID so we pass a tournament
ID and let's verify that we're passing
the term ID right there and that's
what's used to look up our records and
get only a matchups that are for our
tournament now once we have them we need
to populate a couple of things first of
all we need to populate we're into for
each here and let's say matchup model m
in matchups and just like up here with
our team model we're going to declare a
new lookup so we'll copy all this and
say ok the first thing to do is look up
our matchup entries so let's go in to a
new variable it goes into m dot entries
and this will be a matchup entry model
we will not pass in our tournament ID
we'll pass in our matchup ID and so that
would be m dot ID and how I know that
well back over here in sequel we created
this
Espie matchup entries underscore get by
matchup if I modify this we're passing
in the matchup entry we call it entry
instead of ID let's actually change that
to ID to be consistent I don't believe
we use this anywhere else the the thing
to be cautious about is if you've used a
store procedure somewhere else you just
broke it everywhere else so what I would
do since I know only my code has been
using this database I can do a ctrl F in
here paste in my store procedure name
say the entire solution and it says I
can't find any reference to that so
that's good because I don't need to
change any signature then I don't mean
to change it from match of entry to
match up ID so in here we can now run
this so that's been updated and then
grab this name of store procedure and
paste it in right there now we've
populated our match up entries and just
to verify what goes in there we can
actually run just part of this stored
procedure and see we have a match up ID
a parent match up ID team competing ID
and a score what we have in our match up
entries model we have the team competing
the score and the parent match up and
the ID so we need to pass in these IDs
parent match up ID and team competing ID
and look both of those up by their
respective IDs so same pattern here
prop int team competing ID and the
parent matchup ID all right so now these
two values II populated these IDs but
not their actual models that they are
representing so let me go do that as
well so those are three things we need
to do now let's come back over to our
sequel connector
now if populate our entries we're going
to loop through each entry and populate
the actual models for matchup model and
team model and we're also going to need
to outside the loop for this entries
we'll need to populate our team model
based upon the winner ID so let's get
started
I doing a for each and if you get a
little bit lost or if you think oh I'll
never forget that
don't try and keep in your head ran a
piece of paper or put in code comments
okay so we get put in code comments
right up here something like you know
populate each entry to models and
populate each matchup one model just we
have an idea of what we're doing and
those notes are all up to you how you I
make them look
so for each matchup entry in entries now
we can say is we need to loop through
and find each ID we need to populate we
need to populate the team competing
based upon team competing ID let's start
there so I'm first gonna do a check to
see if me dots team competing ID is
greater than 0 now it'll be 0 if we
don't have a team competing ID it's not
going empty like we wouldn't have in a a
text file we have to have a number here
so it it defaults to 0 because there is
no ID ever of 0 we have our auto
incrementing ID fields we always start
at 1 therefore ideas 0 means it's not
really a valid ID so if match up entry
dot team competing ID is greater than 0
then we defined that team and populate
it well if we look up here we have this
method called get team underscore all
not only to get all the teams
it also populates all the members for us
in that case what we can do is actually
use this list to grab out we can call
this and then find just the team we need
it doesn't make sense though to put that
inside a for each loop and look it up
twice so let's look it up right here
where we'll say a list of team model all
teams
equals get team underscore all this will
be all the teams now that are available
to us
so we can say em e dot team competing
equals all teams dot where x equals
greater than X dot ID double equals and
we have the ID we're looking up which is
me dot team competing ID first and there
we go
so we've done here is we've said in all
the teams find the one that has the ID
that matches the ID we're looking for if
you find it grab the first record
because it returns a list of teams and
we should only have one in that list
therefore got the first one put that in
a team competing spot we loop through
both entries and we're done so that's
pretty simple now let's do the same for
matchup model so we'll come down here
and say if me dot match up model ID is
greater than zero we need to look up the
match up model and this story get a
little tricky and sometimes tricky can
be bad but I think in this case it's
okay and so I want to talk it through
the first though so right now we are
loading our entire tournament and one of
the steps in doing that is loading all
the round information and the first step
we did was we loaded all the matchups
and I loop through each matchup and said
okay here's how to populate more
information about that matchup now these
matchups are in order
if we go back over here and look at this
stored procedure
let's grab SPM
chops get by tournament believe is the
one yep so if we look here oops all this
changes to a one
notice that the match up round is in
order now that's because it's just how
it's put in database which we could rely
on but let's go even further let's
change that back but then what we're
gonna say order by match up round and if
you don't specify a direction it will
give a direction of ascending therefore
if we change this back to one run us
again nothing seems to have changed
which is good because we want but if we
ever got out of order in our database
it's not a problem because we're getting
ordering by our match up round and we'll
update that so we can rely on the fact
that the first match up in our matchups
list that we populate is going to be
from round one and all round one
matchups we loaded before we go around -
well this parent ID is for the previous
rounds information that means that we
should have in this list of matchup
model the parent that we're referring to
therefore we could say me dot parent
matchup equals match ups dot where x
equals greater than X dot ID equals
double equals me dot parent match up ID
first and done that should be able to
find the parent basically fact we've
already loaded them in now it is a
little circular and we've already seen
what circular
and do if we're not careful if you don't
think through all of the implications
but in this case the only thing would
really happen is we just look up here if
it can't find it it will blow up on this
first if it happens then we'll address
it by some other means but doing this
say there's a whole bunch of work of
loading every matchup and then doing
essentially all this work for every
matchup and then looking up to find the
parent ID so hopefully we can keep this
in place otherwise we'll have to go back
to the drawing board and figure out a
more efficient than a better plan but I
think bit should work so we've gone
through the entries we had two models to
populate and that's done so now back or
a matchup model and we have to get the
team model for winner well we're already
looking up team information so we can do
that either right below or right above
this for each let's do it right above so
we're gonna say if M naught M e m dots
winner ID is greater than 0 m dot winner
equals all team's dot where x equals
greater than X dot ID double equals m
dot winner ID dot first open closed
paren and semicolon and now we've
populated the matchups model as well
so in theory we have now loaded all the
round information we have not yet
populated the rounds but we at least
loaded up into this matchups list next
we'll have to loop through and put
together all of our different rounds but
first I noticed I have an error up here
it's kind of hard to see if you have a
one character variable but if you can
see that there's actually a little red
squiggly underneath the P and if I right
click on it it should come up at some
point I said the mouse over yes a local
or parameter named P cannot be declared
in this scope because that name is used
in closings local scope to the final
local or parameter essentially that
saying is you've declared P in here but
then down below in the parent scope you
declared P again well it's a really easy
way to fix this we can declare P at the
using level and then just reload it
every time we need it and that solves
that problem quite handily all right so
that takes care of that error which is
good now our our files not yelling a say
as an error but now we have to address
the idea of populating these rounds how
we undo that so in case you've lost
track of where we're at let's review we
are trying to get all of our tournaments
so we're looping through every
tournament we've returned and in this
loop the tournament model are working on
is label as T so T dot prizes load that
up t dot enter teams load that up and
then cycle through and add the team
members
and then the hard one or at least the
more complicated one it's not hard this
is more complicated came with the rounds
and so now we have this matchups which
if we come down here to the bottom is 4
notice I'm use my guides here so I can
say the bomb is for or for each my
matchups we completely taken care of and
now I can loop through and put these
into rounds now remember my rounds are a
list of a list of matchup model so how
we gonna put this into the right place
well let's do a for each on our matchup
model and we just did a for each but
this for each we're working on the
models we're adding stuff I don't want
to get the two confused so I'm gonna
separate them out you could put the
logic for this in the same for each but
I'm going to keep it separate and it
makes it a little more understandable
what's going on each section so for each
matchup model m in matchups same exact
signature so now I can loop through and
create my lists and actually right above
here I'm it creates a list of matchup
model called current row and I will
initialize that I'm also going to
capture the int current round
I'm gonna start the off in round one not
round zero so what's gonna happen is I'm
gonna do a loop I'm going to say first
of all if m dots match up round which
that's an int if m dot match up round is
greater than current round
that means you've moved to the next
round
now I do this right away before you do
anything else and the reason for that is
because if we've changed rounds we have
to some housekeeping before we add that
anywhere so what the round has changed
what we're gonna do is say that T dot
rounds dot add current row so that's the
list of match up model now you haven't
put anything in there yet don't worry we
get to that but the very first we do is
check to see if we've changed rounds
because if the match up round is two
that means we've completed round one
which means that this current row should
have all of the round one information
therefore add that to our rounds then
current row equals new list of match up
model and current round the color equals
I'm sorry plus equals one so move to the
next round so that's what happens if the
round has changed but well if the rounds
the same well in that case we're gonna
say current row dot add M so let us walk
this through we have say three matchups
the first two are for round one the
second one is for round two
this starts off at round one so it comes
in and says the current match up round
well that's round one is that greater
than round one No
therefore just add that first match up
to our current row go the next match up
it's match up round is also round one is
that greater than round one No therefore
just go down here and add the second
match up to our current row go back up
to the top that match up round is - is
that greater than the current round yes
therefore add the current row which of
those two matchups add that to the
rounds so our list of match up model
which contains two matchups gets add to
our rounds then we clear out the current
row so we can add new rap new matchups
to it and we change the current round to
two then we add the current match up to
our current row we go to the top we only
had three therefore we're done therefore
at the end of this we have to say
current row dot oops not current row it
would be T dot rounds dot add current
row so we have to add that last row in
and that should populate our list of a
list of match up model so we can save
this and there's all of our code for the
get tournament underscore all now all
that codes in one file it really easily
refactored so we have some more useful
functions we could probably use some
other places but for right now we'll
leave it as it is and we'll come back
over to our form and we're see we're
gonna call that four
and that should populate our tournaments
so in theory were done on a sequel side
before we compile though we have to take
care of the text connector as well
otherwise the data connection will
yellow that's because we've not yet
implemented our interface so I just
implemented that interface and now down
here we have get tournaments underscore
all they may be saying oh no we do all
that logic all over again but different
for text files you ask me really hard
he'll probably look something like this
copy paste that's it why was it so easy
well because we're our text files we
have to load the turnip model and
hydrate it before we can then add one
more tournament therefore we have a code
already for getting all the tournaments
therefore with that one copy-paste we
have implemented fully the text file
interface now last test to make sure
this works
so again if we've forgotten let's close
out everything else well save all that
and we're gonna open up our dashboard so
you can see it we're populating this
drop-down right here the load existing
tournament drop-down how we do that
well let's create a private void wire up
let's call wire up lists and in here
we're going to say I keep forgetting
that name this is called the load
existing tournament drop-down so we're
gonna say load existing tournament
drop down dot data source equals
tournaments and they're going to say
load existing tournament drop down what
is a long name dot display member equals
and we have to pick one property from
our tournament model if we look
tournament name sounds pretty good you
want to create any kind of other
property for it that was pretty
descriptive so now we just need to call
this wire up lists and as long as we do
it after we initialize our lists which
we are is we're in a constructor and
this has already been run so once we
once we populate this and then run this
which just happens in the constructor
then we should have a drop-down that's
filled with all our tournaments now
let's run this to find out but in order
to do that we have to a program we can
keep it text file for now but we
shouldn't be using the create tournament
form we should be using the tournament
dashboard form the form eventually want
to be to startup form so let's run this
and now if we move our file over we have
it might work and now question mark
those are two tournaments we have in our
list that works let's change this over
to be the sequel connector run again and
we get an error and before we even read
the error message hopefully by looking
at the code you should be able a spot
our issue in fact you may have been
yelling the screen saying Tim you forgot
something Tim you forgot something it's
yeah that's a pretty glaring why I
forgot so let's look at whether the
error says in case you haven't caught on
yet and no worries if you haven't
but it says procedure or function SP
prizes on a score get by tournament
expects the parameter at term ID which
is not supplied and what do you mean I
didn't supply it well yeah didn't supply
it okay so down here we've passed in you
know tournament ID to our parameters and
then pass it in there we in do that up
here so let's populate that and then
let's make sure we add the other
information here and I'll move my cursor
up and so now we've passed in the
correct parameter but before we get too
cocky we have a same issue right down
here with our team's so let's make sure
we copy these lines and do the same
thing for our team as well
let's it continue and now we have our
first tourney which is our only
tournament which means that both sequel
and text files are now working to
populate this box perfect all right so
we're not going to wire out this load
tournament because we don't actually
have the the form wired up you have to
do anything so we're not going to mess
with that because we have to pass that
tournament in and so let's wait to the
next video for that but we can call the
Create tournament form now the question
is going to be where does the create
turnit form go once it's created a
tournament and this is the one we
agonize over because of all the logic
behind it we're gonna have to add a
little more I'm sorry but don't worry
it's not a big deal
but what happens we crit we click this
button after the tournament has been
created do we come back to our form here
and as have it add to the list
or do we
go right to the tournament viewer I'm
thinking the best option here is to go
right to the tournament viewer the same
as if you clicked load tournament that
makes the most sense to me so let's do
that which means that this button right
here the only thing it needs to do is
open the Create tournament form and that
is easy to do well double click on our
create tournament we're gonna say create
tournament form and we'll call this frm
equals new create turret form frm dot
show that's it we create an instance of
that class and then we say dot show
which actually launches the form to show
us works let's start this up will say
create tournament and that pops off this
form right here in fact it could go
through and save all the information
just make sure it all works
and let's add another prize as well just
we have a couple prizes in here
I'll make this 25 so now we have three
teams two prizes and we can say create
tournament which seems to do nothing and
that's okay because it will go to that
other forum when it's done but if we
were to start this back up our drop-down
should now have first tourney and second
tourney now why did I stop it and
restarted well when you create that
tournament it never lowered this back up
it never said hey you know we've we've
loaded we need a new tournament loaded
so we can also address that in a future
video
as an improvement to actually make sure
we refresh this list whenever tournament
is created but for today this forum is
done we've gotten all the work done it
needs to do we lower the list which is a
little tricky for sequel it was very
very easy for text files and we wired up
the create tournament button to actually
launch the create tournament forum so
that's it for today in our next video
we're going to tackle the tournament
viewer forum and get that started the
turret viewer forum is our last forum we
have to do and just to get a quick
preview we're going to load all the
rounds into our list here and say round
1 round 2 round 3 and based upon which
round we're going to select red spray
all the information about that round and
we're wipers check box to make sure we
say if you want to have only unplayed
gains list in the list or not
when we select again a matchup it's
going to allow us to see which two teams
are playing and then we can enter in a
score and hit the score button which
will
identified who the winner is who the
loser is and marked that that match up
as complete so there's a couple things
we have to do there but that will allow
us to walk through the entire tournament
and complete all the the matchups so
we're getting very close it's the last
forum we have to tackle before we come
back through and do a couple things like
exception handling and logging and other
cleanup like sending email out and if
you're one of the paid subscribers
you'll also get the video on hesse and
text messages which be fun so but that's
that's for the next video we'll cover
the tournament viewer so stick around
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
