create a quick video to introduce my new
c-sharp application from start to finish
course in this course I'm going to show
you step-by-step guide to application
from its idea stage all the way through
being built a lot of you have requested
it type of video
and you can't do everything me in just
one video so I decided to do an
experiment I have built an entire course
for you and I give it away for free each
week I'll release a new lesson you'll be
able to follow along right along with me
by the time we're done you'll see a
number of valuable parts about building
application and they'll all be in
context of actually building an
application so let's talk about where
we're going to build and then we'll get
into the areas we're not cover in this
course so the idea for this application
is that our friend wants us to build a
tournament tracker something that can be
used to track a game term of some kind
for example in America we just finished
the NCAA basketball March Madness
tournament in it 64 teams plays there's
six rounds of single elimination games
to determine the champion the brackets
look like this now if you're outside the
US you might be more familiar with the
elimination portion of the World Cup
after the group stage your main teams
place single elimination games to
determine the eventual winner our friend
wants an application that can run these
type of tournaments so think office
tournaments or recreational league
tournaments and that's we're building so
now let's discuss the technologies that
we end up using this course we arrive at
the conclusion that a win form
application is probably our best for now
but we also set everything up to be
easily changed over to an asp.net MVC
application or a DPF application or
something else entirely we don't want to
commit to a single database solution
either so we end up building two
different types of data storage both
Microsoft sequel server as well as txt
file storage now other technologies
included
our dapper we do a lot of linked we do a
lot with interfaces especially with our
data storage so he's storing either
sequel or text files and the way I flip
that over is easily done using
interfaces we don't actually ever talk
directly to the code that writes a
sequel or to the text files also we do
emailing from c-sharp we have custom
events and we even get into advanced
debugging in this course and the reason
why is because everything is done screen
and so sometimes you have bugs in your
application well we have bugs too but
we're going to fix them on screen so all
told is over 25 hours of in-depth
real-world training now honestly giving
away this much solid content for free
isn't something most people would do
especially since creating it isn't free
however I always want to give you more
value than you ever pay for my goal is
to get individuals started and that
probably means you don't have a big
company behind you paying the bills but
if you can afford it then paying a bit
would make a big difference in how many
videos I can produce
therefore I've create a paid version of
this course now it's on I am Tim quarry
comm there's a link down below
now here's what I did if you buy my
course for $67 I will give you the
following extras first of all you get
all 27 video lessons right away you
don't have to wait for them what you do
on YouTube every one of them is ad free
on YouTube you'll see little ads here
and there for hey go ahead and you know
buy this course or head up this other
thing going on so as we'll add here and
there plus the YouTube ads on my site
they're all bad free I'm also giving a
bonus 28th lesson on text messaging so
we're going to send text from our
application as well as certain emails
now that's not dependent on the
application meaning you're not going to
miss anything if you don't get that
lesson
if you do the YouTube route and just
watch it for free don't think like the
applications incomplete this is
definitely a bonus lesson I'm also
giving away the source code for this
project if you watch on YouTube you can
see all the source code and if you were
a type along with me you would have all
the source code but if you want to
download the source code right away you
can go ahead and do that in the paid
version also I use git which means that
after every lesson where we modify the
code I checked that code in which means
that you can actually dial back in time
and see my code as it stands at a
certain lesson point also I'm get away
all the database scripts so the entire
database for sequel that we created just
for this application you can rebuild
that in your environment as well I also
wrote a 44 page course companion guide
now that guide talks you through some of
the things we're doing on video and kind
of spawns in certain areas kind of
expands on a little bit it also talks
through in text some of those trickier
bits plus if you buy this course before
April 15 2017 now I know cell you may be
watching after that and I apologize you
missed it but if you buy this course
before April 15 2017 I will send you my
personal five-step cheat sheet I have
played out a project now if you've
missed it again I'm sorry but if you
jump on my mailing list you get a heads
up on all special offers including some
offers I only send out to my email list
so many tell you want to do so that's
the plan now make sure you're staying
informed of each video as it gets
released make sure to subscribe but also
hit that little bell icon and when you
do make sure the checkbox is checked for
send me all notifications otherwise you
might not get a notification that a new
videos been posted a post one every
single week now let's address a couple
of concerns that I'm sure will come up
first yes this course is entirely free
on YouTube you don't get the extras and
you'll miss out on that one bonus lesson
but that's it so then course we entirely
free second if you want to do a schedule
of what's coming up go to I am Tim
quarry calm and look at this course you
will see all the lessons there you can't
actually view them which is Elysia the
title of the lesson you'll know it's
coming up next and third yes
I'll still be releasing standalone
videos on YouTube in fact I have a video
coming up soon that you'll see as well
so some weeks you're going to get two
videos not just the one video so I think
that covers it so let's jump right into
lesson number one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
