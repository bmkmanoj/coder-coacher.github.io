extension methods in c-sharp before we
get into what extension methods are and
how they work I want to go over a little
demonstration that will show us first of
all how we could do something and then
how extension methods could make it even
easier okay what we have here is a
simple console application the console
application asks you for input for value
X and input for value Y it then takes
those two values converts them to double
multiplies them together and gives you
the result okay very simple if we would
run this it looks something like this I
asked for X three point two five
y four point eight nine the product is
fifteen point eight nine two five okay
very very simple but what we have here
is something that could pop up in your
programming over and over and that is
the the need to convert a string to a
double okay so we're reading information
from the console it always comes back to
us as a string but then sometimes we say
well that's not really a string it's
actually a number I need to convert it
to a number so what we do is here is
we're doing a try parse what that does
it takes the string value and it
attempts to convert it to a double and
if it succeeds this tryparse returns
true which I'm ignoring and it puts the
value in X if it fails it does nothing
to X and returns a false so I'm doing
this twice if we had you know ten
numbers that's gets very complicated
inside of our code and there's a way to
make this code easier do things once you
know don't repeat yourself so the first
way you could tackle it would be to
create a mini static
that handles that conversion for you
let's go ahead and do that right click
on my project I'm gonna say add class
and we'll call this converters because
they'll probably be more in the future
you know two decimal two into those kind
of things so let's make this a public
static class and the reason making it
static is because the fact that we don't
intend to save things in this class
long-term it's just for passing
information in and immediately getting
information back so our first method
public static double convert stranded
vessel
and we'll call it input make things very
clear and then our double would be
output and we'll initialize that to a
value of zero so we do the same thing we
did in our static void main which is to
say double dot tryparse
and we'll take that input as our string
and say out output and we'll go ahead
and return the output okay so this
method does the same thing that we do
here it is just once so you can just
call this method over and over and save
ourselves and the complexities that way
down the road if we said you know what
we want to go ahead and handle that
boolean that tripart returns we want to
say you know if it fails throwing
exception or if it fails log something
or something like that we could do that
we do it in one place not in multiple so
to implement this we can even do it
right here on the initialization and say
converters dots convert stray and
decimal and we pass in the first value
and we can do the same thing here for
our Y value
and then we've just eliminated the need
for these two lines okay that works
and we've eliminated a couple lines
we've made it so that if we need to
update how the conversion works in the
future we can do that in one place and
that's a pretty good refactor but one of
the things that it does lack is
simplicity when whenever we get a string
in and we want to convert it we have to
go to converters dot convert strand
decimal and pass the value in and then
get the value back that works we use it
for a lot of different things but this
is a place where an extension method
could make could make things even
clearer and easier to understand use so
let's go ahead and go over here to our
converters and instead of having that
convert string a decimal we're gonna
create an extension method now extension
methods must be in a static class and
they must be static themselves since we
already have a static class that's not a
problem we'll go ahead and just add a
new method inside here so we'll call
this public static double just like the
other one and we'll call this two double
now the big difference here is instead
of just taking a string input we're
gonna say this string input
now the reason for this is because we're
telling the compiler that this is going
to attach to a type string so whenever
we have a type string this method will
be attached to it and I'll show you how
that works in just a minute let's go
ahead and take this exact same code
let's copy it and paste it right in and
there you go we just create an extension
method let's see how that works instead
of having this whole list here we can
just say first value dot to double and
that is a same exact thing as this whole
line here okay it shortens it and it
makes it a little clearer we have a
string we say convert it to a double
okay so that is an extension method it
needs to be in a static class it needs
to be static itself and it must have
this for the first parameter indicating
what type were attaching to the end
result is whenever you have in this case
a string so for example first value as a
string in the list of available
properties and methods you'll see your
method listed if you hover over it
you'll see that it's listed as an
extension method extension methods can
be created for a number of uses and the
result is they can really help your
applications be more concise more clear
and they can make your code more
efficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
