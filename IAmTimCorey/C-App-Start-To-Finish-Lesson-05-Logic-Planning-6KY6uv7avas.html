start-to-finish course my name is Tim
Corrine today we're looking at logic
planning now so far in this course we
have scoped out our requirements we have
built the overall structure for
application as far as our design we have
designed our data back-end and drawn out
our front-end in this step what we're
going to do is look at some of the
global ideas for how we're going up our
different forms there's a lot more to
logic than just wiring up forms but
you'll find that wiring up the forms
will do most of the major heavy lifting
for your application by the time you're
done you'll have just a few things left
to do before your application is running
so today we're going to talk through
those global ideas the big picture ideas
we won't get into the nitty-gritty of
actually writing code but instead we'll
talk through what each different piece
of the application should do if I were
to do this on paper which I recommend
you do I'd write out some notes and
thoughts on what each piece is going to
do I redraw out each form and kind of
put arrows there and and say okay this
button is going to do this and that
button is gonna do that now again we're
on screen we're not showing a piece of
paper so what I will do instead is I'll
bring up the form and then we'll talk
through the logic behind each different
piece like before the order doesn't
matter but I'm actually going to
readjust our order a little bit because
I want to talk about one of the forms
last because of the most complicated
more most complex so let's go through
the easier more simple ones first and
they'll get to the more complex one at
the end so let's start with the create
tournament form before you start in the
lesson go on I remind you that if you'd
like to get all of these lessons right
away plus all these other bonuses click
the link below in the description to
purchase this course for just $67 and
when you're considering that don't
forget to hit the thumbs up in this
video I'd really appreciate it okay so
let's get back to the lesson
for me created in our previous step we
kind of drew it out again remember that
this is just a design of the application
it's not the actual form itself it's
just the concept of what the form will
probably look like or at least the
structure of it so the first thing you
look at is this create new button it's
actually a button or a button link but
what this does is going to create a new
team now remember we have a new team
form so this button will open up that
new form but it's not done there once
the new team gets created we want to
close out the new team form and come
back to this form and have that data on
the screen now in the team / players
list box and how we're going to do that
is we'll probably create a method that
the create team form can call saying
okay here is the new team there's a new
team object and that's where if you
remember back to our big idea the
overview planning we did we talked about
key concepts and one of the key concepts
was interfaces and this is probably a
good place to have an interface because
that way the form doesn't have to know
the create team form does not even know
about the tournament creator form it
just need to know about the contract the
determinant creator form implements if
you're not sure what that means don't
worry about it will actually show it in
code we'll talk through it and talk
through the different options we have
that's just where varying levels of
experience will show you more or less
you need to do a certain Junction or
getting more of idea of how you gonna do
it but if you don't have that experience
don't worry you'll learn how to do it
and then next time you'll have that
experience next let's look at the ad
team button now this button is pretty
straightforward what you do it's going
to look at which item is selected in
that drop-down right above it and then
take that item and put it in the list
for the tournament players list box it's
also going to remove it from the
drop-down list
it pulled it from once it's done both of
those steps we're going to need to
refresh both the drop-down list and also
the list box next we have the create
Prize button and this button works
almost exactly like the create new over
the selected team drop down the create
Prize button is going to open up a new
form wait until the prize gets created
and then take the value from that
created prize and put it in the prizes
list box
so really the logic is basically the
same it's just which class you're
creating so it's not much more new to
say there next we have these two delete
selected buttons what each of these is
going to do and they are so similar I
just highlight them both what eat it is
going to do is when you click that
button it's going to delete whatever
item in a list box to its left is
selected in the case of the team's list
box the additional step is going to put
that team back in the select team
drop-down box and finally we have the
create tournament button and this is
actually the big one because a lot of
stuff goes on behind the scenes when
this button is clicked first of all
we're going to validate all this
information so for example we need to
make sure we have a tournament name we
need to make sure that the entry fee
isn't something like a negative number
we have to make sure that we have at
least two teams for the tournament can't
be a tournament the only one team once
all of that is done we then need to
create a schedule remember we talked to
the fact that we have that rounds
property which is a list of a list of
matchup we have that rounds property but
we don't have that on the create
tournament form because that's not
something that the user does that it
gets populated on the click of this
create tournament but first we'll need
to figure out how many teams should be
in the tournament and if you read the
companion document that comes along this
course you'll see some I've written out
the formula for how to determine
how many teams should be in tournament
and then also how many byes we should
have to make up for the missing teams so
for example if we have 10 teams in the
tournament the tournament needs to start
with 16 teams so therefore we need to
have six byes in the first round and so
how that gets worked out is determined
in this create tournament button click
it won't happen right behind the button
in the code-behind
but this is where that logic gets kicked
off we will also then need to randomize
the order for the first round once all
that completes then we're really done
with this form so let's move on to the
create team form this forms a little
simpler but let's look at some of the
interesting pieces of it first the add
member button this is going to take an
existing team member from a drop-down
list and add it to the tournament player
list box on the right that logic is very
similar to the previous form where we
had the add team button don't forget
that when we add the member to the list
box we have to remove that member from
the drop-down list and refresh both
lists the next interesting piece is the
create member button what this will do
is take those four fields above creates
a new team member and add them to the
tournament players list box it'll also
then clear out those four fields finally
the create team button will allow us to
first of all validate this team and then
create them the other thing we'll do is
send this information back to the caller
now the one thing you may have noticed
it's missing on this form it's not
something that we realize at the
previous stage is that we don't have a
delete player button on this form
somewhere we're going to add that and
this part in the process again it's
really nice to have it drawn on paper
please let us draw it in but since I
don't have a draw on paper I'm just
going to quit my notes to make sure to
add that
the other thing we'll do is make it the
same and the other delete buttons
because the users want to see a similar
experience across all the forms that way
they get more comfortable with how
things work and know what to expect and
they see certain things okay moving on
we have the create prize form and this
is even simpler this essentially is the
same as the previous page with just the
add new member field or section so the
create price has four text boxes and
when we hit the create Prize button it's
going to validate the information and
then send that information back to the
calling form and close this form and
that's all there is to it the next form
is the tournament dashboard this is
really simple it has a list of existing
tournaments if you select one hit load
tournament it's going to load the
selected tournament viewer for that
given tournament so that's the load
tournament button does the create turner
button just open the create turnit form
and that's really all this form does the
only thing that will be different is
will have to capture when a tournament
gets created and put that new tournament
in the drop-down for the load existing
tournament drop-down that way once you
create a tournament and the form closes
you can then load that tournament and
that brings us to our last form the
tournament viewer and this is the fun
one it has a lot of stuff going on
behind the scenes that makes it a little
more complex but I think we can
definitely dive into it and understand
the overall view of what's happening in
his form first and very simply the
tournament name will get updated when we
load this form when the form gets loaded
we're going to pass in that tournament
object so we'll know what the name is
and we'll just put that in this label
next we have a drop-down with rounds now
so far I haven't lehigh lay the
dropdowns
essentially are just loading information
from a database or from a text file but
with this drop-down it's a little
different because this is actually
calculated so what's going to have is we
have that list of a list of matchup we
call that whole object rounds this
drop-down will figure out how many
rounds are in a round object it doesn't
make sense necessarily we talk about it
you gotta kind of see on paper but
essentially could happen is if a
tournament has four rounds we're going
to have to put in this drop-down list
round one round two round three round
four and it has to know go to the list
entry for round one round two so that
drop-down will change what the matchup
list box shows but next we have the
unplayed only checkbox if this is
checked which I plan having it checked
by default if it's checked then we will
further filter the matchup list box not
only by which round we're in but also by
if a game isn't played or not next we
have this section over here that
displays the scores and allows us to
update or change the scores so based
upon who is selected in the matchup list
box that will determine which matchup
then gets displayed on the right first
we'll update the team names team one
team two and then if they have scores
we'll put those scores in these score
boxes and finally this score button
right here will allow us to change that
matchups scores and based upon this it
will finalize and say the match up is
over and this is who won now that's
where it gets really interesting because
we're going to have to figure out some
way of triggering then other things
based upon a matchup being scored for
example if this is the last unplayed
game in the round
hey the score button here should trigger
the next round remember that we email
people when they are scheduled to play
we also email out the results around and
if this is the last game in the last
round meaning the championship game we
then trigger the end of tournament
information meaning we then assign
prizes and we trigger that final email
saying who won who got what and what the
results were now that raises an issue or
at least a question and that is can we
mark played games with a new score so
for example say there's a basketball
game in a score for sample team one was
95 and a score for sample team two was
75 we put those values in and hit score
but deme realize instead of 95 and 75 it
was 95 and 82 can we go back in and
update that score and I think the answer
has to be that yes we can as long as
we're still in the current round
remember that teams can't play each
other until they're in the right round
meaning if we know that we're going to
play each other in the next round but
this current rounds not over we can't
play each other in that next round yet
all the games have to be done in the
current round before the next round gets
started so as long as we're in the
current round we can adjust those scores
we just think of this way what if sample
team one was given 95 points and sample
team 2 is given 75 but in actuality we
got backwards sample team one should
have gotten 75 points in sample team -
should have got 95 points and that
changes the outcome of the game if we
were already in the next round that
would change who plays who in the
existing round that could cause some
major issues so I think we need to lock
this so that we can only modify scores
in the existing round which means that
this score button needs to have logic in
it that says are we in the current round
and that's really into the tournament
viewer so that raises this question what
are the other
we haven't really covered in our logic
planning and we've got quite a few for
example we haven't really talked about
data access how are we going to access
the data store the data how are you
going to deal with two different data
sources that are very very different how
we're going to email out information
what triggers that what triggers knowing
who plays the next matchup these are
some areas that we're going to dive in
we actually get to the code we can't
plan everything out in abstract some
things it's just easier to be in the
code and then plan so we're done we can
with our planning outside of Visual
Studio we've created our data design to
create our UI layouts we have looked at
what logic needs to be behind that user
interface in order to use and move the
data around properly we're not going to
worry about trying to plan out every bit
of the other pieces of logic at this
point we'll get that once we've done all
we can to put we have in code so that
brings us to what's coming up next and
up next we're going to talk about taking
our data design and putting that into
actual code we're going to create our
class library and prepare that for use
in our application before you go you'll
see a link in the left of BIOS course
check out the intro video on this
playlist for more information what you
get if you pay also if you are ever
wondering what you could do to help this
channel out without paying money I've
listed six things that really help I'd
appreciate if you consider doing one or
more of these thanks again and don't
forget to keep practicing what you
learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
