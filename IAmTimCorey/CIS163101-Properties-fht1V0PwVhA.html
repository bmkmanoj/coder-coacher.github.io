the different ways to create properties
in a c-sharp class when you first start
out in a class the simplest way to
create what we call a property would be
to do just a public give it a type like
string first name okay this could be
called a property but there is a
difference between this and a true
property so let's look at the next type
of property the next type of property
I'll look at is called an auto
implemented property or an auto property
to create one you can use a snippet by
taking PR o P and hitting tab twice this
creates a full property with a get and a
set give it a type a name
these two function the same way in your
code however behind the scenes there are
differences in how the two interact the
biggest one you'll run across probably
is the fact that you cannot do data
binding on this type of property data
binding would be where you hook up a
text box or a combo box or something
else in your user interface directly to
a property so for that and for many
other reasons it's best not to do this
type of property at all
so go ahead and forget you even know how
to do that and just use auto properties
instead this functions the same way as
the the previous variable type we saw
earlier the third type of property is
called a full property let's go ahead
and look at what that looks like
so type prop full to use a snippet and
what this does is it creates something
very similar to our auto property with
it's getting set only this time the get
and set actually have code so let's go
look at how to work with this the first
thing is since we're using a snippet you
can tab through these different pieces
that we need to change the first thing
you need to change is the type now note
it's the type is here and it's here but
when I change the type up above and hit
tab it changes the type down below now
let's give us a name
one of the standard naming conventions
is to give an underscore and camelcase
so underscore lowercase F in first upper
case and for name and then for the
actual property
pascale case first name what this does
is this underscore indicates this is a
private backing field it's called a
backing field is a field behind a
property a public property so this is a
private banking field and it's really
something we shouldn't deal with
directly except in rare cases from now
on in we deal with the public property
both forgetting and for sitting so this
right here is a full property this is an
auto property when you look at it the
actual functionality is no different at
this point for the first name when you
ask for it we need to a get it returns
the value of this private first name
variable when you go to set it it
populates the first name variable the
private banking property with a key word
called value value is whatever is being
passed in to your set so why would you
do a full property when an auto property
does the same thing well there are cases
where a full property gives you more
things for example if we want to return
something a little different than what
we've set we could change the output for
example let's go ahead and expand this
out so it's formatted nicer to actually
put code in all right so instead just
directly returning first-name let's go
ahead and say dots to make it do to
uppercase
maybe the first name should always be
uppercase in that case we store however
they pass it in but we return an
uppercase that may not be what you want
for first name but that is a possibility
the other possibility is maybe you don't
always want to change the first name for
example let's go ahead and wrap this in
if statement now since I want to wrap
this I'm going to select the whole line
right click and say surround with which
allows me to insert a snippet that
surrounds that line so let's case an if
statement if and tab okay it puts it
inside the if statement the other you do
here would be to cut that line out type
the if in and then put in the right spot
but surround web is much quicker so
let's compare this value and say let's
look at the length of the value and say
if the length is greater than two so in
this case we're saying you know what
only set the first name if the length of
the incoming value is greater than two
that means the name coming in has to be
at least three characters you know may
that's not what you want for first name
again but maybe it is for something like
age where you say age must be greater
than zero and less than a hundred and
thirty obviously an age of five thousand
wouldn't really apply to a person and so
you can do some validation there okay so
in this case if you try to put T or ti
into the first name property it's not
going to do anything it will look like
it works but nothing will actually
change in the first name property now if
you wanted something to change or you if
you wanted to alert the user in some way
you could do something like throw an
exception
or something like setting the first name
to be equal to unknown if you can type
it okay or you know whatever you'd like
to do so there are ways you can do you
know an different else and I don't
advise just not setting and not doing
anything but that is one of the benefits
of having a full property is the
evaluate the ability to do validation on
the set and do manipulation on the get
now let's go back and and delete this
code out so we're back to restore it
from one of the other things that people
sometimes overlook is a fact that
properties allow you to create read only
or write only values and this works both
the auto property else the full
properties so for example if we wide a
read-only property we could just take
the set off and that works for both full
and auto properties now first-name and
lastname are both read-only now that
might not be what you want for a name
but could be what you want for something
like an age where you set it once and
never change it okay
now what if you wanted to set the name
the first and last name and never change
that
well you can't change initially unless
you do a constructor so ctor is that is
the snippet for constructor so now when
this person class is created I could say
asked me in a first name and a last name
and that I could do is say underscore
first name equals what was passed in
that changes the backing field for my
first name property now for my auto
property that wouldn't work right but
they have no banking property well there
is this thing called a private set up
son you know I sent a : after that okay
a private set allows me to make this
read-only but I can change the value in
my constructor now that's the only place
you can change the value of last name
but this allows me to say last name
equals the past end last name and thus I
can have something in here and the user
can't change it so that be how you make
things read-only the opposite is also
true
you can also make things right only this
has less use in typical programming but
you could say give me a make it only a
set you can change it but you can't read
it it doesn't make sense usually an auto
property but in a full property it might
make sense where you set the value but
don't ever allow anybody outside to read
that value for example a social security
number you may allow the value set and
say you know what I'm never gonna give
that back out to you I only want to use
it internally using the backing field
okay now the other alternative here
let's put my set back in
okay the other alternative would be if
this was a social security number I
could say let's manipulate this to only
show the last four digits of the social
security number in the get and then I
can still work with the private backing
field to get the full value inside of
this class instance that's how you can
protect data and yet still allow some
visibility of that data
you know last four digits of a credit
card number last for social so on and so
forth okay so we have we've dealt with
auto properties with just a get in asset
we've dealt with full properties to
create an auto property again we just
type in PR o P and tab twice to get our
snippet for that and for an auto
property we are for a full property we
tape out prop full and hit tab twice and
that is our snippet for full property
there are other things you can do with
properties that really make them very
powerful especially in presentation
later so for example maybe you want to
see a full name somewhere on the screen
well a full name is typically just your
first name and your last name it doesn't
make sense to have that be a property
with a set where you put in the full
name because then you're typing things
twice I type in my first name Tim I take
my last name Cory and I type it again as
Tim Cory doesn't make sense so instead
let's create a property with only a get
called full name so in this case I'm
going to type it out public string full
name I open closing curly braces and I
put a get and then open closing curly
braces there now for this I'm not going
to use a banking field instead I'm going
to use the properties I all
in this class I'm gonna do a string dot
format because I want to put two
properties together and this is the same
syntax as console.writeline but again
console.writeline uses a string format
underneath now notice what I did there
I just put first name and last name with
space in between into a string and
returned that for my full name I didn't
have a backing field for this full name
I just used the properties that already
exist in my class and manipulated them
in some way so I could also do something
like pass in my nice prefix like mr. or
dr. or miss or MS or any of those and
then my suffix like junior senior second
third fourth whatever you want I can
actually add that out into you know dr.
Timothy Cory the third you know and
create this is full long full name but
for this case is decide you know what
full name is just first name space last
name and all I did was return that so
now I can create a bunch of properties
with just gets it makes no sense to set
them well I can create a bunch is
properties what just gets that do a
number of different tasks for my
presentation layer a good one we address
you know address usually you have
address line one address line two
city state zip country and you have
always broken out in different pieces
but then sometimes you want to see all
of those together a property with just a
get that puts all it together it would
be a great place to do that
so that is Auto properties full
properties and how to use properties and
new and interesting ways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
