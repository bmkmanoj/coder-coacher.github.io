variable and how to use it so begin
let's look at a list variable type list
specify the type of item for each member
of the list for example in this list
we're going to store a list of strings
so each member will be a string variable
give it a variable name and assign it to
be a new list okay so we have list of
type string we have a name it's called
which is demo and we instantiate it to a
new list of type string that is a list
to add to the list just type your
variable name and type ad and put in
your specific item you want to add to
the list in this case I'll add a few
names
okay so there is a simple list now how
do we get the data out of our lists well
we could do a for loop and say for I
equals 0 2 demo dot count so for I
equals 0 I is less than demo account I
plus plus and then it could do demo I
and that outputs the string Bob then
George then Tom and Sue just to
demonstrate this does work let's go
ahead and finish off our console
application and run it and there we go
Bob George Tom soup but that's a little
more complicated than we need to have
let's go ahead and comment this out
again we use the comment helper and
let's do a for each again as a snippet
for that just type tab tab the first
item that's for each is the variable
type of the individual item in a list in
this case we have a list of type string
therefore this should be strength item
is the variable name for the specific
item in the list so on our first loop
through the list item will be populated
with Bob the next iteration through the
list item will have George inside it and
so on and so forth we can leave that as
is or we can give it a better name like
name and finally we put demo here this
is the collection with a set of data so
for each string in demo do something
again we'll do a console.writeline and
this time instead of putting demo and
then brackets and I and all that
confusing stuff we will just put name so
console.writeline name
and let's run this again again Bob
George Tamsui same result much easier
code that is a list and that is a for
each don't forget to instantiate your
list before you try to use it if you
don't bad things happen let's go ahead
and see that a person I call in there
and comment out the rest of the line so
now we've not instantiated demo let's go
and see it ahead and see what happens
there's build errors are already let's
go ahead and hit no and look at the
build error use of unassigned local
variable demo okay what it's saying is
we haven't actually assigned anything to
demo yet we haven't filled it up it's an
empty variable and yet we're trying to
use it so if you see that error make
sure you instantiate your demo to a new
lift and that concludes lists and for
each</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
