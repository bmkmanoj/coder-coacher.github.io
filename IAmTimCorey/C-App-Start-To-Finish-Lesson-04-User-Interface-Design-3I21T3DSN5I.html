start to finish I am Tim quarry and
today we're going to look at building
our user interface in the design phase
for our genomic tracker and this is a
fun step because we actually could have
see a kind of rough idea of what our
application is going to look like which
really helps cement some ideas in our
minds and it also helps hone our overall
idea for how the application should work
now normally in this process this is
where I get out my whiteboard or my
legal pad and I start drawing and I am
not an artist by any stretch of the
imagination but I still I could draw it
out because that way I can scrap it
erase it start over and it gives me an
idea of what the thing should look like
what the form should basically be it
doesn't have to be pretty doesn't have
to be even proportional it doesn't have
to have all of the the extras you're
going to want to add to make this thing
really pop it just has to have a basic
idea of these are the forms I need or
these are the pages I need and that's it
so the question that comes up is where
do I start and that's the same question
we have when we started the data design
where do I start with this thing and
really the answer is it doesn't matter
just start somewhere if you aren't sure
of a certain part of the application
start with what you are sure of get that
stuff out of the way first and then come
back to you're not sure of more often
than not you'll find that you've got a
better idea now of how that piece should
work and you've also got that momentum
of I've done this four or five six seven
times I'm on a roll I can do this so
that in mind I'm going to start with our
Tournament viewer form now before I go
to that form I want to talk a little bit
about how I've adjusted for working on
video and so one thing I'm not going to
do is just show a whiteboard session I'm
actually going to show you a somewhat
completed form now it's not very pretty
it's not going to have again all the
visuals but it gives us an idea of where
now again before I show you this I want
to emphasize I don't encourage you to do
this in windows form builder don't go
into Visual Studio and create a new form
and design it and call that your design
process that's not a real design you
don't want to start there and the reason
why is because one of two things will
happen
either one you'll spend way too much
time tweaking the layout and looking for
different controls and trying things out
and naming things and all this other
stuff that's really not necessary and
it's part of the process or you'll
create this form and in the end you'll
say that's great I'm going to use that
for my actual application and well it
sounds like you just saved some time
what you really did is you shortcut the
design process and you haven't looked at
other ideas or alternatives and you've
probably left yourself some problems in
the form that you found worked around
because you don't want to redo it
whereas if it's on paper you can go
ahead and scratch it out and try again
you can try weird and silly things and
say yep that's not going to work or
you'll have that you piss fitting when
you try something silly and go wait
that's not so it's awesome so definitely
put on a paper but for our purposes
since I am showing on the video I'm
actually going to show you a completed
form we're going to walk through my
thought process and some of the things
that I change and tweak until you got it
somewhat right and again this is about
an 85 and 95 percent certainty this is
not a hundred percent done even in the
rough layout all right that's enough
preamble let's actually jump right into
tournament Viewer before we get started
in the lesson I want to remind you to
subscribe to this channel if you are
subscribed click the little bell icon
make sure your gave me alerts when I add
a new video and while you check on that
could you also give us video like I know
that we're just getting started but
liking a video is a simple way that you
can make this course more popular and
that helps everyone it increases the
visibility of my videos on YouTube which
generates more income for me
it helps others out because they get
introduced in the desirable content and
it helps you out because I'm able to
produce more free videos okay so let's
get back to the lesson
alright here's a turn on your form that
I created now again it's ugly right now
that's okay
let's walk through my ideas for this
form first we have the tournament and
that name in the less than greater than
science and so what that's going to be
is that's going to say the name of this
particular tournament so this form is
going to display all the information
about one tournament so it's going to
first say this is the women's basketball
tournament or whatever we've called our
particular tournament again this part of
the process we don't care how the
information got here we don't care about
what the back ends gonna look like we
just want to look at user interface
layouts so pretend like the rest doesn't
exist and you're just developing cool
screens so we have a tournament name
next we have this round drop-down and so
here's my thought I didn't know the good
way of layout the tournament bracket and
have a huge bracket on screen we can see
all the games and nice or layout in
really even if I found a third-party
control it did it that's not going to
teach you a whole lot because you're not
going to use that bracket in your job or
to create your own application unless
you're also creating a tournament viewer
so instead I thought what if I showed a
list box that matchup list box and in
that list box I had just the games in
this particular round in one round
and so that drop-down for round allows
me to choose which round I'm displaying
so in a four round tournament if you
were on one round two round three round
four so that drop-down would change
based upon the number of rounds the list
box would change based upon which round
is selected in the drop-down and then my
final piece I thought of was what if we
only show the games that have not yet
been played
let's think for a minute about a
tournament that has 16 games in the
first round that's a lot of games but
imagine we have 16 games as list box
well if we only have
- left to play you're weeding through 14
played games to find the 2 - aren't
played so instead we could check that
box it says unplayed only I'll probably
have a default 3 checked but at that box
is true then we'll only show the games
that have not yet been played so as you
play games that list will get shorter
and shorter until is none left in the
list I also have thought that I would
change the round drop-down based upon
the current active round so for example
it in default to whatever round we're
currently in if we're in round 3 right
now
it wouldn't start off this form with
round 1 is certain around 3 how is going
to work I don't know yet I have wrote
down a paper as this is a cool idea
remember this for later because now I'm
not doing code I'm doing user interface
design now on the right we have sample
team 1 and a score in a box they have
vs. sample team 2 the score in the box
so this section right here well I'm
doing or I'm thinking I'm going to do is
I'll have the name of team 1 in the name
of team 2 and they'll be able to put in
scores for them if they're not already
scored so they're already scored that
box to the right of score will have an
actual value but they've not been scored
yet it will have nothing once they've
scored we'll put the information in
those two boxes and hit the score button
to the right the idea here is that would
complete the match up now looking at it
I'm not sure that's my final design I
might want to change what that score
button says and how those two boxes are
laid out just because I'm not sure it's
totally clear with the score box versus
the score button and how those two
interact and I want this to be very
clear to the user that's using this form
so this form is basically done there's
not anything more that I think needs to
display on the form it simply has all
the games and then you can score a
particular game and it will show you
which ones are you be played pretty
simple we can probably add some more fun
stuff like me buttons that tell us who
won the tournament
or things like that but right now I
think that this forum is done in a
design phase so let's move on to our
next forum now again it doesn't matter
which order you do is in but in my
thought process if I have a term viewer
forum I'll probably need to term it
creator forum so here's my create
tournament forum it starts off with
asking deterrent name and then an entry
fee box that box will allow us to if we
want to specify how much each team needs
to pay to enter the tournament and then
I have it gets a little more complicated
so my thought is we have a select team
drop-down and what this will do it will
allow us a select an already existing
team maybe one team enters more than one
term especially if that team is one
person so if we've already created team
we don't need to recreate them we just
need to add them to our tournament and
we hit the add team button is going to
take whoever's in the drop-down and add
them to the list box on the right of the
upper top where it says team slash
players and that would be who is in the
tournament now if we don't already have
a team we need to create one that's that
create new link and when I don't get
individuals too much at this point
that's why they're ugly gray forms I did
like the idea of having that create new
be somewhat different than the other
buttons just so it's pretty obvious they
were Korean new team versus creating new
team on this tournament as am using
existing team but Adams the tournament
so I it was just confusing I decided
that link button me to be a bit
different okay so we got the drop-down
for teams we've also got to create new
button for the team both of those will
add whatever team easy to create or
select to the list box on the right and
now we have prizes either tournament has
a name and entry fee players and prizes
you're confused as to what a tournament
has you can go back and look at your
data model because the data model for
tournament tells you all the things
you're going to need to capture so for
prizes I didn't expect to have prizes
roll over from one tournament to the
next but it seemed too different to me
especially the variable number of
players in the tournament so instead I
said we'll create a new prize list every
time from new prizes so instead of the
drop-down we just have to create prize
button and that will pop up a new forum
just like the create new team will pop
up a new forum so again in your notes
you should note that we have two more
forms to create now they create new team
and they create new prize
once the prize is created you'll get add
to the prizes list box that seems pretty
straightforward now next to the list
boxes and I'll change these icons
probably I'll probably go with some kind
of red X or something like that but the
delete selected whenever you have a list
box where you're adding something to it
you need to have some way to get them
out to for example maybe you add a
player or a team and you didn't want to
you want to take them back off you've
got to have a way to do that without
closing the form and restarting and
that's really all I have for this forum
I had that create tournament button
which will take all the information and
create a tournament object the
assumption is this will also get saved
in a database or a text file in some way
but again we don't care about code at
this point now if you're looking at your
model you may have noticed that I'm
missing one piece of data and that has
the rounds we have a list of a list of
matchup in this form doesn't cover
rounds in any way and the reason why is
because rounds are random who goes in
what order for each matchup is random
the number of rounds is determined based
upon number of teams so all that gets
set up in code and it's not something
that the end user does at all therefore
it's not displayed in this form okay
according to my notes
the next form I had to create was the
add team
create new team form and so let's go
ahead and create that and this is my
idea for the create team form as a team
name which if you notice let's go back
to the create tournament the tournament
name its layout the same way and that's
an idea that it's really important to
think about is the continuity between
forms the idea that the same thing works
the same way on multiple forms or the
same layout works a kind of same way
that way even if you do things a little
differently the fact that it's done a
little differently throughout your
entire application makes your form and
your application more cohesive so you
have a team name and that's just a
straight text field then we have select
team members now this again pulls my
database a text file and it says I
already have team members why don't just
go ahead and add one of these if that's
what you want so if the same office team
plays all the time so you have 10 people
in the office well there's no reason to
recreate who they are every single time
the same 10 people therefore for that
second tournament will just select the
team members in the list because we've
already created them in the first
tournament so the select team member
will will select who to add as a member
of this team or if they're not already
in the team member list we can add them
right in line now it's important to note
that this form now does two different
things it both creates teams and also
creates members and sometimes that's not
the best way of doing things sometimes
you want some separation there where you
have button that goes to a new form for
add member but for me what I said was
this is such a little bit of data just
four fields all text fields and I have
the space in the create team form let's
go ahead and put that right in line with
this form because I know that at least
for the first little bit I'm going to
end
during new members right away multiple
times I don't want to go three four and
five forms deep to create a tournament
now don't forget we're already in for
number two this forum number one was
create tournament and on there it had a
create team button so in this that's
this former here now if we say add new
member or create member is a new form
that's three layers deep and it just
gets confusing and it gets cumbersome
and so the more I can streamline that by
putting things together the better I
feel about it from a user acceptance and
user comfort level with my application
now that might not be something you're
comfortable with and that's fine you can
definitely have just a button here and
open a new forum but for me I like the
compact clicker design process of this
create team forum so that's what we're
going to do so whether you add a member
from the list or create a member either
way they could add to the tournament
players list box once all the team
members have been added and once the
teams are named we go ahead and create a
team and that's it and that's the create
team form so the next forum accordingly
notes is that create prize form and
that's really simple so remember we have
back on our tournament form we have that
create prize button it's going to allow
us to create one prize and add to our
list of prizes so this represents one
prize so for example place number two
place name second place prize them out
$20 or prize force edge 0.15 or 15% in
which we accept there is definitely up
to us at Build time so it's pretty
straightforward has four input boxes and
that button to create the price it'll be
a little more goes on behind the scenes
to say don't allow both prize amount and
price percentage but besides that
we don't have a whole lot to work with
here as far as difficulty and so that
brings us to our last form and this form
I really wrestled with so I'm going to
show you a form first and then let's
talk about it this is my tournament
dashboard form now I'm not totally in
love with this but I've come to the
conclusion this is probably the easiest
way to make this whole thing work you
see when you create a windows forms
application and again we're getting a
little bit in a code and that's okay
when it create a windows forms
application it wants to create one form
and leave it open the entire time you
can open new forms and you can close
those new forms but if you close the
main form the application is done and so
I was wrestling this idea of how do I do
multiple tournaments and how I have this
system where a form stays open the whole
time that's logical at first I thought
about having a switching system where it
said if you have no tournaments
currently running open the create
tournament form but if you have an
existing tournament go to that
tournament instead and that kind of
works except the fact that maybe you
want to have two tournaments running how
do you create the second tournament and
if you do create a second tournament how
is it system know which tournament to
open up and if you have no tournaments
yet and it opens the creator net form
when you're done creating the tournament
it's going to close that form which
closes the application and that doesn't
work so I said you know I need some sort
of central form that kind of coordinates
a quarterback's everything and that's
this stupid little form here's what it
does it allows you to see what
tournaments are currently open you
select one and you hit load tournament
and it opens the tournament form the
turn-on viewer or you can say create
tournament even if you currently have
existing tournaments when you create a
tournament it opens the create
tournament form which is pretty
self-explanatory but this form stays
open all the time that way if you close
out of the create tournament form you
still have this form
and that drop-down should be updated if
you have a tournament viewer forum open
it will be on top of this dashboard you
won't see a dashboard the only time
you'll see is dashboard is if you have
nothing else open so again I'm not in
love with it
but I think it works and so we may have
to tweak how it looks a little bit
because it really is stupid simple so
maybe do some kind of design around it
to make it a little more inviting more
splash pages or something like that the
key here is this is what we need on the
form and this is the form we need to use
to open the application on and that is a
conclusion of our user interface design
that's really all there is you just kind
of sketch out some forms and say what do
I need on each form and what forms do I
need that's really it so now coming up
next we're going to talk about logic
planning the idea behind how you wire up
our data and our front-end and it's give
me a high level planning it's not gonna
get rid deep in the weeds but instead
we'll talk through the ideas of how
we're going to wire up all the buttons
and the dropdowns and everything else so
we have a good plan for what to do once
we have the user interface actually
built and the models built before you go
you'll see a link on the left - pilots
course check out the intro video in this
playlist for more information what you
get if you pay also if you are ever
wondering what you could do to help this
channel out without paying money I've
listed six things that really help
I appreciate if you consider doing one
or more of these thanks again and don't
forget to keep practicing what you
learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
