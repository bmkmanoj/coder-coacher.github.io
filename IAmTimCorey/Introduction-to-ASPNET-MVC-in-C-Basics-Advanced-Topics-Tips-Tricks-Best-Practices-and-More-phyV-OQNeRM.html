going to walk you through the basics of
asp.net MVC we're going to start off by
identifying what we get ran in a box
after examining all the parts of MVC
along with how they fit together I'll
demo how to create a site and pages
manipulate data and more by the time
you're done this video you should be
able to create an asp.net MVC website on
your own before we get started I want to
mention a couple of things first of all
if you haven't already
click the subscribe button on this
channel but also in the description
you're going to find a link to my
mailing list that's kind of important if
you want to hear my exclusive
opportunities discounts my courses and a
lot more stuff and don't worry I don't
send out a ton of emails that's not
housekeeping for now let's jump right
into MVC here I've got Visual Studio
2017 open now I'm using the Enterprise
Edition which has a few more bells and
whistles but the Community Edition is
free so you don't already have 2017 I
recommend downloading it just goes
visual studio comm for those of you who
can't use the latest version of visuals
view because of business restrictions or
other reasons don't worry what you have
access to in Visual Studio 2015 should
be about the same for MVC you'll find a
few differences but don't worry about it
if you're on an earlier version of
Visual Studio
you'll pricey more differences but the
core concepts should probably be the
same so let's start a new project and
this is the first kind of hurdle with
2017 I want to talk about now talk about
a4 but the idea that I don't really like
this search templates it seems
convenient but really it's not and the
reason I say that is because these
descriptions down here don't really give
a full story of which template you're
choosing and with a dotnet core and
dotnet standard templates also having
the same name
seems as some of the ones are currently
used to using Dennis makes things
complicated for example of IRS search
for asp.net MVC I get four options and
they look the same if you look to the
right - or C sharp to our VB if you
mouse over they actually look the same -
just don't mess with this is my
recommendation it's just too easy cause
problems instead good create new project
find it here in this case I'm in web so
templates visual C sharp web and then
you'll see asp.net web application
dotnet framework and let's expand that
there dotnet framework not the dotnet
core and not dotnet core he knows dotnet
framework this person right here asp.net
web application dotnet framework that's
the one you want
now let's call this something we can
understand let's start with MVC demo no
spaces and for our solution we'll call
this our ASP demo application so that
the project name is MVC demo the
solution name is ASP demo application
now it's the first thing you get now
because my fonts are all there for
display purposes for this video this is
a bit of a mess now Microsoft has said I
submitted ticket for this and they have
said that in an upcoming patch this was
fixed but for right now this is awful
but if you expand us out you'll see that
it actually fills in nicely so except
for the okay and cancel so we have a few
options here now by default we've
selected the MVC we could do web forms
we could do empty web api and all the
rest if you notice down below
there's some check boxes here and
depending on what I select it changes
those checkboxes so what this is doing
is it's a series of templates and
depending on which options you select it
kind of puts things in or takes things
out to create a template that's specific
to what you want in this case we're
looking for the MVC templates and we'll
go over with MVC is in a minute but for
now note that the web forms that's kind
of old way of doing things it's kind of
way that it's similar to wind forms in
the desktop application side as opposed
to APF so this will be that like the
wind forms era websites I recommend if
you're starting a new application do you
not go that direction they're having a
lot of strides that have been made with
web forms but still they're kind of the
old technology I'd recommend against it
so we're going to the MVC instead that's
kind of the the new way of doing a
server-side web site with c-sharp and
we'll talk about server side versus
client side in a little bit but for now
this is where we're going to go now if
you notice this next thing Web API
I love Web API in fact when I come into
a company that the first thing I look
for is can we use web api because what
web api allows you to do is kind of
disconnect your user interface from your
business logic and your data and so I
love that and we'll cover that in a
future video
but for now we'll just note that it's
here and it's really a partner with MVC
notice how these two are both checked
when you select Web API these other ones
down here we're not going to cover but
we'll get into those possibly in a
future video but for now MVC now we
could still select Web API when web
forms were even ad unit tests
now I had a couple of questions about
the fact I don't do unit tests in
certain videos and that's true I don't
I'm going to cover you know test ads on
their own in a video upcoming but I try
and keep my videos very very lean and
clean I try to fill them up with a whole
bunch of different technologies all at
once where you have to learn four and
five and six different things in order
to get this one thing working instead I
try to teach you a piece at a time now I
find that's the best way
release that I've seen to learn is to
learn a piece at a time instead of
trying getting overwhelmed with all this
stuff so we're not going to add unit
tests now but in a future video we'll
definitely come back and add unit tests
to an MVC application to see how that
work because it really is the same
whether it's an MVC application or it's
a desktop application or even just a
class library the other you're going to
note is this change authentication
button this is pretty cool it allows us
to do different types of authentication
including Twitter authentication Google
authentication Microsoft authentication
or Facebook or our own our own
authentication so there's a lot of
different options you can do with
individual user accounts it can also
hook up through a Azure Active Directory
an Active Directory on site or even
office 365 it could login via your
Windows credentials so it's some fun
things you can do there similarly
powerful things and really they make
life easy as far as hooking these things
up for example it in individual user
accounts if you were to select this the
code is practically all there for
hooking up to Facebook Twitter Google or
Microsoft all you need to do is
uncomment that section put in your keys
and you can tell where I get those API
keys for it and then you're good to go
and it it's great for authentication so
you can have your application and you
can say only if you're authenticated
only if you're in a certain group when
all that fun stuff but for today we're
going to say no authentication so we're
all set to go
but before I hit okay I want you to keep
your eye on this lower left-hand corner
I'm not trying to be on it but when I
hit okay
there's going to be some activity down
here I see if you can kind of look at
that and watch that we'll talk about
what it's doing so he okay and right
down here there you go adding bootstrap
adding jQuery and a whole bunch of
different stuff and so if you look at
just the the progress bar which is up
here right now if you look at that it
seems like this loads slowly but if you
look in the lower left hand corner you
see a lot of stuff happening now some
people kind of skip over there or missed
that but what that's doing it is loading
a whole bunch of different NuGet
packages if you're not submitted nougat
nougat is Microsoft's package manager
and what allows us to do is take a bit
of code and wrap it in a package and say
this code does this one thing it may you
know convert data to JSON that's great
if they have one package that does that
and for example in this application we
have a nougat package for jQuery well
jQuery is a JavaScript library and what
Microsoft has said is instead of us
reinventing the wheel and saying we're
going to create our own JavaScript
library for doing what jQuery does we
recognize that jQuery does things really
well and so we're going to bring them in
as a package instead us doing ourselves
and so what this makes our MVC
application be is a modular application
it's no longer Microsoft saying here's
all your stuff use our stuff don't use
anything else of stuff and be separate
from the world
instead what it's saying is this is what
every else is doing
so we're going to bring this in as well
for example a popular front-end HTML and
CSS framework is called bootstrap and
bootstrap was actually created by
Twitter and was originally called
Twitter bootstrap but now it's just
called bootstrap and if you go to get
bootstrap comm you can see bootstrap in
its current form and then the newer
versions are coming out and that's a
great framework
well MVC says you know what that's a
great framework so we're going to pull
it in as a nugget package and so when
you start up your MVC application if
pulling all those new packages in to
build this completed template so let's
see the new get packages they're brought
in for this template that's been created
so I right click on references and say
manage NuGet packages in my installed
section notice I have all of these
different nougat packages there's a lot
for example you look there is jQuery now
one thing you gotta note is right off
the bat I have 17 updates to do in fact
jQuery the version brought in my
template is one point ten point two but
the latest stable version is three point
one point one now you may be like me and
when you see updates may be done you
want to just hit that update button and
in some cases that's not a problem but
whenever you see a major version number
change met for example that one has
changed to a three now that's something
to look into
there's been two major versions of
jQuery since this one dot 10.2 since
that's the case there's probably
breaking changes in their diet aware of
and so I would not recommend you do is I
would not recommend that you come to
updates select all packages and just say
updates
if you do that you will create some
problems in your MVC template right at
the back now with that being said I do
think that you should update these
packages it's just you're going to
figure out can I do an update to the
latest version or for example when it
comes to coming to jQuery maybe I should
go and move to the 1.12 4 which is in
the same major version so it's live to
you now if you're starting off with a
blank template like this or a blank MVC
application you could try just updating
everything and depending on when you do
the download when you do the the
template you'll have a different number
of updates you'll have different places
to update them to and so it may work for
you it may not work for me it all
depends on timing but if you're starting
out from scratch hey it's a great time
to try it the other thing to note is
sometimes we'll have this box checked
now with this box checked notice
bootstrap install this 3.0 the version
the latest pre-release is 4.0 0.0 alpha
6 well that's an alpha release that's
not really something you want to have in
a production application but maybe if
you're trying things out or learning
what the new 4.0 bootstrap has in store
for you maybe you want to do that demo
application in which case you could
check this box include pre-release but I
would recommend for any application
we're going to be using this in a
business environment or where it's going
to go into production in some way
uncheck this box don't include
pre-release notice now that bootstrap
said the latest version is three point
three point seven that delay is stable
you can still do is drop down here
look at all the different versions and
change versions so if you have this
pre-release checked you could say yes I
see alpha 6 but I realize do is three
point three point seven so you could do
that but with this checked and if you
said just update all over here it would
update to the latest pre-release version
that's not necessary good thing so by
default I would recommend unchecking
match and then going from there all
right so that's enough about nougat and
about the packages that are installed
it's quit quite a few let's look at our
template and let's 10-man just talk
about what is asp.net and what is MVC
asp.net is the umbrella under which
Microsoft puts all their web focused
tools and applications it uses stand for
active server pages which was that web
forms thing I showed you earlier but now
it's just kind of umbrella under which
everything lives and so MVC is one of
those things that lives under the
umbrella MVC stands for model view
controller so three different things
models views and controllers and we'll
look at all three of those soon notice
the controller's folder the models
folder and the views folder so look at
those in a minute but one of the
benefits of MVC is that all of our code
which is written in C sharp is compiled
and run on the server meaning when the
end user views a website that has been
built with MVC all they get is HTML CSS
and JavaScript they don't get the
c-sharp code so all of our business
logic
we put in c-sharp the end user never has
access to that even though they use the
end result now one thing a lot of people
get confused on or miss entirely is the
fact that MVC is a UI centric pattern a
user interface
it doesn't really talk about or worry
about or cover the business logic or the
data access or other things that kind of
behind scenes now if you've watched AMA
other videos you will have seen how I
try and push you to put as much logic
into your class library as possible and
the reason for that is because you can
take that same class library and attach
it here to this MVC application and
connect it up and so you could take an
application that used to be a wind form
application a desktop application take
away the wind form add in asp.net MVC
and as long as the logic was in the
class library the business logic and
data access there's very little work to
be done in MVC to get the same result or
a similar result but now on the web in
fact in my c-sharp application course
where we built the tournament tracker
application we pushed everything
possible into our class library with the
intent of changing the user interface
which is a win form application be
intended to change that into something
else later down the road in fact I'll be
creating an add-on course to change that
win form application to a WPF
application they'll also be doing
another and course that changes the win
form application over to be an asp.net
MVC application
and so we can do both of those things by
just replacing the user interface not
the entire application so let's start
with an overview of what MVC really does
the end of Vienna see now the heart of
MVC is the controllers this is kind of
backbone of MVC what the controllers do
is they link the views with the data so
the controller is controlling the
application now in our case we start off
with a blank template we actually have
one controller already built the home
controller now if you note there's not a
lot of code in here and it's a couple of
reasons for that the first reason is
because this really is just a sample to
get you started but the other reason is
because the MVC framework uses some
naming conventions to link things up and
make things linked together so in this
case we have the index action result the
about method which returns an action
result and the contact method which
returns an action results now an action
result is usually a view now remember
models views and controllers so this
controller is saying return this view
now isn't say which of you to return it
just says return view well where is that
view come from well if you have a home
controller then it's going to look for
the view in the views folder under the
home folder in here it's going to say ok
this is the index action well there's
the index view
so--that's will get into view a minute
but that's the convention that it uses
is it looks at home controller means
under views home folder and that takes
the method name and says that the page
name that's called the action and the
result of the action the action result
is the display the view in this case it
says just display the index dot CSS HTML
page so for the about method it's going
to say let's say return view it's going
to return the about CSS HTML page so
this is what the home controller does is
it says here's which view to display
when you call this method now that's
very very simplistic and yet it does
have some power behind it and we'll see
that in a minute but don't worry if you
say that looks really too simple because
your your methods here will probably
have a little bit more code to them
maybe not a lot but a little bit more so
we see this index action we very kind of
open this page up but let's open up the
index dot CSS HTML page the view to see
what's in this view and we'll close out
the that suggestion for now now if
you're familiar you probably should be
if you're going to do asp.net MVC if
you're familiar the HTML that's all this
is for the most part right here is HTML
we'll ignore this part we're up here for
just a minute
but this HTML it's just HTML I mean if
you want to change this to an h2 tag you
just type to instead and there's an h2
instead of h1 you change it back now
familiar to have pages laid out you'll
notice something here we're missing HTML
normally a complete HTML page has a head
and a body and in the head we have
things like our CSS and some settings
like the page title and other things in
the body we have HTML like this we also
have our JavaScript references and other
things well we don't have that here in
the reason why is because of view is
just a part of your overall page I read
cover where the rest of that stuff is on
just a minute but for now just note that
where this is just a part of our page so
that's a view now unfortunately if you
notice over here the models folder is
empty now I really wish that the
defaults when a template gets created I
wish it had at least one method that
uses a model unfortunately we don't have
that that demo but don't worry
I'll walk you through create a new
controler new views and using models to
connect those views so we'll get there
but for right now just note that there
are no models here but a model is simply
a class with properties that's all it
really is in fact let's create our model
now just so you can see what it looks
like
add class where I call this the person
model now let's follow the same
convention that we're using here home
controller well person model
so a public class person model and I'll
type prop string first named prop string
last name prop int age now normally I
wouldn't have a property called age
that's an integer because age is a
changing thing
so instead probably has only a date time
with me birthday in that way I could
always know what the age is based upon
where we are in the year but in this
case I want to have an integer so it's
called age and be good to go with that
now let's add one more prop bool is
alive so this right here this class is a
model as for properties in it it's all
really does we could do some default
setting so for example you could say
equals true default to true for is alive
and it can even default the age to
something if you wanted to but will
default up to 0 which is the default for
an integer but now it's at least set and
it's only the first and last name but
we'll leave those alone so that is a
model and we'll use that a little bit to
create we create a new controller but
for now once we look it is and close it
out now I had send that the view is
missing stuff there's stuff missing here
now I'll show you where that is so if
you go into views folder and you look in
the shared folder here there is an
underscore layout dot CSS HTML if we
don't like that this looks like an
actual HTML page we have our head up
here we have our body here we have some
interesting things but it says scripts
so at least we know that there's jQuery
and bootstrap scripts
but is different and I'll cover us in a
minute but for now just not--that's list
scripts to other JavaScript scripts so
this is more like our page
well if you notice right down here
inside of the body inside of a div
called container body content or the
class container in body content we have
this at render body now what this does
and I'll explain the ads in a minute but
for right now what this does right here
is it takes our view so index dot CSS
HTML it takes that HTML code and sticks
it here so who want to go to the about
page it takes out the code for index
from here and it takes the code for
about and puts it here and that's how it
changes from page to page and so when
we're creating a new controller with new
views all we really doing is just saying
replace this code right here this little
bit with this bit of HTML that I wrote
with little or big for example the about
page very little whereas the index page
it's a bit more doesn't matter we have
to stick it here now why is that helpful
well notice up here and you don't have
to understand all the HTML was doing and
we'll see what's doing but for right now
is note this up here is navigation well
all of our navigation is rendered once
so it's always it always looks the same
no matter what page were on and that's
kind of helpful down here we have our
footer with a copyright notice and it
says copyright date time now year so
2017 is the turn here 2017 my asp.net
application that's a copyright because
I'm
every single page the scripts are on
every single page up here we have styles
on every single page and so all that
stuff doesn't have to repeat it from
page to page the page or from view to
view to view instead each view just
takes its code and puts it into this
right here and so takes it as a part and
puts it into the whole now lastly I want
to talk about before we actually hit
play and see how this website renders
the last thing I want to talk about is
what's called the razor syntax or a cor
razor the razor syntax is Microsoft's
creation that allows us to mix C sharp
and HTML and it's really quite brilliant
notice ever receive this @ symbol right
here that @ symbol says I am going to
bring in some C sharp code but notice
how it's mixed right inside of our HTML
it's not a problem
the rendering engine is smart enough to
know when C sharp stuff starts and when
it ends so for example down here we have
at HTML action link and that passed in
three parameters what this does is it
creates a link on a page but that link
is based upon a path a route so it's the
home controller the index action and it
says we're going to have the actual text
be home now why is it important to have
this method right here well normally a
link has the full path so HTTP colon
slash slash
localhost colon 13 297 whatever it is
slash all that stuff
we don't have any of that here this
method takes care of everything
including finding out what the link is
what the URL path should be all the way
to the home controller the index action
it's kind of nice little tool to have
well that's a c-sharp method but notice
right here we have our list item tag and
so it says list item and then it has
c-sharp code right away so it's HTML
code or a CL markup and then c-sharp
code and then right back to HTML markup
to close out the list item and so the
rendering engine says no problem I know
how to do this and so it knows based
upon the brackets or the spaces wherever
else we do it says okay I know this is a
transition from c-sharp back to HTML
every once in a while this gets a little
confused don't worry the way to get
around that to tell the rendering engine
this is where c-sharp starts and ends
and that's what curly braces but the
most parts this right in line works
really well and so down here we have the
copyright symbol and then we say grab
the c-sharp date time now year and then
it puts that value which is 2017 for
this current year they put that right in
this spot and keeps going remember that
the client never has access to this not
even in the code behind in the browser
instead all they see is 2017 so big
parts of the MVC framework is using this
razor engine now notice on the index
page we've skipped over this right here
there's a curly braces
and here was doing it is saying viewbag
dot title equals this so it's actually
saying here's this property assignment
this value that's all c-sharp it knows a
semicolon even and so we have as at
curly brace and then close curly brace
so the razor engine knows that
everything between these two curly
braces is c-sharp code only now the
viewbag itself this is a pet peeve of
mine the view value I would recommend
that you not use that often use it
sparingly once people learn about the
view bag they tend to think that it's
for everything and it really isn't the
view bag should be used as little as
possible but what is is this grab bag
you can use it for anything you want
this dot title property doesn't
technically exist until we create it so
for example I could say view bag dots
notice the dot does not recover any
intellisense dot superhero equals Tim
which is a little thing to much myself
but that's okay
so that works it would compile it work
because I've now add a new property to
the view bag we can put any kind of
object in this property you want because
it's dynamic now in this case Microsoft
has said we want to use the view bag
title we go back to layout dot CSS HTML
and scroll a top notice here in the head
we have a title tag and that's a title
for the web page and it says at viewbag
dot title - my asp net application so
this page can change that title and if
we look the about page also changes that
title so depending on which view you are
going to the title of the webpage will
change even though we're not actually
changing this right here the actual
layout dot CSS HTML because we are
changing a bit of it with this viewbag
dot title so if you want you to put a
little stuff like that and that's great
just don't stuff it full of tons of data
that makes your application blooood and
it slows any web server and it causes
some problems so just try and limit that
to just little stuff okay so the quick
overview we've learned about what razor
is we've learned that this right here is
just a web part a piece and that piece
gets put into this at render body which
is razor by the way just call any render
body method inside of c-sharp and so our
actual web page is rendered off of
layout dot CSS HTML and then which view
we're looking at index contacts about or
a different when we create so let's
actually run this right now and just see
how this web page looks now right now it
says Google Chrome next to the play
button it may be different for you in
fact if I do the drop down here notice
Chrome Internet Explorer Microsoft edge
or even Windows Phone I don't have
Firefox installed currently so I don't
have Firefox news list but if I did that
browser would show up as well and so
since google chrome is my default
browser it gets chosen here which I love
chrome so we'll use that the reason this
choice is significant is because we can
actually open different browsers to test
out if they all look similar
and this is more of an issue going back
a couple years that is now but they're
using major problems with rendering from
Internet Explorer to Chrome - you know
Safari and so the idea of having the
ability to display your application on
one or more browsers and try it out and
switch very very easily was a big deal
now it's still an issue but it's not
merely the issue that it was you can
also say if you say browse with and wait
for it there we go
we can actually select multiple and say
browse and if you do that it will open
let's actually close that one that one
or not select that one so I could say
open Chrome Internet Explorer and edge
and will actually open three different
windows at the same time and show you
the same exact website for now though
we're just going to run Google Chrome so
I'll run this you get this page right
here we're saying okay your application
is starting what it starts here is our
application now again remember this is
bootstrap if you're not familiar
bootstrap is a responsive framework
meaning when I maximize this page it
layout in three different columns down
here but if I were to shrink it down
notice those three columns are now one
stacked column if I shrink it down even
further notice as many of our up here
that changes to this little drop down
here that's just stuff that bootstrap
does and it's really cool and it does a
lot of fun stuff
but for now let's look at our page
notice it says up here in the upper left
home page because we are on the index
page remember index set the view bag we
come back over here the view bag that
tiled to
Paige so now let's go to the about page
also note the URL before you continue
the URL here is localhost colon 63 564
this right here is the port number and
that will change depending on your build
because it will change where it's hosted
and so don't let that that's just the is
Express on your machine running a
background a copy or a slimmed-down copy
of is which is Microsoft's internet
information server which is how they
host web pages and they have to have
that running in order to actually view a
web page now I look at the code behind
for this to f12 alright so here is our
code behind if I look at this 2017 so if
I select that notice it says copyright
2017 not date time now dot year I can't
see that I told you that but I wanted to
show you that okay so you seem that a
URL right now is just localhost but
watch what happens when I click the
about link it now says slash home slash
about and this is the about page also
notice up here it says about in my title
bar if I say contact
it says slash home slash contact go back
to home there's no slash anything and
this is all about routing so if I wanted
a contact page and I knew that it was
the home controller it's a slash home
controller slash contact page and I hit
enter
it takes me to the contact page so this
is the route to go to to go to contact
we can avoid having people have to type
those things in by creating these links
those that link is one of those action
links created by the razor engine based
upon the controller and the action now
we'll get into how those routes are set
up in just a minute but for now I'll go
back and look at this page right here
now let's make this half the size of the
screen and we'll select the visual
studio is the other half
let's take us out now if I come over
here to my index dot CSS HTML page which
is the view I can start making some
modifications even though I'm currently
running I can make modifications to my
HTML not my c-sharp
but my HTML so for example this asp.net
and right up here I want to change that
to say demo on YouTube I say that
nothing happens the wait there's this
little refresh link here if I click that
notice it's already refreshing the
Chrome browser as a demo on YouTube now
I could have come over here and hit
refresh over here so why is it important
to have this little blink here well
right now we only have one browser
linked knows a little tooltip there but
what if I open this in Chrome Firefox
Internet Explorer and edge do you think
a lot hit refresh on four different
browsers instead I hit the floor refresh
right here and will refresh every linked
browser you can also the drop down here
and see which
warehouses there are by going to the
browser link dashboard or you can see
the actual command ctrl + Alt + Enter to
refresh the link browsers next let's
look at close us out and see where these
routes take us so the routing happens in
this app underscores start folder we
have bundle config filter config and
route config let's go to route config
we'll come back to bundle config in a
bit so the route config is where the MVC
application figures out how it navigates
between controllers and actions and so
right here we see we can ignore this
this is a default to ignore this route
don't worry about it but down here we
have routes dot map route and this is a
default route and so it says controller
slash action slash ID so that's saying
is after that localhost colon and the
port number the next thing it's going to
look for the next thing it's going to be
the controller the next thing is there
the action one thing after that is the
ID so remember that the about page was
slash home
that's a controller slash about that's
the action it didn't have a slash ID and
the the home page the the starting page
didn't have anything well if you look
down here we have defaults
it says the controller this right here
the default is home for the
the default is index then or that the
home page is in the home controller and
the index action and the ID is URL
parameter dot optional meaning we don't
have to have it so if we don't specify
an action it's going to assume the index
action if we don't specify a controller
it's going to assume the home controller
now we can't say localhost / about
because it wouldn't know what the
controller is so we set the specified
controller if we're on specify the
action but if we say localhost / home
it's going to say okay no problem I will
go to the index action and please say
just local hosts and I am assuming you
put the port number on there or say look
just local host then it's going to go to
slash home slash index as its assumption
it's not going to change the URL it's
just going to assume those two values
home and index you'll also assume there
is no ID since that's optional so the
question that comes why you care and the
answer is simple for the most part
you shouldn't okay again my piece of
advice my best practice would be that
you just leave this register routes
method entirely alone however there are
times when you may want to add a route
add a new way of doing routing for
example
web api which memory cities for i love
web api they have the same idea of
controllers in web api but and actions
too but they don't want to get confused
with MVC because remember those two live
kind together wherever you get Web API
you get MVC as well and so what they do
is they add new mapping and they put
above this mapping and the reason
because above is because these routes
get looked at in this order so does does
it match this if yes do it if it doesn't
does it match this if yes then do it and
so for a web api they say API slash now
I don't they have the ID here but so
what they do is they say if you see API
in what would be the controller spot
it's not a controller called
API it goes then to the web api
processor and then the next thing is you
look for controller action and ID when
your name so there's something else
called me of API that's Web API row and
so when we get a URL if I come in here
and say okay what are the routes we have
the first route is the web api route
does after localhost does it say API if
so this is the route handler however if
it doesn't say API then it goes down
here int as well whatever's after
localhost must be the controller and so
that's how we can have multiple routes
to do different things again I wouldn't
typically think that you would need this
I've used a couple times for very very
specific circumstances
but the most part I don't even touch
this file I leave it alone I do think
however it's important to at least know
how its routing works because NVC if
you're not careful can feel an awful lot
like magic happens the problem I really
really hate magic when it comes to
programming and you've probably heard it
before but whenever you have magic and
programming where you say it just works
the problem is when it stops working you
don't know why and that's why I try and
cover these things that may be a little
off the beaten path but I really think
you should know because if something
breaks in the routing you know where to
go
app underscore starts route config dot
CS now is one more thing I want to cover
before we start modifying a site in
earnest and that is the bundling so
let's close all of this so we have the
layout CSS HTML which that's under the
shared folder under views to view share
folder underscore layout dot CSS HTML
and this is our our standard page this
is the full page remember this is where
our our part goes our view now remember
I said before that I want to go over
what this scripts dot render is but for
now just think about it as that's where
our scripts are well let's cover what
this is this is called bundling and so
instead of having a script tag here and
a script tag would look something like
this we'd say script SRC equals you have
path so maybe scripts slash bootstrap
dot J s
something like that hopes lysed left
there yeah I mean an end tag sorry there
we go so that would be with a standard
script tag would look like
so we'd have our path to slash script /
bootstrap jas that's by the way right
here notice this tilde here the tilde
means from the root of our web
application in this case our root is
that localhost colon the port so from
there it's slash scripts slash bootstrap
j/s so that's a typical script but we
don't have those here instead we have
this at which indicates the razor
framework scripts dot render which is a
c-sharp method that has that same Tildy
so it means from the root of our website
so localhost colon the port slash
bundles slash jQuery well if you look
let's kind of collapse it all down I
don't see a bundles folder again root
where is the bundles folder it's looking
for it and somehow it works so where is
it well it's actually part of our app on
our source Start folder we have bundle
config let's open that up now I'm going
to give you a little bit of a caveat
here this is Microsoft's original way of
doing bundling and what bundling is is
grouping together scripts into one group
essentially that's every done it but
there are better ways out there in the
open source community that that work
better for example web pack is one way
of doing it and so there's other ways of
doing this
but Microsoft
has kind of kept with us bundling for
now my guess is that bundling is on the
way out and that at some point we'll see
them use again some industry standard
ways of grouping these scripts together
so I wouldn't go head over heels of
bundling but at the same time you don't
have to avoid them either
so what bundling is is in this registers
bundle register bundles method we can
add one or more bundles and name them so
for example this personally here bundles
dot add it's a method new script bundle
now as a script bundle and there's style
bundle and come a style in it that's
just CSS so script bundle said okay here
is the name in this case a name is from
the root localhost colon port number
slash bundle slash jQuery which sounds
familiar because over here render
bundles slash jQuery so that's the
bundle name is it include and here's the
scripts we're output in this bundle in
this case this one script and that
script is starting from the root slash
scripts let this folder right here slash
jQuery - and then these curly braces
version will notice jQuery - 1.0
I'm sorry 110 - Jas so it's saying
include the jQuery whichever version we
have included here now you can probably
see the benefits of doing this right now
because this version here allows us to
say we don't really care which version
of jQuery we have whatever version it is
we're now in it so if we change to
jQuery
- 3.2.1 I believe it was the latest
jQuery
it will replace this one dot 10.2 with a
3.2.1 version and we wouldn't have to do
anything else with our application
because it's still bringing that same
bundle and that one would have a newest
version of jQuery so that's kind of nice
but this bundle is a little bit lame in
the fact that it only brings in one
script that's it whereas down here the
bootstrap bundle brings in bootstrap j/s
and responds yes that's a little better
now the reason we have multiple bundles
is because ordering is important when it
comes to JavaScript and so you have to
for example load jQuery before you load
jQuery dot validates because jQuery
validate relies on jQuery so the short
version of this is that Microsoft has
created some bundles and they've put in
the right spot so jQuery and then
bootstrap they put in the right spots
for when they're needed there's
moderniser and if you wanted to add your
own bundle just basically copy what
they're doing and then put your own
values in here is the name and then here
is what to include as you want include
moya one thing just say comma and the
next thing and if you want the same
thing happens with CSS they only have
one style bundle but they call it
content slash CSS and so they have the
bootstrap CSS which is pretty important
but then also your site dot CSS the
thing I like here is under content that
site dot CSS there's not much in here
what that's meant for though is meant
for you to put your own custom CSS and
say alright put a placeholder there and
said ok put your own CSS there that's
great
and they'll go ahead and render that for
you now I kind of wish they had the same
thing for JavaScript and I don't and so
if you want to add that email I put in
this bootstrap bundle here or you might
want create your own bundle and then
just add it afterwards here so it's real
to you now I saw that's the final thing
that I want to cover one more thing real
quick just briefly then we'll come back
to it because I wanted it on the screen
and I don't want you to say hey I'm
skipping over something at render
section this is a fun one and so what
this at render section does is says
sometimes you might want to put stuff in
more than one location no worries we'll
create this at render section and you
can create as many as you want input in
different places in this layout dot CSS
HTML page and what allows you to do is
later put stuff here or if you had one
of these up here put stuff in the menu
if you wanted to you create lots of
little widgets and have them all over
the place and have each different page
or each different view update what's in
that little widget but in this case
Microsoft includes one by default and
it's not required so requires false but
what is is at render section called
scripts cuz up said ok I will put code
right here and notice it's right before
the close of the body tag now this is
where you put any custom JavaScript so
let's say ferment that your index page
let's go back over there to index so
interviews the home index page so this
page whined to have some to mess with
JavaScript a it wants to
do something where it changes the color
of this h1 tag let's just say and it
wanted to use jQuery to do it because
jQuery is a nice easy way of accessing
itis well if we put our script right
down here said script type equals text
JavaScript and then put our our access
to jQuery whatever I do and you know
let's just pretend that's JavaScript so
if we put that here where does this
script tag end up well it ends up right
here why is that a problem well remember
that javascript is order dependent guess
where jQuery is down here so we're
calling we're having a script up here
that calls jQuery but jQuery is not
loaded yet down here that's a problem
instead what we do is we actually cut
this out here let's start over we
actually do a render section so we'd say
at section all lowercase and then we'd
say this section is the script section
and here I could paste my JavaScript my
script tag and so now since it says
section scripts which we defined over
here scripts render section and so it
says okay
on the index page I have this little bit
of code right here it's not going to go
here that code goes in the render
section called scripts right down here
well guess what this is below jQuery now
this script has access
to the dollar sign and all the rest the
jQuery provides fun stuff so that render
section pretty powerful stuff mostly I
use it for just that those scripts but
even that's a pretty limited operation
because and I haven't really covered
this because I don't I haven't recovered
HTML CSS and JavaScript yet on this
channel but you really shouldn't have
JavaScript right on your HTML page it's
it's just not a great idea the most part
you should have JavaScript in their own
files and you should access them as
needed but you kind of want to separate
those two a bit now there's a little bit
debate there but the most part that's
the case it used to be we put JavaScript
right on its pages put a whole bunch of
JavaScript there the problem is is no
code reuse and it gets kind of messy and
this and other things come along with
that and so I recommend you create your
own J's file and access it from here if
you need to and so there might be a few
calls here of the most part all your
javascript is located in its own file so
there probably a ton of JavaScript here
maybe it's a few calls or a few calls
out to a few methods you create but
there may be a little bit JavaScript
here and so this is kind of important to
know so that's the render section all
right so does enough explaining going
over and covering enough theory
essentially let's go ahead and actually
create a new controller and use our
model we created and create some views
so do that let's shrink these down from
it let's go to our controllers and say
you know what I want to have a person
controller so I right click in
controllers say add no at the top option
is controller well that's what we want
now really controller if we open up home
controller it really is just a
a class but inherits from controller so
there is a little bit there
it also has this public action result
and and all the rest so there's a little
structure that we create so usually I
use this and controller instead of added
class just it makes it a little bit
easier so let's just do add controller
and I'm going to say leave it alone the
MVC 5 controller empty now there's a
whole bunch of fun little templates here
that you could use where maybe you want
to have a control with read/write
actions if you want to play that or play
around that you can it creates some quit
that stuff so create action to read
action the update action delete action
and the list action that's a lot of
stuff alright and if you want to use any
framework which again not a big fan of
but you could do it too if that stuff
the most part stick with your empty
controller now I can add it brings up
this dialog box here notice I haven't
touched anything
notice how default is highlighted and
controller is not and this is just a
help for you is try and tell you hey you
you name a controller something with
controller at the end in this case let's
call it the people controller I add and
it's going to scaffold out a controller
for me which really means it just
creates the class name inherit some
controller and creates my index method
which is nice because remember the
default for a route is to call the index
action so if I say localhost call the
porch slash people if those are the
people controller and since I have not
specified an action it will go to the
index
action now what happens if the index
action isn't there bad things so it kind
of nice to have this index method
already here so you already have as
action now notice down in my views
folder I now have a people folder it's
empty
let the people folder there that's part
of what NBC does when you use that
controller now I have this index action
which returns of you kind of cool but
now that create the matching CS HTML
file for my view well don't worry
there's actually a shortcut to doing
that if I right click on my method name
notice that the first two options are go
to view well there isn't one or add view
and that's the one you want add view now
this is okay what's the view name well
it's the index view because it's the
index action so it puts that there you
could change it don't change it now the
next thing it says is what template do
you want to use this template is the
empty template meaning without a model
or do you why use why other templates to
create the lead the details the add the
empty the lists look over a couple of
these in a minute but for now let's
create the empty without model template
create a partial view at unchecked we're
not going to cover partial views in this
video getting long enough as it is
but that's an option leave that blank
for now until you know what you're doing
now you use a layout page by default
this is checked which is good where I
use that underscore layout CSS HTML file
because that's where all the other stuff
is as far as the head goes in the body
the script tags and the CSS and all the
rest
as as leave empty is set as a razor
underscore view start file which is the
this file here so yeah leave it empty
but that does mean you can change your
layout to a different layout maybe you
have two or three different layouts for
example you might have a layout for
employees and different layout for
guests so you have the same views but
maybe they have different menu options
or menus or maybe they have different
color schemes whatever you want to have
it would be a different layout page
would work for that sorry I add now
notice under people we now have index es
HTML by default it adds that view bag
title and says index let's go ahead and
change that to be people so for the
index page we'll say the view bag let's
say people and then this is the default
people view just so you know what it's
going to look like now if we hit run
once we fist the load your application
starting one to start
whereas see how to access this page I
noticed since us on this index CSS HTML
page when I ran it guess is you know
what you probably go to that page
therefore I'll take you there
see slash people slash index let's come
back here for a minute and now we're at
the home page because that's default
route and if we were to do slash home
it's still here because remember if we
don't specify a controller then the
controller default is home if we don't
specify an action the action default is
indexed therefore since we're not
specifying the action it's saying the
action is index well that's still this
page because this page is home slash
index but if we instead say slash people
there's our default people view even
though we have not specified slash index
because the default page or default
action is index action also notice up
here it says people and there's our h2
tag we specified they're pretty basic
stuff right now we've created a one
method which is already kind of there we
created a view for it and we said load
that view just by navigating to it
manually
well let's create a new action so public
action results and let's call this list
people now
let's start with just returned view but
you know what let's actually create a
list of people let's the person plane
type I'll do control dot to find that
person it's not finding it let's flat
why if person model that's why person
model now I do control dot and add the
using statement for MBC demo dot models
and we'll call this people equals new
list of person and we'll say people dot
add new person model I'll say first name
equals Tim last name equals Cory age
equals 38 and is alive equals true we
need to specify that because that's the
false true all right so there's one
person add to our list let's copy this a
couple more times we'll say Joe Smith
whose age is 56 and we'll add Sarah
Sarah Connor and we're never quite sure
what her age is because always changes
so those are the three people we're
going to add to our list now this is our
model that's people person model and now
this is actually our data say it again
it's from a database may be asked our
class library give me all the people in
the people table on a sequel database
that's what this is simulating something
like that now obviously wouldn't have
this dummy data like this but let's
pretend like we're doing that
so now how I give this list to the view
well it's actually pretty simple like
that so return the view and pass in any
object and kind of a string if you want
a model or a list of model it doesn't
really matter now I recommend only a
model or a list of model now don't
forget we're not done yet we need to
create the view so I right click on list
people say add view the view name list
people the template I want this to be a
list what's the model class that would
be the person model so the individual
model is a person model but see a list
of them now the really cool thing is
that built right in and understands how
to deal with this data the model class
it just looks for any kind of class
that's not a controller looks for any
kind class is it okay that could be a
model in this case the person model now
just as a quick note in older versions
of Visual Studio it used to be that your
model might not show up in this list if
you had not yet compiled now I believe
it's been changed since then I haven't
had a problem recently with it but if
your model is not in a list what you to
do is exit out of here go to the build
menu and say build the project or just
hit the red arm to the green play button
and then close it out once it opens up
either way in a compiler application
but I believe in 2017 is taken care of
for you but just so you know in case
you're using an older version of Visual
Studio or in case that doesn't show up
for you for some reason
so we've got the mile selected it's a
list template and I wouldn't have to use
this template I don't want I could use
an empty template but I kind of like to
use the list template because it gives
me a structure to work from a starting
point I can then edit how I want
everything else do the same we hit add
now is a lot more stuff going on here
then in our other our index so index
that was it now we have this so let's
look at what this is really doing the
first change is this at model at the
very top and it says ienumerable MVC
demo dot models dot person model and
that's our list of model but until list
is ienumerable and that's okay to have
ienumerable instead of list next we have
this h2 it says list of people that has
a paragraph tag with an action link for
creating a new person now notice this
has two values instead of three like
before previous on action links we had
both the controller and the action but
in this overload is the name and it's
the actual action but no controller is
it assumes the person controller or the
people controller now that's gonna
create a link going nowhere we don't
have a create action yet but we'll leave
it alone for now
then it creates a table and this is the
reason why I like doing it this way with
the template because it shows us kind of
how to do this this whole layout with
lists so it starts off with display name
for model and then this arrow that's
kind of the link arrow model dot first
name so what this display name for
says is give me the display name for
first name which in our case it says
first name and last name and age and is
alive and then we have an at for each
now again you gotta catch this
this is c-sharp code let's raise ur so
it's c-sharp a for each so same for each
item in model so that's going to say for
each person essentially and it has open
curly braces but we're mixing in HTML so
notice even though we got four each
which really take is a c-sharp
constructs and has the open closing
curly braces we can still mix in our
HTML which is cool because we're now
allowed to do things like this where
we're saying for each person create a
new row in the table and then do display
for their first name last name age and
is alive you know it's different here
for display for display name for and
display for depending on this is for the
name of this column this is for the
value in depending on the type if going
to change how we render the HTML for
this particular item in this case age
vs. is alive and we'll see that in a
minute
then finally have this down here three
action links again three locations
you'll have yet three actions don't have
yet the Edit action the details action
and the delete action we'll come back to
that in a minute but just note that this
template kind of thinks that we're going
to create a full application a full crud
application create read update and
delete and so it's okay I'm going to
show you all the people but now you
should probably have a ability to create
a new person and you should probably be
able to edit an existing person and you
should probably bill see
details basically an existing person
probably will delete that person so
that's kind of their concept of how this
is working so it's really built that
full crud operation if you don't want to
do full crud
no problem just take this out but for
now let's actually run this so I'll say
run I'll wait for it to build it's
loading it takes a bit for NVC get
started the first time but in this cool
this is since again we're in the CS HTML
file it said ok you probably go right
there and so it takes me to this page
right here notice and it's what I
created a bool especially is alive those
are check boxes it's not like this is a
text box it says true or false
it says boolean it's only two values
true or false
that's what check box is true or false
therefore when we say display four is
alive it's going to render that as a
check box so we have Tim Cory H 38 and
is alive is true in fact all these are
is alive so this shows us how to use a
model and a list of model now we could
wire up these other ones we won't but
for now just note that this is a pretty
powerful templating engine it gives you
all the examples you need because you
probably remember display four versus
display name for no problem just use a
template and say okay from here I want
to do something different we would have
to use a table we
strip this down so you know what forget
the titles forget all this instead where
it's going to list out to a forage and
list out each person's first name we can
do that and that would work and so
there's a lot of things you can do here
from this point it's a whole lot easier
to start from here then it is to start
from that blank page and go how do I
loop through again how do I display the
value for a way that creates the right
type of input element all those kind of
things this just makes a whole lot
easier to start from this and then
modify going forward all right now if I
were to actually click on these links
here I get this it's a 404 now 404 is an
error that's kind of big bad it's one of
those things where if you run this air
it means that you've kind of wandered
off a path and it's a problem you
definitely don't want to have 404 errors
in your application so make sure that
you either change those to like take
them out or actually add those actions
in now I'll show you something else as
well and that's the idea of creating
errors or having errors in your
application so let's go back over the
people controller so I'm going to create
intentionally an error so let's say
person model T equals new person model
now I'm going to say int I equals P age
let's actually flip this around so say
five divided by H now what's the age
right now well age is defaulting to 0 so
5 divided by 0 well that's a divided by
zero error what's going to happen
let's run find out so we have run chrome
we're going to show you what an error
looks like wait for it to load all right
so now let's go to the people controller
remember the index action is a default
so I'm going to specify index I get this
error now I'm debugging so let's
simulate the idea that we're not
actually debugging and so we wouldn't
have caught this in our code before you
that I shall point out that the new
exception box is a whole lot more
intuitive now it kind of trimmed out all
that stuff you probably didn't need
anyways and it really comes down to
attempted to divide by zero you still
have the details so you open that up you
can you can still copy details you can
look at the exception settings all of
fun stuff but let's instead hit continue
this is the yellow screen of death it's
what you'll see on your website if you
have an exception now here's the problem
you don't want to show this to your
customer your end user and the reason
why not is because look at this source
error line 16 int I equals 5 divided by
pH and by the way here is the stack
trace so you have all the information
you need to understand how this
application works including the
controller it's in the line it is here's
the code surrounding that line and here
is the complete stack trace so that's
that sense of information remember I
three for that the end user only gets
HTML CSS and JavaScript
well we've now
I elated that we've shown them c-sharp
code well there's a way to solve this if
we go to the web.config now if you're
familiar with the wind forms or DPS
there's the app config these two are
functionally equivalent it's just that
on the web we have web config on for
applications like desktop applications
we have app document fig so web config
it's got a little more stuff in it than
we're used to probably but right here
under system dot web we need to add a
new tag so in here we say custom notice
the intellisense so we can just use that
errors mode equals we have three options
off on and remote only and so as i
saying is we're turning custom errors
either on or off or only for most what
our custom errors well whenever we would
normally have that yellow screen of
death where we have the the c-sharp code
instead if custom errors are on will
display a a friendly error message page
or if custom errors all remotes only if
anyone not on the webserver itself gets
the error will go to the friendly page
but if you're on the web server you'll
get the yellow screen of death or again
off would be we're not using custom
errors show that yellow screen of death
this is what i use typically remote only
and the reason why is because for my end
users i don't want them to see the error
but i want to the error which I want
that valuable debugging information
now we're currently on the server so
instead let's just show it as on for
custom error because that way we'll only
ever get custom errors so let's run it
again remember that exact same problem
by doing a slash people and we'll see
why our error page looks like now okay
so we had a same error we continued and
now we have this nice generic very very
simple web page that says error an error
is a crude oil processing your request
it's ugly but it's a whole lot prettier
for the end user
then the showing of source code is or a
stack trace and also it protects our our
site where is this page come from well
if we come back over here to the shared
folder err dot CSS HTML error an error
is a career well processing your request
so there you go you can change this page
to be you have something fun you can
change this page to be something
light-hearted or more informative or you
can actually have multiple of these
error pages depending on what type of
air you got a four oh four or 500 or a
401 or a 403 does only matter you can
send different pages based on that but
for now the simplest thing to do is just
add this custom errors mode equals on or
remote only and then modify this error
dot CSS HTML file and now you're not
showing users that ugly error screen
okay there's a couple things they have
not yet shared the lonk over before
we're done the first one is this global
dot a si X file this is where your
application really starts the
application on its course starts
now we had only covered areas but we
really won't in this video but those are
our registering areas there we don't
have any areas right now but now here we
have filter config and maybe we skip the
filters we don't reuse filters either
but then you have routes register routes
and there's our routes register bundles
and there's our bundles so that's where
the the bundles and the routes are
registered so if you were to do this
well now you don't hate bundles and so
that would be a problem and that's where
you come to fix it is in global de si X
again you probably shouldn't change this
file but that's where this is if you
want to register something else for
example a global logging system probably
here at the right spot so that's this
file right here and then also we have
the view underscore view start so we
have as a views folder and inside views
let's collapse the other ones inside
views we have as view start dot CSS HTML
inside here it specifies the default
layout which in our case is underscore
layout so again not really magic this is
where we specify that this underscore
layout CSS HTML is our default layout we
could change that you wanted to you
could change it to underscore your
company name default layout dot C S HTML
that's fine and then just change this
file here as well so those two things I
thought were important to at least show
you so you have idea that are there but
it's probably not something you need to
modify other files are the packages that
config this is where all of our new get
packages are specified you don't touch
this really usually use the editor under
references right click config mesh NuGet
packages
so leave it all alone now when it comes
to actually deploying an MVC web site
it's a little more complicated than
deploying an actual web site an MVC web
site is actually compiled the nice thing
is if you right-click on the project and
say publish it has some options there as
far as a sure is or FTP you're pushing
to a folder and you can set all that up
so just note that also and this is just
a dotnet thing in general but if you
were a check within a source source code
control so for example get would
probably the source control you'd use
one of things you make sure again this
is a dotnet thing in general but I'll
specify here this packages folder does
not get checked in the source control
okay this is this hidden dot vs file or
folder you'd only check in the SLN and
everything in here or most everything in
this MVC demo folder the reason you not
do not check in packages as a ton of
them here these are all of our new get
packages we get those when we build the
application or when we ask for them
instead a check in is this packages
config file this specifies the packages
we need so it does not find them when it
goes to build they will say okay go and
nougat and get these so that's just kind
of a little tip there when it comes to
get I'll have a video series on get kind
of shortly but but that's kind of
important a note if you're checking that
in the source control okay so that's MVC
we create a new controller called people
controller we add two actions to it we
created those two matching views we
actually used our model and it really
covered everything in here as far as the
base demo goes from here you can really
create
very impressive websites by just putting
different pieces together now it haven't
covered what hTML is what CSS is what
JavaScript is and that's not really in
the purview of this video so if you're
not really comfortable with those yet
I'd say probably hold off on trying to
build web applications because even
though a lot of this is CSS I'm sorry a
c-sharp there is still an awful lot
that's HTML CSS and JavaScript so it'd
be important to learn those or get a
pretty good foundation though before you
move on now upcoming on this channel you
will see some content on HTML CSS and
JavaScript so you'll get some of that
content in the near future but for now
if you're not comfortable with those
three you might want to learn those
before trying to tackle a web project
like this so I hope you've enjoyed that
