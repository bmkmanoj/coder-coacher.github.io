c-sharp from start to finish course I am
Tim quarry and today we're looking at
data design
now we've already set up the boundaries
for our application the requirements
that derive how the application gets
built it kind of built a little bit of
structure but now we're going to take
those requirements and build an actual
data structure now at this point some
people may say I see it done differently
in other lessons I've seen some people
design the front-end first and then
develop the data later and that's true
some people like to design how the
application looks first and then from
that it helps them decide what to do the
data I've done that before but I found
the best success for me comes my design
of data first and here's why your
application is nothing without data in
fact your application is just a vehicle
to display manipulate change and save
data now think about that for a minute
because at first it sounds wrong so
start thinking to some examples let's
start something simple let's look at a
text editor think of maybe Microsoft
Word even what's its job well it all
revolves around the text on the page
whether it is which ions are bolded
which ions are underlined the spacing
all the rest all of that is data and it
all revolves around that that data you
give it and maybe right now you're
saying okay sure lot business
applications the basic applications you
know would use data a lot in their cast
center around data but certain
applications aren't for example a game a
game is not based around data well
really yes it is let's take for example
chess chess is all data you've got
pieces in certain locations so you have
what the piece is what it can do and
where it's located then you have the
game board and where each piece is in
relation to each other on that game
board and then you have the moves and
where the pieces go
that's all data and
that's chess but if we look at a more
complex array a larger example say a
first-person shooter game how can that
possibly be data well you have to know
where your character is and where every
other character is the compose system
does in order to know when you shoot a
bullet first of all where it's going to
go that's data how fast is going to get
there that's data and when it gets there
who is going to hit if anybody if it
hits somebody how much damage is to do
that data you start seeing all the data
that goes on behind a scene sometimes
but still is fundamental to the
application it's all about that data
again looking at that first-person
shooter game what's the end result you
want to see a victory how do you
determine victory based upon the data
that says all my foes have been
conquered so data is very important and
that's why I start with my data I will
often find that it's easier to develop
my front-end user interface once I have
my data because I see what needs to be
done and then it's just a matter of how
to accomplish that instead of just
drawing from a blank slate with no
information all right so that's enough
theory let's get into actually mapping
out our data before we get started this
lesson I wanted a quick man to help you
out if you're anything like me you
probably have a friend or relative who
thinks that because you do something
with computers you must know how to fix
their computer I don't know how many
computers I've fixed over the years so I
excited come up with a better solution
so I built a course that teaches anyone
how to properly maintain their own
computer
I call it PC maintenance for the rest of
us and it cost us 29 dollars I show
people how to download free software to
protect their computer including an
anti-virus a malware scanner and online
file storage applications then I show
them how to use each one as well as how
to maintain a computer after its cleaned
up so how does it help you well what I
do now is I tell people they have to buy
this course
watch it and do it says before I work on
the computers that solves most of their
problems both now and in the future and
they can do the same for you
you will find a link for this course on
IM tim quarry calm as well as in the
description below do what i do and you
will not only be helping me out you'll
be helping yourself as well okay let's
get back to the lesson
now typically I draw this out on a legal
pad or my whiteboard and both are great
ways to visualize what needs to happen
and the same time they're quick to
change now that's kind of hard for me to
show you on video so instead of that
kind of fast forward to when I'm done my
design but I'll walk you through a step
by step so what I do is development
there's a lot of scratch this out move
us around erase this draw a line through
this move this over here because
developing on paper is so easy to make
changes I will encourage you and I
started this course by saying don't open
visual studio yet do this development of
the plan in notepad in your scratch pad
in a legal pad in your white on your
whiteboard don't do it inside of code or
inside of Visual Studio and that still
holds true here I'm just going to show
you the cleaned up and result of all
that planning I'll walk you through some
of the the questions I have a thoughts
that I had along the way so this is
really where I start the blank page and
really this is going to be intimidating
at first because you don't know where do
I start what's the best place to start
and the answer is really just put
something down and so I said well let's
start with team I know I need to have
some kind of team that has people in it
has a team name and all the rest so I
start with team and I said on that team
we're gonna have to have members now in
parens I put this is the type that I
think we're going to have so I said
probably a list of type person I'll have
a person list yet and may at that point
I pause and say crate
personalist but my focus is on let's
just get the team built first now the
other thing here is I don't typically
put types in until after I've come back
through but in this case I'm showing you
the end product and so I put the types
in there but really what you want to do
is you want to get all the information
about team down first before you do
anything else don't worry about types
for now but do a second pass after you
got all the data in place do a second
pass and assign types each one just to
make sure you understand how this is
whole this whole thing's going to work
again since I didn't have a type person
yet I'd make a note of that but not
actually develop the person class or the
person group of information yes because
I'm focusing on team if I leave team to
build person I might forget where I was
in team and miss a key component so
always focus on one thing at a time
everything else gets written down for
later so I have members so that would be
the number of people on a team which
could be one person it's a one person
team say for our ping-pong tournament or
it could be five people say for a
basketball team or it could be twenty
people maybe for some kind of office
game it doesn't matter what matters is
do we have that list it can have really
zero or more but in our case we kind of
or sit ahead at least one person on a
team the team name we know that each
team has to have a name in order to call
it something better than Tim Bob Mary
Sue all that may be a great team name
who knows and that'd be a string so
that's we all the team classes so let's
move on a person since we created this
list of person let's go ahead and now
create that person object so you get
that out of mind too we have a first
name which is a string that's pretty
straightforward a last name also string
we could have asked for just name and
had first and last name together but I
find that breaking that part in two
different properties of two different
data points is first of all best
practice in the industry meaning the
industry does this by default or does
it's mostly
but also it makes a whole lot easier for
us to do things like have an email where
it says dear Tim it seems more personal
that way instead of dear Tim Cory so
breaking apart in two different objects
and having a user break that apart is
very important you could say well I know
how to break a string apart based on the
space therefore tim Cory could be in
that very well he'd break it apart and
say the first part is the first name the
second parts the last name which only
works when a person only has one space
in their full name what if for example
they said they had a last name that has
space in the in space Wilder is the last
name Van Wilder
well that would come out as split apart
that's a problem Wilder is not the last
name is Ben Wilder first name is Joey
the same thing is true for first name
the first name is Mary Sue well the
first name truly is Mary Sue where they
put Mary Sue their first name Mary Sue
Smith if we broke down apart we'd say
the first thing as Mary not Mary Sue so
breaking things apart can get ugly
really quickly instead of breaking
things apart later you can put them
together later and that also allows you
to do interesting things like last name
comma first name or first initial last
name okay let's look at the next
property email address can you capture
the person's email address that's an
also string and cell phone number and
that too is a string and that trips some
people up here the idea that right in
the name cell phone number and yet we're
not saving it as some type of numbers
into a double or anything like that
we're storing it as a string and the
reason why is because we don't treat a
cell phone number as if we as if it were
a number itself so for example the
number we can add from to that which is
subtract from it we can divide and
multiply it but doing that to a cell
phone number doesn't make sense
we wouldn't add to to a cell phone
number for any reason the cell phone
number is way is and never changes also
we might want to store
sometimes formatting for example around
the area code in the United States we
put parentheses and put a space and then
after the first three numbers of the
actual phone number we put a dash and
then the last four well you can't really
do that and store it that way you might
say well yeah but I'll store as just
numbers well that's great but still
doesn't get past the idea of this isn't
really a number to be manipulated so
we're going to store as a string now you
may have caught me saying a couple times
properties and I want to stop for a
minute and point that out really what
we're doing here is we're creating our
classes so a team's going a class person
via class and inside those classes will
be these properties now it's not direct
one-to-one match up match up right now
because for example cell phone number I
might change up a cell phone or phone
number or something like that but it's a
pretty close match up now there may be
other classes we create but these are
really our foundational classes on which
the application gets built these two
plus the of we'll talk about in a minute
and I don't want you get too caught up
in the idea of code but I do want to
think about the fact that really these
do map up pretty directly to classes
which is why I call these items
properties so just keep them to like
your mind when it comes to actually
building our class library having our
data mapped out like this makes creating
our foundation of our class libraries so
very easy ok back to our data our third
class or a third set of data we'll call
tournament and this is all the data that
surrounds the actual tournament which is
what this entire application is based
upon this is a tournament tracker so
this is going to be the central data hub
or essential bit then
everything revolves around so the first
thing we need is a tournament name now
that's not specified anywhere in
requirements but we do mention the idea
that there might be more than one
tournament at time and so if there's
more than one tournament how do you know
which tournament is which you could look
at who's playing then I what round
they're in and all the other details but
really that's that's so imprecise so
instead we're going to specify that
every tournament be given a name that we
could say ping-pong tournament
basketball tournament and then you know
exactly which tournament you're talking
about next we'll have an entry fee
remember we talked about the idea that
we could accept fees or you could say
that every person or every team needs to
turn in a fee well this entry fee is
going to allow the administrator the
person that sets up a tournament to say
there is an entry fee to this tournament
and it's ten dollars or whatever it is
and then every time we add a team to the
tournament we're going to charge that
team the entry fee
so that would be to type decimal and
that's something else to point out we'll
get into more the C sharp after we're
actually inside Visual Studio but for
now I was going to point out that
because this is money this entry fee
we should sort and type decimal not
double on the surface these two data
types look very very similar decimal and
double they both store numbers that have
a decimal point in them the difference
is precision decimal is very very
precise but also takes up a lot more
memory and so we typically only use this
or talking about money double is a
little less precise but if you look at
the actual precision we're still precise
to about I believe it's 14 decimal
places at or 14 places after the decimal
that's good enough for me but in the
case of money we really should have
decimal okay I mentioned that the entry
fee is really charged if there is one
every team that enters the tournament
which means we have to have a list of
teams in the tournament or I called it
entered teams teams that entered the
tournament and that would be a list of
type team the great thing here is we're
developing this tournament we're not
thinking about oh I have to enter the
first name last name and email addresses
and phone number of these people who
were on teams and all the rest were just
concentrated on what the tournament
needs even if we hadn't yet created that
team or that list of person called team
members or anything else we could say I
just need a list of teams and then from
there we could say okay yeah team this
is what I need and in person this is
what I need and so really we're
developing as data we can't look too
broadly we have to focus on just what
makes sense
for this particular object as particular
chunk of the data what goes together in
this case we're talking a tournament so
a name of a tournament the entry fee the
enter teams and then also the prizes the
list of prizes contains just that a list
of price what surprised we talked with
the idea of having you know for first
place you get half the money or first
place you get $50 whatever we want to do
is it set up so we need to have a list
of those and this list it truly is a
zero or more list maybe don't have any
prizes maybe we have one may we have 15
the next property for our tournament if
any rounds and this one's a bit tricky
yeah I think through house is going to
work now we haven't built the match up
object yet but a match up would be one
team versus another team so we're going
to have a look from the middle out so
you have a match up that's one team
versus another we're going to have a
list of those matchups per round so a
list of matchups does
on one another list of matchups is round
two another for round three four and so
on so the so one list represents one
round therefore we have a list of a list
of matchup you get that you might have
to draw it out on paper to think it
through
we have matchups but then we have a set
of matchups that represents one round
and this round property holds all the
rounds so it has multiple lists one for
each round thus the list of a list of
matchup and that's what the tournament
object contains and you know at this
point is a couple things I want to point
out first of all we don't have the prize
object to put a matchup object yet
that's okay we've written those down as
we need these we'll get back to them or
concentrate on tournament the other
thing I want to point out here is
there's going to be data besides what
you have here you're going to miss stuff
you're going to not think things through
all the way necessarily there may be
things that you need for certain things
for example in sequel which is where you
want store our data one of the places
typically what you do is you have a
unique identifier for every row in a
table well probably team will be a table
and person will be a table and
tournament will be a table and so each
of these will probably have a unique
identifier now there are certain things
we call natural keys we could use for
identifiers for example in tournament
tournament name kind of specifies you
know this is this tournament and not one
of three tournaments called this so for
example you wouldn't have three
different tournaments all called
basketball tournament because he
couldn't identify which one was which
therefore you say men's basketball
tournament women's basketball tournament
mixed basketball tournament there's
three different ones and so the
tournament name would be unique across
all the tournaments that could be a
natural key I'm a big fan of natural
Keys I like to create my own
and so it'd be something I'd call ID and
be a discounter 1 2 3 4 it makes it a
little easier for indexing and it's just
easier to work without what is that and
so really we're missing that ID property
probably on all three of these and
that's ok if you notice that you can go
back and put that on all the places
where you need it but you're going to
miss something and that's why I want I
want to get across to you is the idea of
it's ok you may miss stuff you don't
have to get this 100 percent right don't
stress out about it instead do your best
think it through don't rush through it
for sure but make sure that you at least
get everything that you know and a
little more in here do some research
look at what other people do or what
information of your capture in these
type of situations for example a simple
example the person class right now we're
capturing first name last name email
address and cell phone number go find
out what other people do when they're
capturing a person and you may say I
have no clue look well think about
Amazon when you sign up for an account
at Amazon Amazon asks you for certain
information what is that information not
the billing information the personal
information for example they're going to
ask things like where you live they
might ask for two different phone
numbers a home phone a cell phone we
might ask you to tell them what type of
phone number you're giving them they
might ask for a middle name or middle
initial another place you can go look
would be a contact on your phone go into
contacts and say add new contact and
look at all the information that you can
add about a contact because a contact is
really just a person and you don't have
to do everything that every else does in
fact please don't but it's a really good
idea to look through some examples
to say no I don't need that no I don't
need that oh I didn't think about this
one maybe I do need that one and now let
us help you better visualize what did
you need upfront but once you've done
that again don't stress out about I have
to look at ten more example to make sure
I don't miss anything that's not what
this process is about we're gonna make
mistakes and it's okay in fact I know in
my planning I've made mistakes in fact
leave the lesson sighs I'll point out a
couple of my mistakes that I've made in
this process so far and you know what
it's okay because we can work through it
now I caught that still in the planning
step stage which is good because it's
easier to change things in planning than
it is once we start developing but you
know what even in development I'll
capture more errors or more things that
missed and we'll figure out how to
handle it at that point is it as
convenient handing it now no but you
know what you can't ever get things
perfect up front if you try to do that
you'll spend way too much time planning
you'll never get your application out
the door in a well-planned application
that's still on your legal pad is
useless what you need is something out
the door so there is that balance of
which it definitely plan before we start
building but we don't like it so bogged
down in planning that we don't build so
that's just the tension we all work
through but the biggest big key note
here that I'll point out again again is
don't worry don't overthink it okay so
let's move on we know we have prize and
matchup are two more objects we need to
create in order to support the
tournament object let's start with a
prize object into the prize object we
have a place number that's an int or a
number so what the place number is is
we're talking about first place second
place third place
and we represent that with just a number
one represents first place - second
place three third place so if I said the
place number is ten what place is that
well it's a tenth place so it's pretty
straightforward there's not any kind of
matchup you have to do we understand
number one is first place next we have
place name so this is where we're going
to specify what that place is called
and you might think when we just said
what those places are first place second
place third place but maybe we want to
call it champion is first place second
place we call first runner-up you see
how that terminology might be a little
bit different so we'll put that in this
string field the administrator at the
tournament they can specify anything
they want for that place name and then
we're using that or talking about the
prizes or one so Tim won the
championship and got $50 or Tim was the
first runner-up and earn $25 so that's
that place name it's just a name that we
are given to describe that place and it
could be first or second so now we have
the amount again this is money so it's a
decimal and that prize amount is how
much in dollars we're going to assign to
this place and if you're remembering
your requirements let's application we
said it's either a flat amount or it's a
percentage and so they also created the
prize percentage property and that's a
type double so for example point five
three 50% so if you remember back to
requirements we said it's either a prize
amount a fixed amount or it's a
percentage so how how do we represent
that in this prize object well some of
that comes down to we'll probably have
some kind of read-only property but also
prize amount is zero and prize
percentage is 0.5 we know it's 50% if
the prize amount is $20 the prize
percentage is zero we know that the
prize is $20 and so will we use that
idea of one is zero therefore the other
one is the one we use if both are zero
we have no prize which doesn't really
make sense we then create that but may
we do but that would be the prize object
a place a name and amount in the
percentage now on to the matchup object
and the matchup object we have entries
which is a list of matchup entry what's
a matchup entry we'll get to that but
the idea is that a match of entry would
be one person and still have more than
one person in a matchup obviously we
have at least two in fact this system is
designed for just two but also have that
called a list then you have a winner
we're going to specify which team is the
winner we're going to put that in its
own property that way we can pull out
information about the winner like their
email address to email them or that kind
of thing so it makes it just a little
bit easier if we have that winner
property and I also have a round number
is this match up for round 1 for round 2
for round 18 what is it and that's it so
now you how does match up entry and this
is where we describe but we have that
list of massive entry those entries what
they really mean first you have a team
competing so it's one team so that
represents this entry in the matchup is
one team their score if they have a beat
start at zero but then won't see mark
them as a score then we know and then
the parent match up so what I did here
originally I had team one team two of
the matchup object and I said we only
had ever have two teams but then I had
team one score team to score and that
didn't fit right with me the idea that
we
had properties that were mirrored for
two different teams for their
information I didn't really like that
and so I decided was I'm going to create
a list even a little um b2 I'll create a
list and now create an object for each
entry so I can have multiple data points
about that entry in one object and why
the way this helps me is I can reorder
that list based upon things like score
so I can say give me the top one match
up entry order by score and if the score
goes the opposite direction meaning it's
like golf where the low score wins I can
say take the entries list which is that
list of match of entry order it
descending by score which would give you
a low score first and then asking the
first person and that gives me the
winner which I am putting the winner
object and it allows me to then say
other things as well ordered by
something else the other thing I love
you to do though is it keeps the team
competing their score and where they
came from
all together now that where they came
from is kind of important that's what I
call the parent matchup so this is in
round two we know that this team came
from this other matchup in round one so
round one was played team one played
team to team one lost their 14 two goes
on to round two so they have team two
has their matchup
entry with a score of 0 to start but to
help parent matchup of their win from
round one that way we can link a winner
all the way back through the different
rounds so let's see a bit confusing I
know but this is my idea of how to deal
with that whole matchup and which teams
and all the rest how to deal with that
in a way that makes sense
or at least make sense to me and we'll
see Abby put it down in actual code how
it works out in the application you know
what right here we have all of our data
we need for our application or at least
the broad-strokes of all of our data we
need for application this these six
classes are what the application is
going to revolve around and we're done
so now you've developed our data plan
what's going up next well up next we're
going to dissolve our user interface
we're going to draw out our forms so
that's lesson 4 that's come up next stay
tuned for that
before you go you will see a link in the
left of biiss course check out the intro
video on this playlist for more
information what you get if you pay also
if you are ever wondering what you could
do to help this channel out without
paying money I've listed six things that
really help
I appreciate if you consider doing one
or more of these thanks again and don't
forget to keep practicing what you
