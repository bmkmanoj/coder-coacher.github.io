application is going to work right for
the first time and if that happens to
you every single time you know what this
video probably isn't for you but for the
rest of us let's look at some techniques
to quickly identify where the problem is
so we can fix it now here I have an
application I built in this application
is just a demo application it's not
meant to be an actual full-fledged
application in fact this application
doesn't even work if I hit run here I
get this nasty exception now this takes
me right to the part of the code whereas
exception happens but let's first figure
out why this exception is happening as
you can see I'm getting a system dot
argument out of range exception now
we're gonna pretend for a minute we
don't know why that's happening I want
to create an ultra complex example where
it's hard to spot the error so those of
you who are watching home you may look
at this and say oh I see the error I
know how to fix it but that's not really
the point here the point here is we
don't know we're gonna pretend we don't
know why this is happening and so how we
fix this well first thing we can do is
we know the error happens here on line
26 inside of our person class so we can
use what's called a break point to stop
the operation somewhere in here before
we get to that point so we can look at
the data and identify what's happening
and walk through the code so let's do
that now if you want look at this
function see what's actually doing we're
taking the first name property we're
doing we're just saying hey every other
character make it an uppercase letter
it's really funky and weird but that's
what we wanted to do this right here
this line right here line 26 is our
problem but we don't know why in fact
line 26 isn't actually our problem every
time but
what we can do is say well if line 26 is
the problem I can click over here in
this gray gutter over here and notice
this red spot that appears and it also
highlights my line in this maroon color
and what this indicates is that we had a
breakpoint here now a job of a
breakpoint is to stop the code at this
particular instance risk particular spot
and allow us to identify what's going on
right now kind of like pausing time you
know we hit the pause button at this
point and we can look at where
everything is as it is frozen in time
and then we can actually start walking
through and looking at what happens next
and why it happens so let's just look at
first of all what a breakpoint does by
hey if start button okay you notice the
screen flashed really quickly on and
then it went right to this line of code
and we're now highlighted in yellow and
if you can see over here on the left in
that little circle is now a yellow arrow
that indicates that we have paused our
application at this line and now we can
look at all the different variables as
they are in this moment in time so if I
mouse over my first name property you
can see that first name equals Timothy
that's a little small but there you go
first name equals Timothy
okay so that's the value right now of
our first name property now we can
almost look at the I variable I is
currently one and if we look at output
output has just a capital T and that's
it at this point we know what's going on
we're not quite sure why we're getting
that error that didn't really help us
that much it looks like the variables
are right and in fact first name a
substring of first name at position 1 1
character means it's going to look for
the I in Timothy because it's 0 1 0 is T
1 is I that looks right so now we can do
is we have three options and if you look
up here
you can see those three options step
into step over and step out we're going
to primarily use the step into f11 but
once in a while use f10 now get into
what those do in a minute but let's
first look at the step into and what
this does this is f11 or this icon right
here
step into says take one step in the
application that's it so do one thing
and then stop again so in this case it
completed this one line and then it
stopped at our end curly brace and now
we can actually look at output again and
see output now has T I because that I
was uppercase and then added to our
output so that worked line 26 didn't
blow up but we're in a for loop so it
may blow up next time now we can do here
is a couple different things one we
could hit f11 and step through line by
line over and over again the other
option though is to hit the continue
button right up here or f5 and that will
bios did that that will allow the co to
continue running as if it were normally
running but then notice it's back here
in this line and the reason why is we
still have our break point here and so
our break point says hope you hit that
line so go ahead and pause and now if we
look I is 3 instead of 1 which means
that we've run this for loop twice not
just the once
B this if right here it says I modulus 2
equals 0 well this right here a percent
sign is called modulus and what means is
it tells us the remainder of this
division so for example 2 divided by 2
there's a 0 is a remainder therefore
this would be true if I was to I 3 so 3
modulus 2
means 2 goes into 3 one time fully and
that's it as a remainder of 1 therefore
this we false and we go down to the else
statement so basically what this does is
these are evens and these are odds okay
so we come down here we say well I is 3
and first name has at least three
characters therefore we're good so
actually it's 4 characters because we're
a base 0 and that's gonna be something
that comes up in a minute so let's go
ahead and we hit f11 and step into one
line and then look at our output and our
output now it says t IM o which is great
the other thing you do is just hit f5 if
we wanted to and I hit f5 or the
continue button up here and now I've
gone to the next time we hit this
breakpoint in this case I is 5 instead
of 3 okay it continued again and now I
is 7 and our output says if you notice
our output says Timothy and that's where
we get our first clue that something's
not right because our output has our
entire name in there if you notice the
first name variable or property its
Timothy there's no extra space at the
end there's nothing extra on the end so
if output already has the full value of
Timothy then why are we coming to this
code again we're gonna add another
character what character is there to add
well here look first name dot substring
7 comma 1 so what's at the 7th position
remember this is a base 0 so T is 0 I is
1 M is 2 o is 3 T is 4 H is 5 y is 6
where 7 don't have a 7 we can't go 7
therefore the character at position 7
would throw an error in fact if we zoom
out here and actually
into this code we get this error
argument out of range exception and that
exception simply tells us hey you've got
you're out of bounds you can't look for
position seven in your strings you only
have through position six and so there's
our error so we now know what our error
is because we debug this now we have
figured out well why are we going to
seven
shouldn't we be stopping before that
since there's only zero through six so
we know we have to look back up here at
this four lie on line 18 because we're
going one step too far so if I had
continued right now it will blow up if I
hit stop or shift f5 they'll stop the
application from running
all right ahead and did that so now our
application stopped so you can make
modifications now let's look at why this
error happened well if we look at this
line which is the line we need to
inspect we start at zero
well the substring is zero base that's
great
we started zero only say well I plus
plus so only one character at a time
which is great but I is less than or
equal to first name dot length well
what's the length of our name it's seven
characters because for length that's the
number of characters not a array
position so does it start at zero it
starts at one so if you had a one
character first name the length would be
one in my case Timothy is seven
characters therefore it first named out
length is seven characters so I is less
than or equal to seven so if I is seven
we're gonna run this code that's a
problem and that's where we really
should have followed the default pattern
for a four which is I is less than first
name dot length that accounts for the
zero based verse is versus the count
of the letters if he runs again now the
output shows in the screen is Timothy
and there is no error so we know we've
corrected that problem so that's how to
use the debug to identify and solve
problems we click on the gutter over
here on the left and place a breakpoint
we place that breakpoint wherever you
want
where there's code so if we say you know
what I want to start off right off the
bat with this spot right here to debug
that's fine you can also place more than
one at a time so you could place one
down here let's place it there and
another one over here that's fine that
way what you can do is you can when you
hit start you can just say okay I'm
looking at that they look at that and
back and forth and when you're done you
can even tickets out half way through
now if you hit start again or continue
it'll go until its next breakpoint and I
can look at output and say okay that's
what the output is so it's a lot you can
do with breakpoints just on their own
but one of the things that is often
overlooked is the fact that breakpoints
do more than just pause the application
in fact breakpoints don't even have to
stop the application at all let's look
at an example if I hit run
notice how the capital T and a capital
Eyre together I didn't really want that
let's shift this so that is capital T
lowercase I uppercase M and so on now
identify well why is it doing not the
way I expected because here I said I
divided by 2 therefore the second letter
should be the case that you gave me the
third letter should be uppercase so I'm
thinking the first caret the first
letter and the third letter because
these are the ones that are odd now
again my logic is flawed because we're a
zero base
counting system and this is where when
you're doing a for loop debugging is
great because game that zero-based
versus the length total or count those
things can get very easily it gets you
tripped up which is which and debugging
allows you even if you don't have an
error to make sure your code is working
in the way intent so let's just start
with I wanna know every time it's an
even letter what it is and what the
value of I is so you play a breakpoint
right over here on line 22 but instead
of stopping application I just wanna
know what those days are now I could run
this and if I did I could look at I
every single time and said okay I is
zero now what's the output kind of
beginning I could step into and I
actually put my breakpoint down here
it's a little cleaner because now the
output is T but mousing over two
different things is kind of pain I could
solve that notice I mouse over let's
zoom in here when I mouse over there's a
little pin right here I can actually pin
this and I also go over here and pin the
output and now let's zoom back out I is
0 and output is T if I hit f5 to
continue to the next time this
breakpoint is hit watch what happens to
the values of I and output is now 2 and
output is Tim I is now 4 and output TI m
OT and then i is now 6 and we had a full
Timothy okay so that allows us to see
what's happening just by pinning these
values and if I want me to get rid of
them I ask mouse over them and hit the X
now the cool thing is I'll leave this
one for now if I hit stop notice those
pins kind of go away there's a little
pin indicator here he mouse over that
and I can see it but if I runs again
that's pinned still and that's kinda
nice but let's go ahead
and I also stopped my application so is
there a better way to show us what's
going on and maybe even what each
character is it's being added one at a
time we can do is right click on our
breakpoint
now I notice there's a lot of options
here
we can delete the breakpoint which I've
been doing just by clicking again we can
disable the breakpoint and what that
essentially does is leaves it as if it
wasn't even there but yeah it's still on
the sidelines the gutter for when you
need it later can re-enable it but we
can also add conditions and actions
let's look at actions now on this action
right here it says log a message to the
output window and then we also has
option down here continue execution so
let's say notice it even gives you kind
of example text you can use sodaw sine
function would give you the function
name so funking name builder that way if
you have multiple these breakpoints you
would know which one was being called in
this case we don't really care but you
know what isn't hurt to show you how it
works so dollar sign and notice the
intellisense that's amazing dollar sign
function so that's the function name but
colon the value of I is curly brace I
closed curly brace and the letter is
curly brace first name nose intellisense
dot substring i comma one close clear
wrist and what that allows us to do is
actually see what the value of I is and
what the value of that individual letter
is by calling this exact same code now I
take close notice it says continue
execution that means we're not going to
pause the application we're
is gonna output this message to the
output window and keep going get close
and now note that our former circle
where it looked like this is now this
diamond and that indicates we're doing
an action on this row so let's go ahead
and pin our output window let's go ahead
and clear as well and now I'm gonna hit
start now a lot of things use the output
window point--we there we go so there's
our output window and if we look console
you i dot person dot funky name builder
that's our method name the value of I is
zero the letter is T the value of I is 2
the letter is M the value of I is for
the letter is T and a value of I is 6
and the letter is y so there's a four
times that that breakpoint is hit and
the values for both I and T or anything
else you wanna show also note the
application fully ran meaning it didn't
stop anywhere if we wanted to we could
change this breakpoint again right click
and say actions it changes to pause the
application if you wanted to or not
let's go ahead and say no don't continue
no it's good like the red circle or yes
continue now it's that diamond again but
next let's look at other options we
right click and say conditions now this
condition was going to allow us to do is
say only hit this breakpoint under
certain circumstances for example this
breakpoint gets hit when I is 0 to 4 and
6
what if we said that I pass T of lower
case I has to be greater than 2 so now
it
be the only hit this on four and six and
if we go ahead and scroll down here
let's make sure that's actually set so
that set I is greater than two we hit
close notice that if we look at the icon
here it's a diamond with a white plus in
the middle that white plus indicates
that we're not always going to hit this
breakpoint we have some type of
condition on it so let's clear our
output window and run this again and
notice down here that we have two
entries funky named builder the value of
I is four letters T and the value is six
and the letter is y so only hit those
that break point twice once for the T
and once for the Y because in the other
occasions I was not greater than two
therefore we didn't hit that break point
so the question you might ask yourself
is when would I ever use either the the
action or the condition and as a couple
of times when I found them valuable one
is sometimes you need to debug only at
certain points for example you're
loading a thousand records and you know
that there's an error somewhere around
the 600 mark so you don't want to hit
that break point every single time so
what you do is you hit that break point
at say 590 and step through the last ten
be for 600 or maybe you put 600 and see
what happens and you keep changing that
until you know that your break point
right before where the areas and then
you can look at all the variable values
at that error time the other time you
might find it valuable is when you only
want to break when certain things are
true for example you're processing a
whole list and you know that whenever
you pull up this one users file and
process it
you have an error but again you don't
want to loop through every single user
you want to only target that one
particular person so you put a condition
on it says only if the user ID is this
users user ID will you stop at the
record there's a lot of advanced cases
where either the condition or the action
can be really useful so let's go ahead
and delete that breakpoint now be so far
I have covered these step into or f/11
but let's look at the other options we
have so let's put a breakpoint I'm back
in program CS and the static void main
put a breakpoint right here on line 18
let's hit start and it will stop at that
particular line let's clear the console
and get that out of the way so here I am
paused on line 18 again that's now in
yellow meaning the application is
running and we're stopped at this point
and I say you know what I don't really
care to go into this function let's see
what happens if I hit step into f11
daddy takes me to the funky name builder
method and I go you know what I didn't
want to be here you have a couple of
options one you could stop the
application and restart it and put your
breakpoint different spot and that's
just dumb especially if your application
is big and you have a lot of setup stuff
I do it's just messy don't do that
instead what you can do is you can do
these step out of or step out which is
shift f11 or I just click this button
here because I use it so rarely but the
idea of step out of is we're in this
method right here let's go through the
entire method hit the return and then
when that return sends us back to our
caller we're go ahead and pause the
application again so it won't pause and
hear anymore it will wait until it's all
done this and has sent the values back
to our caller at that point we'll
the application again so let's do that
step out so we're in our paused here on
line 15
let's do step out note we're back in
static void main and if I hit the step
into now it goes the next line and the
reason it didn't go the next line when I
hit step into the first time is because
right here this has to be resolved
before we can do the console dot write
line and so it resolved it by taking us
to this method but once it's resolved
the actual value had come back now how
does this line actually runs it so I hit
step into again it goes to the next line
which in this case is line 20 so that's
one way of doing it but there has to be
an easier way in fact there is so if we
run this again I am here on this line I
say you know what I don't want to go
into this method and I know that if I go
into the method I hit step out that's
not really that efficient what's a
better way of doing that and that would
be these step over and that's F 10 or
this button right up here
so what F 10 does is it says don't leave
this particular method just step over
any calls that would take you into
another method so let's see that in
action so if I hit the step over or F 10
it's skipped o or the funky name builder
went right to line 20 as if we never
were there in fact let's do us again in
real time I'll move my breakpoint up to
here I hit start I'm gonna hit the step
over which seems to work just like these
step into except for the fact that it
doesn't go into any methods that you are
calling so I could hit step over right
now even though it's not really stepping
over anything and it still works
so let's hit step over again and again
and it kind of skipped over the idea of
diving into funky name builder method so
that's why the basics of debugging using
these breakpoints
the idea is if you know where to look or
have a good guess of where to look to
figure out why your application isn't
working you go ahead and click in the
gutter on the line number of your
offending line in this case we'll do on
line 16 and then whenever you run the
application if it's a generic breakpoint
it's going to stop once we hit this line
that's highlighted you could have more
than one and you can also right-click on
your break point and add conditions or
actions to limit what happens to the
breakpoint when it's hit or to do
something once it is hit and maybe even
skip over it so that's a little bit of
advanced stuff but the basics are a
breakpoint just click and you're good to
go if you don't know where to put your
breakpoint you're just not sure at all
here's a quick tip just put it the
beginning and then step through line by
line by line and if your application is
pretty large yeah a little bit of a
problem you're going to need to have a
little better idea than that but what
this allows you to do is it allows you
to look at everything and have no
assumptions you know exactly what's
happening line by line the other key
here is a guide the idea is that these
breakpoints aren't just for debugging
they're also really helpful in your
learning so you know exactly what's
going on because you're watching what
the compiler is going to do in your
application when it's run in real time
so you can see how it changes variables
and it morphs things and you say you
know what I didn't expect that I don't
want that and then you know exactly what
need to do to fix whatever is happening
because you know where the issue is if
you have thousand lines of code it's
hard to debug but if you have a thousand
lines of code and you know that things
go horribly wrong on line 893 it's a lot
easier to fix and that's what debugging
helps you do using breakpoints
