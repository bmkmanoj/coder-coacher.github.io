I'm going to introduce you to WPF before
I do I just want to mention a couple of
housekeeping things first if you haven't
already subscribe to my email list you
might want to pause this video just for
a minute and do that the link is in the
description my email subscribers hear
about things first and they get to weigh
in what comes next
I also reward my subscribers with
discounts and special offers on paid
courses second you'll also notice a link
to my facebook page down there I'd
really appreciate if you would head over
to my facebook page and just give it a
like as well that's the place where I'm
going to be giving more specific
feedback on what you want to see next in
these videos if you want your content be
better aligned with your directions
developer Facebook is a place to go to
give that feedback all right so enough
housekeeping let's dive in a DPF here I
have Visual Studio 2017 now if using
2015 or earlier it's probably about the
same but just know that I'm the latest
version here and the latest version is
free so if you go to Visual Studio calm
you can find the Community Edition for
free there so go ahead and get that if
you're able now here going to do it rest
start a new project like on a new
project right down here now you could
just look for do PDF here or you search
for it here on the left but the tricky
thing here that you'll make sure you
avoid is getting the wrong version of
APF note the seven or eight different
options we have here
we don't want most adoptions back you
only want one and the one you want is
actually the top one the WPF app dotnet
framework and it's in visual C sharp
there's also one here note it's for
visual basic that's not what you want
you can also go to windows classic over
to the left templates visual c-sharp
select windows classic and you'll find a
PF app
tres Alexis de APF cap net framework
let's name this WPF demo now I'm going
to give my project name and my solution
name the same name just because it's
easiest that's the simplest way for one
one project one solution but I would
recommend that if you're going to create
a you know quote unquote real
application or going to you know move
forward this in a more professional
manner
well I typically do is say something
like WPF UI or all caps APF UI looks a
little funny but it's an acronym as -
ekans actually and that called this the
you know demo a project or something
like that just you have a solution name
is separate from your user interface
because your user interface could change
and also it doesn't represent your
entire solution if it's named after just
your user interface if you really should
have a class library and should have a
lot of stuff possibly and so the project
name and solution name usually should be
different but in this case I say WPF
demo and the same solution and we'll hit
OK here and create a project now while
I'm doing that let's talk about what the
difference is between WPF and wind forms
this is really kind of same ballpark but
the to operate in they're kind of the
same ish but they're not the same now if
you've seen my other videos you're
pricing a lot of wind forms wind forms
is what came first and it's also the
easiest to use now why create WPF well
Microsoft wide to have a form
application that could be more modern
and feel and wind forms is just kind of
limited by somebody the old school stuff
is kind of still dragging along with it
and they try to make it a little more
moderate I try to clean it up they've
done a great job but the reality is it's
still old school
and one of the ways that's really
evident is whenever you get into
anything graphical with wind forms wind
forms to use as GDI
which is a way of rendering things it
pulls right from the CPU the processor
and so it really puts a bird on the
processor and slows things down now that
you see how he did everything back in
the 90s but didn't get video cards and
video cards were dedicated to rendering
and displaying video and other graphical
elements and so DF says well we don't
want to base our stuff on GDI
we want to use DirectX and actually talk
to the video card which means that if
you want to you can create a 3d form
that is a cube and it spins an air and
every side has a different video playing
on it and it will work you might need a
bigger video card but it will work and
that's definitely something you could
not do in wind forms now that's not
exactly a normal line of business
application but there's a lot of cool
stuff you can do with that now we're not
going to get in-depth into all that
really deep stuff but I want at least
give you an overview of how to get
started in WPF and really understand the
basics of what's going on here the other
thing that DPF does differently is data
binding and data bindings really big in
the EPF you can data bind to anything
and that's not really true in women
forms not as much and so there's there's
a lot of power there but it also adds a
layer of complexity we're kind of
touching that a little bit and finally
DTF is it's a little bit more like HTML
and CSS in the idea that you can apply a
style at the project level or at the
forum level or the item level and so
we'll see some of those properties right
add they were kind of familiar with if
they're a little bit different a bit
tweet so those are kind of things that
make DPF a little different
said it's a little bit bigger of a
barrier to entry then wind forms is when
it forms the drag-and-drop and just get
started you can really start in wind
forms and day one whereas day PF is a
little more time-consuming to get
started and so I'm kind of reduce that
barrier entry a little bit and kind of
see an overview of how WPF works so
we've got our form here that we've
created this is the the starter form
it's essentially form one if your food
with the wind forms but this is actually
called main window so this is form one
and R at the bat if you look just up
here at this window it looks pretty much
the same as what we're used to in fact
if we run this it starts real quick it's
going to look almost identical to a wind
form application and actually start over
here so this is it this is the the blank
form looks a little different but it
kind of works the same as three buttons
up here minimize maximize and close this
is extra this is actually a WPF
debugging thing and so I'll show you how
to turn that off in a minute but it
allows it to do some debugging around
DPF but this is not actually part of our
form and if we were to run this outside
of Visual Studio we would not get this
black box and you can move it around if
you want right like that so let's close
this out now and let's look at what our
form is made up of now in wind forms the
code behind is empty which it is here as
well the right click on this and say
view code it looks identical to WinForms
we have just the the constructor and it
has the initialized components it's a
partial class that's all there really is
to it
but if you look we have this extra thing
down here and this is where
people get a little bit lost or a little
bit confused or even scared
this is XAML or example and what zamel
is is the design system for building
this form and it's XML essentially but
it's the extensible application markup
language instead it's extensible markup
language so this is what Microsoft
created in order to help us build these
forms and so everything you put on this
form is going to have sam'l down here to
correspond to that element so for
example especially had a drag-and-drop
and put a button on the form now before
we go any further I want you to pause
from it and listen what I'm saying right
now is this is important don't do this
don't drag and drop onto a jpf form
that's not how they're designed okay
I'll show you how to do it safely but
the reality is you should probably avoid
it almost entirely and that's the first
place which we get tripped up is they
treat it like a wind form application
come to their toolbox and just start
dragging things on that really reduces
the power of WPF and essentially it
makes it so that you rigidus used wind
forms because if you're going to take
away all the power of jpf there's no
point to it and it's just add complexity
for no real reason
so don't drag and drop but I did ok and
the reason I did I want to show you what
this does notice down here in our sam'l
we now have this line of text that's
actually on pinna so you actually see
the whole line of text so you have
button and then it says x : aim equals
button content equals button that's the
actual text into the button this is the
name of the button horizontal alignment
is the left here's the margin
so what's aligned to the left it's kind
of margin of this it's got a vertical
alignment to top and the width of 75 the
reason why drag and drop on to our our
window here is bad is because of all of
this stuff right here and what is that
well it's hard coded locations now again
wind forms were used to this we have to
have this there's no way of doing this
and other than having hard-coded
locations but in de PF it's different
and to write treat it differently but I
want to show you at least the fact that
the sam'l changes so imitate us away
arrests start over now the very first
thing you know about sam'l is the grid
system and so that's typically what you
have and the form is a grid and a grade
can have multiple elements inside of it
that's important because certain items
can have only one element inside them
other elements can have multiple items
inside them the grid can have multiple
now think of a grid a little bit like an
Excel spreadsheet
except that right now we only have one
cell and that's this entire window so
the first thing I do is actually put
some grids on here so we can actually
have different places to put things
whether that is by inside grid and it's
importantly a note here if you're not
familiar open clothing tags this is an
open tag this is a close tag okay the
bottom one down it's kind of highlight
above them the bottom one down here is a
close tag because it has a slash in
front of grid so this is an open tag and
we have to do things outside of these
brackets to be inside the grid so
between this bracket right here and this
bracket so open tag close tag inside
here we need create new items or new
elements so we open up our
essentially is a less than sign and we
say grid dot column definitions notice
we have intellisense which is nice
intelligence is not perfect in zamel
it's a little ugly in some spots but it
gets the job done
notice when I closed out my essentially
I greater than sign here when I close
that out it gave me the closed hang this
is an open tag now close tag inside here
this is the column definitions so how
many columns do I have going down here
on my grid so the first column must say
I'm going to say column definition and I
have to give it a width so first I'm
going to give here's what I do I give my
first and last column a 20 pixel width
and the reason why is it creates this
nice little border around my form where
we don't put things right up to the edge
of the form is a little white space I'm
going to reform so that's how I do
things you don't have to do the same way
but that's just kind of my my standard
now this is called a self-closing in
that we put a slash at the end and now
this is both the open and the close so
it only has stuff in here to apply any
kind of modification to a column
definition so this is now defined one
column video is a few more times and I'd
copy this and paste it but instead of
the width of 20 now 20 represents pixels
we don't say 20 px like you would in
HTML or CSS instead we just say 20 but
in DPF we don't typically specify
hard-and-fast widths or heights we try
to avoid those kind of things as much as
possible and the reason why is because a
WPF form can be flexible
it can grow to fill a space it means
they can shrink to fit the space that it
has available to it and that's one of
the real big improvements that everyday
applications get to use it used to be
I'm going to date myself here a little
bit but it used to be we had monitors
that had a screen ratio of 800 pixels by
600 pixels you know something small like
that then we have these big complicated
forms well the problem was our form may
have been designed for a 1024 by 768
screen what happens when you get on a
800 X 600 screen well in wind forms it
means you can't see the right-hand side
of the bottom of the form that's a
really problem because using the bottle
of form is where a submit button is and
it didn't even put a nice scroll bar
scroll it goes just off the screen and
as a real problem we actually the
designer applications knowing what the
smallest screen resolution was going to
be and then not making it form any
bigger than that and that's really ugly
now we shouldn't have that today but
there are other issues that come along
with screen sizes for example you might
have a small form and if you maximize
that thing in wind forms all the stuff
in the upper left-hand corner and you
have this gray space on the rest of
screen that's not very pleasant to look
at in DPF we can have a more responsive
design where the form cap fills a screen
however big the screen is or how are
small the screen is we can also do
things like show more stuff if there's
more real estate available to us inside
a px a lot of flexibility there but you
can't lock it down to set widths and
Heights and so as much as possible we
avoid set pixels so once you too
whenever you see a pixel number so for
example 20 whenever you see that in day
opf I want you to pause and say is this
right and assume it's not now in this
case it is correct I want to have that
set border no matter how big or how
small the window gets that does mean
that the window gets to be 40 pixels
high by 40 pixels wide we take nothing
but border and you know what at that
point yeah you probably should because
it's a stupid small window there's not
really a point to it so that's why I
specify for my border but I don't want
my border here I want to have a normal
column and so what I specify is Auto and
what Auto allows me to do is the EPF
says we're going to handle the width of
this column based upon whatever you put
in it and so you put some really wide in
it but company-wide if you put something
kind of small in there the columns me a
small think of it kind of like an HTML
table if you're familiar those so the
table would get bigger as small in Japan
what goes inside them so it's we're
gonna have for our normal column so I
copied it and pasted a couple more times
that's actually make it a little smaller
now paste it one more time we're going
to change this instead of Auto I'm gonna
put star now what star says is that it's
going to take up the rest of the
available width notice up here we have
is one star now and so we've got a width
here of 20 so that's this column right
here we have three autos they're not
really showing that's because they're
all in this line because there's nothing
in the column therefore their width is
zero and then we have a star that takes
up the rest of the space and I put that
on the right-hand side so it goes far
left to
right now the reason I did this is
because otherwise I didn't have a star
column these Auto columns would all take
up the same amount of space and kind of
fill in the gaps here that's not really
want I want to have one column fill in
the rest so how does one column here it
takes up the rest of space on my form
and so it will grow or shrink depending
on what the other columns do that's
perfect and I'm going to take this copy
that's first one and put at the end now
I have my column at the end again with
at 20 pixels of white space and that's
all there is to defining columns you
have your grid column definition inside
there you define the number of columns
you want what the sizes are going to be
now just you know you can have multiple
star columns if you do each column will
take if you have two each column take
half of the leftover space if you have
three each day a third and so it's just
kind of divvied up whatever is left over
the number of star columns available and
I just use one usually also note that
the number of columns I put here is at
this point kind of just by feel I think
I'll probably need three columns at
least so I put three here but you know
what if I need more I have copy and
paste and put more in now we'll see how
to reference these in in a little bit
but for right now as well you know that
we reference these columns on zero based
counting array so this is column zero
column one two three four and five so
zero through five there's a total of six
columns so that's our columns now if you
are thinking ahead you'll probably think
okay that means if we have columns we
probably have rows and you are correct
and you can probably guess how we define
rows grid dot row definitions
inside here we say row definition
instead of height I'm sorry to say width
because it's not a column it's a row and
rows get height so again what I do is
say 20 now no you can't you cannot hit
the double quote here it just adds one
in c-sharp it would kind of skip over
that since you hit double quote and
notice there but you can't in zamel it's
one of those shortcuts that I wish they
had in zamel place haven't gotten around
to yet and again this is a self closing
riddle to close it out and we'll do the
same thing here we're going to copy and
paste this we're going to change this to
the Otto same deal here
Otto works the same way it just in rows
instead of columns and usually a few
more rows and I do columns just because
we have more stuff going on and then the
last one the second last one hit the
star and then one last one I said again
to our 20 so now we have our first in
our last row our 20 pixels high we have
one two three four five rows there Otto
height and then one is that star height
so we have our columns we have our rows
that's great now it's at this point
you're probably thinking man we're not
using our screen real estate very good
let's see if we can change that up and
we can we have these buttons over here
let's zoom in here excuse buttons right
here why has a horizontal line as we're
currently highlighting and what that
indicates is this configuration right
here or we have our zamel on the bottom
and our design at the top or vice versa
in fact we're going to switch that using
these this swap button here so we could
switch that around and totally mess you
up dokey to the way it is so that's this
line this horizontal line over here
represents this relationship right here
whereas the vertical line right here
represents a vertical split and that
looks like this
that's usually a little bit easier
because usually have a widescreen
monitor until you have a little more
space now what I typically do is I'll
try and move my window around and then
shrink down one side you can do that so
you can actually still see our whole
window but have a little more real
estate on the right to work in our zamel
it's not a perfect world but it's a
little closer and if you are not dealing
with the the increased font size that I
have in mind for for video you'll
probably I'll see a little more on your
screen than I do on mine so this gives
us a little better view of zamel oh
don't forget as well those down here
those are our icons so again you can
switch back to our horizontal split we
can also collapse one of the panes and
just see these are the zamel or the the
actual window so as a line you can do it
the one thing that I have not found how
to do and love for something to find how
to do this or for someone to actually
get this pusher with a change is I love
you separate my zamel from my UI and
it's like I pull this you know say
there's two tabs now instead of having
just one pane split in half that I could
take this side over here and put on a
different monitor but you can't do that
that's kind of a bummer that love bill
do that so I have my actual live output
view in one monitor in my Zaman
different monitor but that's not
something that that DPF stuff for yet
that probably you know Tim's wishlist
number one for DPF number a close number
two is that being able to hit the the
double quote no skipping over
instead of adding an extra one okay so
we've gone through we've add our our
columns and our rows which seem kind of
boring and in fact if we run this it
would be look no difference because
these columns and rows are invisible can
actually show anything
so let's actually add something here to
make it a little more useful all right
so let's start with a very simple label
or as case is called a text block now if
you're not sure what you're looking for
here you can do go your toolbox and look
for the different tabs in fact here's
text block here's text box which that's
great block and box we can't get those
two mixed up right but block is the one
at the label essentially now there's a
separate one for label but typically
just use text block essentially what it
is is just text in the screen I think
labeled a little more associated with a
text box but it all comes down to just
displaying text and so I end up using
just text block usually so if you
weren't sure what to put in here you
could look over here and get the name
and is type it out or you can even drag
and drop it either on the saml or the
form and then modify it but just make
sure you take off all of those you know
left align and top and and less and all
other stuff that's that locks it down to
a certain spot all right so I'd
recommend if you can learn it that a
great or look over here and just start
typing that now note that since I
clicked off of my zamel it tried to
render it over here and said oh nope
that's invalid markup and with invalid
markup it breaks things let's see if you
could take it away that comes to window
it's great so if you have invalid markup
then it's going to yell at you and take
it right
and there is some intellisense down here
saying okay here's the problem in our
area pouring a little squigglies but
just know that you have to have valid
zamel in order for the form to show
which again it's a little more difficult
than wind forms because you can get it
wrong but at the end of day he comes
down to just close out your your item
that I closed on text block where they
slash the end and life is good again so
you can do that you want that's right
now I'm going to do is I'm going to say
let's get a text block I'm going to say
I want to be grid dot column remember a
city for that our columns and rows are
zero based counting so I want to specify
that goes in a certain column a certain
row I have to start at zero the cool
thing though is since I use as 20 here
which is essentially a buffer column and
a buffer row I can actually go down one
below and that's column one so my
thought process and my best practice for
myself is I say I never play anything in
column zero or row zero so now it starts
in column one and so in this case column
one and Row one so the column is one and
the grid dot row is one as well I'm
going to close out the tag and then
inside between the closing and the
opening I'm going to put text let's say
hello world and check it out we have
hello world right up here
now the first thing you might notice is
that it kind of small it's you know it
how do you specify the the height of
this font
well we didn't and took the overall
default but we can change that now I
could say right inside next to grid dot
row
before the close of the opening text
block I could say font size equals let's
go 18 and now it's bigger
all right in fact I going to change it
again I can say 28 and bigger again
notice this row has gotten larger
because the label inside it is larger
now what if I didn't know this font size
I wanted well if you're selecting text
block you can open up properties now
remember property just like in wind
forms properties allows us to modify the
properties of whatever element we're
selecting in this case text block so you
could say the text is hello world like a
change that you wanted to in fact you
can say hi world and we could off this
notice that we scroll over here now it
says text equals hi world now why it
changed this well I had it between the
opening and closing tag of text block
but the properties window says not
really that's our should go it instead
should go in the text property of the
text block and it should be a self
closing tag the text block is so it
changed a little bit and also change the
value here to hi world notice over here
one is a little smaller here but it says
hi world now note these these draggable
arrow things here don't drag them if
you're a drag these it would resize the
column and say that's the width the
column has to be we don't want to change
that we want this to be nothing but Auto
adjusted columns and rows so if you want
to see the grid go away what you can do
is click outside the grid tag but inside
the window tag so right here the grid
goes away you can see
form kind of looks like in the real
world now let's go back to properties
here on the text block click on there
and we can change things like the text
is 9 share Lama pronounce that si gos to
go I'm not sure that's the default fonts
and now we specify the pixel of 28
pixels that's right there notice if we
were to change this as something else
let's go to 36 if we were to click off
this watch this right here
it changed the font size at 36 and it
gets a little bigger over here so this
property window right here is the same
as modify it directly in zamel the only
difference is like with our text where
we did it inside between the open
including tags if it likes something
different it's going to change it when
you make a change also note the color
here next to the 36 it's white and Suman
there it's white and that means it's a
local change versus this right here is
inherited from system dot resource so
DPF has a hierarchy of a application of
styles just like CSS does on the web and
so you first have this global style in
the system resource and then you can
apply themes which can be global or for
certain set of forms and then you can go
down and ply at the forum level and
finally at the local level and so
depending on where it applies this icon
color will change letting you know that
alright so on these right here aren't
set at all or the default so that's all
well and good let's actually shrink down
a property when it's going to see our
form again
but the coupling to watch show you first
of all you don't want to specify a font
size for every single item on your form
so let's do this up here in window
notice that window is up whole bunch of
stuff we can I ignore up until now and
most of stuff you really don't want to
change this is kind of stuff it's
bringing it saying okay here's what this
should do as far as look and all the
rest and unless you know what you're
doing leave it alone but a couple things
that can change first is the title bar
main window that's what's up right here
we can change this to our WPF demo and
we'll notice that changes over here in
our preview window now the height and
width are set 350 and 525 and hopefully
you remember my warning there saying
wait a minute we've got hard-coded
height and width and that's a problem
right yes and no it's probably the right
height and width you want for your form
when you first start up you might want
something different but just know that's
the starting height and width you can
change it to whatever height in width
you want going forward once the
application is running you can change it
to be 525 by 525 square you can change
it to being fullscreen nineteen twenty
by twelve 1080 it's whatever you want to
be at runtime but the starting height
width are these right here and so you
can change that in fact if we were to
change this to be 525 notice my form got
taller
I should back out of that so this time
to address at least think about should I
change the height and width of my form
but that's more we can do here's more
properties we can actually access in
fact if we would have properties you'll
see a whole bunch here but we can say
font size equal
let's get 18 now what is this this is
now the default font size for this form
note that did not change hi world and
the reason why these hi world already
has a font size therefore we're not
going to override it in order to use our
forms global font size but anything new
or anything does not have a font size
specified get the font size of 18 now
you can also set things like font family
now this right here is not intellisense
backed and that's probably Tim's wish
list number three would be to have an
intellisense list for font family this
is one of those times where I would drop
into the properties and go to our font
family here and change this to changes
right here and so you want something
different if you want something a little
more fun you can do that but typically
if they said sketch flow print there you
go
and it's kind of fun but typically the
this cgo UI is what we use or the light
version of that as well I kind of the
light version is a little more crisp and
clean I think but I change that here
instead of changing that right in lines
I I can never remember how to spell this
and since there's no intellisense that's
the problem for me I also rearrange
where it's going to be just like and see
it without having to scroll it all to
see it so there's my font size that I
font-family notice the font family
change this font family that's because I
had not specified a font family down
here for my text block so it didn't
change the size that did change the
family
now if I took out sighs let's control X
that knows that is it's not big but it's
not as small as it was now these are
font size by default is 18 now for this
one we're going to be a little bigger
all right so let's let's also add a line
break here in zamel line breaks don't
later so you can add line breaks as you
feel necessary in order to make it
readable for you in this case I don't
want to scroll off the right of the
screen I want to see all my properties
right in line now let's change this hi
world to be WPF super demo now note what
I did that made our column 268 pixels
wide which that's the problem going
forward but that's okay where I deal
with that in mint but I want to kind of
demonstrate the the width of this column
also notice this first row is 48 pixels
high because that's what this label
needs why doesn't get much because the
font size and how much text is in it has
nothing to do with setting the width and
the height of the label alright so now
let's add a text box and a text block
both where I have is you know let's say
its first name and then a text box to
have us actually type in our first name
so let's start with a text block first
we're going to put that underneath our
label right here rest put first name
then where I have a text box that says
you know or allows us to type in our
first name so right down here below our
text box I'm sorry lower text block but
on the same level we don't have nest to
inside notice we're not putting anything
inside our column definitions that's not
our stuff goes we define our columns up
here we define a rose up here down here
just kind of where we feel like inside
here we put our other values or other
items and so what I like to do is I can
keep some sort of order going on here
where you know column 1 Row 1 stuff goes
here column 1 wrote
I'm sorry column 2 Row 1 goes right
below it you're kind of going this way
up top then down the next row and this
way and down the next row in this way
that's kind of how I do it basically up
to you how you decide you want to do it
this case we're going to do text block
where I say grid dot column still column
1 and rests a grid dot row is 2 right
below it we're leave off the font size
we will say font weight equals let's
just say bold and then I'll say text
equals and our text is going to be
first-name I will do the close out slash
and there's our first name notice the
font weight didn't really change
anything here and that's because we're
using the thin font and so we're going
to do it actually change the font family
to this CEO UI so I'll do that right
here like so notice is now very very
bold so let's change change this to be
not bold and it's a little better you do
have some options here font weight
there's other things like black and
there's sellable and semi have you know
light and regular and all the rest you
can try out some work some don't
depending on the font some funds have
the ability to do these things some
files do not so you kind of play around
to paint what you want to do so there's
our text box I'm sorry to protect block
I totally just in confusing
there's a text block that says first
name
so let's now create a text box the group
you see I saw that right below text box
and this when you give a name so X colon
name Y X cool name well that's just how
sam'l does it so this name is the actual
name for our text box so we'll call this
first name text now again if you come
from a date
I'm sorry winform application background
you might have already realized we
didn't name this here we in name this so
how you reference those in code well we
don't really they don't have names and
we could give them names if you want to
reference them we don't have to give
them names and behind scenes it probably
gives them a name and I don't really
care all they care about is what we need
to do in this case we don't need to give
a name if we don't need a reference it
and so it kind of cuts down the amount
of then we have a type so if you don't
need to name it don't so the case we
have a text box first name text because
we assume we're going to access this
text box later and then we could specify
other stuff but for now let's just close
this out actually put the clothing tag
at that we can change it there we go and
so now we should have a text box and
where it a text box and that's up there
because we didn't give it all this other
stuff so let's do that
grid column column to grid Row Row 2
now it's right there then if we put a
cursor here we notice that that's our
text box not very big right well in this
case we have to give some sort of width
or minimum width or otherwise
give it a size so width equals again as
pixels we can say 300 me really big we
can say it's 30 to make it kind of small
and you can experiment with what looks
good to you probably something more like
150 is passable and this is where our
forms took to take shape but it's a
little ugly in fact if we move this over
here we notice he had a label up here
first and then way over here we have our
actual text box you should also get rid
of this as well I don't really find use
for these things here so let's get rid
of them I can minimize them for now but
we're actually on get rid of them
entirely in a minute but first I want to
dress this issue of this space right
here when you specify that space should
be there so why is it there well the
reason is there is because notice how it
ends or starts right after in line after
this right here so this is column one
and column one is the width of the
largest item in this case our header
label the WPF super demo so since it's
that with the next item it gets put in
this column it's not going to fill that
column it doesn't need to in fact it's
said make the font size huge and expand
to fill a column instead we said here's
the font size here though here's the
font and here's the actual text and
therefore only takes up this much of the
column this much is then blank now it's
not really we want we don't want this
big label affecting all the rest of the
items in the column how do you fix that
real simple we come to our text block
the one that is affecting everything
else and inside of it we say grid dot
column span now what column span does it
says
I want this item to go in more than one
column in fact I want to go in two three
four however many you want in this case
we have one two three columns before the
star column let's specify three now
notice what happens on our form now our
text box has shot right over and tucked
up almost next to first name perfect so
now our header label spans multiple
columns which means that it's no longer
the largest thing in the column first
name is that's why we're this is tucked
up right next to it now you also might
notice that these two are really close
together and so is this to extent and so
we can also look to address - spacing by
adding margins and padding so let's do
this let's go down here and say margin
equals now the margin here allows us to
add multiple dimensions we can add one
so say we add let's add 20 and then when
it's done just put 20 on every side 20
pixels
therefore it's pushed this down it's
pushed this over it's not always
anything over here because it's not
going to bump up against if it did it
put a space there and it's also pushed
it down 20 pixels from the above row so
this row is essentially 40 pixels larger
and the column is 40 pixels larger now
we're spanning three columns so it's not
a big deal but for the row itself the
row is pretty high so that's if you want
to specify all four dimensions left top
right and bottom all at once or you can
say comma zero
now notice we got 20 left 20 on the
right nub top and none down below what
this indicates is this is the left and
right this is the top and bottom but
maybe that's not what you want either
may want to specify a different width of
margin for each dimension in which case
you could say comma is zero comma zero
now notice we have 20 pixel to the left
non-top none to the right not now below
now in our case we don't want the
padding to the left we want to be below
our label which one's below well it goes
in a clockwise pattern starting from the
left goes left top right bottom
therefore we can say left top right
bottom Bob's last one there for a last
one gets one sit to 10 notice now that
first name and the textbox have both
bumped down because we have a 10 pixel
margin between our header label and this
row now those of you follow along we'll
pricing now wait a minute you didn't
have to do this that's column definition
of 20 on either and you know both the
left on the right and the top the bottom
as well because you could have dealt
with margins and yeah kind of the
problem with that is that it's a little
harder to manipulate when you're talking
about forms going to grow and shrink it
the form shrinks too much you got a
problem you've also to make sure you put
those margins on the right ones the
right elements that's a little harder
keep track of that's why just two macro
definition in my column definition of 20
on both the front end in the back end
to put those kind of margins in by
default bake them in it also makes my my
columns and rows start at 1 and 2 0
which is kind of nice so now I have a
little bit of space here and now I can
move on to my next element align ad
which is a button so it's called button
and again where I call it give it
X dot name equals let's call it the
submit button and we're going to give it
a content that says run me and when I
give it a grid dot column of 1 and a
grid dot row of 3 and there we have our
button here now notice that it said
content this is where DPF gets a little
tricky sometimes that's why it's helpful
to have this property window here is
that for a text block is called text and
that's what comes out in the screen for
a button
it's called content now the reason is
called content is because instead of
putting this here instead we could do is
not make us a self-closing button but
instead have an open button tag and a
closing button tag and inside of there
put something else so you actually have
an icon and some words or an icon some
words and a swirling you know a swelling
icon as well whatever you want to do we
could do inside this button but in our
case I just want to put a little bit
text content therefore I it's called
content and there is the text that goes
inside of it so that's it
so that button now notice my button
again tucked right up underneath first
name and it's also the size of this
column and row now the reason is this
size is because a button will take up
the available space you give it in fact
us to demonstrate that let's do this
grid dot column span equals two and now
button is this large now if I said row
span wouldn't do a whole lot of this
extra rows or emptor autofill which is
going to zero unless you tell it to be
larger but what we've done here is you
said okay this is the height that that
row needs to be and that's based upon
the font size run me but when I do
column span it goes okay I can still
then and it fills in because this column
is an extra 160 pixels
no problem I'll fill that and so if we
actually spilled it over into the one
star go over to this edge line here so
buttons unless you specify a height
width just kind of get bigger or smaller
to paying with what space you give it so
that's just you know kind showing off
what they do you could say do you want
to change that you could say well here
is the the maximum height or here's the
height here is the width but I kinda
leaving the way they are and just do
margins and so that's case when I just
do a margin 10 and boom there you go
it shrunk this down what it's done it
shrunk it down at 10 pixels on each side
because it says okay this is the total
width you have and it's okay let's take
10 pics on each side make it white space
instead and it kind of shrinks it down
so that's kind of nice it's centers
event which is really fun but we could
also say well may wanna push down
further
and if we want to do that we'd have to
put a margin below the text block and
text box otherwise be any kind of funky
looking so the key here is the EPF is
very very flexible but you have to kind
of think through what you really want to
do with that flexibility can't just kind
of throw things together now again just
to come back to my soapbox a little bit
we didn't drag and drop anything on here
but you want to have this flexibility of
expansion and change based upon our form
size now right in our form isn't change
a whole lot based upon the the size
because it's kind of all locked in a
little bit but we can make that a little
more flexible and actually make it grow
and shrink depending on our how the form
is is sized but for now we're going to
kind of leave it at a simple demo we're
going to get into the really in-depth
stuff so that's kind of the basics of a
form we've got our er header label we've
got our text box we've got our button
now it's actually why it's button up and
do something so I click on my button
here and go to properties and notice in
the upper right hand corner we have its
lightning bolt which indicates events
just like we do in window forms and you
have a click event so I can double click
on this and it actually creates the
submit button on our click which is
great that's one of the reasons why I
named this submit button before I create
the event because I wanted to have its a
submit button or click instead of button
on it or click so that's kind of
important
the other thing is note that it's still
disabled so click equals submit button
on a square click so if you didn't want
to go to the property window change to
events dealt with right one because I'd
click equals and then put in your event
also note if you want get rid of this
event
the events now gone
a coastal there but we can safely delete
this code because it's not attached to
anything and that's one of the the
kicker's of wind form was if you delete
the code before you delete the event
then what would happen is it would cause
the wind form to crash and be a real
pain to try and get back where as this
it's all out in the open we can just
modify it and we're good to go so let's
put that back fine adjusted the sail
window instead they click equals and
notice is a new event handler just click
on that insure event failed excellence
normally that'll work it may have to do
the fact that I deleted before and then
redid it let's try it again
this may be Tim's wish list number 4 yep
Tim's wish list number 4 is to fix that
and plug in the editor so you can make
over here don't click down the event and
we've really broken in Visual Studio now
so this is all those things where when
doubt we're going to go ahead and
restart the application and see if that
doesn't solve our problem so close out
Visual Studio and open it back up and
submit and we'll try it again so let's
go to open project solution find ours
JPS demo
back up and now let's try it again click
equals Alex tab and feel the rating
submit button on square click come over
here there's our submit button on as
where click so if you get bug in the
editor nothing you do a fix it is just
save everything close it down open back
up and then try it again but just type
click equals and then I come up that new
events this tab on it or double click on
it it will create your code for you so
in here we're going to a very very
simple message box show and we'll just
say dollar sign double quotes hello
space and then we'll do the first name
text dot text and that's just the
person's first name where they type in
the box so it's just really simple
submit button event we're going to do so
let's run this now just to show that
this event works and that our text box
works and it looks all pretty so let's
say Tim run me hello Tim excellent so
our day PF window works and our text box
works our button works and in fact we
can resize as you wanted to know it
doesn't shrink really nicely yet that's
I mean we can add in the future to make
this actually grow or shrink depending
on the window size right now acts a
little more like wind forms and so we
haven't lis take an advantage of a lot
of the benefits of APF quite yet
but we'll get there but for this demo I
kind of stopped at that point where I'd
go way in depth and APF I'll do some in
future videos to kind of give you a
little more targeted update Sunday PF
and kind of help you with some some
speed bumps you might have in day PF but
before we go I want to deal with that
that annoying bar that pops up that's
there I'm going to show you how to get
rid of this
all right here that box let's go tools
options and here is options for
everything it seems like but it come
down here to debugging and look at our
general window and then scroll down we
have it enable UI debugging tools for
zamel and inside here we have show
runtime tools in application uncheck
that box hit OK and now we start this up
we won't have that black bar anymore or
that black bar the icons on so that's
gone so if you don't want that if you
just go to tools options debugging
general and then search for show runtime
tools and application because you could
do is say show runtime in our search box
and take you right here show runtime
tools and application uncheck that
so that's nobody in there real quick or
you can type you know sam'l and only
find the things that are related to
zamel that's a little harder i think to
get to so it only shows the one that
specifically saves animals so you don't
see that then one option there so that
that search box is really helpful if
you're trying to find something in this
case it would be show runtime tools and
application so let's type show runtime
tools and it's right there so it's up to
you how you get to it but the important
thing is that you know how to fix it if
you want back to check the box again
so that's WPF kind of nutshell there's a
whole lot more we have to go over at
some point we will do that for example
the combo box is a lot different
you used to and so we have to do a video
on that but as you get deeper into EPF
and as you start to use it there's a
whole lot of power here that first of
all if you're going to use a PF you
should really take advantage of that
power because otherwise it really is a
wind form application it's more
complicated and that's no fun but the
other thing is you should probably learn
a framework like mvvm model view
viewmodel
and that's it's a little more
complicated but it's worth it in the end
because it allows you to do a whole lot
more advanced stuff with the APF and
i'll at some point do a video on this
but in the meantime i'll at least show
you my recommendation for a a tool for
mvvm now you can do mvvm on your own
kind of roll your own right in just a
native day PF but let's put this it this
way this is my end game for you if you
don't do a PF you really need to mvvm
and if you've got to do mvvm the easiest
way of doing it and the most powerful
most complete way of doing it would be
to use a tool called calibre micro so on
references manage media packages go
browse and just type Caliburn micro
that's right here i Rob Eisenberg this
is a great tool still being updated he's
now on version 3 which is is great
anything a lot of work on this we've got
team around now but this tool here makes
mvvm easier into aps because it's a
complicated subject and it also allows
you to kind of fit in this to a modeler
to a mold that kind of gets in the
groove how mvvm works and again I notice
this is kind of endgame stuff but
depending where you are with APF you're
very comfortable with gamblin and how it
works the kind of stuff I'd say move
this direction if you
that's just my recommendation it's my
two cents we can take it or leave it
definitely the comment down below if
you've used it before or if you thought
about it there are some documentation
some tutorials out there that work with
calibre micro or show calibre micro
they're not complete if not there's not
this be-all-end-all
wonderful documentation that's kind of
kinda how it goes with with open source
projects like this it's a whole lot
easier get the code working that is to
document it well especially how fast the
code changes so I'll at some point go
over that the kids that's I'm kind of a
fanboy of Caliburn micro it's really
made life easier for me I'd like to show
it off and and kind of get you to like
as well but that's kind of endgame
before that I like it get more
comfortable example get more comfortable
is opening multiple forms and kind of
nesting forms or creating controls and
other stuff like that you can do with
with the PF but for now this is an
overview is a very start of de PF I
wanted to show you just some of the
things you can do wrath of bat now your
homework is to go try us out build
something yourself into a PF and see
what things you enjoy what what problems
you have and then here you do come back
here and post a comment down below and
say this is where I got stuck what is
the problem I had or this is what I find
confusing because I'm going to take
those and use those as a way to create
new videos so I'm going to say okay
everyone's getting stuck on drop downs
go ahead and create a drop down video
and that thing wasn't becoming for sure
but you know it ever get stuck on a
certain topic or a certain that
confusing I'll create a video for that
as well also go to Facebook and interact
there because they'll have some awesome
pulls up and here's what I'm thinking
about which one he wants he first let me
know and we'll go from there
all right don't forget to hit like on
this video I loved
if you
do that if you didn't like it hit don't
like or the thumbs down give me a
feedback let me know if you like it or
don't like it and what you want to see
more of leave a comment down below also
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't
already all right thank you very much
hope you enjoy the video and as always I
am Tim quarry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
