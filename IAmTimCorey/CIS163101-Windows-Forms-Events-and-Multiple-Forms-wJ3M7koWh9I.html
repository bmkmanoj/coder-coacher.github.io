opening multiple forms and also dealing
with events now here we have the form
from our last video we have a first name
a last name and a button that says
process right now this form doesn't do
anything if we run it we can still type
in the box you can click the button but
nothing really happens so let's go ahead
and change that first let's start small
and just have this button pop-up a text
box that says first name and last name
combined so say hello first name last
name okay so we select the button you go
over here to our properties window again
if you don't have properties of you
property window in our properties for a
button if we look up here at this icon
it says events little lightning bolts
select that and it pulls up all the
different events that are possible for
this button right now they're in
alphabetical order but you can change
that to be categorized and it will
adjust to being grouped by similar
functions so for example focus events or
key events like keydown keyup or key
press I prefer to have the alphabetical
list now for a button typically what you
want is the click event okay if you do a
drop down here is actually nothing
selected as nothing in here but if you
double click in this white space it will
create an event for you let's go ahead
and do that we'll double click it's
creating an event reference and it has
taken us to our code behind now note
with our little highlighting here that
we are using Visual Studio 2013 don't
worry everything is just the same in
2012 except these little highlights
which we won't actually use okay in our
event we have a couple of things to look
at first of all it returns a void
because
the event is being called being fired
and we're not actually talking back to
the item that's firing the event we have
a name of our event which in this case
is process button underscore click this
is the name of our method they've hooked
up in the designer we go back here to
our designer we now have process button
underscore click if you want delete this
method if you create it by accident
create one a different spot or somehow
create us and you didn't want it delete
it from here not from your code behind
if you delete it from your code behind
let's go ahead and cut this out and you
go back to your form you'll get this
rather nasty error and basically what's
saying is I've got a problem I am
looking for something that has been
removed
okay so let's go back here and undo that
cut and then go back to our designer and
we're back so let's select our button we
select this right here just highlight it
and hit the backspace it Mouse off go
back to your code behind and now you can
safely take this out and nothing blows
up you can save those changes let's go
ahead and put that back in so again
select click and double click in the
white space to the right it creates our
method we do have two parameters being
passed in that we won't use at this time
okay so when the process button is
clicked what do you want to do well
let's first build a string that says
hello first name space last name so
we'll do a string message
equals string doubt format now I'm using
a string dot format here so that I can
put variables inside of a string in the
correct spot let's look at how this is
done
hello space curly brace zero curly brace
space curly brace one curly brace okay
if you're not familiar syntax basically
is going to happen is we're going to put
parameters after this string constant
and then a strained out format method
will take those parameters and put them
in place of this curly brace to zero
clear braiser curly braces hit one curly
brace okay so remember comma and then
first name entry dot txt comma last name
entry dot txt and we have to have the
same number of parameters over here as
we have specified in our string and I
forgot to put a semicolon at the end and
it looks like I have a lower case
instead of upper case text casing is
important okay so what's gonna happen is
it's gonna take this hello string it's
gonna put our first name in the zero
spot let's replace that and if it our
last name and it's gonna put it in the
one spot okay since this is a zero based
list so it should say hello John don't
okay if you have used the console dot
write line this works the same exact way
so now we have a string that has our
message how we display that to the user
well the easiest way in Windows forms is
to do a message box
dot show and here we can just put our
message notice there are 21 different
overloads for things like changing the
button styles or putting a caption on
the box for this case we'll just use the
actual message and that's it
backdoor designer we hit run we have our
box let's go ahead and put John Doe and
hit process up pops a box that says
hello John Doe ok you notice there's no
caption up here we didn't specify one
and there's no icon here we can we could
change that to make it a little more
visually impressive if you want but this
is a very standard pop-up message box
and that's all there is to events you
select the item that you want to have an
event on you select the lightning bolt
and the properties to show the events
and then you find the event that you
want double-click in a space and then
but whatever code you want in there for
when the event is fired
note that buttons are not the only items
that have events for example our text
box hat also has a click event that
probably isn't very useful in most
situations but there are other things
like key press or key up you could do
things like doing a validation either on
key press or on leaf so for example if
you decide you wanted to have a text box
that only accepted certain characters
i'm key up or key press you could check
that character and not allow it
you could also validate when a person
leaves that box whenever that the tab
out or click out of that box you could
have the event fire to check to make
sure that the text is valid now the
other way
to do all these things and you have to
make sure that you choose the right way
of doing it for your case but these are
just just examples of what you could do
okay so you've seen events we've seen
how we can fire an event based upon a
button click and then actually have seen
how to use the properties of our text
boxes note there are other properties if
we hit control J here to pull a list up
we can see we also read the tag we can
read the how the text is aligned we can
actually read just about anything that's
in here for example the size the client
size the container that's in the company
name if we specified that okay it's a
lot of stuff we can we can use there but
by and large for text boxes you want the
text property okay so now you say I
don't really want a message box I want a
different form to pop up where I want to
do something so for example this process
button I want to actually go out and get
more information so let's go ahead and
change how this event works we'll take
out this text here and let's go ahead
and fire a new form a pop a new form up
whenever they hit process well we only
have one form so let's first start by
creating a new form right click on your
project and say add new item or windows
form you got a new item it's gonna pull
a dialog box up where you can select
windows form if instead you right-click
and say add windows form it's just a bit
quicker it goes right to it
okay so let's name this form step 2 this
would be step 2 in the process of
processing this users information and we
hit add
okay now we have a forum called step two
and it has it's labeled step two and if
we run this application we still only
have our main forum how we open step two
well don't forget that these are these
forms are actually just class instances
okay so this is an instance name step
two we can exit we can create a
reference to this by saying step two
then give you a name so for example my
step two equals new step two
we've now create a new instance of a
step to form called my step two can say
my step two dot show that's really all
there is to it if we run this and say
process we've now popped up a new box
that says step two and that is just a
start
of using multiple forms instead of a
windows forms application and of using
events inside of your windows form
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
