video every Monday
you've still this Monday but I wanted to
add as extra video to let you know about
a an offer I have going on right now
butts a limited time offer so they go to
my website at I am Tim Cory comm and
click on courses notice that there's a
career mentorship and this is something
that only is gonna last for a limited
time because we're gonna start up
starting June 1st so you click on this
you'll see that it actually closes May
25th so if you want to get on board this
you need to get increased soon what this
is is a mentorship where I'm going to
walk you through how to align your
career in such a way to get that next
promotion or to get a job in the first
place and so we'll start off by looking
at your resume and the first thing we do
right on June 1 is I'll look at your
resume and let you know the weak spots I
see and what we need to tweak now it's
not a format and layout thing it's about
your content your content is key all
right
I'm also going to do an assessment I'm
gonna give you a project to do before
June 1st and you're gonna complete it's
a really simple project I'm gonna give
it to you and you're gonna complete it
and give it to me and I'm gonna look at
your coding style and a look at how you
accomplished it what things you couldn't
do what things you could do and duggie a
baseline for how we can move you forward
to the next level and also we're gonna
do a career path evaluation you're going
to say this is kind of direction I was
thinking about and I'm gonna look at
your project I'm gonna look at your
resume you know look at where you want
to go where I say okay let's draw out
the path to get there then over the
course of the month I'm gonna give you
one or more projects to do where you're
going to do it and then every week or so
we're gonna check in you're gonna let me
know okay that's a great time I check in
I'm gonna review your code and let you
know okay here's the things I would
here's how I'd tweak her direction
here's the things I've done differently
and then give that back to you and then
you keep working on it until we kind of
point it in the right direction into
your you kind of seen the light at the
end of tunnel okay this is where I need
to go these are the things I need to
learn and here's I can make my code
better so that's gonna be throughout the
month and at the end of the month we're
gonna do is identify a career plan maybe
we found out that you know what you
really want to go web but man you're
going to start a little bit further back
into say okay I'm gonna learn c-sharp
just gonna learn the you know the actual
language not the UI yet or maybe you
found out that I just don't like this
but I'm really good at that and surround
try some different things out so I'll
lay a career plan for us okay okay now
that we've gone through a month of this
here's how you keep going keep this
momentum going to learn even more all
right so this is a month long process
that it starts in June first and I just
have some pre-work so there's gonna be a
little bit of stuff ahead of time but
I'll start kicking in my actual
mentorship starting in June first
it's gonna last about four weeks so the
whole month of June or so there is a
limited amount of spots so make sure
that if you want to do this do you get
in quick all right now just to be real
front about this this is an email based
mentorship it's not going to be video
chats so any phone calls there's a
couple reasons for that one of the
reasons is because with time zone
differences it just makes it really
difficult to connect especially with a
set of people and so on my end I got to
connect with each person at least once a
week and so to do that I have to you
know set up a time and that's gonna be
difficult
if I had to set up my time and go oops
that is on line with your time let's
let's make some changes so in order to
benefit everybody we're gonna do is
email based another benefit here is
it bypasses the idea of you know if
there's a struggle with the spoken
English language and so if if you're
saying you know I can read and write I
can listen to English and understand it
I can write it pretty well but I had a
hard time with an accent or something
else where I might not be able to
understand you as well that bypasses
that problem all right so there's a
couple of reasons why also if we're
gonna do a an actual video or phone call
mentorship that'd be a much more
expensive program so this kind of keeps
a cost down as well all right so this is
the first time off rent so which means
that this mentorship which normally
costs four hundred ninety seven dollars
now only cost two hundred and ninety
seven dollars so that's a two hundred
dollar savings so as only happens this
first time so therefore again if you
want to save two hundred dollars now be
the time to do it now the one key thing
I'd like to highlight down here as well
is be prepared to work this is not gonna
be something where you can put it off
this is something you have to do it in
the month of June and you have to work
I'm gonna give you lots of work to do in
your spare time the more you can do the
more you can benefit now if you can't
because of a circumstances something
like that that's okay it will still have
quite a bit of benefit with this but I
want to get you the maximum benefit
possible and so if you can clear your
calendar you know nice the weekend to be
great because you can take full
advantage of the the train that I gave
you and the the direction I'm gonna
point you in all right now one of the
things this is not this is not me
training you and how to do c-sharp
that's my YouTube channels for that's my
paid content is for this is me mentoring
you in you already know c-sharp at least
a little bit you can be a beginner or if
you a more advanced person but I'm going
to mentor you in the okay here's how I
say you're going to need to tweak things
so if you are not refiling good design
practices I'm gonna say okay you need to
work with not repeating yourself you
know keep things dry and so here's kind
of you know one saying you've got this
Co repeated three times why don't you go
back and make this you know so you're
not repeating yourself three times
that's the advice I'm going to give you
and now you go do it it's not me sitting
down say okay here's the code that you
need to write do this this is much more
of a you know if you were working in a
company and you're talking to your boss
who's also kind of guiding your career
not the person doing work for you all
right so that's the career mentorship if
you want to take advantage of that go
ahead and either click in the
description down below there's a link
for the mentorship or go to I am Tim
Cory comm and click on courses alright
