solutions and projects we'll discuss the
differences how they work together and
how we can add multiple projects to one
solution before you start I want you to
note that I am using Visual Studio 2013
ultimate release candidate if you use
Visual Studio 2012 all of these things
will work exactly the same you just may
notice small visual differences to get
started we can either select new project
over here on the start page or we can go
to file new project note that on the
right the solution Explorer is blank we
have not started with anything open now
it could create a blank solution and
start from there but instead let's go
ahead and create a new visual c-sharp
windows windows form application down at
the bottom we'll notice that we have a
solution name field we can fill in I'm
going to put my solution in production
environment you'd want to change that to
a much more fix a much better name let's
put it that way for my actual project
name let's go ahead and call it my forms
application
again a very simple name but for this
demo it works just fine I will lead
location as it is you can change that by
going to browse and finding the location
you want and I hit OK alright I now have
a solution called my solution that's
right up here at the very root I also
have a project called my forms
application so I have one solution one
project note that the project is one
level in the solution that means it's a
child of this solution the benefit of
solutions are that it can hold multiple
projects at the same time and they can
interact in a more direct fashion so
let's go ahead and create a second
project this time we'll create a class
library so let's right click on the
solution and go to add new project this
dialog looks very similar to the
previous dialog the diff big difference
is down here we do not have a solution
name to fill in that's because we're
adding it to the my solution solution so
under visual c-sharp windows let's
select class library and name this my
class library and hit OK
we now have two projects inside of our
solution my forms application the
windows form application project and my
class library the dll creating class
library let's add one more project to
our solution again right-click on the
might on a solution called my solution
click add new project this time we'll
add a console application and call this
my console application
all right now we have three projects
when we start we get the form one from
our windows form application but what if
you wanted to start the console instead
well let's look at that right now if you
notice my forms application is bold the
name my console application is not and
neither is my class library that this is
because my forms application is the
default startup project we can change
this by right-clicking on the project we
want and saying set as startup project
this changes the default startup project
to whatever we selected there are cases
when it can have multiple projects start
at the same time however for the sake of
this demo that's outside the scope of
what we'll cover so if we open up this
program CS and create a simple hello
world application
and hit start we now get the console in
our hello world instead of our windows
form again to change that back we
right-click on the project we say set as
startup project and if we run that we
get our windows forum
okay so one solution holds multiple
projects but how do those projects
interact with each other for example
let's create an actual class library
class so let's delete this class one
since class one's a pretty horrible name
not that my class library isn't but
let's right-click on my class library
and say add new item and we'll add a
class and we'll call this calculator
for those of you using Visual Studio
2012 this right here will be a little
bit different don't worry about it it
just tells you how many times this class
library has been referenced so we change
this to a public class and let's add a
couple simple methods
all right so now we have an add and
subtract method of our calculator class
so if we come over here to our console
application and say console.writeline my
well there is no my class library in
this list but we call it calculator
nothing well we have to instantiate
first so let's go ahead and create a new
instance of calculator calculate or Cal
equals new calculator nope the typer
namespace calculator could not you found
if we try to add a using statement here
there is no option to add a using
statement well that's because we are in
the my console application namespace
inside of the my console application
project we are trying to access a
different project entirely so how do we
do that well like everything else we add
a reference so just like we brought in
these libraries here through references
for example system is right here as a
dll reference right there let's add a
reference to my class library so right
click on the references in the project
you want to bring in the reference tube
so right click say add reference under
solutions choose four categories here
assembly solution comm and browse under
solution this looks the current projects
inside of your solution there are two
listings here now I could add references
to both however I don't need references
to both just to my class library
in order to not create circular
dependencies I don't want to just add
all of my projects to all my projects so
I add just a reference to my class
library this means that my console
application will now have a dependency
on the my class library library okay and
now you notice in the references my
class library shows up when we build
this application it will take the DLL
that gets outputted from the build on
the my class library and put it into the
bin directory of my console application
okay
so we've added a reference but we still
get this red squiggly but now if we do
the drop down either by pulling this
menu down right here or by doing control
dot we get the prompt to add a using
statement for my class library click
that now we have a using statement up
here for my class library and now this
seems to be set up properly so down in
our console.writeline we'll use the
instance name calc dot add four plus two
and that should output six so it should
say hello world next line should say six
let's try it out huh
we actually did not set the my console
application back to be the startup
project let's do that real quick set a
startup
okay we start again hello world six so
now we've create a reference to a
different project inside of our same
solution if we look at the bin directory
so right click on my console application
open folder in File Explorer we look at
the bin directory the debug we see my
class library dll along with our my
console application key XE so it
compiled the my class library took that
dll and put it into the bin directory in
a debug folder so that we could have
that we can maintain this dependency on
this dll and that is projects and
solutions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
