from start-to-finish course my name is
Tim quarry and today we're going to be
building our forms just like with a
class library when we build our forms
we're just going to take the design
we've already came up with in the
planning process and put it into an
actual form you might be tempted to
write a bit of code in this stuff as
well but really we want to concentrate
on just building our forms we'll start
wiring them up later now if you remember
the designs we came up with were just
rough sketches in this step we'll make
those forms look good
that means establishing the design guide
of some type I won't bore you with the
experimentation I went through to find
come up with my design but instead I'll
just walk you through the end results as
we go before we get started though I do
want to point out the eye basing all of
my work in this video off the designs we
did in planning step number four if you
have a companion workbook you can refer
back to those designs to help you follow
along otherwise you can look back at
Lesson fours videos to see what our
design plans were so let's get started
before we get started in the lesson I
want to remind you to subscribe to this
channel if you are subscribed click the
little bell icon make sure you're
getting the alerts when I add a new
video and while you check on that could
you also give this video a like I know
that we're just getting started but
liking a video is a simple way that you
can make this course more popular and
that helps everyone it increases the
visibility of my videos on YouTube which
generates more income for me it helps
others out because they get introduced
to this valuable content and it helps
you out because I'm able to produce more
free videos okay so let's get back to
the lesson here we have our visual
studio project as we left it when built
our class library the only differences
are that I did add those code comments
on each one of the classes but that's
not really why we're here instead we
want to add a new project to the
solution so right click on the solution
say add new project and we're
select windows form application I call
this project tracker UI this is a
windows form application so windows form
tracker UI hit ok now the first thing it
does it gives us this form 1cs now when
we create our class library
I said delete that class one dot C I
would start over start fresh we can't
really do the same thing inside of the
windows form and the reason why is
because in this program dot C s you'll
see that we run right here form one so
you have to have something here to run
in order for it to be a form project now
we could delete it and then come back
here and manually update this but I find
that for forms is probably better just
to rename it as is right over here so I
clicked and I clicked again after a
second or you can right click and say
rename we're going to call this the
tournament viewer form and to ask us
since we rename this file would you also
like to rename all the references to
form one want to say yes
so now renames the class the partial
class tournament viewer form and also
this partial class here tournament
viewer form and that's what you want
so another question is what next well
we're going to start right away by
modifying so these properties let's
actually pull the properties window out
like so
and I call this form call it turn of
your form by the top right here where it
says text it still says form 1 I'm going
to change this to say tournament viewer
and that just tells us it changes the
text up here to say something besides
form 1 we can change that later if we
feel like that's just not a great
descriptive name the next thing I'm
going to do is change this back color
this back color is a battleship gray
it's really ugly
especially since most forms use this if
they're built inside of Visual Studio so
let's change the back color instead of
control we're going to select under web
we'll select white now this gives a
little more modern feel white is a great
background color because it doesn't draw
the eye away from our stuff on the form
so usually I start either a white form
or if I go the opposite kindly this
visual studio window is I'd go to a dark
gray let's choose white for this then
next I'm going to do is change my font
now it's important to change your font
right away on form instead of later
because every control we add to this
form after we change the font will
inherit that new font but any controls
that were already on here won't get that
new updated font so if you change it up
front then all the new controls will
have it so let's change this font from
the standard which is Microsoft's answer
to this one I'll say a 16 point font
that's a nice thin font it looks a
little more modern and of course that
changes the size of our form because of
the size the font it assumes the form be
a little bigger will shrink that damage
is a bit and the only other thing I want
to do is I want to change this icon so
let's go
to our demos folder tournament tracker
turn check our UI and here is this
tournament tracker icon file now in case
you didn't see me create that which you
didn't or know how I created I actually
just used the Metro studio from sync
fusion it's a free tool that allows me
to take simple icons and make them into
icon files or ping files or JPEG files
it's a really handy little tool and I
find it useful for creating icon files I
am really not a designer and so I don't
have the tools or the experience and
skill to create my own icons from
scratch so it's a great starting point
so I created a little clipboard icon
my thought was its way like Coach
carrying whenever we had tournament
where he'd keep track of things and so
they're going to be kind of glued
representation of what this project will
do and so we'll add that icon to every
form we create just kinda cute cohesive
look so that's the basics of this form
but don't forget this is actually the
tournament viewer form it has more than
just a base stuff we have to actually
add stuff here so let's start dragging
stuff on so I'll open up my toolbox and
pin it and the first thing is at the top
we have here is kind of header label and
so I'm going to change this for color
instead of control text I'm actually
give a custom color say 5 1 , 153 comma
255 and that's the RGB code well it has
to be 255 not 555 there we go so now
it's that bluish color I'm going to
change the font on this since it is a
header label and change the font to
light 28 let's go font here and we'll
change this to light and 28
now we'll also change the name a label
call this the header label and for a
text will say tournament and : all right
I get us started and we can rearrange
that how you want I'll get roughly in
place I may tweak it later that's good
for now
now I'd actually not copy this and paste
it into the controls see when they wants
it selected I hit ctrl C and then I take
control V it puts a pasted copy here and
that's fine for objects just as a quick
note don't do that for forms that's just
a real headache I actually did that the
other day I was in a hurry and I'm like
oh I already have all these these base
settings and wants my other four miles
copy and paste the form it'll be okay it
was a nightmare
you step on toes back and forth between
the two forms they actually kind of get
commingled and it's just ugly
so my quick piece of advice here is
don't copy and paste forms it's
physically possible some copy here and
then just right-click in your project a
paste so it's physically possible just
don't do it all right now for that you
can copy and paste objects like this so
it'll give it a new name label one so
let's change that and this is the actual
tournament name and for now we're at
none made a good starter name for it and
then we'll move that over a little bit
more alright next we have a drop-down
with a label so let's start a label and
I will call this
round call this the round label and I
will change the four color again to the
51 153 255 I'm going to change the font
itself to 20-point now line that up and
that's really good for our round label
now look at the drop down itself but
combo box normally you'll eat align
these with the pink line here that pink
line indicates at the bottom of the
label text will be the bottom of the
text in the drop down but because I made
the label a little bit bigger of font
I'm actually going to move this up and
use the bottom guide here so that blue
line and what that indicates is the
bottom of the labels box which is
invisible but upon the box will be the
same as the bottom of the combo box and
I kind of move the comma box text up
just a little bit it makes a little more
centered then I will drag it out a
little bit like a little bigger it's
call it there for now
I'll call this round drop-down next I
had to add checkbox I'll line that up
and again I'm going to change the four
color to you guessed it
51 153 255 I'm also going to change the
font on this to be 20-point the font
actually applies to the the equivalent
of this label here I'm also going to
change the flat style to be flat and
that like that check box actually turn
blue instead of have a black check in it
the last thing I do is come down here
and change this to played only and I
should also name this to pun play only
checkbox and one thing I note here is
I've called this round label I've called
this round drop-down and called this
unplayed only checkbox you don't really
have to put the the type in there in
that name I like to one of the reasons
why is because this label here really
the same kind of thing as this they both
are for the same thing this indicates
it's the round but it's the route it's a
label for round vs. this is the
drop-down for round and so putting the
type in the end allows me to
differentiate but also winning when I am
searching intellisense I can actually
search for label and even though it's
not the beginning of the word it will
give me all the labels that's makes my
life a little easier if I forget what
did I call it
you do measure the labels but it would
mess with checkboxes or drop downs or
whatever so let's move that up a little
bit something like that so now we have a
list box be careful to get a list view
it's a little bit different I've made
that mistake more than once
I want a list box one reason - I'm on
list box is because it behaves very very
similarly to the combo box these two are
basically the same thing with just a UI
difference which makes life a whole lot
easier for me because I can treat the
two of them in a very similar manner and
not get confused on which is which
there's our list box I'm going to change
the border style to a fixed single and
then the only thing left to do is to
actually name it in this case it's the
matchup list box so that's half a form
the other half a form is I have to have
a label over here let's grab it right
here copy paste normally I'm not a big
fan of copy paste when it comes to
coding but in this case it seems to work
pretty well it brings a lot of those
same things along with it the for color
and the font and the flat style and
everything else so I tend to use it for
that but usefully be careful to name
this something different all right so
this will be team one name and again
typically I wouldn't have this say team
one or team too because I want to have
somehow flexible system or to have more
than two two teams whatever but we've
already talked to the fact that we're
only ever going to have two teams
competing and tournament and so it just
makes more sense to have things labeled
team one team two let's go ahead and do
that and we'll call this team one just
we have something to visualize right
here and then I will copy this and paste
it down below and I will say here this
is score and team one score label and
then I grab a text box
and again I will line that up at the
bottom and I will call this team one
score text or score value of coat score
value I will copy all this and I'll
paste it in since I copied all three
notice how I highlighted that I'll do it
again for you I clicked and dragged
uniform and notice that little gray
outline of a box this is my highlight
window it's now highlighted three items
this label this label and this text box
now I can control C on that and ctrl V
to paste it will paste all three of
those items together in the same layout
and relationship then if I select all
those and I drag one of the items say
it's label I can line it up with the
other label that is companion in this
case bitten right here and now these two
are in perfect alignment now I can go
through and change all these to call
this one team one name so I'll call this
one team two name and I called this one
team one score label so I'll call this
one team to score label and this one is
team to score text just a quick note
here because I was selecting items that
had the same property so this label and
this text both have that name in parens
property and actually all items do
because that's the name of the object
instance so because they both have these
when I switch between
them it keeps the box time to highlight
it as you can see there it's a little
bit darker color and it's solid what
that indicates is the box is really
selected and so if you start typing and
notice up here where it says team to
name now I click there I just clicked
off and clicked in I don't click there
but if I start typing notice how it
turns blue and my typing goes in that
box that's a quick way to move from item
to item renaming things or setting a
text property or other column property
between objects just to light the object
and start typing let's come down here
right you're going to change this to say
team - I'll ask me to do well second the
last thing I need to do copy and paste
this just say hello label and I'm going
to change this to say vs or verses and
you know I bet might put a - and before
- after I'll kind of Center it ish you
look pretty good and I will call this
the vs. label now note I could use some
of these tools up here some tools up
here to allow me to align things better
so you can use those two a line then the
same height or the same relationship of
the page I'm going to use that for this
little thing right here it probably a
little more complicated than I need to
worry about and the last thing on this
page we need to do is add that score
button so I'll come up here notice of
any common controls this is where I
really live count controls has pretty
much everything you need for 95% of all
forms at least but if you really feel
like you have to go
on that you could browse around in these
other categories or go to all windows
forms and really browse around or if you
think you know a name of something you
can type it so for example I'm looking
for a button now obviously this buttons
right here but if I were to start typing
bu TT it shows me that in all Windows
forms there's a button and a radio
button and common controls is a button
and a radio button the duplication here
is because all windows forms has all of
all the controls whereas common controls
is a smaller subset of that that has the
most common ones kind of sense so
there's not two different buttons here
the same button it's just where it comes
from in this case let's grab the common
controls button that makes it a bit
bigger I'm going to align it more like
that for now
before I go on I'm going to change this
to say this is the score button and now
let's change the flat style to flat
let's change the flat appearance we're
going to change the border color to
silver we're going to change the border
set we're leave only the border side
alone we'll change the mouse down back
color and the mouse over back color so
Mouse down back color will be 1 0 to 1 0
to 1 0 to 2 and the mouse over back
color will be two for two two for two
two for two
we can try it out in it and then the
font we're actually going to change it
to say semi bold we'll leave it at 16
and the 4 color will change as well
again that's the 5 1 1 5 3 2 5 5
looks a little better and now we'll
change that to say score there we go
there are score button and that's pretty
much it for our tournament viewer forum
so we have our tournament and the name
of the tournament we have the round
drop-down with which round one of you we
can check a box that says only show us
the unplayed games in this round then we
have this match up list that shows of
all the matchups in that round and then
if you select one of them is going to
highlight and say team one is this
team's name right here and their score
is this if they have any score loaded
yet and then again
team two and their score if any we can
also fill in these boxes that give the
score and then hit the square button and
that will complete that round for that
matchup and we'll say okay who won based
upon the score so that's our whole page
now let's see it's an action but in
order to do that we open up solution
Explorer and right now the tracker
library is bold that means that it is
the project that will be started when we
hit this start button the problem with
that is you can't load or run a class
library it isn't an independent project
that can be run on its own so this
tracker UI is the one you want to run so
I right click on tracker UI and say set
as startup project now we hit start and
here is the form notice is a little bit
different than even the designer looks
like and the reason for that is because
this is actually taking the settings
from my windows and applying it to this
bar up here and these icons so they're
actually Windows 10 style icons and bar
so that looks pretty good
also notice the mouse over changes the
car the button a little bit if I click
on it it changes to even darker
like if it's a really clear indication
that button was clicked
so that's form one let's move on to form
number two this should go a bit quicker
as we continue to move as we go over
things you've already covered so we'll
have to explain them through add new
form we're going to call it the create
tournament form and again go into the
properties let's go ahead and pin this
and the text to the form we're going to
change to say create tournament the font
we're going to change and then the back
color we're going to change as well
I'll change it to white and then just
mirrors we already have over here one
more thing and that's the icon we use
that same icon now we can do a little
bit of shortcut in the fact that if we
come back to our solution Explorer and
open up our other form which is actually
open up here we can come back over here
and start copying and pasting it
actually knows it's already labeled
header label you just say
create tournament and now that is the
right size for label and it looks just
like the label over here now we need the
tournament name label add text box so
let's grab these two right here that's
copy and paste now say tournament name
term a name label and turn aim value
this is what the user will enter in the
tournament name so make it about like so
next we have the entry fee click the
line those two there I'll call this
entry fee label and entry fee tank our
value I'll come back over here say entry
fee
get the alignment right
it makes me smaller will also default
that value to zero next we need to have
a drop down move that a little bit we
need to have a drop down with a label so
let's grab these two copy and I'll paste
and put above I'll line up like so and
this we're going to say add team I'm
sorry selecting the add team we will go
next to this label here so this is the
select team label and the select team
drop down I'll make this drop down a
little larger the same size of that text
box probably good now the next item the
create new team I debate a little bit on
how it should look and we can definitely
the sin the comments if you'd like below
but this create new team link I assigned
to make into a link label which by
default is this blue color which I
thought about changing to make love our
accent colors but the problem I have
with that is if I change it to an accent
color and they have a green accent card
used which would stand out the problem
is that we've been trained with the web
that
a blue text that's underlined is a link
and it's very obviously click on a link
to go somewhere we can know that and so
to change that coloring to something
that would be maybe more in line with
our color scheme really actually have a
jarring effect in some ways so there's a
debate there you can have it I'm not a
designer I'm not really great at making
things look wonderful
so you can kind of figure on your own if
you want to do that or not
I'm going to leave it as is now say
create new I kind of pull that over so
it's actually over the drop-down these
don't look quite right and there we go
looks a little better so now you have a
tournament name the entry fee and then
selecting a team from a drop-down or
creating a new team and then you have a
button this is ad team copy that button
paste in I might actually play around
making it wider but flatter I'll call
this ad team and team button and that
looks pretty good I'll copy that and
paste it and then down below I'll line
up and this will be the create Prize
button and the text will say create
price now over here makes a little
bigger we have a list box copy that and
paste over put in need to probably since
it's just list box but doesn't really
hurt
we'll change this name to call it
tournament players list box and I will
put a label above it and coloreds
current players label let's actually
shrink us up just a bit
you can Kelvin or Rose you want how it
clicks in so that's one row two three
four five can probably leave it at five
select team slash players and the other
thing I want to do you want to know it's
plus over a little more you don't need a
waste space we don't have to the
originally I said for having some white
space and some kind of breathing room
your form at the same time you don't
make it so open empty that it's hard to
see on screen is it has a huge in order
to be visible so there's that balance
you have to reach all right so let's
grab actually grab this button over here
it's height a little better paste it
over here and I will put it right here
for now I'm debating if I put here or if
I put up here plus Lee here for now or
may not even Center it a little bit it's
trying to align over there with that
bottom I'm not sure that's right or not
I don't think it is actually I select it
and hit the down arrow kind of make it a
little more in line
I could again align the Middle's of
these two of a line to okay let's see if
we can do that we have it's a line
middles button right here and I kind of
move this down a little bit which
actually means I need to realign this
and then move all of these
up to align again with that over there
so it's a whole lot of moving around for
just that little bit of twitch but
that's okay
some people will notice that and the
off-put is not quite right it's not me
that's okay
copy this and paste it and line all up
and then I call this prizes label prizes
list box and we'll call this delete
selected prize button and communities
long if you want the names they should
be a little bit descriptive of what they
do I would recommend against
abbreviations abbreviations are more
confusing than they're really worth once
I delete selected and actually move us
down a little bit and that throws the
whole thing off and that's okay I guess
we should do the same thing here delete
selected and called this the delete
selected prize button so we'll call this
the delete selected players fun okay so
I could player button
and then it'll make this bigger will
actually match these up I'm gonna sleep
either but the same so now let's make
them kind of line up with where I should
go and I think we're good looks about
right so now we have the delete buttons
we have our list boxes we have our
labels the only thing left is a button
down here that says let's get a name
first the create tournament button and
we'll just say create tournament make a
little bigger stain a little more and
there we go and that is form number two
let's move on to form number three
scratch add windows form we'll call this
the create team form again we'll go to
our properties say create team we will
change the icon will change the font
and you'll change the back color there
we go again got copy and paste from our
previous forms so actually going to copy
this header label and this first text
box and label right here put that there
I'll call this the create team and
that's we will say T name team name
label and the team name value and then
we will do actually a drop down so let's
grab this right here actually the button
as well I'll copy those and paste them
line up the labels and we'll say select
team member label and the select team
member drop-down and the add member
button
remember select T number and down below
we actually had this box around a set of
controls so let's build that I'm going
to do that through group box now that's
not in the common controls but if you
type for group box
it's either in containers or all windows
forms let's drag this on now what this
does is it puts a visual boundary around
our stuff whatever it is we have on here
now there are more benefits than I'm
using it for I'm basically just using it
for a good delineation and say hey
here's a group of stuff I'll go together
that's not really connected with the
rest of form directly it's kind of a sub
form almost so that's all using it for
but there are more uses you can move the
whole group around very easily and even
has its own label one so on and so forth
but for now I'm just going to say this
is the add new member box now right now
that's our standard font with a standard
font color I am going to change that but
I'm not going to change it until after I
put my stuff in here now since I'm
copying pasting it's not as big a deal
but if I were dragging new stuff in here
it would be kind of a big deal and the
reason why is because anything dragged
into here will inherit this items
properties so my fetching is the font
size or color until after I've brought
everything in so let's bring in we have
this right here let's grab this ctrl C
control-v I'm gonna say first name label
and first name value I don't think this
a little bigger once I figure out how
large this is going to be first name
nothing pretty big so we'll move us over
actually this box a little bigger kind
of hoping to keep this small but
thinking this will have to do we can
always go left to right a little more
easily on a monitor because typically
monitors are in widescreen format not
all the time but most of time anymore
they're widescreen and so you have more
horizontal space and you do vertical
space and so that's just want to keep in
mind when you're designing your form
which way do I want to kind of lean or
bend this because I can make it a little
wider instead of making it longer by
stacking these on top of each other
now copy I'll paste this I will say last
name and up here I will say last name
label and last name tank value I want a
text gets one of the way they sometimes
do it but it really is additive value
I'm going to paste this again let's go
ahead and align these and do another one
right away
now here's a danger in doing two at once
I could easily forget to rename one of
these items and I'll have a label one or
a label 2 or a text box 1 or text box 2
floating out there that's not ideal I
really really don't like to see that so
just be careful in copying pasting don't
do too much without making sure you go
back and rename right away
so I'll call this email label and email
value and cellphone label and civil
phone value all right there we go
and now down here I can say email and
cell phone get cell phone numbers I
wanted to say how long it is and it's
all along
everyone knows I'm talking obviously
cell phone I could probably put just
sell there or cell number but cell
phones a little more professional it
seems like so let's do that and they get
a little larger
I'll control C and V on this button I
make it a little smaller not too much so
I'll say create member there we go
and now I'll come back to this change my
font size to the label size enemy color
I will change to my 5 1 1 5 3 2 5 5
there we go and now I can actually click
and drag and bring this up if I want to
might want to do a little bit of and
then I can actually if I select one and
ctrl and select the other it selects
both for me and they don't have to be
next to each other if I do this I'm
actually selecting the labels too I
don't want that I just want the items
and so I select one and then I hold down
control and select the other let go of
control and now I can drag in movies
around as I
so there we go so now not a little
larger to match my box down below and I
can even move the add member over a
little bit to better centers and I can
also bring all of this up just a smidge
to better align with the create team and
now I need a list box on the right which
I can just copy from here and paste over
here lion like that so and then I'll
actually make it the same height roughly
as this box over here which I don't make
the same height I like you to write it
down a little bit and then move my
button down which case I had a little
more space to make my button
let's same width so there we go so now I
have the tournament player list box I'll
actually call that the team members list
box so a team members list box which
we're going to select team members or
add them either way they're going to add
this box over here we'll also need a
delete button for this let's go ahead
and grab one of those copy and I'll come
over here I'll stretch my form out and I
will paste that in and I will roughly
center it there and I will say delete
selected member
and then finally we have this button at
the bottom which I'll probably the
scroll is a bit for I will say instead
create tournament I will say create team
there we go and there is the create team
form now right now I'm scrolling a
little bit but that's mostly because
it's kind of shrunk down into the Visual
Studio IDE and so I can probably value
find on the page itself as long as you I
have a small monitor and that is the
assumption here that the monitor is
smaller so that's a pretty safe
assumption these days so let's move
right along to form number four right
click on our project say add windows
form and this is the create prize form
first we do is go our properties we're
going to change that say create prize
we'll change the icon to be our icon
we're using we will change the four
color I'm sorry not the four color will
change the back color let's change the
correct color here change the back color
to white
we'll change the font
16-point and now we can create the
create prize form this is pretty simple
we'll just grab this and we will grab
let's do this for now I'll paste it in
it's still called header label which is
good but we need to change this to say
create price and now we need to grab
let's grab actually this one right here
I'll paste and put it right here make
sure it's aligned there we go say this
is place number place number label and
this is the place number value I'll move
this over I also need to do is copy this
and paste it three more times those
don't look like they're in line so here
we can do
we come over here and say make vertical
spacing equal and that makes a mess of
things so we hit undo I select only one
of the items so let's just do it the
text boxes here and say make vertical
spacing equal I move that one down and
then we'll all summit say align left and
move that one over and so now we can say
let's move this one right here and then
again just start aligning all of these
base out the first one
last must not want to line up there we
go and then actually I move this one
down so it's straight down to about here
so this is going to be the place main
label and the place main value and this
is going to be the prize amount label
and the prize amount of value and or
this is going to be the prize percentage
label and the prize percentage value
let's go back and change all this text
so that's the place name the prize
amount and this is the prize percentage
next we have to add one more label so
let's just copy this and paste it that's
actually about right and we'll do the -
or - like so it'll move us around till
it's about what we like and what was
called this the for label just to get a
better name and then finally come over
here grab our create team button and
paste this in put it about the center
call it the
create prize button and say create prize
looks a little big fist form well you
can address as you want to I think that
looks okay and keep the same approximate
sizes all the rest of the create buttons
the big ones so that leads us to
conclude form number four we only have
one more to go
so let's right click on tracker you I
say add windows form and say tournament
dashboard for to our properties by now
you should be kind of familiar with this
you say tournament dashboard let's see
if I can get all right turn the
dashboard we change the font we change
the I'm sorry as the icon yeah
change the font get hit myself I had no
clue how to pronounce that it's a go you
I see Gio Iona whatever it is it's a
cool looking font and it's sixteen point
so we want and then finally we want to
change the back color to be white
that's our form will actually a little
bit smaller when we're done we can start
with that so let's grab the header and
this is glass say I actually centered
this so let's first change the text to
say tournament dashboard
and so you actually Center that if you
want if you want to center that we just
say formats Center and form horizontally
that moves over to Center and then we
can say we want to drop down and so when
you come over here grab this copy it
will paste it and if I keep tower
centering format will do that so let's
Center all these like so and we can say
for this it is the load existing
tournament label and this is the load
existing tournament drop down and I'll
button below that but first let's change
this text it says load adjusting
tournament okay we'll set a is in a
minute I set it on one sense everything
to change things have to be redone so
let's just wait till the end now you
have button over here so let's take this
and paste it in I'll put it down below
here I'll say load tournament load turn
it button and then we have to add a big
one
they set the design they chose which is
create tournament button all right we
can kinda move this form around we can
select all these a needing less space
here
let's try us down move this all up we
can say make vertical spacing equal
that's not really want but instead you
want to align the centers and then
shrink that down and maybe you can move
it up a little more and then adjust our
form accordingly so there we go now we
have our last form this form is going to
eat a select one of the existing
tournaments and then load it or create a
new one now the one thing I didn't point
out your forehand but I want to go back
and talk about is this idea of you know
you're copying and pasting and creating
all these different items it's very easy
to forget to remain one of them but if
you can over here the properties and if
you do this drop down here now notice
how many things are in here that's
pretty impressive first little form but
look at all the different names if you
see group box one select it it selects
that group box and now you can actually
rename this to something more
intelligent let's say add new member
your group box so that's a great way to
make sure that you hadn't missed
anything in the naming by just looking
through here and making sure there's no
ones or twos or anything it's that you
don't expect to be there I can come here
and very easily go from form to form and
make sure that they're all the way
should be
once done we save them and actually go
on to need a change is this form is
actually the first form it starts when
the project loads so let's go back to
our solution Explorer let's kind of
collapse all these forms down and go to
program CS and where it says new
tournament viewer form we want to say
new tournament dashboard form so now if
we run this I'll bring it over here this
is what starts up and this is the
starting point for our application now
in case you're not sure why I did that
or how that works if you're familiar
with the console application we know we
have a static void main and that's where
all of our code runs and one static void
main is done the console closes well a
windows form is basically the same kind
of design in the fact that we have a
static void main and that's actually
inside of program CS that's right here
and once this method is done the
application closes and so we have these
three lines of code the most important
one for us since these are basically
saying just do it Microsoft sorry setup
but as last one here says application
run new tournament dashboard form which
creates a new instance of a tournament
dashboard form but what that does is it
actually pauses the application right
here at least it pauses this thread or
this method and it says don't and this
line until this instance right here
closes which is why when we start this
up we're writing this form right here if
we ever close this form the application
closes even if we have other forms open
so that's just a quick tip you priority
that but I wanted to point that out just
sure also note this right here XML code
comments submit Microsoft did that's
just one more indication that yes you
should be using XML code comments and in
fact we come back through all these
projects these forms and view their code
will actually add our own XML comments
to all of our methods that really need
it and it's being called outside of that
form so that's it that is our form
design project that's really all there
is to it really quick in some ways and
some way through a little long but
mostly the reason it took so long is
because we actually talked through why
we do things and how we do things and
those kind of things but the actual form
creation process once you get through
the first couple and we covered all
those topics went really quickly
especially or copying pasting that was
that made life a little easier for us
now coming up next we're going to start
getting into building our logic we're
going to take our project our solution
as it stands right now and start wiring
things up and that's where you know the
intimidation kind of kicks in for some
people the idea of even if I believe
your team and I create my class library
I created my forms and things look great
I'm just stuck now and you know what
we're going to get unstuck pretty quick
because we'll find we have a lot of work
we can do before we even really get into
the hard stuff and the more we chip away
piece by piece we'll find that there
isn't a whole lot of hard stuff it's
mostly just easy stuff and it's just
kind of those LEGO pieces being put
together in different ways so as it's
coming up in the next lesson so make
sure you stay tuned for that
before you go you'll see a link in the

information what you get if you pay also
if you are ever wondering what you could
do to help this channel out without
paying money I've listed six things that
really help
I appreciate if you consider doing one
or more of these thanks again and don't
get to keep practicing what you learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
