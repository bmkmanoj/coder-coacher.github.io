start to finish course my name is Tim
quarry and today we're going to create
our class library so far we've been
stuck in planning mode and I say stuck
because that's how I always feel that
first thing I do is start writing code
and as I have stressed planning is
important it needs to be done before we
start coding but now that we're through
our initial planning we get to actually
start by opening Visual Studio today and
today we're going to look at creating
our class library based upon what you've
already laid out so let's jump right in
before we get started this lesson I
wanted a quick man to help you out if
you're anything like me you probably a
friend or relative who thinks that
because you do something with computers
you must know how to fix their computer
I don't know how many computers I've
fixed over the years so I excited come
up with a better solution so I built a
course that teaches anyone how to
properly maintain their own computer I
call it PC maintenance the rest of us
and it cost us $29 I show people how to
download free software to protect their
computer including an anti-virus a
malware scanner and online file storage
applications then I show them how to use
each one as well as how to maintain your
computer after its cleaned up so how
does it help you well what I do now is I
tell people they have to buy this course
watch it and do it says before I work on
computers that solves most of their
problems both now and in the future and
they can do the same for you you will
find a link for this course on I am Tim
quarry comm as well as in the
description below
dude I do and you will not only be
helping me out you'll be helping
yourself as well
ok let's get back to the lesson here we
are inside Visual Studio let's create a
new project we'll select class library
will name this track your library and I
call it library at the end to make sure
that I know that this is a class library
go ahead and set the location to the
location I specified and the solution
name we will call tournament tracker I
lied okay the first thing I do is to
open up solution explorer and delete
glass one and the reason I do that is
because I don't want anything named the
default like one at the end so instead
of trying to rename that and possibly
have an issue let's go ahead and delete
that so now we have our library setup
and it's ready for our classes but what
classes we put in here and this is a
great part about having done the
planning process lr8 we're really not
thinking at this point instead what
we're doing is we're just retyping what
we have in our planning document into
actual code now we still are thinking
it's just that our thought processes may
be a little bit different instead of
thinking what data do I need we're now
thinking is that the right name to call
it and I missing anything those type of
things and so it really speeds up the
process so I've got a printed out list
of my classes and the properties in them
and so let's go ahead and start creating
those if you have the companion guide
this is a great time to open that up and
go to that page because it really helps
you follow along if not you can
reference the previous videos to see the
design for our class layout and compare
that toward doing right now or if you're
really organizing it's been taking notes
refer back to those so let's start by
adding a new class and we'll call this
team model we just call it team if you
wanted to but a standards that put model
at the end of it just so we know this is
a data model or it captures data it does
really differentiate this type of object
from anything else so let's go ahead
just put model at the end of every one
of our classes so team model let make it
public
and we'll type prop P ROP and this is my
snippet that I use it's built into
Visual Studio and this snippet what does
is you type prop and tab twice
it creates an auto property and this
auto property is the type of thing where
I use quite a bit in our classes this
holds one piece of data so this case
right now it's an int type and it's
called my property of course we'll
change that we can change that by saying
a list of person and look I tab I can
say team members I hit enter it goes the
end of the line now we don't have a
person class yet we'll get to that so
for right now it's Reds quickly that's
ok next I'll type prop string team name
so now we have two properties first is a
list of person and next is a string and
that is all I needed for the team class
before I continue the one thing I do as
well is initialize this team members
property by default this will be an
uninitialized list and I wanna make sure
that the very first thing that happens
is we initialize it so I can do is at
the end of the property say equals new
list of person and this is something new
in c-sharp 6.0 it used to be we couldn't
do this here and so instead what we do
is they create constructor ctor tab
twice and then say team members equals
new list of person and that's in the
constructor and so anytime this class is
instantiated it called s in and it
wouldn't and she ate the team members
property but since c-sharp six we can
now just say the auto property equals
new list of person again that's not me
for the person who has not yet created
no worries we'll get there next so let's
go ahead and right-click on the tracker
library and say
add class this is the person model of a
public class person model I say prop tab
twice string first name prop tab twice
string last name email address cell
phone number and that's it so now we
have a person model notice how quick
that went and I intentionally didn't
really talk through the whole thing I
just want to go through it because we've
already talked through initially in our
planning step and now I'm just putting
it stuff down into actual code and the
one thing we need to address is back
over here in team model we call its
person and shape person model you change
this as well so now we have no more red
squigglies the team model is as team
members which is a list of person model
and the person model has our four
properties and that's all for that let's
add another class now we add our
tournament model to make it public
we're add our string tournament name our
decimal entry fee our list of team model
enter teams our list of prize model
called prizes our list of a list of
matchup model called rounds and again we
will initialize these to these three
lists so equals new list of team model
equals new and notice how I said new
space I kind of glossed over before but
it already knows list of prize model and
so therefore I say new and it says right
here list of prize model so I can say
tab and it fills in for me even though
right now prize model is not yet a
created model and so it's yelling at me
but at the same time it's saying you
probably want this to be a new list of
prize model so it allows it even for the
more complicated list of a list of
matchup model it allows it now let's
continue on and create these other
models add class prize model make it
public hint place number
place name prize amount and prize
percentage now leave those all to their
initial values now to come back over
here to our tournament model we can see
that prize model is now working
correctly so we add our next class which
is the matchup model we can make it
public prop tab twice a list of matchup
entry model entries you can say right
now equals new list team model winner
int match up round alright the last one
I have to do is I have to add a new
class for matchup entry model make it
public
team competing score and parent matchup
and guess what
that completes the basics of our class
library you seem to get right down to it
the class library once is planned out is
very very simple to actually build but
before we go there is one other thing
that want to point out that we really
should do I'm going to start doing it
don't show the whole thing just be the
is old it long and tedious and that is
we need to comment this and I know
that's know one of those steps kind of
like planning but you're like man I
really don't want to do that or I'll get
to it later and here's the reality if
you don't do it now you won't get to it
but I'm not asking you to comment this
in general instead I'm asking for is XML
comments as you've never used an XML
ecology for it they're really easy to
use and they're really really useful so
for example above this property right
here if I type three slashes in a row
one two three it gives me a little bit
of XML and it's a summary as a blank
line that has the slash summary if
you're familiar XML or HTML or things of
this nature this right here is an
opening tag and this is a closing tag
inside here is where you put your actual
comment in this case I might say
represents one team in the matchup and
then come down here and again over the
score that presents the score for this
particular team and then our matchup
model I would say that presents the
matchup that this team came from as the
winner now that may be a little long
since I could actually write here hit
the enter key and put an X the next line
and notice how it added those triple
slash comments and then moved one space
over and then start my text so this is
called an XML comment now it may just
look like a kind of cool way of
formatting or maybe not cool way of
formatting your comments there's so much
more to this I do it quick constructor
here to shoot me let's say create a
constructor where you have to pass in a
double called score or maybe initial
score why you do is not really important
instead what's important is this actual
method if I hit triple slash comments
here I get that summary but I also get
its other line saying here is the
initial score parameter so not only kind
of document the method itself but also
inside here and this is where people get
some things mixed up a little bit it's
inside like this and so it's between
this greater than sign and this less
than sign not in here somewhere
not in here you document right there
so not only kind of document the method
but also the parameter in fact if this
is a method and it had a return type
we could also document that and if you
notice if you open up your less than
sign I can have examples or which
exceptions get returned or what
permissions are needed for this method
remarks see also I can document a whole
lot of other things but again you may
say who really cares or wash I use this
format well let's look at
if we did CW tab tab again
console.writeline not really pertinent
in this location but pretend that it is
if I look at this right now I see that
it says it writes the current line
terminator to the standard output stream
how does that method pass this
information along well it's by these
triple slash comments that phrase right
there right the current line terminator
to the standard output stream that
phrase comes from the summary statement
now if I were to go down one level say
to this versus bool value notice as
value is the value two right whereas
that come from well that comes from the
parameter documentation for this item
again triple slash comments and that's
what Microsoft does but we can do as
well if we use these same triple slash
comments so if someone is calling this
class library instead of just seeing
team competing which may be descriptive
but this is definitely descriptive or it
should be in telling you exactly what
that is all about we can even give an
example of how to use a certain method
or even say who had access to a certain
method or a certain property so all of
these things can be done using our
triple slash comments my encouragement
to you is definitely use these so I'll
go back through and add the triple slash
comments on the other properties in the
rest of these models but you do need to
watch that instead let's talk about
coming up next in our next lesson we're
going to start building our forms now
remember we've already designed our
forms in our planning phase and now
we're going to take those designs and
create actual forms and the first thing
you may be thinking is those forms were
ugly and yeah they were they were
designs that were just for
catching things out now we're going to
try and add a little life to these forms
making a little less like standard
battleship gray forms and give them a
little bit of a modern feel so make sure
you stick around for that
before you go you'll see a link in the
left of BIOS course check out the intro
video in this playlist for more
information all you get if you pay also
if you are ever wondering what you could
do to help this channel out without
paying money I've listed six things that
really help I appreciate if you consider
doing one or more of these thanks again
and don't forget to keep practicing what
you learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
