going to walk you through what the
dotnet standard is and how it relates to
other versions of the class library
project type especially I seen a lot of
confusion on this topic since Visual
Studio 2017 was released in fact I may
have sent you here if you watched with
my other videos and had a problem
following along this can be a confusing
topic so I want to create a vo to clear
up that confusion let's start by looking
at the various class library product
types in Visual Studio so here I have
Visual Studio 2017 open I'm ran the
Enterprise Edition of Visual Studio but
the free version called the community
edition will work just fine so let's
click on this create new project link
and filter this list by class library ok
so here's all the class library types
now note that there are visual basic
versions in here we're going to ignore
those we're not doing a VB down here so
there is for you sequel applications
let's ignore that one and do you see F
service library at something different
but the rest we have net core dot not
standard dotnet framework and portable
so what's the differences here well
we're going to concentrate on the.net
standard today but let's start with what
the dotnet portable is the class library
portable version the idea behind the
portable version is that we could take
this code and use it on any device so
for using a silverlight on Windows Phone
or just a Windows Phone app in general
or if we're using it on mono or
somewhere else
the portable class library should work
the problem of the portable class
library is the team maintaining it with
a separate team entirely from all the
other dotnet applications the
Silverlight and the Windows Phone and
the desktop and the web
and so they were trying to pull together
this API to work across all of them
based on was already there kind of
shimming things in so that's the old way
of doing things and by oldham in a few
years old it's all it's not very old but
it's old enough that microsoft said you
know what this isn't the way we want to
go and so they replaced the portable
class library and it's still here
because of backward compatibility but
they replaced it with the.net standard
so the dotnet standard is is it's a
flipped on its head version of the
portal class library instead of trying
to find out where things kind of matched
up in the different frameworks what
dotnet standard says is based upon our
standard if you want to be a dotnet
something if you want me the dotnet
ecosphere then you have to implement
these api's think of it kind of like an
interface in c-sharp it's saying here's
the contract that you will follow if
you're a dotnet something like a dotnet
framework or dotnet core and so all
these different API s early different
libraries will implement the dotnet
standard as long as they're compatible
with it and I'll show you a chart in a
minute of what's compatible with what
but the dotnet standard says here is the
contract and they have different
versions that contract a 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3
i think one point six and then 2.0 it's
coming out so that's they have these
essentially contracts and they said if
you're the dotnet framework you will
support this contract and so really the
dotnet framework is what the portable
class library aspired to be the portal
class library aspired to be this place
where you call me and I'll work no
matter where I'm actually located the
dotnet standard says will definitely
work because
the frameworks implement us they imp
they follow the contract and so if your
code can fit in dotnet standard it will
work across the board in net at whatever
version you use at the dotnet standard
now it's confusing so you pull up a
chart here to show you what I mean now
link to this in the comments but here's
the dotnet standards so we have 101 1 2
3 4 5 6 and 2 now down here is all
different frameworks so dotnet core
supports things like Linux and Mac as
well as Windows whereas a dotnet
framework is more for the desktop
applications and even asp.net as well so
we can look here and say well if we want
to use the dotnet framework 4.5 the
highest dotnet standard we can go to is
1.1 so if we're on 4.5 the dotnet
framework then we have to use dotnet
standard 100 or 1 1 otherwise it won't
work
if we can move to four point five point
one then we can move to 1.2 so there's a
lot of different flexibility here on
where you want to be and so as chart cut
helps you figure out what you want to
target so if you want target all these
platforms including Windows Phone
Silverlight you cannot go beyond dotnet
standard 1.0 there's not a whole lot of
API is in there's it pretty limited now
we'll look today at one point six and
that supports dotnet core 1.0 which is
pretty low 4.6.1 of the dotnet framework
mono 4.6 xamarin iOS 10 xamarin Android
7 and the next version hopefully of the
Universal Windows platform so one point
six color is quite a bit of the modern
stuff
now if we want to go to the Universal
Windows platform as it is today we have
to drop down to the dotnet standard 1.4
so that's how you use this chart they
tell you the lowest possible version you
can get away with but I tend to say and
go for the highest version you can get
away with so if you don't have a support
Universal Windows platform then go 1.6
if you really want to support Windows
Phone 8.1 well then go 1.2 not 1.1 or
1.0 go 1.2 now it is getting pre
theoretical here so I'll kind of talk
you through what does the dotnet
standard really mean and there's two
versioning rules that are really
important and really powerful so the
first rule is the dotnet standard is
additive that means that if you have
something that's using.net standard 1.1
it will have everything that 1.0 has
plus it will have all the stuff in 1.1
so it has both so 2.0 has everything
from 1.0 and everything from 1.1 and
everything from 1.2 and so on so it's
additive it does not take anything away
which is great if you can rely on then
to say yes it can move to the next
version if you run 1.6 and you wanna go
to oh and everything that you support
dotnet Cornette framework whatever if
they all support it you can move there
without a problem it's simply a matter
of changing your target for dotnet
standard and it opens up those new
possibilities of a 2.0 without taking
anything away that's wonderful
second of all it's immutable that means
that once it's shipped once that next
init has been shipped it doesn't change
it will always be that way
so it really does lock down the
framework to be something known that you
can work against so it really is a
powerful powerful tool so I'll give you
this page you can look over it the
dotnet standard is open source which
means you can go to the issue list and
submit a bug or ask a question or even
look at what things have already been
asked for and maybe even make a
modification and submit a pull request
yourself so it really is one of those
ways that Microsoft has moved into the
open-source friendly marketplace is they
have open source and dotnet standard and
said this is for everyone to contribute
to so this is what dotnet standard is in
theory now let's look at it in practice
so let's look at dotnet standard now
again dotnet core and dotnet framework
they can both make use of dotnet
standard libraries you know dotnet
standard library can go anywhere but
we're going to do a dotnet standard
library just kind of demo what it can do
however if you're using just desktop
stuff you're not really looking to
change then there's not really to go off
a dotnet framework the.net framework
scrape for console applications WPF
applications wind form applications
service applications even the asp.net
MVC and all the rest those all work
great with dotnet framework that's the
the big windows centric framework but if
you have this idea that you know maybe I
want to put my stuff onto a Linux box or
maybe I wanna target a phone platform or
maybe I do one of those dotnet core
versions of the asp.net in order to
target a Linux box and run an ASP site
on Linux well then the
that stand is probably a way to go here
so let us create a dotnet standard demo
I'll call it demo class and demo
solution just we have a difference here
solution okay wait okay and here is our
dotnet standard version now it looks
pretty much like a dotnet framework
version and the two are very similar
name so it's kind of tough to figure out
which do I have one of the ways you can
tell our dependencies you can see SDK
here and that says dotnet standard
library another way is to right click
the project and go properties you can
see dotnet standard this is 1.4 so we
can change to 1.6 and that's all it'd be
changed to 1.6 and we hit save and now
supports 1.6 if you want to back off to
1.0 is select that and then apply it so
they'll say dotnet standard as a target
framework if it says that you map you'll
follow along with some of my videos
unless I explicitly say this is going to
be a cross-platform library it most
likely targets the dotnet framework it's
a much easier learning platform adding
in different operating systems and the
limitations of dotnet core and dotnet
framework I'm sorry I've gotten that
standard just isn't worth it as a
learning platform usually so unless I
say so
I'm using dotnet framework but in this
case we're using dotnet standard 1.6 now
I'm a class 1 typically I say to delete
class 1 before you do anything else in
the class library project I will follow
my own advice and let's add a new class
we'll call the person class make it
public
and will say prop tab twice and say
string first name first and last name
okay so looks just like in our class and
really that is now note that I only have
three using say ones up here usually
have a whole lot more when you have a
dotnet framework project they have
really cut back on what the using
statements are by default so let's show
adding one more class let's call this
the let's call the operator class
alright now this is not a working
project you can't really do anything
with it you can't run it because it's
not something I'm actually going to
necessarily use not yet at least
let's create a public void create list
of people and for right now returns it
returns nothing so that's okay but we'll
mop up in the future so list of person
all right now you have our list of
person let's actually changes the output
we're going to say output add new person
first name equals Tim last name equals
Cory and we'll just copy that maybe one
more time and we'll say sandy Smith and
find let's go ahead and change this
output to be a list of person just we
have something coming out and return
output now why I do all that well I kind
of want to show you that this all seems
to work just like a dotnet framework
class library does in fact let's add a
new project we're going to consult
application get a dotnet framework
console application not the dotnet core
it will call this our console UI and
we'll add a reference to our oops
on the wrong one here at reference here
to our dotnet standard demo class
so now here I'll serve startup project
so start a project and now you can come
here and say operate or the control dot
and say using the.net standard class
demo or standard demo class and collect
the mouthful operator Oh equals new
operator
Oh dot create list of people and we'll
put that into a bar my list now out
typically use a VAR but it's a shorthand
for saying list of person and so my list
is just VAR just easier it does strongly
type that to our list of person and I
can do a for each bar item in my list I
can say console.writeline and let's do
our dollar sign syntax with dots I'm
double quotes inside here we'll say
curly brace item dot first name space
item dot last name and then is on our
list
so Tim quarries on our list and sandy
Smith is on our list and then last but
not least we'll do our console dot
readline to stop the console from
exiting out so run this and there's
build errors so let's go ahead and say
no we don't want to run the last
successful build instead let's look at
our error
the error says a project that's right
here target is the dotnet standard
version 1.6 it cannot be referenced by a
project to targets dotnet framework
version 4.5.2 if we go back to our chart
over here 4.5.2 well that's 1.2 or lower
or a dotnet framework so you have two
choices here we can either back down our
dotnet standard to 1.2 or we can
increase our debt net dotnet framework
version 2 in this case 4.6.1
let's come back over here our console we
can go to properties we can do a drop
down say 4.6.1
are you sure you want to change it sure
let's go ahead and change it and now if
we run this there's still build errors
let's see why all right so the error
says we have version 1.6 with a dotnet
standard and version 4.6.1 of the dotnet
framework now if we come back over to
our page over here 4.6.1 should work
just 51.6 but notice how it's scratched
out here uzv next here's my guess my
guess is that I have an update for
Visual Studio now this is update right
here one notification that's an update
for my net now my guess is that my my
version currently still thinks that it's
1.4 is the maximum dotnet standards for
4.6.1
let's verify that so out here the dotnet
standard demo class the properties
we'll say 1.4 we'll save that and now
hit run again and this time the built
exceeded and it ran and it says Tim
Cory's on your list and so is tinny
Smith let's go ahead and edit those font
sizes be a little bit larger how is that
let's run that again a little bit of
there so 10 quarries in the list and so
as sandy Smith so it worked for dotnet
1.4 but not version 1.6 that's probably
because over here I have a visual studio
update that's my guess but this is one
thing I want to point out when it comes
to working with these types of libraries
this is cutting-edge stuff this is stuff
that Microsoft is just working on now
the fact that even their their page that
shows the different versions has
scratched out some modification shows
that so we need know is that if you're
going to target the dotnet standard be
prepared for some buggy interactions
okay I've had a couple times now where
things don't compile even though they
should I'm like I'm not quite sure why
what's happening what's going on I
restart visual studio and it's fine so
this is definitely cutting-edge stuff
this is definitely stuff that Microsoft
is working on the artwork and fast it's
a very rapid turnover rotation of fixing
bugs and adding new features but at the
same time we've gotta be careful not to
get too close to that bleeding edge it's
really fun place to be we have all the
latest and greatest tools and toys but
on the other side you have all the bugs
and all the kinks to work through on
your own and sometimes the IDE doesn't
help you sometimes are actually hurt too
like in the case of this where it says
you can't do a 1.6 even though I can't
so my guess is the IDE is just not an
updated
to say yeah I can or maybe the compiler
isn't up-to-date we'll see when we
update that so that's the first thing
I'd be careful of is if you don't need
to do the dotnet standard right now
just hold off now it doesn't mean don't
play with it
definitely play that try it out build
some test projects if you want to
I just wouldn't necessarily push this to
production unless you need to now that
being said there are ways to build an
existing dotnet framework library
they're kind of in line with the dotnet
standard libraries the biggest thing to
know is what's compatible and what's not
now there is a plugin you can get for
Visual Studio that will tell you if your
current library is compatible or not I
believe that's referenced in the page a
link down below but also just you to
look at the nougat packages you add
because if you add a new get package it
also has to be compatible with dotnet
standard so in a third play libraries as
well so just kind of keep that in mind
when you're building a library so my
tournament tracker application which I
created for my c-sharp course that
project I just for fun ran that through
the compatibility wizard to see can I
move my class library over to dotnet
standard and mostly the answer is yes I
have to do a little more research on a
couple of class or a couple of new get
packages I use but the one thing that
really tripped me up was accessing the
web config file or the app document sig
file I'm sorry accident that file uses
some libraries are not available yet in
dotnet standard so in order to do that I
have to do a different way and so some
code refactoring it has to go on there
so if I want to move that library over I
have to make a few modifications and
that really comes down to is in dotnet
standard if you're accessing something
it's available only on the particular
platform you're on it's not going to
work so if I try and access the registry
in dotnet standard by default oh no you
can't do that because the iOS phone
doesn't have a registry not in the same
way now there are things you can do to
get around that or to kind of add in
some compatibility and as the versions
of.net standard go up you'll get more
and more access to more and more api's
they'll that may add functionality you
need now here's a deal if you do want to
go the route of building a dotnet
standard library you may have to create
a second library so here's what I mean
if you build a dotnet standard library
it may have the vast majority of your
code but there may be certain things
that you have to do on the platform
you're on for example if you have to
access that registry well maybe create a
separate library that handles the
registry access alone it won't be
compatible with the rest of the
platforms like dotnet core or the
zamarons stuff but that's one a little
bit of code and you can port that to
other platforms or at least port that
functionality those other platforms by
rewriting it for each platform specific
to whatever they have that's equivalent
so that little bit of code has to get
rewritten but the vast majority in your
dotnet standard class library does it so
that's basically it I just want to do a
small little video it's not a whole lot
of demo here it's more a matter of me
kind of walking you through this but
just kind of showing you what gotten
that standard is and how it relates to
dot in that core and dotnet framework
and even the dotnet or the portable
there's a lot you can do with dotnet
standard already especially you can get
into the 1.6 range
and 2008 have even more stuff so if you
want that cross-platform library that
works anywhere in a dotnet universe
where's dot net core or xamarin or
dotnet framework or any of the other
platforms you saw there you can use
a.net standard to give you that that
foundation on which you can build your
applications now if you have target only
a specific platform for example if using
wind forms which only works on windows
or WPF which only works on windows if
using these types of platforms then my
recommendation at this time is to still
target the.net framework it's more
feature-rich
it's more stable and it is really
designed for what you want to do so if
you do want to go possibly on the road
to a broader platform then the dotnet
standard is the way to go as you've seen
here it's really not that hard to use
and it kind of works the same way as a
normal class library so you can feel
kind of comfortable doing it but there
are those a little bit of hurdles you
have to get over in order to get it
going the biggest one being the versions
of the frameworks that you use together
so that's it I just wanna give that
quick kind of overview of what's going
on with the dotnet standard I hope you
enjoy it if you have any confusion which
I'm sure is probably some because this
is a much broader topic that I covered
if you have any confusion or any
questions please let me know in comments
down below I'll do my best to answer
this is again it's still it's a new
frontier even for me so we're still kind
of learning as we go all right also down
below is a link for my mailing list also
my facebook group if you can give that a
like to appreciate that and also if you
give us video a thumbs up that'd be
great
if you aren't already go ahead and jump
on the subscriber list for this YouTube
channel that'd be great all right thanks
so much again I am too
