interfaces in c-sharp here I'm using
Visual Studio 2013 but you can use
Visual Studio 2012 without any issues
there won't be any differences with this
demonstration okay so what are
interfaces well an interface is a
contract what it does is it tells the
application this is what you can expect
from any class that implements this
interface so for example it can say you
can expect to have these properties and
these methods let's go ahead and build
an interface so we can see what it looks
like and that will I think will make it
a little clearer as to how to use an
interface and what it really means so
when I'm creating an interface and I
want to share this among different
projects I'll put it put the interface
or interfaces in their own project that
way I can pass just that DLL or just
that project around and not have to
share my entire solution so let's go
ahead and create a new project what I
have right now so far is a console
application but let's go ahead and add a
new project enter your class library
class library projects compile down to
dll's which is exactly what we want in
order to share this to different
applications
let's call call this specifications okay
the first thing we do is we delete the
class one CS file we don't need that
let's add our first interface so add new
item and we'll create an interface
interface interfaces should always start
with the capital I both for their file
name and for their actual name so let's
start I person
note that the P is also capitalized so
it's capital I then capitalize each
first letter of each word
so I person okay and just like with
classes the first thing we do here is
change this to be a public interface now
one more thing to make life a little
easier what I typically do is change the
namespace we could leave the namespace
the same and what that would mean is
where every use this DLL we have to add
a using statement for the specifications
namespace well that might not always be
what we want because we'll have to add
that in multiple places so instead what
I do is I change this name space to be
system now you have to be careful here
that you don't step on any toes by
naming things in the same way that would
be in this system library but for our
case that shouldn't be a problem
what this will do is since every class
unless it's been changed from the
default since every class has the using
system at the very top the only thing a
project we need to do is import our dll
or project into the library and you can
start using it immediately let's just
see how that works right away let's go
ahead and change that back to be
specifications and go back to my my
static void main in my console
application and go ahead and use that i
person just to see it show up in a list
so the first thing I do is add a
reference to my specifications project
if you were adding a DLL you could do
that at the Browse hit okay and now I
have my specifications here now if I
start typing i person I don't get
anything
in this list and that's because we still
have the namespace as specifications if
we change this to be system however and
save that come back over here and try us
again I was go ahead and save that first
I person note that turns blue because
that is valid interface system that I
person okay
so just changing from the specifications
namespace to the system namespace allow
us to easily use that without adding a
namespace our using statement up here to
our namespace okay so what goes into an
interface well a few things most usually
its properties and methods and this is a
contract so it only be the public
properties and methods you want to say
that any class implementing this will
have so we're creating a simple i person
contract so let's start with a couple
properties a first name to last name so
I would say string first name and then
do my get and set note that I did not
add a public at the beginning of this
you don't add any access modifiers like
public or private to the beginning of an
interface declaration
okay and one more email address okay so
there are three properties let's go
ahead and add a method called hire I'm
not sure why would I use the hire but we
will so just like with our properties we
don't add that modifier so it start with
void if we return void hire and then any
properties or our parameters we want to
add here so you want to add a parameter
called date/time hire date you can do
that the one thing is a little different
is that instead of adding our open and
closing curly braces here what we do is
we add a semicolon this just says that
we're done with this specification so
now we have an interface that has three
properties first name last name and
email address and one method called hire
now how we use this well if we go back
to our program CS if we want to create a
class we'll do a hit go ahead and do
that in our console application if you
want to create a class that implements
the interface we do it this way let's go
add new class it will call this class
person now the class name and the
interface name don't have to match in
fact they usually won't but in this case
they're similar
so public class person okay now how do
we implement an interface
well it's fairly simple after the
Declaration of public class person we
tape a space a colon a space and then
just list our interface I person and
we're done
now if we were to compile this at this
time we'd get an error in fact we get
four errors it says that the
demonstration dot person does not
implement the interface member and then
it lists the three members and it does
not implement the member and the one I'm
sort of four members three properties
and one method so how do you fix this
well we could do it manually but visuals
to us made life so much easier for us if
we click on this I person we have a nice
little drop-down you can also hit the
control dot and do the same thing drop
it down we have this implement interface
I person or explicitly implement
interface i person let's go ahead and
just implement the interface i person
what this has done is it has created for
us three properties in one method
instead of each it has a throw new not
implemented exception what that does is
since Visual Studio has created these
properties and methods for us it doesn't
want us to confuse those with completed
properties and methods so it adds this
throw new not implement exception that
way if we accidentally use this property
or method it's going to throw an error
so let's go ahead and change these so
they work the way we want to well with
these properties I don't need full
properties just Auto properties let's go
ahead and change this to be auto
property
now we'll just change this to one just
to make sure it works we'll go ahead and
hit build and our builds exceeds that's
because an auto property and a full
property it doesn't matter which one we
have is long we have that property all
that says is you must have a first name
property we both a get and asset so
let's go ahead and change last name an
email address as well
okay so now we have three properties and
one method and this class implements
this interface properly now we could add
things here so for example if you want
to we could just say
okay so now you've implemented that
method nothing really special here but
you may say well what if I want to add
extra properties not a problem you can
add as many properties and methods as
you want to this class
the only specification is you must have
these three properties and this method
in the class that means I can add extra
properties like age so I add an extra
property if I go ahead and hit build the
build still succeeds because it doesn't
matter what extra things I add it just
needs to know that you have fulfilled
the contract so that's a basic interface
and a basic implementation of an
interface but how do we use that well
when we specify that we want a a class
instance we can specify person equals
new person right that's typically how
I've done in the past so how does
interface change that well let's first
just do a simple person dot hire and
we'll do daytime dot now
oops make sure you get the right opening
and closings okay
whoops I should not do a date-time to
string I should have just a day time
okay
so daytime higher does not actually
return anything of course not
okay so let's go ahead and change that
to be just person dot higher because
inside of person dot higher we actually
do the console.writeline ourselves all
right so now we finally got it right so
what should happen is we create a new
person we hire them it spits it out to
the console let's go ahead and run that
and it works this person was hired on
twelve three and there's a time okay
so let's change this over to use the
interface instead to do that we just put
the I in front I person so now this is
the interface I person and we put a new
person into it and if you run this
nothing changes but let's go ahead and
look at that person object if we say
person dot age equals five we get this
error system dot I person does not
contain a definition for H but if you go
here we have this age so what's the
problem well let's go ahead and change
this back to be person and now that
works the reason why is because we have
said that this variable person if we
change us to be is an AI person if this
variable person is an AI person well i
person only has these specifications
first name last name email address and
hired method what that's saying is is
that whatever is put in this person will
satisfy this contract it may do more but
it would definitely satisfy that
contract but age is not a part of that
contract so we can't use it without
casting it but we can still do the hire
because that's one of the things in the
contract this thing it useful when you
have different types of class
is that all implement the same interface
let's go ahead and add another class so
add class and we'll call this employee
and we change the public like before and
we'll go ahead and enter implement the
interface I person go ahead and instead
of actually doing the same way I copy
and paste for simplicity sake so copy
and I'll paste now we have the same
thing as I person well why do we care
well for employee maybe you don't need
the age but we do want to have other
methods like public void fire
okay so they have a fire method and
we're going to change this higher to say
this employee and we'll change the fire
as well so now we have this employee was
hired on and this employee was fired on
for these two methods they're very
simple methods we haven't changed the
properties at all but let's go ahead and
look at this again so now in our i
person we have this hire we pass in the
date and it pops out and says hey this
person was hired on but what if we
change this to be employee everything
still works in fact if we hit run it
runs but note that now it says this
employee was hired on twelve three if we
change that back to person and hit start
it says this person was hired on twelve
three so the difference here is that we
can put whatever class implements this
interface we put whatever one we want
into this variable and use it this can
be helpful when we have a bunch of
different types for example a library
has books and magazines and videos and
DVDs and a whole bunch different things
like that but they all have similar
things they all have a title a
description and they have some sort of
library identification like a barcode
that the library uses the track the I M
so that they could all implement the
interface I library item that we create
and then we can put those items into a
list so for people in our example here
we could have a list of AI person people
equals new list of AI person
okay so now we can do is we can add a
whole bunch of people to this list but
they could be a type person or they
could be of type employee in fact both
are valid and both can be added just to
prove this let's go ahead and create a
couple of I person objects so I person
employee equals new employee okay and
we'll go ahead and hire the employee to
and let's go ahead and add both of these
to the people people dot ad person and
people dot ad employee okay
that works in fact if we run this or we
build it built exceeds there are no
problems and if we do a for each
tonight do a for each I person P in
people we're going to say P dot hire ok
we'll take these two lines out so now
we're doing is instead of manually
specifying that we're going to hire them
we're gonna loop through that list of
people and hire each person intern so if
we run that we can see that this person
was hired on twelve three and this
employee was hired on twelve three so
it's little it looped through our entire
list and even though one list of type
employee and one was a type person it
hired both of them because they both
implemented the AI person interface this
is just scratching the surface of what
you can do with interfaces in a further
video we're going to go into more in
depth of how we can implement interfaces
that implement each other so we can have
some sort of nesting so for example a
employee is a person and so on and so
forth but for now let's go ahead and
stop there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
