the basics of Windows forms projects
here I have a new solution with a brand
new windows form project opened up as
you can see we start out with a form 1
CS and a program CS file if we open up
program CS we can see that down here in
line 19 we have an application run new
form 1 this is where the application
actually starts we have here our static
void main which is our introduction to
this application and it creates a new
instance of form 1 which is this form
right here if we run this we get the
basic windows form with all the nice fun
controls that come with a form dragon
resize capabilities maximize resize
minimize even we have a nice buttons
including the close button our icon over
here is a standard default windows form
icon and with it comes a contextual menu
including the close
alright so that's right out of the box
so first thing we need to do is go ahead
and look around at what we have okay
if we click on the form we see down here
in our properties window which if you
don't do not have property window go to
view property window let's open it up
and here I have it pinned over here so I
can reference it easily so I selected
form 1 I need to click up here somewhere
in the title bar a form 1 and over here
the properties you can see all the
properties of form including the name of
the form 1 instance ok now when you
start an application probably the first
thing you should do is rename form 1 to
be something more significant for let's
say for example we're going to call this
form our main form so let's go ahead
here and click on form 1 up here
click again to forget the rename you
could also right-click and say rename
let's name this to be main dot CS click
enter this dialog prompts you and asks
you if you would like to rename
everything related to form 1 to be main
and yes we do now you can see that we
have a main CS file that says main to
form 1 and if we go back to program CS
we are now ran new instance of main
that's the easiest way I have found to
create a new form of our default project
the one thing does not change if you
notice right here it still says form 1
let's take a peek at where that is we
scroll down here in our property window
this is the main form as you can see
scroll down here to text and it says
form 1 we can change this to be main
page or main form whatever you like
we'll leave that main form for now no it
still has not changed but once we mouse
off of however we do it if we mouse off
of this field it will update the
property click over here and now it says
main form ok so now if we start this we
haven't broken anything it still starts
just fine and the only major difference
is it says main form the reason I
renamed it here instead of down here is
because when you rename up here in a
solution window it renames the actual
file itself so if we right-click on this
project and say open folder in File
Explorer we can see a main CS a main
designer dot CS in a main dot Razak's
file ok these are the actual form files
and they're all renamed to be made
instead of form one this just keeps your
project very clean so let's look over
here the toolbox if you do not have a
toolbox again you can go to view and
find a toolbox in the View menu
the toolbox has all the controls for
your form now if you're in a CS file
you'll notice the toolbox empties out
since there are no usable controls for a
code-behind file but if we go back to
our design view or form we can see we
have a number of different options in
the common controls this is where most
likely you will start and do most of
your form development it's from this
common controls tab I would recommend
keeping just this open it keeps things a
whole lot simpler notice if we open up
the all windows forms we get a very long
list of possible items to put onto our
form which makes it very difficult to
find exactly what you're looking for
so again common controls today since
this is an introduction to windows forms
we're gonna look at a few basic controls
first the label if we click and drag on
our form we get label 1 if we select
that label go to our properties you'll
notice up here at the top in parentheses
we have name this is the instance name
for our label so let's call way
something more significant like first
name label ok and again mouse off that
it still says label 1 but again that's
because this is our instance name not
the text of the label down here on our
text we can say first name and they will
put : after that ok so let's do that
again and create another label this time
for last name so again we name the text
to be last name : and we scroll hip to
the top and rename the instance name to
be last name label for consistency say
it's good if you would keep the name
convention consistent so that later when
you're working with these labels
and text boxes and other things you know
exactly what it is so for example first
name would not be an appropriate label
name because we probably have a first
name text box that we'll be using
okay now you notice these are a little
bit off okay the last thing is a little
bit indented from the first name well to
fix that select the last name and start
to move it you see as guides that pop up
these guides help you figure out how to
line up the controls easily you can snap
right to underneath or you can move down
but notice that blue line indicates I'm
aligning like first character so now
first name and last name are aligned at
the start I could also align at the end
if I'd like instead in this case at the
start is fine and I will play around
till I get that kind of where I want it
now let's go ahead and drag and drop our
text boxes this is where we'll allow the
user to actually type in information I
click and drag and I can rename the
instance nano text box to be something
more significant like first name entry
and let's go ahead and do that again for
the last name text box last name entry
and now we try and line this up with our
labels so see here as pink line is
saying at the bottom of the text of my
label will be at the same height as the
bottom of the text inside my text box
and that's what we probably want I'll do
the same thing for the first name and
now we have an evenly spaced and yet
uniform first and last name
let's go ahead and throw on one more
control throw a button on and we'll just
drag that around put somewhere like
there let's go ahead and change the
instance Nia's button to be process
button and again it still says button 1
because that's the text of the button
not the instance name let's scroll down
here to text and change this to be
process and put an ellipsis after it
there we go so now we have developed a
simple form okay if we run this you'll
see it doesn't really do much okay it's
still the resize it just fine we can cut
it off we want if we click the button
notice the first of all the mouse
highlights over and it turns blue we
click it we get a little darker blue let
go and it comes back the blade or blue
but nothing really happens and if we
type in our text boxes we get some nice
text it's a line at the bottom but it's
pretty basic let's go ahead and change a
few things here first let's make these
bold well if we select the item and
actually can select both by holding ctrl
key and selecting the other item now we
have two selected over here our
properties know a certain properties
have gone away because they are unique
to the specific item and cannot be group
changed for example our instance name we
can't have two items with the same
instance name therefore it is not
allowed to change both at the same time
but we can't go down here to font click
on the font box anywhere and then click
the ellipsis
when this dialog pops up we'll have a
full control over what font what font
style and what size the font to have
that box we can also change the effects
like strike out and underline for this
case let's just go ahead and make these
bolt okay okay
and now our first and last names are
bolt go ahead do the same thing with our
button so I select my button go over to
font click the ellipsis and select bolt
hit OK and there we go now maybe you're
saying you know what eight point two
five point font seems a little small I
want something a bit bigger we could
change each individual control or we can
select the form itself and select font
let's go ahead and change this to a
12-point font now keep an eye on this
form over here when I hit OK notice the
form got bigger but we still have an
eight point two five point font here if
we select this over here we have a
12-point font so what's the difference
well we've already changed something in
the font in this case we change it to
bolt therefore the universal changes
will not overwrite that font setting
because we've specified specifically
what we want therefore we have to change
it to be a larger size let's go ahead
and do that by selecting the first one
holding down control select in a second
let's go ahead and slide the button as
well now again only the things that are
in common with all three items will be
shown in its properties list and font is
one of those choices go back over here
and select 12-point font
okay and now we have 12-point font for
all we can change the size of our form
and we can go ahead and change how the
highlighting works or how it the items
are aligned and that
