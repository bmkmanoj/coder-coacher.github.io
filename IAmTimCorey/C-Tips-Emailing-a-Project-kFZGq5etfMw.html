Visual Studio and you want to share that
application with someone real quick
and you don't have the application
inside source control we can just give
them a a link into your repository
sharing can be a bit difficult there's
not a simple straightforward way of
doing things for example if you were to
zip up the entire application and try to
email to somebody the email servers
would most likely reject it and the
reason why is because you have dll's and
exe s inside of your zip file so I'm
going to show you a couple different
ways to clean those out and allow you to
easily share your application with
somebody else via email now here I have
a sample project the same project has a
few different projects inside of it a
console application a class library and
a asp.net MVC application and these are
just demos so if we right click on the
solution there's this open folder in
File Explorer this will take us right to
where we need to be it will open up in
this folder right here
so here I've already opened up this
folder in the example app which is our
solution name and here's our solution
this is important that you include this
estulin file and all the folders inside
here except the packages folder okay so
when you want to show your application
with someone the first thing you need to
make sure you do is include everything
for example if you just include the SLN
file you won't give them anything they
can work with okay you can include the
SLM file in all the folders that go
along with that except for the packages
folder and the reason I said except for
the packages folder is because inside of
here you have all the packages that are
included inside of your project now if
you don't have a packages folder don't
worry
Bettis means you're not using nougat
but inside of these folders everyone
then will have some sort of DLL and
that'd be a problem for emailing the
nice thing is Visual Studio will rebuild
this packages folder for you in the
newer versions in 2012 and before I
believe you have to turn on nougat
package restore alright so in order to
send this to someone I'd select all my
folders and files in the same directory
as the SLN file I exclude the packages
folder and then I right-click and say
send to compressed zipped folder I've
got a zip it all up I'll leave it as
example app now I'm not done yet
and the reason not done yet is because
we have to open this up and then inside
of each of our folders they have to open
them up and delete both the bin and the
obj folders I right-click and save
delete I go back up one level I go like
next one I slice both the Bene obj
folder and I say delete I go up one
level good my asp.net net MVC app and
there is a bin and obj folder go ahead
and delete both of those these are
temporary files and compiled files that
get rebuilt every time Visual Studio
compiles therefore they're not necessary
for setting to your your friend or
co-worker whoever you're emailing things
too because once they hit the build menu
and say build this project it will
recreate that folder and all the files
inside come back out and now the zip
file is ready to email to any 21 ok so
that's one way to zip up all of our
projects and solutions into ones that
file we can email safely now there is
another method we can use and that's if
we go to this website
Visual Studio Gallery msdn.microsoft.com
you can either copy this long
complicated string or you can search for
clean project this is a an add-in that
is no longer being updated but it still
works fairly well and what this does it
will download an MSI file you run the
MSI file and install it I've gone ahead
and install it on my machine and so if I
come to this folder the example app
folder and I go up one level so this is
the folder that contains both my
solution and all of my project files if
I right-click on that I now has option
called clean remove source bindings and
zip solution this does a similar action
to what we just did
only in one step and there you go was
telling you as it cleaned up your
application and it created a zip file we
see the example app zip we open this up
you'll notice we have loops we have that
zip file from before we can go ahead and
delete that we don't need that in their
zip file we have our console UI let's
open that up real quick
notice no bin or obj folders same thing
for example library and finally for the
web front-end no banner obj folders
that's great the only thing it missed
was a fact that include the packages
folder so we need to go ahead and delete
that once that gets deleted this is if
file 2 is ready to deploy just to show
that this does work let's go ahead and
extract this hey say well hit extract
all and we'll say let's extract it to
example app 2
okay let's go back to the visual studio
we're gonna say file open project
resolution and say example app 2 example
app SLN alright looks very similar to we
have you for but if we go back over to
our folder notice there is no packages
folder but let's go ahead and watch what
happens go ahead and move it around
let's watch what happens to this folder
when we hit the build button build
solution notice the nougat package
manager is point out of packages and
there they are now the build succeeded
to come back over to console UI we now
have a bin folder and obj folder and the
same is true for the example library and
for the web front-end so those are two
different methods to zip up your
solution so you can send it to a
colleague or friend the key things
remember or you have to start in the
solutions folder if you want to do it
yourself make sure you get your solution
and all of the folders underneath it
except for the packages folder and then
you clean out the bin and obj folders if
you're going to do it using the clean
product tool you have to go up one more
level and right click on the folder that
contains your solution once you do that
you need to delete that packages folder
inside of that file either way your zip
file is now ready to send
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
