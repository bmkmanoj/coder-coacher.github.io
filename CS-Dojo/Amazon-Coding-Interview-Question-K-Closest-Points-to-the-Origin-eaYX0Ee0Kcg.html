Amazon we have an array of two posts or
an array of arrays of two items each
this represents points on a
two-dimensional space so for example
this first item - 2 4 represents this
point right here because the
x-coordinate of this point is minus 2
and the y coordinate of this point is 4
and the problem is this given these
points how would you find that K closest
points to the origin and of course the
origin is at 0 0 so for example if the
given K is 2 how would you find the two
closest points to the origin out of
these points the two closest points here
are minus 1 0 and 0 minus 2 so you
should be able to print these points and
try solving this problem in a more
general way to practice pause the video
right here and think about how you would
solve the problem and then come back to
the video the first natural step for
solving this problem is to find the
distance to each point from the origin
and of course we can use the Pythagorean
theorem to do that so to find the
distance to for example at this point
minus 2 4 we can just find the value of
square root of minus 2 squared plus 4
squared which is equal to square root of
4 plus 16 which is square root of 20 so
that's the distance from the origin to
minus 2 4 and we can go through the same
procedure for every other point to find
the distance for every other point as
well and after that you can just
construct a new array with objects
containing the coordinates of each point
as well as the distance to each point
from the origin and this new array might
look like this I'm calling this new
array points with D as in points with
distance and the first object of this
new array will correspond to the first
item in the original array with the
coordinate
- - for and with this s square root of
20 of course and we're going to have the
same type of object for every other
point in the original points so the
length of points with T the new array
will be the same as the length of the
original array points and you can use
dictionaries or hash tables to store
this information instead of using
objects as well once you have this array
all you need to do is you just need to
find the K objects or the K points with
the shortest distance so at this point
this problem is actually equivalent to
the problem of finding the K smallest
elements in a given array of numbers for
example if the given array is this array
of integers and if the given K is 3 we
want to be able to find the three
smallest items out of this array which
are 1 2 and there are right here now
there are a few different approaches for
solving this problem the simplest
approach is the one in which you sort
this array in an ascending order so that
the smallest items come first and out of
the sorted array take the K first items
and that approach would take Big O of n
log N in time if you use for example
quick sort or merge sort another
approach is using a variation of
something called selection sort and I'm
not going to go into detail here in this
video but this approach would take big
off and K in time now my personal
favorite approach is the one in which we
use a max-heap and this one would take
big of k plus n minus k times log k in
time let me explain how it works first
of all let's quickly go over what a heap
is in a sentence it is an efficient way
to keep track of the largest value in
the given collection of numbers suppose
as an example you're given these three
numbers 4 1 &amp;amp; 5 if you construct a
max-heap with these three numbers you
can sort of visualize it as a bag or a
box of the
three numbers and however many numbers
you have in the max-heap retrieving the
largest number out of it is very
efficient in fact asking the heap what
the largest number is without modifying
the heap so just examining what the
number is
without retrieving the number itself
will be done in Big O of one in time now
there are a few other operations we're
going to use on a heap for this
particular problem the first one is
create creating a heap a max-heap with K
items takes Big O of K in time the
second operation is replace so for
example if we want to replace the
current largest number in the given heap
this one with a new number three then
this heap will be rearranged so that the
current largest number will be four and
they will have one and three below it
this operation takes Big O of log of K
where K is the number of items in heap
and the third operation is print off
this print all the items in the given
heap in the order that's not necessarily
sorted so for example this operation on
this particular heap might print four
one and three and this operation takes
Big O of K in time now how can we use a
max-heap and those operations on it to
find the K smallest items in a given
array of numbers let's consider this
array of numbers a game and let's say we
want to find the three smallest items
then the first step will be to construct
a max-heap with the first K items or
with the first three items after that
for each item in the remainder of the
array ask ourselves is this number
smaller than the current largest number
in the heap if it is smaller then
replace it with a lakh current largest
number so when we are examining this
number right here to the heap will look
like this
and the current largest number has
become four and when we're examining
this number three four will be replaced
wait three we're going to keep going
like that and when we're examining this
number ten because this is not smaller
than the current largest number in the
max-heap we'll just ignore that number
and at the end of this process just
print all items from this heap and we're
done we have the K smallest items from
the given array now let's quickly recap
our entire strategy using pseudocode
we're going to define our function
closests which takes the given points
and K for finding the K closest points
to the origin and from this function
we're not going to return anything but
we're going to print the K closest point
and in this function first of all using
points create points with D for points
with distance an array of objects
containing the coordinates as well as
the distance to each point from the
origin after that using points with D
the array of objects create a max-heap
with the first K items and use the
distance as the key when we create a
max-heap let's just call this max heap
MH after that run a for loop for each
point in the remainder of the array and
if this points distance is less than the
current max of MH
then replace mah is current max with P
and once we're done with this for loop
then just print all points in image and
we're done now what about time
complexity let's think about it line by
line the first line here using points
creating points with D takes Big O of n
because we go through this array only
once and creating a max-heap with K
items as we discussed earlier takes Big
O of K in time and here we're running n
minus K loops in each loop replacing M H
is current
point with P takes Big O of log of K and
so the runtime for this entire four loop
will be big-oh of n minus K times log K
in the worst case scenario after that
printing all points in image will take
Big O of K in time so adding them all up
Big O of n plus big of K plus Big O of n
minus K times log of K Plus speak of K
we're going to have Big O of n plus n
minus K times log K and that would be
the runtime for this entire solution ok
thanks a lot for watching this video if
you liked this video I would also
recommend my course on udemy you have an
essential coding interview questions in
which I cover eleven of the most
essential coding interview questions to
master with coding exercises in Python
and Java in case you're interested in
taking the course I put a discount code
