to use dictionaries in Python you can
think of a dictionary in Python as sort
of like a lookup table just as an
example let's say you have this table of
information this table indicates that
George is 24 years old
tom is 32 years old and Jenny is 16 or
in general there's the value of 24 with
the key George the string and the value
that's associated with the key Tom the
string is 32 these are sometimes called
key value pairs because we have a bunch
of keys and a value associated with each
of those keys and you can use a
dictionary to store this kind of
information so let's see how we can do
that in Python code to create a new
dictionary you can write the following D
equals curly brackets and when you run
this cell this defines a new dictionary
that's empty so it doesn't have any keys
or values yet and it assigns that
dictionary to the new variable D another
way to write the same thing is to write
D equals dict parentheses and it would
do exactly the same thing but let's go
with curly brackets for now and actually
you could also write this so that it has
some predefined keys and values as well
so for that you can write D equals curly
brackets double quotes George : 24 comma
double quotes Tom : 32 and this defines
a new dictionary with the value 24
that's associated with the key George
and the value is 32 that's associated
with the key Tom but let's go with the
first one for now to define an empty
dictionary after defining an empty
dictionary you can add a key value pair
like so these square brackets double
quotes George equals 24 this says add a
new key value pair where the key is
George and the value is 24 we can
more pairs by writing for example D
square brackets double quotes tom equals
32 and the square brackets Jenny
equals 16 and now this dictionary has
the three key value pairs and to find a
value that's associated with a certain
key for example George
you can just write print the square
brackets George and this will print out
the value that's associated with the
value George and then of course if you
want to print out the value that's
associated with the key Tom you can just
write print these square brackets Tom
and then it will print out 32 and if you
try to look up a key that doesn't exist
yet it's gonna give us an error for
example if you do the scar brackets
Alice it gives us this key error because
the key Alice doesn't exist yet now as
we saw the value that associated with
Jenny was 16 but it's possible to change
the value that's associated with a
certain key after we already have that
key value pair in the dictionary we can
do that with just like before the square
brackets Jenny
equals 20 and once we run this cell now
the value that's associated with Jenny
is 20 now one thing to note here is that
the values can be any type but the keys
can only be certain types and there are
different types we can use for that but
most commonly keys are strings or
numbers and in Python you can even mix
different types of keys so for example
you can add a new key let's say 10 with
the value 102 this dictionary D with D
square brackets 10 equals 100 and once
we write print parentheses the square
brackets 10 it works just fine
retrieving the value 100 now what if we
want it to iterate over key value pairs
in the given dictionary for example this
one D
let's pretend for a second that we don't
know how to do that and of course if we
don't know how to do something like that
the first thing we should do is we
should just use Google and I'm gonna
show you how I would go about it and for
that I might write something like how to
iterate over key value pairs dictionary
Python let's take a look at the first
result
this one right here from Stack Overflow
and just be careful because this one is
a little bit old
it's from 2010 but it might be okay and
you can see that this question is about
a dictionary and then a for loop here so
I would just skim through this page and
then I would try to find what I'm
looking for which is something about
Python 3 probably so it says for Python
3 points X we're using Python 3 by the
way it looks like we might be able to
use four key comma value in d items and
it looks like this D is the dictionary
so let's see if it works by copying this
over here and let's try print key and
then key without the double quotes and
then the same thing with the value it's
a print value and then value and once we
run this cell we see key is George and
then the value that's associated with it
is 24 and to make this look a little
nicer let's add colons here and let's
add an empty line here by adding an
empty string here with the print
function and when we run this cell again
it looks much nicer so value is 24 for
the key George and the value that's
associated with Tom is 32 Jennie 20 and
the value that's associated with the key
10 is 100 so it looks like this method
works okay and that's the basics of how
to use dictionaries in Python and
actually the ability to use Google just
like I did
to find what you're looking for when you
don't know how to do certain tasks is an
important skill to have as a software
developer as I talked about it in my
last video so that's definitely
something I would cultivate over time if
you're just getting started with
programming anyway I will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
