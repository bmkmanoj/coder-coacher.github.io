software developer / software engineer
for a little over a year but my major
and my university wasn't computer
science or Computer Engineering
it was statistics so how was I able to
get this job without a computer science
degree I'm going to explain the process
I personally used step by step so here I
present the six steps I personally used
for getting a job at Google as a
software engineer step one I took a few
programming courses during my summer
break and that gave me enough technical
basis to start learning on my own after
that these courses were on programming
basics and data structures and
algorithms and they were taught using
Java step 2 I worked on a few personal
projects first of all I used the website
called project Euler to work on my
programming fundamentals then my first
real personal project after that was
going to be like the reddit of Japan
because nothing like ready existed in
Japan at the time so I built a simple
prototype using a language called Ruby
and it worked but in the end I was
actually too afraid to release it maybe
I was too shy but still I enjoyed the
process a lot and I enjoyed learning a
new programming language on my own too
step 3 thanks to my personal project I
eventually landed my first technical
internship it was at a tiny tiny
start-up in Tokyo and it was as a
software engineering intern I think I
was able to get that job
partly because I had demonstrated
without reddit in Japan project that I
was able to build stuff with Ruby and
something called Ruby on Rails and step
forth again more experience in the tech
industry with a few more internships
this time actually at Microsoft
these internships were in something
called data science and product
management as I explained in a previous
video I was able to get these
internships thanks to the combination of
my statistics background my first
technical internship as a software
engineer and a few more personal project
I worked on after the one I mentioned
earlier step 5
I prepared myself for software
engineering interviews I used resources
like cracking the coding interview and
lead code I'm going to put links to
those resources below in case you're
interested but I found that the most
helpful thing I did by far for preparing
for software engineer interviews was
doing mock interviews with my friends
practicing with my friends was a really
good practice for me so I'd be less
nervous in the actual interview and
actually when I gave mock interviews to
my friends as if I'm the interviewer
that was really helpful to giving a mock
interview to my friends helped me
understand what it feels like to be in
the interviewers shoes and I think it's
really really important and this is a
point that's often overlooked the reason
why it's so important is because at the
end of the day your job interview
whether it's technical or non-technical
it's just a form of a communication and
just like in any other form of
communication it's crucial that you
understand the other person's
perspective in this case the individuals
perspective not just yours and step 6 I
applied and actually I kept applying as
I mentioned in a previous video I
applied to Google at least five times
over the course of two years or so and
in the end I had five separate
interviews for five different positions
at Google and I got rejected the first
four times so I only got through the
last one but the first four interviews I
did they're never gonna be on my resume
so nobody really cares that I failed
four times at this point all right those
are the six steps but there's something
else I want to tell you whether you're
applying for a job trying to start a
business or looking for a girlfriend or
boyfriend when you go for something you
really want this whole process can be
really hard and it's actually really
discouraging for most people so it's
almost inevitable for you to keep
getting rejected by your potential
employers or by your potential
girlfriends or boyfriends and if you're
trying to start a business it's also
very common for your business idea is to
keep failing one after another but at
the end of the day nobody cares about
the things that didn't work out
none of those rejections are not gonna
be on your resume so nobody will care
about them the only thing that matters
is what you get in the end so if you're
in a process like that right now if
you're going for something you really
want maybe it's hard maybe you get
discouraged sometimes but keep going
because eventually you get there if you
don't give up okay that's all I have for

this like this video and subscribe for
more and if you have any requests about
what kind of videos I should make in the
future let me know in the comment
section below as well and I'll see you
