is Mikey and I'm your host and today
we're going to talk about the top five
programming languages to learn for
getting a job at companies like Google
Facebook Microsoft etc so the obvious
question here might be doesn't really
matter which languages you learn if
you're trying to get a job at one of
these companies my answer would be yes
it does but not directly what I mean by
that is when you have a job interview
with one of these companies as a
software engineer candidate the most
important thing they'll usually look for
is not what specific language or
technology you've been using instead
they tend to look for mostly your coding
skills your problem-solving ability and
your data structures and algorithms
knowledge so you might say wait why k so
it doesn't really matter which languages
I learned them my answer to that would
be actually it still matters a lot I'm
going to explain my reasoning behind
that in this video but if you just want
to find my lists just keep over to this
time in this video okay so if these
large companies don't care that much
about which languages you know then why
does it matter at all which languages
you learn if you want to get a job at
one of these companies there are three
reasons for this reason number one when
you apply for a job at one of these big
companies how do you think they will
decide if they should invite you for a
job interview of course there are a few
different aspects to this for example
your education your personal projects
and so on but the biggest factor is
usually your work experience and how do
you get the experience in the first
place probably at smaller less known
companies first and actually smaller
companies and startups tend to care more
about which specific language or
technology you know so for example a
small start-up might say we need someone
who can help us create an iOS app
tomorrow or we need someone who knows
JavaScript really well by next month so
depending on which languages you know
it'll actually be easier or harder for
you to get a job at one of these smaller
companies and reason number two I think
you should learn a programming language
that aligns with your interests so you
have more
duration and reason for learning so for
example if you're interested in learning
to make an iPhone app you should
probably learn Swift and if you're
interested in data science machine
learning or science in general
Python might be a good choice for you
reason number three some programming
languages or simply easier to learn than
some other ones for example I would say
JavaScript is easier to learn than Java
and Python is easier to learn than C++
so based on that I decided to use the
job market and ease of learning as the
two main criteria for making my list of
top 5 programming languages to learn ok
so here's my list number 5 Ruby Ruby is
a programming language from Japan it
became popular due to the popularity of
something called Ruby on Rails and Ruby
on Rails was at some point I would say
the hardest framework for building
websites although it's not as popular as
it used to be anymore
still a lot of companies use Ruby on
Rails today and Ruby is a really simple
and easy language to learn number four
swift Swift is now the primary language
for building an iOS app whether it's for
iPhone or iPad if you have the skill it
should be fairly easy for you to get a
job since many companies want to build
iOS apps I haven't used this language
extensively myself but it seems like a
fairly simple and easy language to learn
the only downside of Swift is that it's
not really cross-platform meaning it's
not easy to create an iOS app with Swift
if you don't have a Mac number three
Java Java is probably one of the most
widely used programming languages today
you can use Java to build many things
including Android apps many companies
use Java frameworks to create websites
as well unfortunately it's not the
easiest language to learn since it's a
bit more complex than the other
languages in this list number two Python
Python is also a very popular
programming language at least in North
America and many companies use it to
create websites with frameworks like
Django and flask this is probably the
language of your choice if you're
interested in
things like data science machine
learning or science in general it's also
one of the main languages used at Google
so it's popular at both large companies
and smaller companies and number one
javascript javascript used to be a
language that only ran on your browser
whether it's Chrome Firefox or Safari
but recently people started using it to
create back-end code meaning the code
that runs on your servers not just
front-end code meaning the code that
runs on your device whether it's a phone
or a laptop javascript is a great
language to learn for getting a job and
it's also fairly simple and easy to
learn now if you're just getting started
with programming I'd recommend that you
start with either Python or JavaScript
and I think your optimal choice here
mostly depends on your interests for
example if you're interested in UI or
user experience design then JavaScript
is probably the way to go if you're more
into logic machine learning or science
in general python might be the right
choice for you now I have three more
languages for honorable mentions but I
have a quick announcement to make
I've just launched my patreon page where
you can chip in a few dollars to join a
private Facebook group and a private
monthly live stream where you can ask me
any questions I'd much appreciate it if
you can head over to CS dojo dot io / PT
to support my channel so here's my
honorable mention number one go which is
also known as go lang this language was
originally developed at Google but it's
used extensively in many companies today
go is known for its efficiency and it's
simple syntax and it's actually becoming
one of the most popular programming
languages today so if you're looking to
add a language to your skill set this is
the first language I'd definitely
consider honorable mention number two
Courtland Courtland is a relatively new
language and it works in both a Java
based environment and a JavaScript based
environment Kotlin was recently
officially supported by Android so it's
possible that Colin will become the
primary language for developing Android
apps in the future honorable mention
number three Seco with
some people pronounce as SQL if you
search for what programming language to
learn you might run across on an article
or two that mention sequel but if you're
beginner it might be confusing because
Seco is different from all the other
languages that we talked about in this
video
Seco or SQL is a programming language
that solely focused on managing
databases it's usually used in
conjunction with one of the other
languages so learning Seco as your first
programming language is probably not the
best idea and in my opinion it's not
that easy to learn Seco without having
some real-life data to play with so I'd
focus on learning other languages first
okay that's all I have for this video
thanks as always for watching and again
I'd much appreciate it if you can head
over to my patreon page right here to
support CS dojo and let me know in the
comment below if you have any requests
about what kind of videos I should make
in the future and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
