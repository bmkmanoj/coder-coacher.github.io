introduce you to the three
problem-solving techniques I've
personally used to get the recording
interviews with companies such as Google
and also to be a better software
developer in general the first tip I
want to give you is to think on paper
when I say think on paper
I don't literally mean when you get a
coding interview problem take out a
piece of paper out of your pocket or
whatever and start writing down your
thoughts right there this is more about
how you think about the problem and not
about using physical paper per se so to
see what I mean exactly let's take a
look at one example of this suppose
you're given this problem in which
you're supposed to write a function that
takes an array of integers and finds two
integers out of that array that multiply
to 20 together so with this example with
this given array you can see that 4 &amp;amp; 5
here multiply to 20 together so that's
the pair you need to find when a typical
candidate is given this problem they
might start writing some code right away
to solve this problem but that's not
necessarily the right thing to do before
you start coding you want to make sure
that you have the right solution in
concept one way to do this is ask
yourself how would I solve this problem
on paper so imagine writing down this
array on a piece of paper then you're
trying to find a pair of numbers that
add up to that multiply to 20 in this
array again I don't mean that you need
to write this down on a piece of paper
literally but I think this is a good way
to think about this problem without
going into too much implementation
detail at the beginning then you might
say for example well I can look at each
item and ask myself for example for two
at the top is there number 10 in this
array so check these numbers one by one
and check if any of them is 10 and the
answer is no so let's go to the next
number look at number four here and ask
myself is there number five here because
four and five would multiply to 20
together and then week
check these numbers now and once we get
to five we'll just return this pair of
numbers four and five and we're done so
this is one potential solution to this
problem and this way you can explain it
without using any computer science and
this is how you can come up with a
solution without going into too much
implementation detail you might also ask
yourself what if you had an array which
is much longer than this one you might
have for example
1,000 items in this array then the
previous solution of checking every
potential pair of numbers to see if they
multiply to twenty would be a lot of
work so ask yourself again how would I
solve this problem on paper you can
imagine a very long piece of paper with
a thousand numbers what I would do for
this problem is I would write down each
number I see
by going to these numbers one by one on
a separate piece of paper so when we see
two right down to right here and when we
see four right down four and so on and
whenever we see a new number for example
five right here
I would ask myself what's the number
that would multiply to 20 with five the
answer is of course four so we can
instead of going through this whole
array we can just check this separate
piece of paper and ask myself is there
four already or have we already seen the
number four the answer is yes so we can
just return four and five from this
function and we're done this way with
this solution we don't have to check
every single potential pair in this
array to see if they multiply to twenty
once you have this basic strategy down
which you can use on paper you can then
translate this into data structures and
algorithms using your computer science
knowledge with this solution a good data
structure to use to keep track of each
number we've seen might be a hash table
or dictionary for example to recap the
idea of this
Josie is to think about how to solve the
given problem in concept first or on
paper first then think about how to
translate this into data structures and
algorithms using your computer science
knowledge I would even say you shouldn't
start coding until you go through this
whole process first unless the problem
is so easy that you're fairly certain
that your solution is correct and
optimal right away now this is actually
something I used for my daily work as a
software developer at Google to whenever
I had a complicated problem to solve
I would first take out a piece of paper
and think about it on paper this time
literally on a physical piece of paper
and then I would consider multiple
solutions and make sure that I knew how
to solve the problem first before I
actually put it in code so this is a
technique that's not only useful for
coding interviews but also to be a
better software developer in general -
ok guys thanks so much for watching this
video this video was actually an excerpt
from my brand new course on udemy 11
essential coding interview questions in
which I cover 11 of the most essential
coding interview questions to master for
your next coding interview if you're
interested in taking this course there
is a link with a discount code glow in
the description alright I'll see you
