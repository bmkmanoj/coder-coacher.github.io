should you learn first my short answer
would be pick either Python or
JavaScript and throughout this video I'm
gonna explain why I picked those two
particular languages and I'm gonna walk
you through the process for picking the
right first language for yourself for
your particular situation and
preferences so as you pick the first
language for yourself one thing to keep
in mind is that once you know one
language whether it's Sybil's plus Java
or anything else as long as you know one
it's gonna be much easier to learn any
additional languages because all
programming languages are sort of
related and similar so I would say if
you already started learning one
language and if you like what you're
learning just keep going with that other
than that there are three points you
should consider as you pick the right
first language for yourself number one
the job market actually the job market
is a tricky point to consider because it
highly depends on your location and the
industry you want to get into so for
example if you want to get into a
start-up in San Francisco good languages
to learn might be JavaScript NGO or
Python and if you're interested in going
into gaming or banking a better option
might be c-sharp or C++ so I would say
just take a look at the job postings of
the kinds of jobs you're interested in
on websites like LinkedIn and indeed
calm and just look at what their
requirements are now the second point to
consider is what you want to build and
I'm just gonna give you a quick list
here if you want to build I Oh s apps so
whether iPhone apps or iPad apps I would
go with Swift and if you want to build
Android apps I would go with Java first
and then maybe call in after that if you
want to build websites I would get
started with JavaScript HTML and CSS
first and if you're into debt analysis
engineering science or machine learning
I would get started with Python R or
MATLAB and if you want to game the
moment I would go with C sharp or C++ so
as you can see there are a lot of
different options here depending on what
you want to build and the third point to
consider is the ease of learning like I
say in one of my previous videos
I would say Python is easier to learn
than C++ or C and JavaScript is easier
to learn than Java
so what programming language should you
learn first well it highly depends on
your particular situation but I would
say in general try to find something
that fulfills all of these three
criteria so ideally find something
that's in demand in the job market lets
you build something you want to build
and is relatively easy to learn and that
actually brings us to python and
javascript and that's because they're
both relatively easy to learn and they
both tend to be in demand in the job
market as well so which one of these
programming languages should you learn
first that actually depends on what you
want to build so if you're more
interested in the logic side of things
than visuals then I would say go with
Python Python is often used to build
server-side code or back-end code of
websites which is basically the code
that runs on your servers many companies
also use Python for their analysis data
science and machine learning purposes
for example when I was working at Google
I used Python to visualize and analyze
some data there so if you're interested
in building websites instead I would
first go with JavaScript and if you go
with JavaScript first learn HTML and CSS
so the way it works is HTML and CSS
determine where your webpages look like
and JavaScript allows you to add
functionality to those webpages for
example you can add a piece of
functionality that says when I click
this button right here it's going to
change the color of this other button
right there and you can see all of that
HTML CSS and JavaScript as a set of code
that runs on your device or on your
browser and that's called a front-end
code and that alone the front-end code
alone is actually not enough to make a
complete website for example something
like Facebook because when you go to
facebook.com Facebook needs to know who
your friends are and that information is
not stored on your device or on your
browser it's stored somewhere
Facebook's server so you need code that
runs on Facebook's server or your own
website server and that's called
back-end code which I mentioned earlier
as opposed to front-end code and to make
back-end code developers use something
else for example nodejs which is based
on JavaScript or Django or flask which
are something called web frameworks that
are based on Python so actually to make
a complete website you need to learn a
lot of things HTML CSS and JavaScript as
well as at least one web framework but I
would say just start with HTML CSS and
JavaScript if you're interested in
building a website okay if you're
interested in learning Python
I'd recommend my Python tutorials for
absolute beginners right there and if
you want to see my top 5 language
recommendation you can see my video
about that right there and if you're new
