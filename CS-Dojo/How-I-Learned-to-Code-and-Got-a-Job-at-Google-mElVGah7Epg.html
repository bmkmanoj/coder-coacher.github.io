previous video I didn't study computer
science or Computer Engineering as my
measure at my university instead I was
studying statistics but on the side I
learned to code mostly on my own and
eventually I became good enough to get a
job at Google as a full-time software
engineer so I briefly talked about how I
learned to code in the same video but in
this video I wanted to go into more
detail so I'm gonna talk about my
personal experience first about how I
learned to code but if you just want to
find my recommendation about what you
should do you should just skip over to
this time in this video so here are the
4 steps I personally used to learn to
code first of all I took a few summer
courses during my summer break so the
first course I took was an introductory
programming course it covered topics
like loops variables if statements and
functions and then the second course I
took was on data structures and
algorithms it covered topics like trees
graphs hash tables and searching and
sorting these two courses were both
taught using Java after I took those
courses I decided to learn more on my
own I heard that you can use something
called Ruby on Rails to build websites
and I wanted to build a website so I
decided to learn Ruby on Rails and Ruby
which Ruby on Rails is based on and to
learn Ruby I use the website called the
pragmatic programmer and to practice
using it I use this other website called
project Euler which gives you a ton of
simple programming problems to solve to
learn Ruby on Rails
I used rails for zombies which is an
interactive website for learning how to
use will be on Rails and step 3 I
started working on a bunch of personal
projects my first real personal project
was going to be like the reddit of Japan
partly because I'm originally from Japan
and I was living in Japan at the time
working on this project was really
helpful for understanding how Ruby on
Rails works how Ruby works and also how
web technologies in general work through
this project I also learned the
importance of asking for help you know
when you're new to programming it's so
easy for you to get stuck and I think
it's really important for you to just
ask for help you can do this virtually
through websites like Stack Overflow
Facebook groups or reddit or in person
if you know someone who knows how to
code in person and then using the skills
and connections I developed partly
through my projects I got a few
technical internships these technical
internships were really helpful for
developing my skills further because I
started getting feedback on my code from
my colleagues and I started learning a
lot more a lot faster than on my own in
between those internships and even when
I had one of those internships I kept
working on more personal projects that
was partly because it was just fun and
partly because I wanted to build more
skills and after all that I started
working on my technical interview skills
and eventually I got a job at Google as
a full-time software engineer so if
you're just getting started with
programming or if you're a complete
beginner what should you do exactly I'd
recommend the following four steps first
of all you should learn the basics of
programming - one of those interactive
websites I personally recommend code
Academy but I also heard that free code
camp is also pretty good if you're not
sure which language to get started with
I do recommend either Python or
JavaScript after that start working on a
personal project it could be a website
an app or automating a simple task as
you work on your project keep learning
more through those interactive websites
and for more advanced topics that those
websites don't cover I'd recommend
lynda.com and you to me step number
three as you work on your personal
project I think one important aspect
here is the community aspect if
programming is something that's totally
new for you it's probably gonna be
really hard and so it's really important
for you to be able to get help from
others through online or offline
communities so try using websites like
Stack Overflow meetup calm and Facebook
groups and events to find relevant
communities step number four try getting
an internship or a job ideally a paid
one once you do you should be able to
learn even more quickly because you'll
be able to get some feedback from your
colleagues on your code and those are
the four steps I would personally use to
learn to
today if you have extra time and money
to spare going through a coding bootcamp
or even getting a degree from a
university might also be a good option
okay if you're curious about a more
general strategy I used for getting a
job at Google there's a video about that
and if you're wondering which
programming languages you should learn I
have a video about that too and let me
know in the comments section below about
what kind of videos I should make in the
future I'm YK from CS dojo and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
