software developer for about a year and
when I was there some people said to me
wow you're working at Google
you must be so smart and I would say
yeah I must be jokes aside I don't think
it's your smartness or your intelligence
that matters the most when it comes to
getting a job at a company like Google I
believe being persistent and being
willing to try and fail in the first
place are much much more important the
first time I applied for a job there was
when I was in my third year in
university it was for the software
developer intern position in Tokyo I
didn't think I was good enough for the
job but I applied anyway I mean I wasn't
even studying computer science I was
studying statistics so I thought how
could I possibly compete with other
candidates who were studying computer
science
two months later though I got an
interview with them I was really happy
and excited when I got that interview
but eventually I got rejected since then
over the course of two years or so I
applied for four more positions at
Google and I got rejected three more
times the last time I tried though the
fifth time I tried they finally accepted
me and I started working as a software
developer in Montreal Canada now think
about that one company you really want
to work for do you think you're good
enough for them if you don't think
you're good enough for them who cares
really I would say why don't you just
try anyway if you're lucky you might
just get an interview with them even if
you don't get an offer in the end it's
still a good practice for going through
job interviews and of course in the
future you can try again
again and again all right go back guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
