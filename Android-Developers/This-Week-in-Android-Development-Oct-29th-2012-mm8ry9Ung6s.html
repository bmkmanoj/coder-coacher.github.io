interesting things happened in Android

episode of some of our oldest shows our
weekly Android developer office hours

Android design in action will continue

turning our attention to more technical
depth within and i helping to explain

goal is to help create a collection of
awesome apps that we're calling pure
android check out the video for more
details on what we've got planned and if

Trello board and vote on the apps and
