friday's app clinic we once again tried
to review video play apps cynics player
MX player and dice player sadly the
sheer overwhelming anticipation of this
long-awaited broadcast resulted in an
unprecedented demand from viewers tuning
in live which may or may not have caused
YouTube service to spontaneously combust

greatest ever live performance that we
realized that not only had we not been
broadcasting we hadn't been recording
either determined never to be defeated
we will be trying this one more time

bonus time of 1130 a.m. pacific time

repeated failures Nick Roman and Adam
