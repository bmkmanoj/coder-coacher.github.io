Eric we're a ad company from Gothenburg
Sweden we're relief a nap about two
years ago called force of football it's
a football consum consumption app you
can follow your favorite teams and
leagues and all over the world so this
is my small agenda I'm going to go
through the challenges we had with our
design which we transition from and then
I'm going to show you some examples of
different views in our app before we
made the transition to material design
and after so here is our appt this is
about a year ago it's the match list so
you can see all the matches that you're
interested in is a very tailored
experience but right now it's quite
complex so a big part of this
translation to material design is to
overview so here it's a bit hard I think
to to find the Sherry's that you would
like to get out of this view it's quite
hard to like get a short glance of of
the small things and that was I think we
wanted to change the navigation is
really important in any app of course
but we have a lot of contents a lot of
data and information so getting to the
information that you seek it's really
really important so we wanted to get rid
of the hamburger we've had a side menu
for a long time and we felt we need to
refresh the navigation and make it's
flatter and more like easy to understand
like tap on what you want and then get
it immediately and yeah I touched on
content it's really important that the
content you care about pops up in your
eyes when you when you use that yeah so
here are different screens we had before
we did the redesign in the middle here
you see the team page
so I think it's quite hard to like if we
we made so many iterations of different
kind of design standards so you can see
a little bit of both we have a iOS style
toggle button which doesn't really fit I
think and we have different colors we
had some kind of accent color but we
didn't really know what that meant back
then and yeah also the league page here
with the flag and everything we wanted
more consistent experience and yeah so
this is what we came up with after the
redesign we do realize that this is a
work in progress like you're never done
which redesigning dev so yeah we can
always improve stuff but if we focus on
the match list we try to make each match
feel more important like football
consumers they care about results that
should be the focus here we try to
reduce the size of the try to make it a
more compact navigation the hamburger is
gone and yeah we just try to make
everything more like easy to understand
and not get in your way and also the
team pages on and the league pages right
now are like flying up and you can swipe
them away if you if you don't care
anymore so we have some paper analogy
going on there and the compressing of
the of the toolbar I could have a
animation here if I new google sheets
better but yeah you get the point I
think and we have pulled out some of the
key contents the key information about
every team so we create the card views
for all the things that we feel are
important but the the major parts of
course what the users think is important
so we need to test this iterates maybe
move some card views up and down but
it's it's as I said a work in progress
and we try to try to use tests as much
as possible we were just getting started
with a be testing and stuff like that
it's very new to us
but and yeah I really like what they're
doing at Google right now with the
design libraries and stuff for example
this sliding thing in a compression of
the toolbar I think I put two or three
months of my work at time on that but
now you can do it in like five lines of
code with the new design lips oh thank
you google but yeah too late for me yeah
that was it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
