play store filled with really awesome
kids and family apps those apps are part
of our design for families program and
for the past 12 months we've been
continuing to build on the suite of
features and services that we offer to
families across play and I wanted to
briefly recap some of our most recent
launches before we get into the meat of
the presentation so first of all we've
been working on refining our
understanding of parents as a user
segment and finding ways both big and
small to personalize their experiences
on google play and i'll just give you
one small example of this this is the
family category quick link that you're
seeing on the screen this is the little
green family button and we've made this
more visible for the parent user segment
by placing it front and center on the
Play homepage this small change resulted
in a really substantial uplift for
family apps on Google Play we've also
added on to our most popular feature for
families browsing by character in the
last 12 months since our launch we've
added another 34 beloved characters on
the Play Store globally including one
that I think everyone in the room will
recognize and this is angry birds of
course and character painted pages they
show up a curated collection of movies
TV shows apps and games books and even
music albums associated with the
character so I don't know if anyone here
is excited to see Angry Birds 2 movie in
a couple of days I know that my kids are
hard they've been watching the release
date pretty closely and when a believer
to the movie comes out on Google Play
you'll be able to find it all in one
place here on the character page and
we're making this page far more
discoverable through search through
featuring etc all across the Play Store
now beyond the store we've also been
spending more time thinking deeply about
how to offer families more premium
services and better support family
interactions across Android so last
December we launched the google play
music family plan this is a subscription
that gives up to six people in your
family unlimited music for just 14
ninety-nine a month now if you are
buying this separately for each family
member that would actually call it cost
you 60 bucks so it's actually a pretty
great value and we throw in YouTube red
on top of that so your whole family can
enjoy YouTube ads free so what you know
this is obviously here you guys are app
developers why am I talking to you about
this music plan now when you lift up the
hood there's something really important
going on here that's relevant for out
developer communities and that's when
you actually get into these premium
services you need to create a family
group so we start understanding who's in
your family and the eligibility for
these types of family services are
anchored around a shared family payment
method now this really opens up some
interesting possibilities in terms of
interactions around payments on Google
as we all know it's really difficult to
get users to put their credit card down
and a lot of our audience you know
children and younger audiences they
don't necessarily have access to credit
or you know the existing options
wouldn't have been particularly secure
for them so with the family payment
method family members can buy almost
anything on google play including paid
apps in-app purchases and other kinds of
digital content so how does that work
exactly and this is something that's
live you could test it out yourself
let's take a closer look at this
scenario imagine my teenager is playing
transformers RESCUE BOTS and he wants to
buy the two BOTS bundle for five bucks
well he doesn't have a credit card yet
he used up his play gift card that his
grandmother gave him a month ago and
instead of abandoning the purchase or
worse yet heckling me for my credit card
where I have to add that to his account
he can actually use a family payment
method and for in-app purchases we
provide the family manager with the
feature called purchase approvals this
means that I have to actually approve
the purchase before it goes through now
if it was my husband making the purchase
well I don't really want to bother with
all of that because I do trust him so I
have the option of turning this setting
off and now that the family payment
method is an optional feature for
families no one is forced to use it even
when you're part of a family it's just
one more additional pain
method that is available for your family
members so the family group and the
family payment method are things will be
continuing to build on this year and you
probably saw a little note in your inbox
yesterday about family library which is
coming and I don't have more to share
about that at this moment but you can
expect a little bit more news on this in
a few months so with that let's give it
to our main topic today which is about
building family-friendly ops and a
family friendly business on Google Play
now we know all of you sitting in the
audience your developers of kids and
family apps some of you are educators
some of you are here because your
parents or you're just still young at
heart and you hear about all the great
Android and Google API s and you're
wondering to yourself can I use that
service is there a right way to use that
service as a kids app developer and we
know it's hard to figure out how to
navigate the intersection of googling
kids apps so we wanted to give you some
helpful tips on how to use our services
and ap is so first of all let's talk
about your apps you're out probably
falls into one of these two buckets
either you're making it up that's
developed primarily for kids or you're
making an app that's meant to be enjoyed
by both kids and adults now if your app
doesn't fall into either of these two
buckets then you probably don't need to
be sitting in this session unless you're
just here for their air conditioning but
let's move on just keep it in mind which
one you know which type of app do you
have now if you're happy if you have an
app that's designed for kids and
families here's the easiest tip of the
day that will give you which is joining
the design for families program why well
it's better for your apps and it's also
better for our users so most of you
already know about the benefits of this
program but i'll just quickly recap it
you have an opportunity to be featured
in the family category on Google Play
you get to a ranked in top charts for
family apps in addition to regular top
charts in the games or the app section
you can be discovered in search queries
relating to kids content we boost you up
and you get recognized in the store with
the family star badge which is something
that our users look for to understand
whether or not your app is family
friendly we also collect more
information about the target age of your
app
specific category that you're targeting
and this actually helps us do more on
the backend to make sure that we're
actually pushing the right apps to the
right types users now whether you're
part of the design for families program
or not the way that kids apps interact
with Google and Android api's does
require some additional tweaking so
we're going to dive into that a bit
right now okay so let's talk about ads
this is probably the area that most of
you want to know the most about now if
your app is targeting kids as part of
its audience you probably know there are
a lot of legal requirements for
respecting child privacy in different
parts of the world and if you're using
AdMob as one of your ad networks that
AdMob actually offers an option for
dealing with this and this is a pretty
simple thing when you basically go to
request an ad format Bob you just tag
the ad requests in your app with a tag
that we call TF CD and that stands for
tag for child-directed treatment and
this basically turns off interest-based
advertising and remarketing in the ad
request there's another common
requirement in many parts of the world
and this is that the add content you
need to display inside of kids out needs
to be age appropriate when you need a
kid-friendly ad AdMob does offer an
option for this as well and this is what
we call KF a which is Stan sure kid
friendly ad so again all you simply do
is tag your ad request with this
particular tag and we'll actually
deliver kid friendly content in the
advertisement to your app now if you're
participating in the design for families
program and you're primarily targeting
kids Google will automatically tag your
ad requests so you don't have to do that
work on your end but otherwise you'll
need to make sure that you're actually
adding this into your ad request
directly now you may have noticed that
we also recently started displaying this
little label on the details pages for
apps and this is a it's a little label
that tells users hey my app actually
contains ads
because this is one of our top feature
requests and parents on the Play Store
and since its past January in developer
console you'll notice that there's a
section where you can actually tell us
yes my app doesn't in fact contain ads
and this will actually help speed up
your your review process we know that
everyone is always here to get their
apps onto the store as soon as possible
so make sure that you're actually
checking this box if your app in fact
does contain advertising now let's talk
about Google Play game services has
anyone here tried out the auto log-in
feature that we recently launched in
February no maybe not okay well you
should check it out play games as you
know offers a variety of cool features
like leaderboards achievements
multiplayer games and even video
recording inside the app now
unfortunately we can't necessarily offer
these account-based features to children
under the age of 13 since Google
accounts are made for children ages 13
and up or users age starting it up so
here's really the key takeaway for
developers of kids apps first if your
app is really primarily targeting just
children you shouldn't integrate the
game service really really basic now if
your app is targeting both kids and
adults you can integrate the play game
service you just need to make sure that
it's optional and there's two different
implementation options when you read
through this in our documentation you
just need to make sure that you choose
the optional implementation rather than
the auto login version another really
great feature for kids is speech and
using voice based applications makes a
lot of Center kids apps because a lot of
our users they don't they're not
actually in yet they don't necessarily
know how to spell well and they're
probably not typing that proficiently on
a device so as you know Android offers a
world-class speech API which can be used
to power things like voice search like
we have here in our YouTube kids out now
audio recording is a sensitive privacy
area for kids apps and we know some of
you
be wary about adding these types of
features because you didn't know how to
go about it well I'm happy to tell you
that the Android speech API actually
offers a way for you to tell us when you
want us to treat the voice search
requests in your app with more
sensitivity so similar to the ads
situation all you need to do is spend a
special tag with your request and if
you're part of the design for families
program again we take care of this for
you and we're actually tagging all of
your reports requests on your behalf on
the back end finally the most important
tip of the day you don't have to keep
this all in your head you don't have to
furiously scribble down notes will be
including all of this material in a new
section in our in our developer Policy
Center that's called kids and families
this is coming in june and all of this
will be covered in detail with obviously
a lot more technical instruction on how
to do the ad tagging etc so with that
I'm going to hand it over to shazia
because we've discussed how to build
your app in a family-friendly way now
let's talk about how to build your
business on Google Play as a kid's up
thanks nice job Venus hi everyone I'm
shazia mallu me and for those I haven't
met I lead our VD team for families in
education which means I work with a lot
of the developers in the audience how
many family or kids are absent games
developers in the audience today ok cool
excellent and for those who have been to
any of my presentations I like to keep
an interactive and ask you questions
because I get bored of hearing myself
speak all the time by the way before we
start how many people prefer who've been
to i/o at moscone in past years prefer
or raise your hands if you've been to
i/o before at the moscone center of
these how many prefer this location I
share your sentiments ok that's a quick
poll for feedback to the events team but
anyway so we'll get started so you know
unis talked a lot about some of the
policies and design for families and as
you think about building family mixed
age or purely kids directed apps so you
want to share some of the feedback we've
gotten from both developers and from
users so tablet optimization is really
important as you know something we've
heard and in fact sixty percent of our
spend for family apps in the Play Store
comes from tablets which is unlike any
other category and this is not a
surprise right because when you think
about it your parents have phones which
yes it's very personal device they may
give it to their kid at a restaurant but
your tablet is kind of your family or
living room device we've seen and in
fact in a recent poll we conducted of
kids specially younger kids they
actually say they prefer playing on
tablets than on phones we have a tablet
optimization a checklist on you know
android developer calm so you should
definitely check that out to make sure
that you are ready for your app is
optimized for tablets one of my favorite
questions how many people here have used
alpha and beta testing
okay it's still a low percentage though
better than you know the two hands are
typically get and out of those how many
have you guys use open beta at all which
is something we don't recently okay
closed beta okay cool so basically for
those who may not be familiar alpha and
beta testing is a way for you to check
out new app features you may be
launching or even your new app to a you
know smaller group of select users
before you launch it out to the world in
general and this allows them to check it
to give you feedback for you to catch
bugs and fix them before it's released
into kind of you know the big wide world
and any bugs affect your rating and so
with an open beta it can be open to
pretty much anyone that you know who
wants it though you can cap the amount
of people but you don't have to worry
about creating that beta community but
if you only want to use it for a
specific audience then you have the
option of creating a closed community
the list of emails to be beta testers of
your of your content and in fact we now
have like you know at i/o we launched
the ability for you to if you have an
open beta for user to sign into that
from the store listing itself so as I go
into the store listing and a nap as an
open beta I can you know select that to
be part of the due to beta the app and
you can you know for a select group of
apps we also will have the you know
we'll be featuring them in a collection
called an early access collection to
expose our users to really promising
open Vedas that are not in production
yet another audience question who's used
promo codes so far okay cool who knows
about promo codes ok I'm going to zoom
everyone else wants to know grab promo
code since I want to talk about that so
basically promo codes are something we
launched a couple of months ago and it's
the ability for you to create up to 500
promo codes and have it what you call
like a self-serve promo code campaign so
instead of having to work with Google
and figure out how to get promo
in front of you users for up to five
hundred users you can create a promo
code send it out so they can experience
you're a part of the content for free so
this would be really useful for things
like if there's a certain you know group
of influencers where you want to you
know get your app out to or a group of
let's say pet parent evangelist or even
if there's a marketing campaign you're
doing to a target set of users so you
can basically run this on your own from
the developer console and then store
listing experiments actually I won't ask
about this since I do know that seventy
percent of our top developers are using
store listing experiments and this has
been an extremely popular feature and
with this what you can do as you know is
change the text the graphics you know
icons etc to see what do users respond
to we've actually gotten feedback
especially from you know kids and and
you know developers of kids apps that
kids love icons and colors and that's
typically the first thing they gravitate
towards when they select an app to
purchase or download and so getting that
right is really important one of our top
partner is VB first experimented with a
couple of different icons and they found
that using a different icon for the app
actually increase their installs by ten
percent and so they ended up converting
to that icon and in review has tried a
bunch of different experiments and in
fact now all their launches are soft
launches they get the a/b testing to get
their listing right and then they launch
the app to the general public and we
also recently i think is what just as
soon as last week announced that you can
actually run up to five store listing
experiments at a time reviews and
ratings are really important how many
people here have responded to user
reviews and that okay good so reviews
and ratings matter and the families face
more than other categories the reason
being an I see this and myself as a
parent also elect Aaron's look to other
parents for you know ideas and spiration
things on what to get their kids and you
know stuff that will have their kids and
when and one of the main things they go
to is ratings
reviews but these are two way street
right so you want to help build up that
community so people will you know engage
with your app leave reviews tell their
friends about it and we also recently
had announced the ability for you to
respond to reviews which I'm glad quite
a few people are availing themselves off
one of the things we saw that when
especially you know if you have low
reviews and um you respond to those
reviews users that and quite a few users
end up then changing their reading and
they end up raising the reading by an
average of a point seven stars which is
enough to get you over maybe into the
next star rating category and star
reading really matters because people
equate star rating with quality and
we've seen a very strong correlation
between quality and revenue so getting
that rating important in doing whatever
it takes is really important and because
we recognize that we've done a lot of
stuff on that in the developer console
so there's you know the ability to look
at ratings and reviews by time segment
by country in fact one of my favorites
is review highlights so you can see what
are the top themes that people are
talking about your app or game it may be
very different from what you thought
your Apple game was up about and people
are responding to something else and
that helps you maybe change your
marketing campaign or think about you
know an audience you may have not
considered we also recently released
review review benchmarks which lets you
compare your app to other similar apps
in your category across common topics
like speed or stability etc so you can
see what how does your app compared to
those how do your ratings compared to
other similar apps across those
dimensions and make any fixes and we
also allow you the ability to be able to
measure your rating on topic specific to
your app and see where it is that you
are you know falling behind so you can
make improvements so we recognize how
important ratings and reviews are so
there will be a lot of effort made to
help you understand them and may
them make them go up so switching gears
a little bit how many people here you
subscription as a business model ok cool
so this chart actually shows the growth
in subscriptions on on Google Play so
there's a lot more apps and games that
are using this as a business model and
we have been doing a lot of strap on our
I'm to make sure it's easy for for
developers to be able to run a
subscription business so things like the
period write a weekly monthly quarterly
annual subscription the ability to have
grace periods good work credits etc and
actually I was yesterday I was talking
to a developer one of the best
compliments we got was when you know
they mentioned that our subscription
product and the way to manage
subscriptions on on play is head and
shoulders above other platforms was very
happy to hear that and then premium is
another model that actually is pretty
popular on play in the among the kids
developers here how many people use this
use premium okay so one may think you
know what in-app purchases kids does
that really appropriate should we should
be really be showing kids in-app
purchases well story choice is one of
our top partners has you know when they
launched Chuggington they saw that for
Chuck patrol on the freemium version
they actually got about 250 x more
downloads and 3x more revenue than on
the premium version which led them to
actually then launch then you have my
very hungry caterpillar as freemium and
play and it seems strong revenue and
downloads and bear you can chat more
with you on that if you have any
questions and I also want to point out
we don't have any restrictions on having
a AP in the kids section on family
section and in Google Play what we do
have those units mentioned earlier is
the ability for you know there's going
this password protection for I ap
purchases so we can make sure it's
parents who are proving the purchase and
not kids okay so we went over quite a
few things and you'll hear a lot more
fluid IO in fact I think the next
shown here next session in the
amphitheater at 11 is about what's new
in Google Play which will go into more
detail and some of the things I've
talked about
