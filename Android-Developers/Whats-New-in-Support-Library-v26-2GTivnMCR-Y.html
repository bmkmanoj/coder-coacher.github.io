Android support library version 26
shipping new features related to text
animation improving parity with the
android framework and various form
factors such as wear ntp and finally
making the library leaner by moving min
SDK to 14 and dropping 1.4 k methods so
let's start by seeing what's new with
text and fonts with support library 26
we've simplified working with custom
fonts you can now use them like any
other resource placing them in a new
font resource folder we also now support
downloadable fonts meaning that you
don't need to bundle your phone files in
your apk instead the system will fetch
them for you from a phone provider such
as Google phones provided by Google Play
services next up before text emojis you
might have seen this sad blank square
character whenever an app can display an
emoji evolving Unicode standards mean
that the OS doesn't always have an
up-to-date font to display the New York
symbols with the emoji combat library
your app can get backwards compatible
emoji support on devices with API level
19 and high
you now have three widgets emoji edit
text emoji text view emoji button but
also support for app compat widgets and
helper classes that allow you to work
with your own custom widgets emoji
compat can be configured with either
bundled or downloadable fonts check out
the documentation to find out how to use
it let's say that you want the text size
of your text view to expand or contract
automatically to fill its layout with
super elaborate 26 all you need to setup
is the text view auto size you can
control the granularity to define a step
size together with a minimum and maximum
text size or you can provide a discreet
range of sizes to use next topic on our
list animation you can now implement
animations driven by physics forces so
being velocity based rather than
time-based this helps create a smooth
natural-looking animation that can
correct its course when the target
changes it also simplifies handoff
between gestures and animations we have
two main types of physics based
animations spring and
flink let's say you have a view that can
be dragged around the screen but then
when you release it you want it to go
back to its place using a spring
animation will make the view feel like
it's being pulled back by an invisible
but familiar force you can customize the
spring stiffness damping ratio and its
final position if you want to animate a
property of an object and you want the
animation to end gradually use the fling
animation you can customize parameters
such as the starting velocity the
friction and the minimum and maximum
animation values if you're working with
vector graphics you'll be happy to hear
that some of the features introduced in
newer as the case are also part of the
support library vector drawable compat
has a new property fill type the
determines which regions of the image
are inside the shape similar to the fill
rule property of the SVG's animated
vector drawable compact has now the
ability to morph shapes and define paths
based interpolators allowing it to
create rich animations that work back to
API 14 developing for Android wear or
Android TV we have some good news for
you the where you are library has now
become a full support library that
contains some classes it you might
already be using such as box inside
layout swipe dismiss frame layout
wearable recycler view as well as some
new components for action and navigation
drawers several improvements have been
made to lean back CPI including a new
video playback element with six support
check out the lean by documentation to
find out more we have some other notable
changes in this version of the support
library the % support module was
deprecated so you should use ratios on
the constraint layout widget instead and
we have a new preference datastore API
that allows you to implement your own
preference storage but also a behavior
change for fragment manager execute
pending transaction commit now and
similar transaction costs are no longer
allowed during fragment manager state
changes phones emojis autosize textview
physics based animation vector graphics
form factor changes and others that's a
lot of aps in the new support library
that allows you to implement the best
experience for your users to find out
more check out the documentation page
and the google i/o talk on what's new
and support library
