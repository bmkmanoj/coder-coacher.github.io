may to remove rato altogether he

together and help you do so as well and

that all that dashing person that's
Chris Broadfoot I don't know who the
other guy is nice t-shirt anyway they're
going to be kicking off a dead bite
series on building better maps apps and
rato is going to be showing us some more
cool android cartoons with little to no
relevance to actual coding dan is going
to show us how to perform card flip
animations from inside a donut and game
on is back again for another episode to
show us how to integrate controllers
with your android games how did they get
away with it without them so far it's
not that hard is it and Shazam Sam has
been updated with tablet-optimized
layouts and a great app icon animations
yeah check that out excellent so that's
all for this week in Android development
