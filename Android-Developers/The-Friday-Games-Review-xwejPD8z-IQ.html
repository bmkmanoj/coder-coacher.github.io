review of game what shadowy on where i'm
only on screen you're writing on screen
wait now now with a black screen hold on
we can do this all right yeah there we
are oh cool alright thanks one all right
right over the frontier review games as
always I'm Dan Galpin and with me is in
New Lewis exactly we're gonna have a
nice casual conversation with our game
now behind us using in the advanced
green screen technology we have here in
the studio and the game behind us by the
way is greedy spiders too just to give a
call out to it but more importantly
let's find out what you're drinking
today well Ian's drinking my Mountain
Dew oh yeah dude I was up all night you
know what I was up all night doing
making an intro video oh yeah the one
that didn't get plain that's all right
actually it's a different one dose video
I know but Apple back but no man
sometimes I wonder well so we don't have
a producer Daniel Pham is not with us
today he is off in on a whirlwind tour
of New York and London because as you
know it's fashion week that he's got a
lot of control houses to visit pretty
much everyone in Europe who who does
faux hawks will be at the the London
faux hawk convention and I think I think
it's exciting for it to get to meet a
bunch of his peers this fight exactly so
we wish you the best annual we keep on
truckin and we still we totally believe
that you have a girlfriend even though
we've met her never met her but he does
he doesn't want her to meet us actually
I think he knows that really can't blame
ya exactly cuz isn't he pretty young I
bet it's girl from this about mid 20s
yeah probably
so all right he doesn't want her to meet
you all right so we we've got some games
today / do have some games mr. yan start
drinking ladies okay we have an opener
that's in this course we do so today
we're drinking rogue dead guy ale we're
going back to what this houses for
people who've stayed up till four in the
morning actually both Ian and I both
stayed up all tall hours tonight last
night so we really bad idea we're
pushing like dead guys and bring justice
to be the zombie edition actually I
thought the show that's kind of I feel
like right now all right so welcome so
this is um this is a new studio set up
for us and we actually have real-time
statistics on but I can just barely read
oh looks like what is that two people
are watching something like that the two
people watching thank you some way
thanks to both of those was a producer
isn't it oh well anyways so thanks to
take thanks to you and we appreciate it
exactly all right right so anyway we
love you guys and as always um there's
we do so hi producer lewis is monitoring
the youtube channel so if you guys want
to have some conversations you know just
say something maybe spark us off on
another wild-goose chase absolutely
where we are here to be casual once
again it is a casual Friday review
absolutely this week we're going to look
at a couple of games but we also want to
use this as a jumping-off point just to
talk about the you know android gaming
and how you program and SL games on
android this is a big week to work for
Google we'd we announced a new
Chromebook which I'm really excited
about and you know I think a lot of
people don't recognize but that crow
book has some serious potential for
games
that and it's really the first one that
I think actually is gpus more powerful
potentially the cpu and so i think we're
going to see some really really cool
stuff about it so I'm excited it's using
the Exynos 5 and it's a very low
resolution device for that excellence 5
so you know it's going to be a really
really nice game machine x las five
that's an exciting chip it is an
exciting ship yeah it is actually so the
chrome the Chromebook actually earned
the distinction of being the first
device to ship with an arm a 15 so
that's some good stuff that's an outer
border part isn't it it is it is it's
got its got a really long pipeline so
you do have to be a little more careful
i think in terms of you install the pipe
thank you all right button out of
ordered pipe ism is going to be a lot
harder to stall exactly and this is
actually it's probably a good thing you
know well actually actually it's
speculative out of order a 9 is also out
of work you know me 15 is also speculum
execution well ok so was their first
respective apart don't remember I can't
remember actually for speeding I know
that the pipeline is longer and dealing
that thing I hope it doesn't crash yeah
exactly but I'm really excited about
that anything you know the price point
is great and the trackpad feels really
good so I know that was kind of proper
earlier with it well the original
original chrome books I think you know
people underestimated that and now and I
can give me that really really good job
of getting good parts getting good
sensors in a degrading well so I it's a
great little machine i'm excited i'm
excited some people do games on it it's
a little bit far off for me android but
you know I thought I'd do a i was
gonna say sent it yeah do you want to
talk about like the new windows machine
decks dude this machine do it uses a t30
that's old news man I mean come on
that's like that's like that's like
apart from six months ago
but alright my Mountain Dew is finished
I think it's time for beer so yeah it's
been a it's been a good week we've had
some company down I'm definitely again
you know just working through a lot of
test suites with different game
developers trying to figure out what it
is so so here's something that that um
surfaced pun intended right I think it's
really important just recently and I
think this actually may apply to the
Exynos 5 is we we saw some game
developers with poor performance either
well not performance related either
incorrect results in the fragment shader
or basically massively incorrect and z
results absolutely you know what's
interesting about we're moving towards
devices all the next generation of GPU
to do whether that be the the t 60 for
this in the x and i was five or the
adrenal 320 these are all unified shader
models and so they're designed to be
both from cute monsters on the GPU as
well as as graphics monsters and so what
we're seeing there is that making these
your head in the display there man i
think it is so I'm dead yes you promise
dude also the corner of the lives just
play that's kind of cool actually you
know what oh yeah did you meet a bogus
letters a little bit I just lower the
monitor more sorry all right maybe stop
having a head that way hunch he's gonna
be like Quasimodo well I guess we could
pan up a little bit um but anyway so
what so what that means when you get
into devices that are designed for
compute is now they they actually have a
unified China model and so now we're
seeing things where before a lot of
times they would sort of fudge in vertex
shaders
in terms of medium in terms of you know
whether you have medium precision or low
precision it might not actually have a
tribute your precision but now that
we're actually having these that are
designed to deal with compute nina
precision may actually be something so
all of a sudden well put Bertha promise
it for a long time and in a lot of parts
so you know the problem is these these
things are defined as no lo is less than
or equal to medium is less than or equal
to high i mean theoretically you're
guaranteed 16 bands of media is the
problem but it could be would be more
definite well it usually is actually
because because um so so the what we're
seeing is there are some parts and i
believe the excess five is one of them
that I the uses 16 bits for medium p and
so if you were using medium p and
getting by with 24 bits of precision now
you get squashed down to 16 we're seeing
these like bizarre Z fighting issues
yeah yeah and again it's just it's just
we're talking about vertex shader
precision most the time pixel shader
precision actually is is unchanged they
were already crazily optimizing pixel
shaders it to a lot of these devices so
well you know the artifacts you're gonna
get or not nearly then you get banding
mm-hmm and in case you were well it just
yeah it's like you know geometry that
suddenly is fighting with other geometry
and if you draw it in one order on this
on these devices it's just going to
overlap and and so it's kind of
terrifying so yeah so one thing to note
is gives it up when you're actually
using a vertex shader using media
precision you really only guaranteed 16
bits and unfortunately it's not easy to
necessarily test that in terms of having
a GPU that's a reference design but it
is something you shouldn't you should
consider and you should actually put
some it's actually worthwhile to
exceptional code and actually try to
check those in from kind of too low
because you can actually test for those
it's just it's just that you may not
have a GP sample that yeah so it's an
interesting device but again all the new
devices are not necessarily going to
have that issue but they are going to
definitely have issues because we're
moving towards unified models here in
Mobile which is exciting actually I
think it is it is really cool yeah I
mean I don't know if I'd characterize it
as being because of unified shaders I
think it just happened to come along
with that but yeah cold in here okay
actually I just want to cover up my
boobs and I'm Teddy Teddy get that onto
I'm going back oh so let's talk about a
little a little bit about the game
behind us because because it is here
yeah absolutely so this is greedy
spiders to ever agree spiders didn't
play that it was like a sort of a puzzle
game right I did a puzzle game and it
said they're like move your flies or yes
I goal the goal with this one is to is
all this is Q is to free your flies from
you know the spiders and and it's
actually it's actually fairly tricky to
to do that there are these you know the
goal is really to to make that spider
will always follow the path towards the
nearest book in terms in terms of the
number of segments so you can use that
against him so as you see here we really
actually have the goal is now to isolate
him
the other bugs as quickly as possible
and that's how we get the best support
and then once you guys as the folks get
to go free and and there's there's all
sorts of stuff the game starts throwing
at you in addition so that's just the
first one is cutting you can freeze them
there's all sort of other stuff you can
do to the spider in order to in order to
prevent it from eating the bugs and it's
i think is really clever game the
puzzles get really really challenging as
it goes through this is a you know an
example of game that's done very very
well the back keys you see does not do
anything here which is unfortunate it
actually should technically do something
but not nothing so you're watching the
confidence monitor right so you have an
idea of what people can and can't see ya
so likes it I'm pushing the back key
here but you actually see the outline of
the tablet here and it's yeah exactly no
no it's okay it's okay here I'll show
you how we do this oh yeah yeah yeah we
just move your chair okay okay as you
can see as you can see there are stars
in this game yes this is this is great
actually you know one of us can actually
play the role of the letter Turner no
you know what I'll tell you exactly why
I put it I wanted to set up this way
yeah cuz I'm just goddamn sick of
talking about the back key yeah I
actually there was that hater I actually
was there a hater well not on our show
but on me and rato show oh yeah guy went
off he's like Mandela sales guys they
probably worked for apple we're trying
to like ruin Android and uh dude okay
really I mean look no one from apple
well no that guy sure well you know it
was actually really hilarious so it was
one one of the things he said was I
can't believe you're telling people not
to have an exit dialogue before you back
out of the application because it's
going to you know every application
should have that what if it takes a long
time to reload I'm like yeah that's a
really good point but except really the
only the only apps to get a pass on that
or games because yes games can take a
while to reload on earlier systems or if
you're under tremendous memory pressure
yeah you know and generally if you
really want to throw a dialogue
because of loading you know it's okay
but you know in general is better just
not do it all I mean I still I'm still
of the mindset that that user will
figure out you know fairly quickly well
now that you don't lose your contacts
yeah when you lose focus then I think
that that's absolutely right because the
user is either going to go right back to
the game in which case you should still
have your context and you should still
have everything you just be basically
you should be you should pause yeah and
then just let them resume or the user
doesn't care anymore and in your game
will get killed off and as long as you
handle the notifications correctly
you're probably going to be fine but you
know we're so happy this game actually
you know does not have a menu key it's
doing a lot of things right but you know
there is I am sitting here and I have to
like okay first of all this is this into
something we're about these games I have
the bricks and the bricks say i'm
actually going back to this other menu
that looks like bricks and then we've
got a non-square break oh yeah oh and
then and then but the best ones
fortunate yeah can you swipe know you
can and uh well it's a different it's
not return a proper swiping motion but
yeah it is oh that's one thing by the
way I've noticed on a couple of games
they'll implement a swipe but they won't
implement it with physics and as you get
on to bigger devices it's really
annoying because you have to drag your
it cold finger all the way across the
device he's particularly nice if you can
use physics is built
in terms of gesture gesture detector
it's just it makes the game feel like an
android game and it makes me feel a
little bit customized event horizon well
yeah it could because exactly because
the gesture detector and the flywheel
physics will um will in general do the
right thing as far as the the momentum
of your swipe and people are going to be
used to that yeah you know because all
these other apps use it so and no matter
it like if you tune it so that you
really really like it and it's different
from the system default yeah um you
might want to just you know ask yourself
what why you do it is really telling me
there's a lot of games that actually
have tried to tame this and you really
notice it I mean it's very it's a
visceral quality the game feels thick or
sticky right we find as it is it you
know our our physics are a little looser
than and some other touch based
operating systems especially in the
newer versions we really wanted to have
this very active and alive an elastic
feel to the to the user interface and so
what and so when you have a game that's
using because like oh I'm going through
slug you know this sludge trying to try
to get to the UI so general I think it's
a great there's one really bad thing
about it yes and this is you actually
look it up in the in the like view pager
code there is a fudge factor that we
apply to our own physics like a factor
of four it's true because we suck but
you know whatever if if there's a fudge
factor great grab it out of the source
it's a constant factor yeah
alright so let's let's buddy items I
really love this game honestly it's an
incredibly well designed game it's
really really fun the craft really well
done it's very cute and it definitely is
a game we're looking at all seasons yeah
that has legs people are come on play
with uneven little details like I like
see what you did there yeah legs nice so
the any note i love the fact that his
eyes even moved here on the gun on the
title screen it's very very cute you
have the little you know you have to
give the little obvious option for music
sound effects and off on the radio you
know nations you can change the
difficulty on it from easy too hard you
know whatever can't do that actually
yeah i mean you can't actually determine
whether or not they've raided you on
google play so kind of yeah
actually the truth is i hope these
developers hear this from us because
they will eventually hear from the play
guys it's against policy to incentivize
reviews so if the website team sees that
nothing it's borderline it because
they're not asking for a good review or
a bad review if this is this is one of
the team clients kind of borderline as
long as you know so it's it's one of the
things and it's a goofball because you
can't actually tell whether they
reviewed it so it's sort of like you
know so it usually happens is sure I'll
rate you on google play and I go to
Google Play and I hang out here for a
little while and I load the gretna never
load so they looked on by age and then I
come back and it's like you know usually
game goes we read on google play plus
five you know you go again kinda silly
since you can't actually detect it but
that being said
so it's it's it's not you know whether
it's helping you're an audio I think the
team is sort of okay as long as you're
not act as one first Pacific so check it
out look who just walked in it's rato
mire no a welcome to the neighborhood
rate why is reto Meier slumming in here
with the game guys it was Hall would
that be well it could be anyone's I'm
gonna mute this tablet just in case the
point you're welcome Thank You rato
representatives of the man thanks right
to a pretty good thing I appreciate that
one all right yeah we via Daniel Pham is
off teaching people all over the world
how he how he does his magical producer
ship and in his in his giant world tour
in addition to the fauxhawk a convention
which of course is very important so so
we're all kind of figuring things out we
realized how much we rely on him here we
do absolutely alright so let's weekend
which we can switch to another title uh
so we've actually looked at a lot of the
ones that here a producer lewis what
happened to our hdmi oh I did no way
really all right time to you can see you
got a transformed from screen alright so
um so yeah we've looked at a few of
these before so I'm not going to go into
any detail i'm just gonna bring them up
and be like wow that looks bad and why
does that look bad uh well it's it's
because this game has never been really
tested on tablet display is the wife is
what I think but I'm not sure it could
just be its intended to be squashed like
that but this is greedy monkey and it
was also this this game is just one that
you know it has a lot of potential in
terms of in terms of in terms of being a
physics puzzler and it just doesn't
quite live up to their the goal is to
actually you need to clear away the
boards so that the banana will make it
to the monkey this is the laziest monkey
on earth and it's just you know if
there's so much that I can say in terms
of polish in terms of
anything from the font the graphic style
is actually relatively consistent but
you even see like the bat like there is
some yeah yeah I mean like the Stars
have have a little bit of a bevel to
them that yeah I was saying yeah
emphasis I would actually like to see
everything take the style of the
background I think it's yeah I love it
you're right background that's kind of
cool I love that style I think it also
scales really really well like what's
great about not having lines and not
having distinct outlines is if they
actually scale and look great on every
display that's a good point because if
you've got a like a black line around
your you know that that's going to scale
differently and it's gonna going to end
up actually being invisible on some
devices and too thick on others exactly
and you end up with these a listing
aliasing artifacts like you can see here
on the board on the very very left you
can see that you can you can't really
make out the outline because of the
angle the board is sitting at the
outline wasn't there at all and we
actually chose an art style that was
more consistent with a nice gradient
fills of the background I think I think
it would look a little bit better don't
want to say a lot about this game it's
just there's a lot of polish that can be
done here I think we did look at it a
long time ago but you know my memories
touch that I don't even know me by was
kind of interesting um the main thing
dude you're going to use and engine
don't use the standard an engine package
man use your own you change the package
name you know it's like like really I
was looking and I'm like this is like
calm and edge and this is not an antigen
game this is this is this just a game by
an individual this is a game that
requires accelerometer it's definitely
kind of it's definitely retro why I'm
impressed as its game is is super super
tiny I think this game is like eight or
nine hundred K I don't know which makes
it one of these smallest games and given
that it actually does quite a lot are
you just gonna keep trying to keep these
dudes in the air trying to keep these
guys in the air and and you can't get
comp you get combos you see that you
know which I can't really do very well
here you know what we need for this
place we need like a one of those
remotes where your phone is the
accelerometer yeah that would be kind of
kicked but if only there was a way to
actually use my other phone is a real
hid device and there was some sort of
remote framework for dealing with
sensors that behind
you know Jeff that's you yeah I'm not
gonna be able to do this very well on
this tablet partially because I have it
in the dock which of course I do mostly
for stability but actually you know the
starry background looks pretty good with
us I kind of like stability thing
working out for you buddy I kind of like
the story back on behind it i will say
this game makes a better background than
others um it's pretty blurry how about
actually it's not i just got a little
bit more depth of field yeah I could
totally believe that we were just
sitting in front of a video wall okay
absolutely I really no I tell you I
really want us to be silhouettes though
I totally want us to the MST do yeah
yeah and haven't really really tiny in
the corner like take our shot instead of
just composing it straight actually make
it smaller and take us and compose this
in a little in a little corner oh man
you know you can totally make us into
silhouettes Daniel Pham yeah and maybe
maybe next time we'll do that that'd be
kind of awesome you know and so for next
week by the way just just to let you
know will mention this at the end but I
do want people to to nominate halloween
themed games that shouldn't be that
should not there are so many out there
and everyone is throwing only it's like
you know it yeah you know we might
actually just do games on the App clinic
too because rato was like yeah we'll do
halloween apps at the end of October
going really what's a Halloween app
exactly and but yeah Halloween's huge
for deal there's lot there soundboards
like Halloween themed soundboards
there's Halloween live wallpapers ever
since and I guess the calling cards and
our posting later anyways the there's a
lot of thought of Halloween stuff so
we're excited about that um maybe I
won't wear a hat that time we'll see I'm
so you leave ideas your go is a crazy
old man with long hair that's right
that's my that's actually I walk down
the street and people hand me stuff yeah
begging please okay this is just tight
dress I'm sorry about holes in my shoes
so um any case where are we going with
this alright so I um yeah the game you
know it works and it's cute and it's
very you promised me that there was
going to be interesting stuff about each
game that we're
canet today I am promised me I know I
lied so the other two games only the
fact that it's really small is very it's
actually and the fact that it uses
actually don't think a lotta dimension
was please don't use the stall the
default package or anything like her
user of create your own package name
yeah that was my primary con the game is
actually pretty fun it's very simple but
it's fun so the other other two are over
killing zombie Raiders I'm pretty sure
we've looked at both of them I don't
remember zombie writers definitely
remember overkill that's a shooting
gallery game yes yeah overkill shooting
game I put it on here just just you know
just because we know we could take a
quick look at it again this is a pretty
cool icon I don't remember the game
looking as good as the intro and the
icon though uh yeah the real sad thing
about this game is it it just completely
lacks animation it's sort of like a
shooting gallery semi robotic shooting
gallery you know it mhm but you know
what we can we can you can take a look
but it's got I mean this whole and
getting stuff like that just the yeah
the entire menu system is awesome yeah
and i love i love the little bullets you
know and then you get to the game wow
this looks really well-rendered and then
you start playing it you're like hey all
right first of all you actually this is
a jewel joystick control despite the
fact that it looks like you might be
tapping that's actually not how it works
oh that explains a lot about why i never
got any good scores on this game yeah
yeah it's weird it's like they've got
this great rendering but they can I mean
I've definitely got sympathy for that
like we've got the same problem in the
game we're writing uh-uh man we ran out
of money before you get the main
character rigged that's true so you know
what I was thinking we should do yeah is
just give him rocket boots because then
we don't have to rig him we'll just make
the rocket boots swivel I'll add that
that could work so anyways I you can
also swipe you actually it actually clip
you can swipe with two fingers to change
guns okay that's um nice us a nice
gesture support uh but you know kind of
it's kind of it's tough man I can
definitely sit like just compare just
what you're seeing right now on the
screen with some of the other games
we've looked at and you know what game
you want to play you're like oh my god
that is diff
and it's it's really really crisp and
beautiful and it's you know I mean not
all of us are boring designers it's hard
to say it's hard for me to say exactly
what makes this so good I think part of
its an attention to color part of its a
consistency throughout the design i mean
this this thing is you know you're
looking at this hi res real world bitmap
and then over the top of it are these
things that you know that the font and
the layout is very creative they did a
great job on a mini system the game
itself IE i really want some more
animation in the game you know and i
know they're they're definitely
constrained by size but it's not a small
game it is a game that's actually using
APA expansion files it clocks in at
about fifty four bags I think look up
and you know part of the problem is is
it in this kind of in shooting games
there um there's some crazy to be honest
then it competes kind of directly with
this several several of their games are
sort of shooting galleries but with you
no more sophisticated 3d environments
and so I don't know my this game is fun
it's for it is very well done I did
actually have to play it it is difficult
to play on a tablet sitting on a surface
like this but I yeah I mean and if I had
to choose between a beautiful menu
system and a beautiful you know
excellent gameplay of course I'm going
to choose gameplay you know this the
mating system though he's awesome like
really kudos to you guys man for making
yeah some menu system here the back you
tell us on her but you know hold you man
we're not talking about you know we
spent a year talking about the back key
yeah either know it or you don't so
zombie Raiders is actually a really
interesting game that it takes an
incredible amount of time to get into
and it actually has it's actually kind
of an adventure puzzle fighting shooting
game there's others so basically as you
can see you actually have to unlock
there's a zombie invasion going on and
what you have to do is actually get
through these various areas and you find
you find items you have to use that you
have to figure out where you use the
items and it's a detail long involved
game but this is but this isn't the one
where you're flying an airplane full of
zombies as it no
ochem know that when I love that game is
great this game you know I think in
terms of in terms of in terms of a
mobile game this one's a little harder
it requires a car a large amount of time
investment to to to really get into and
play this game from a graphic
perspective things are not as cool at
the you know what this really reminds oh
man yeah how long has it been since
we've seen just a fun top down nice and
wet a trick I still haven't seen one but
um but this is top-down an isometric
well I guess I guess that's sort of it's
really exposed to the yeah this
isometric side well no just like it
reminds me of X calm and yeah but
where's the shadow is dude yeah I know
that shot us on the air hard all you
need is not even a faint shadows even a
little shadow underneath a little dead
little marker it scored sort of odd and
the graphics are really blurry um you
know I would love to see them be a
little higher res and they are oh that's
true you know there's I didn't notice
because so here's a question to our
audience we were we were just talking
about this the other day is how if
you're going to run an automated program
to detect issues like this so what we're
talking about is over on the right side
of the screen so we've got these things
that are almost behind Dan's head now ok
so these are crisp whereas all of this
it's it's a little hard to tell because
it's a textured but it is not crisp and
it's about yeah I'd say the densities
about it she's kind of nice it creates
depth of field for us and our in our
Sean here there yeah yeah yeah good boy
exactly look yeah except he may look
like we're sort of positioned in a weird
nether space over an isometric field
yeah well you know I think I think
that's okay anyway the point is what
would you do to detect this and it
because i think you know to put it in
layman's terms i think we're trying to
detect you know places where there's a
lot there's crisp but then most of its
blurry mm-hmm but the problem is you
know some things you know if you're just
measuring frequency or whatever some
things are going to be a low frequency
signal and especially things like this
game play it's the only places that you
notice it the only place where it has to
be Chris are the
you would expect it to be crisp and
maybe that's it I mean maybe what we
need to do is shrink it down find the
silhouette edges and then see how many
of the psyllid edges are actually blurry
at higher yeah exactly it would also be
interesting example you just don t
actually change the size of the display
look at look at this game at different
display sizes and compare and compare
how blur to get it get and then we could
actually see kind of where the optimal
where it had the highest amount of
information where we saw be you know are
you starting at that that might yeah
that's true we just characterize it
information theoretically if we if the
information doesn't go up when the
screen size does then that's a problem
right exactly we can do that we can even
take each image apply a scale factor
scale no you're right you're absolutely
right because that's that's the true
that you know it doesn't have anything
to do with frequency it has to do with
information that has to do with whether
the because if you're if you're making a
bilinear prediction at each pixel mm-hmm
and the prediction is always right then
there's no information beyond what the
you know quarter the size would have
been exactly exactly oh you working dark
worse thank you we're solving all of our
problems here on on the Friday review
but yeah so I you know this this game is
really blurry on tablet it's okay on
phones honestly on a Galaxy Nexus you
can see this too all right well I'm
really bored let's take a question from
the audience oh yeah are you sure Louis
are there are no questions all right are
there any game genres that you think are
underrepresented on touchscreen phones
that we do love optimized RTS man why
aren't there more RTS games out there a
lot of liked our defenses stuff like
that but doesn't it seem like you know
what I'm playing starcraft it's like
this seems like it would make sense on a
touchscreen totally i'll i wanna i want
to see some well you know i think i
think in general i want to see games
that take advantage of the connectivity
I mean you know most these these most of
these are like one hundred percent
connected devices and I'd love to see
RTS games and I don't need to play
against the against the computer but
actually allow you to play against other
players like I think that there's
there's really an opportunity first st i
don't feel that way because i hate other
people but yeah not grain yet how that's
something i yeah i mean i think you know
i would love to see me starcraft you
know was a great single player
experience but you know it it as a as a
multiplayer yeah that's yeah no question
well i think that's like
that doesn't feel like it's the you know
core to the phone right or are you just
saying that in general we're not seeing
enough multiplayer experiences even
though these things are yeah even though
these things are connected devices like
I want to see anything to do a lot of
really cool well yeah I mean part of the
problem is I feel like you know
starcraft would have been a completely
different experience if clicking on a
zerg had cost me you know like five
tenths of a sentence no that's true
that's true no when we're talking about
bandwidth caps and stuff like that it's
like it's right you're talking about a
net purchases under that's who that tour
than you fifty cents every single time
you click that's kind of genius uh oh
you know would be great is if you die
three times then you have to pay
twenty-five cents to continue yeah yeah
I always wondered why that model didn't
come back yeah I know I don't know yeah
probably although it never stopped me
from playing far too much robotron um
but wasn't it great when nickel cut our
kids came into being do you have a
nickel arcade nor your house no no we
did not unfortunately we add we did have
an art we did our arcades that have
major major token deals though sort of
it like they had a days you come the
arcade and now you get quad tokens and
so we'd come out with giant sacks of
tokens oh there you go yeah totally no I
I had a nickel arcade near my house when
I was growing up and then oh and when I
lived in Salonika they had a ten drachma
arcade yeah and drachma are worth about
as much as like korean wand so actually
i actually remember when i went to when
i went to Prague actually i was really
excited because the arcade was less
expensive because at the time it was a
you know actually they're still not
using euro in product or not no no it's
still there they have joined the
eurozone but they either they're still
using their own currency all right if I
recall maybe I'm wrong about I think so
and anyway so it was but it was the
other arcade we've actually relatively
cheap there and so that point at that
point I was playing a lot of
she played that you know what I really
miss is that the Nikki game that came
out and it never hit the states because
I think of licensing deals yeah yeah and
it was like I remember I think actually
i don't think i got much past the first
level with the first level was really
fun because you were on the Giants table
from making the Beanstalk mm-hmm and you
know you were like jumping on the jello
and the cakes and stuff like that was
really cool so um let's see I need
anything else can be off the live stream
yeah he's mentioned and engine and Jim
McCleod said you guys love it what do
you think about libgdx um I don't have
experience with it you know to haven't
tried it yeah so unfortunately you know
as far as far as loving an engine what I
what I like about an engine is that um
they've done a really really good job of
building a usable 2d sprite tile gaming
framework on top of the Android api's
and it created really is there's I've
seen a lot of great games come out of an
attention so I always kind of smile when
I see another another end engine game I
also Nicholas really has done a great
job and it's one of the nice things that
Zynga has actually brought back to
community is that they've contributed a
lot of lines of source since he's been
there back into and engine so so you
know I don't you usually get this I
don't get to say kudos as in go very
often but goodness is inka before
continuing that effort and this is not
Korean because he hates people but hmm
Are you disappointed by the limited
number of games that have multiplayer I
i would say that I definitely yes you
know we're starting to see more I mean
there's there's been there's been more
and more games and also you know what
let me just answer that even though
nobody wanted me to yes you're right I
cannot get enough of racist teenagers he
spent all their time getting better than
me at all games all the time ever yeah
no I you know I would say that um
there's there's there's different kinds
of games to you know they're there are
games that are that work very very well
with anonymous matchmaking and an
anonymous is kind of cool a lot of times
there's no communication between the
players so I don't even get to find out
the way that
way that they feel about gay people for
example yeah well in this room you know
I I have a I have a weekly starcraft
match my buddies and and you know we
play on one team and we get matched
against some other team yeah and you
know usually the conversation is hey
good luck have fun and sometimes it's
like dem trash-talking which is which is
always good because you know when
somebody trashes a toxin starcraft they
have to do it over text chat so they're
obviously their actions per minute or
going down yeah exactly exactly when you
have the you are soo ji AE you know if I
I think the main problem is that a a
multiplayer game at least for me is an
appointment mm-hmm so when I have an
appointment I have devices that I can be
at at a specific time that are much much
faster than a phone so I don't usually
look for a multiplayer game on the phone
because i'm probably going to sit down
to my desktop computer which is you know
a hundred times more powerful but what i
do really enjoy is the idea of being
able to do asynchronous multiplayer on
the phone and I think I I don't think
that I would be like this but I can
totally see a lot of people that would
be into the the experience of doing like
a quick land session or something like
that yeah i love i love anonymous
matchmaking actually i think that you
know i think that that a moodle really
lends to it i've got five minutes here i
have no time to grab friends but what
I'm going to do and I you know that
happened all the time in even in World
War in World of Warcraft II sure sure
you run into a bunch of people hey we're
all about to do this same mission
awesome can I join you yes let's go kill
the blah blah and get the blah blah and
you know and so that was you know that
that kind of stuff that lends itself
very well to mobile you know like you
know an example would be like dungeon
hunter 3 actually has this present mode
we say hey oh yeah I've got a room let's
find other people let's go attack this
that works really well and you don't
have to find a whole bunch of friends
knew it and you can actually chat but
people it's such a pain to chat on
mobile but it leaves the conversation
actually yeah that's really tough I
don't think that I really got into multi
gaming until voice chat became
ubiquitous yeah yeah now you know
theoretically there wouldn't be anything
anything stopping somebody from
releasing a chat client that could run
in the background and do this stuff it's
just a matter of you know again these
we're I'm always astounded by how much
amazing computing power we can carry in
our pocket but we're still carrying in
our pocket and powering it by tiny
little batteries it's nothing compared
to something that you plug into the wall
yeah I know it's true i know and i think
that um i think i think we're going to
get there i think that but we currently
you know in terms of multiplayer i think
that you know there's certainly
fantastic success stories in mobile most
live in synchrony asynchronous
multiplayer and or the other thing that
I think works really really well that I
like to see our challenges where you
actually can you play against the ghost
of someone your friend can be like yeah
yeah I just got this high score and you
know etc so right because II because
that's because that's really what I'm
gaming on my phone is because I've got a
little bit of time to grab and I need
the experience that is going to reward
that as opposed to having to like you
know call my friend and of course you
know it'll say my friend is online but
that of course he's online because he's
got his phone in his pocket everybody
always does right exactly so it's it's
tough I mean there's definitely
challenges that we didn't face when we
were doing the you know desktop stuff
yeah we're on the Xbox you're on the
Xbox you most likely you're either
watching videos in which case man get
don't even try to message me or or
you're playing games in which case well
actually don't try to message me most
the time either oh yeah yeah that's me
on yeah like can't you see that so on
but at least at least you're actually at
a console where you usually have a fast
internet connection and you're and
you're in the mood to you know
potentially interact with humans
although you know not always make sure
turns about multiplayer bandwidth of
course although I would say that the the
bandwidth issue is much less of a
concern than latency you can always fix
bandwidth it's very difficult to fix
latency yeah most I mean I think we're
finally getting this in network
like LT has some actually great latency
numbers on a non congested network and
so we're probably getting to the point
where some of the things that were at
one point limited to either land
connections it's got a funny muni I go
back to my friends who were serious
about about gaming would be like all
right I can't have a cable modem because
there's too much latency I can't be on
Wi-Fi because it adds too much latency
to the kick to the to the DSL line which
is the only thing it provides a loan of
latency so that I have a chance of not
getting fragged okay and we're not
anywhere near that in terms of moval yet
you know but there are certain kinds of
twitch experiences that are starting to
work on on an actual you know cellular
network and I think that's exciting LTE
is really enabling all that so I think
we'll see more and more but it still is
tricky and one of things is when you're
doing matchmaking you want to find out
how good are my things can I get a
quality of service if the quality of
service below falls below a certain
threshold what does that mean in terms
of game it does I mean that's just
really I think the biggest problem is
that your thing time is extremely
unpredictable when you're on mobile even
even if you're stationary yeah it can be
very unpredictable because so
susceptible to interference even our
Wi-Fi is actually is actually a perfect
has grounded something works on our
Wi-Fi here it probably will work on a
mobile network so that might actually be
true yeah um but you know i mean if
you've got a femtocell or a or a Wi-Fi
network i think that there is all sorts
of things you can do the nice thing is
that the same games that lend themselves
particularly well to a touch screen only
interface are the same games that very
frequently don't require incredibly good
latency um you know I I don't so I'm
sure there are people who really
honestly enjoy playing the ftse's on
mobile yeah I'm not one of them just
because I feel like I have so many
better ways to play FPS ha's yeah and
and I don't have a better way to play
let's say tower defense or
I like I said RTS nice thing about those
games is that while they're not fully
deterministic it's really really easy to
do latency hiding in those situations
now one of my favorite multiplayer games
as you all know is the big win series by
hothead and they hide latency
beautifully just by pre computing
everything yes exactly this but here's a
dirty little secret oh yeah you're like
oh well yeah of course they just pretty
me it's all predetermined but the truth
is that most sports games can do very
similar things so like for instance when
we did yeah when we NFL fever and NHL
rivals for Microsoft sports we we would
basically start an animation sooner on
the client on the originating client and
hold it out for more frames and this is
the same thing that like you know the
old Warcraft and Starcraft like the you
know if you click on a peon mm-hmm and
he says okay I'm going to do my thing
yeah any you know and he like is acting
lazy well that's not laziness on your
peon sprite that's latency compensation
because if you can hold off on actually
doing the thing for five or ten frames
which isn't very long yeah then you can
completely get rid of pink time problems
yeah that's why an eye out it I have
played a lot of FPS games a lot now on
mobile you know shadow g'nite way it
always was a great experience except
flabbergast me that you can do that step
for the one level what you have to run
backwards where she made me want to
shoot someone oh yeah Oh was that the
one the drill can ya all stomach
terrible oh man that we the meat circus
exactly was he was like and you just got
ground up over and over yeah I made it
through I actually beat that level twice
but that's right you had to beat that
level because we had to get past it to
show it over ilona right-hand bend over
Congress it I was like this cool air is
um but but yeah the shadow I play Chad I
got a plate that trigger I played sir
actually play through batman the dark
night I play you know i played through a
lot of spider-man i played through a
bunch of i play too i love Mass Effect
infiltrator I said already I want you to
play through a lot of that dead trigger
I did a lot of there there's been a lot
of really really great experiences there
but and it's interesting because there's
two different models there's ones like
mass effect which really tries to use
swiping and to create a totally
different interface and sometimes it
just drives me crazy and then there are
the things like shadowgun which are
which are you know which are you know
basically you know doing joystick
simulations and it was funny because I
actually don't know what I like more
because there I totally appreciate the
crazy stuff Mass Effect infiltrator does
but the problem is is when you're
actually playing on a tablet you were
just reaching all over the place you
like putting going up for the corner and
dragging stuff and doing gestures here
and there and and it does it does get to
be a little bit crazier like I feel like
that's a common problem right is it
people will design a great touch
interface but they'll design it around a
particular form factor and and that's
just that's not the world we live in
anymore I mean it's not just about I
mean Android has lots of form factors
yeah everybody has at least two well my
favorite is nova 3 so nova 3 actually
allows you has a mode you can actually
go and drag the different controls
around except you can't actually drag
the one that does reload would you which
is stuck at the top of the screen so you
get have everything else like right
within thumbs window and then you're
gonna reload all right back backpacks
reload and so you know it's again it's i
mean kudos that's actually i love the
concept of having customizable controls
but they kind of have to be customizable
it's at that point for that you know and
again no and noah 3 is great you know
for that kind of game but but definitely
you know we're at an era where the
hardware can actually do some really
nice FPS is you know we're seeing stuff
that you know rivals and in many ways
actually is better quality and what we
saw on the ps2 and on the original xbox
yeah you can definitely get past the
xbox one and ps2 phase for me i didn't
actually get into FPS is until the xbox
360 and i'll tell you why part of it was
that was the first console and you
remember that they came out before the
ps3 on the
so is the first console that had a
unified shader and it was also the first
console that had any real memory so it
drove really high texel density and I
just found it that like the the blurry
stuff is really hard to go back to yeah
I and i'll say i played a crapload of
halo and then hey you know n tail 02 on
the original xbox and and we used to get
together for LAN parties we used to you
know have frag fest and that was really
fun and I loved in fact I love just the
fact that we had to put everyone
together in the same room we had
everyone walking around carrying these
ginormous xboxes and monitor is it you
know super dorky but whatever ginormous
xboxes i try coating around your desktop
well we did that too but i mean that's
why that's why the xbox is seen like oh
this is so really you converted carting
around ladies eco actually has a special
xbox backpack is like custom made that
is because Co he's cooler than either of
us in that kind of creamy she is she in
Korean oh yeah I don't know probably I
love how we do that was like hey we need
this we need to hire somebody for games
and there's this personally really
really likes games and she's got a lot
of contacts in the industry awesome oh
hey she agent what kind of agent oh my
god really Korean nine my yeah exactly
um I know I don't think she's actually
in Korea now I think she's actually I
think she had another meeting this today
actually course she did of course you
did anything else on their list the
questions wrong nomination of games
either get reviewed here but also
featuring know the developer of greedy
monkey is watching you know us well yeah
I'm work they want to know how did they
get to the next step and get behind the
future information well I mean I mean
the truth is you know on a tablet like
this I haven't you know I haven't had an
extensive experience on a phone but
you're in terms of something like Grady
monkey I mean you have to look at the
quality that stuff is getting featured
now in terms of just the graphical
integrity that we're talking about you
know the bar is pretty high yeah and the
reason is but you know they're taking
this game and they're putting it in
front of em you know millions and
millions of Android users we're talking
about over a million activations a day
of just new devices not to mention all
the ones that are sitting out there and
so
so the so the bars gotten higher you
know I mean um I mean I'm not sure well
there's a few things that I mean in
terms of the bar that the minimum bar is
we published it just a few days ago on
deck yeah the app quality checklist
that's essentially that's derived from
the guidelines that Dan and I helped
write 44 game featuring quality and a
shout-out shout-out to our QA team yeah
you know I'm strong actually put them
into words die there is so much more
literate than us when it comes to test
plans well and it was interesting
because you know it was what's great
about that cute that the quality
guidelines is that you can actually use
it as a test plan so that actually says
here are the things that we're trying to
test for and then it actually says and
here are a bunch of tests you may use
you actually trying to test for those
things so fridge well everyone should
look at app quality and tablet app
quality especially for games and and try
to make sure that it gets there you know
and and so you know they're going to
look at part of it they're going to look
at graphics in terms of style in terms
of in terms of pixel density you know
and gritty monkey just it needs to be
taken to the next level let's let's see
what's featured now the other thing that
I think is really important for people
to understand is is that the featured
apps have to be at least four stars and
lots of downloads oh not now would night
well every now and then we'll go looking
for diets in there is a there's
velocities and sometimes what I does is
say some guy is a game that's awesome
except that they didn't test them like
anything but want advice and then
there's like you know yes occasionally
occasionally we'll see a game that has
what we call a u-shaped distribution 44
reviews so it'll be like all fives and
all ones and nothing in between and
that's a really good sign that we should
feature this game as soon as they fix or
blacklist devices and that's that's very
typical but let's take a look at yes
some of these I mean late death dome
that looks pretty cool this doesn't look
pretty cool but yeah the
I don't want to get I want to give it
one star wait what is that I what does
that review oh that's an awesome review
I totally want yet why because it what
is it fish not only the data well yeah
that's a that's a good and not that many
want star reviews not unusual people
seem to be doing well but if you look at
these things you know most of these do
not it used to be that we would we were
desperate for games and I'm talking
about a while ago but you know yeah we
would be 30 years ago years ago if it's
a game played and it looked okay but now
the bar is so high I mean look at yeah I
mean all like you know pirates of the
caribbean that's a Disney game you've
got uh yes Afghan wobble condo Rayman
toggle run is awesome the truth is the
top five or six developers put out more
games that we could possibly feature and
again okay look at all the independent
too but we do yeah exactly so that's
that's the thing is I guess what I'm
trying to say is if if all we wanted to
do was feature great quality games there
are a huge number that are made by
really really well funded people mm-hmm
we don't just want to feature well
funded games or games by the top you
know five developers we really really
want to I to feature some other to me
usually what it takes is a very strong
recommendation sometimes it will be
people that just made it really big on
other platforms like you know for
instance Triple Town was very big on the
original kindle well triple triple town
is just what yeah what's relationship
that guy's really good guy used to run
um xbox live arcade but but yeah I think
I think I think you know with Indrani I
mean it was one of those we actually
said I got submitted so Triple Town went
through a process it got submitted to a
whole bunch of Googlers who were just
randomly looking at games yep and all of
them lost so much productivity just I
mean generally these these these people
came back to us and said you can't you
can't recommend this kind of
to us because we just are missing all of
our objectives and key results for the
quarter because of Triple Town so here's
but here's here's really what it comes
down to a lot of people say well how do
I get noticed and we did for a while run
this game or run this show as a
crowdsourcing thing we've kind of
stopped doing that we've kind of stopped
thinking of this as being a conduit into
featuring because we just weren't seeing
good enough results it turns out that
there's a lot of really intriguing indie
stuff by people who have a super low
budget but for the most part the really
really good stuff floats to the top you
know so for instance we look at the
Android gamer sites we look at the you
know mobile gamer sites we talk to
developers and say what are you playing
so it's not necessarily you know I don't
think we're the ones that are going to
discover yeah I mean there's been a
couple of games that have come through
here that had to come feature you know
and and a couple of ones where they were
oh yeah when I saw it like gunman Clive
for instance yes we all loved that game
we hadn't seen it before absolutely and
I think that that will still happen yes
but we have to understand there are
another really high hey word hero came
through here and were like you know with
some polish this game has all the right
bones it's going to be a great game and
he went and he I mean he I've never seen
a developer work so hard to polish their
game and get it ready for tablets and
get all ready for multiple devices and
and get a much better feature graphic
any other day they did they did great
stuff to make sure that it was going to
pass that that's another thing by the
way look at these feature graphics yeah
they're lush they're beautiful ah there
well made many games did a brilliant job
with that you can see even wild blood
which is kind of small in low contrast
you can still read it even on this on
this tablet and you know yeah and and
and this is and that's an epic game to
you know in terms of in terms of its
yeah that's for you what you will see a
lot of gameloft games you'll see a lot
of compost getting a lot of EA games I
mean there there are big big studios
they're well-funded but so I guess the
point is that um if you
I would say that you know maybe once a
month a game that we see from our
moderator page is good enough to get
featured so I wouldn't like to pin all
your hopes on it but if you do want to
be reviewed on the show the the way to
do it is to go to our moderator page
which you'll have to search works down
have the URL handy but the Friday review
moderator and just nominate it for the
date that you're interested in if it
doesn't get picked up that date nominate
it again and if people aren't voting for
it you know maybe ask yourself why yeah
yeah i mean i'm looking at the findings
we have today you know i mean in terms
of a combination of a graphical polish
gameplay all these different elements
greedy spiders that's we featured the
original we obably feature we probably
feature greedy spiders too as well you
know but uh you know and that's it's
it's as good as it was before or better
yeah it's good as it was before better
um but that's a really polished game
it's a new menu gotta remember to it's
like we would really really love to
believe that featuring is something that
we can just do four games because
they're awesome because we really want
to support indie developers it's not we
The featuring process is actually for
filling our storefront and making google
play a more attractive place to be oh
you know what I don't want we want to
make sure when people download something
off the store that they're happy with it
because that's what gets people going
back and that's what keeps it makes the
featuring process work you don't want to
make sure that when we do have a great
indie title that comes through that we
put it up there and it does something
you know what well you know what what's
really awesome yea though is is what
they've started to do with uh come on
with collections yeah if you go in here
and like tabletop games ohms this is
okay so tavaris ford who's buddy of ours
made this collection of tabletop games
found is it doesn't look like a real
name like if I can hear name I know
right it sounds like a cold prefect yeah
exactly exactly he's actually he's
actually part of hitchhikers guide I
know and it's weird too because um the
one of the guys that did WebGL on chrome
is named Greg tavaris yeah
everybody always gets it mixed up but
yeah and there's a few things like like
check this out nirosha my hex you know
we learned about nourishment hacks from
I I think one of our old co-workers and
Isaac Chris and um and we were super
unimpressed at first but then they did
some updates in it it actually started
getting fun yeah I mean look we even
have rage of bahamut there well read
Thomas I mean you gotta talk in a ringer
yes but steady point being though that I
think this is going to be this is going
to turn into a channel for more
attention yeah we're good because there
are some getting like for instance for
the longest time I was so excited
without the retro site yeah yeah we
wouldn't good which is rubber for the
longest time we get these great retro
games in and we're like okay but we
can't feature very many retro games
because if people come in and they don't
know the retro thing they don't
understand then they're going to see
this and there you think oh I guess
android games are all like full of
gigantic pixels yeah and you know I mean
maybe maybe that was a reasonable fear
maybe it wasn't but I put in a retro
category it really helps and this is a
live look I think I think what's
exciting is that we're actually starting
to improve the merchandise and get more
stuff in there and I think ultimately
you know what's even more exciting is
you know what it's very possible the
let's say I let's say that a female user
comes in here and the average female not
to be you know completely is is is
potentially not interested in death dome
and wild blood okay that might not be
appealing to their demographic in fact
what they want to see is Magic Tree and
Raymond and and triple tap everybody
wants to see Magic Tree come on I think
that I know I know it's true ah cute so
but you know so I think that's the one
thing that's really let or clouds of
sheep I'll of clouds and sheep this game
is those guys need to go out and visit
the we do they're awesome we're that
Norway another and our journey there in
northern Germany yeah yeah they're great
oh I only think he's Norwegian because
it was just his boss hairstyle well AJ
he looks like a Viking doesn't it yeah
he does he does so we're
they have that games right happy Vikings
yeah God that was a terrible game
where's that game so my locker wait I
know they really do but every it's weird
because every one of their other games
is actually pretty awesome yeah they're
they're brilliant and I look house and
sheath is is is it is either like get
the level not happy cod actually the
other the other one on that they had
they have just recently which I am which
I do love and I'm Doug blanking on the
name it's the townsmen is the other one
you should play from from those guys
okay look at how over time which are so
self-indulgent is lit Lewis is there is
there like a final question you just
want to like go out with a bang on I
would say that was it but if you're
really greedy to talk about game
controllers you know what game
controllers are awesome at some point
we're gonna support them and life is
going to be sweet that's a little time
