language learning apps a mission is to
empower everyone in the world to learn
in your language the way we do this is
by providing our users with high quality
courses designed in-house enriched by
conversations with native speakers the
whole idea being that to learn in
language you need to practice it with
people who actually did we get that's
really what people love about our
product this big social interaction
today - over 65 million people use
vision to learn a language and
interestingly out of our five largest
markets and androids four or emerging
countries namely turkey Russia Brazil
and India what we've come to realize is
that a lot of emerging markets have
limited storage memory they have slow or
intermittent connectivity so we've
started doing more to really emphasize
with those using a network lock was the
first tool that we use with that we were
able to reduce the amount of data we
were exchanging because we were able to
tackle some bugs in our code the matter
profiler is another tool that we use
with that we were able to make sure that
what's inside the memory is what is made
to be and nothing more since we are a
language learning application and we
support different of fish languages lint
is a great tool for us with leads were
able to make sure that we have hundred
percent of the data complete and correct
when we were focusing on performances
one thing that we sought is imp database
was huge so we decide ok let's get rid
of the database let's go online we were
able to reduce the increased size from
60 megabytes to 25 megabytes there was a
huge improvement for us and we saw a lot
more downloads from emerging markets
following our work on performance we've
seen a weekly average rating stream from
four point one to four point five which
is the highest we've ever had every
developer has to make sure that their
own app is working in every type of
device in every type of environment
having more tools there are competent
performances for sure we'll have and
we'll make developers life easier
performance is not something that you
set aside and forget about and something
you have to instill in the culture of
the business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
