developer relations team at Google today
I'm going to be talking about the
storage access framework in KitKat
specifically the client apps ID in our
last episode about the storage access
framework we saw the new system
documents UI that lets you easier of
your app browse content from all apps on
the device that share documents today
we're going to walk through how to
launch the UI and how to handle the
results in your app there's more to it
than there used to be new and Android
KitKat our document editing writing and
saving in place and document creation
and deletion here's a quick picture of
the flow as you can see document
providers and clients don't interact
directly just as before a client
requests permission to interact with
files read edit create etc the system
picker goes to each registered provider
and shows the user the matching content
finally the user selects a document and
the system grants the client app
permissions just for that URI let's talk
about action open document this isn't
much different than what you may have
done before you're going to create an
intent category open amol means we only
want results that can be open basically
documents as opposed to a list of
contacts or time zones the type is the
document mime type you want here I'm
asking for any type of image and then
launch your intent with a request code
this can be any value you like but it
should be unique within your app and we
launched the file picker next the user
selects the document and it's back to
your app retrieving a URI is also the
same as before we get a callback and on
activity result we check the request
code matches and the result came back ok
now we don't get back the specific
document directly here we get a URI
pointing to it using intent get data if
you've done this before with the get
content or pick intents nothing's
changed
and this might look familiar to with a
URI we can get metadata about the image
here this query applies to only one
document and we want all the rows that's
what all those nulls are for here I'm
getting its display name note this is
not the same as its file name and size
you can't count on getting a reliable
size for a document because it might be
stored remotely for example so always
check that it isn't no before you try
and get the size but forget metadata you
probably want to open this image
here's a shortcut you can use content
resolver open file descriptor you pass
in the URI and the access mode you want
and you get back a parcel file
descriptor which is a wrapper around a
file descriptor for images there's a
handy method in bitmap factory decode
file descriptor don't do this on the UI
thread do it in the background use an
async task there's an example of this in
the storage client sample code that
we're posting and finally it's best
practice to wrap the clothes in a try
finally block so it's guaranteed to
close and then you can set this image to
an image view yeah here it is
now wait you're saying I want to do
something else or I don't have an image
easy you can get an input stream from
the content resolver and do whatever you
want with it
here I'm reading the lines of my file
into a string so here's a new one we
weren't able to do this before you can
get an output stream from the content
resolver by default it uses write mode
you want to ask for the least amount of
access you need so don't ask for
read/write if all you need is right when
I'm done I just let the document
provider know I'm done by closing the
stream which you have to do anyway
simple so we could open one document
before what about lots of documents at
the same time all you have to do is to
let the user select multiples is add
extra allow multiple it's your intent if
you want you can specify multiple mime
types this time we get back clip data
it's in stored an intent get clip data
and you can get the you are eyes using
clip data get items and then item get
URI
note that you still have to check intent
get data the same as a single URI
because if the user picks just one
document doesn't matter if you allowed
multiple selection it's still coming
back the first way in intent get data so
you have to check both
creating a document is also new an
android kitkat and it's really
straightforward
you give your intent a mime type a file
name and you launch it with a unique
request code the rest is taken care of
for you you get back its URI in on
activity result and that way you can
continue to write to it
or whatever else you want and deleting a
document is even easier you can't launch
an intent to delete a document but if
you have its URI which you would if
you've opened or created it then you can
ask to delete it and documents contract
does this for you again in a documents
metadata you can check document column
flags if that contains support delete
you'll know whether to enable or disable
your delete button or menu option one
more thing to mention when you open a
file for reading or writing the system
gives you a URI permission grant for
that file it lasts until your device
restarts however you might want to
access that file again directly from
your application say you're an image
editing app and you want to show the
user the last five images they've edited
if the device is turned off in the
meantime you won't have access to those
you could send the user back to the
document picker but that's far from
ideal instead you can per miss persist
the permissions the system gave you
now they'll last no matter whether the
phone is turned off or on the system
won't do this automatically for you your
app has to explicitly request that the
permissions be persisted
this is a security measure that's a good
thing one last note you may have saved
the most recent URIs your app accessed
but you should still always use content
resolver get persisted URI permissions
to check that you have the freshest data
other applications could delete
documents apps could be removed so make
this check to make sure your data is
right that's all for now hope you
enjoyed learning about the new storage
access features in Android KitKat
thanks for watching and happy document
sharing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
