me my name is Gary Lowe I'm the lead
Android developer at do me
we provide search tools information for
buyers investors sellers renters and
agents australia-wide we're a big
company with over 500 people in a number
of different products we're three
developers on the Android team and we
work very closely with our design and UX
teams I'm Enrique I'm product manager
here at Omaha it's been a very
interesting time for us or Android app
has come a long way over the past few
years
when Gary and I started that was really
counterintuitive there were problems
with navigation and user feedback was
really cool well to educate our team and
redesign our app specifically for the
Android platform we were really lucky
that the business supported us and
really invested in developing your best
practice Android app once we'd embrace
their android framework we really start
to take advantage of all the tools at
Google and Android gave us we wanted to
provide the user with understanding of
the surroundings of a property we've got
Google Maps we wanted timely
notifications to the user and we've got
GCM push we wanted to help users
discover properties as they walk along
the street you've got geofencing Play
services just makes it so easy for us to
create those experiences 2014 was a
really big year for us we released a
number of great features for search
integration with Google now and adoption
of
material design gives you a very strong
guideline as to how to design them just
makes the experience so much more
immersive the response was amazing we've
had a 44% increase in monthly downloads
placing domain up in the top five
lifestyle apps in Australia being able
to hear real people tell us how great
their app is and how it's helped them
find the home it's fantastic
we've gone from a 2.8 star rating in the
Play Store to 4.1 the future of the app
is constantly evolving and changing to
really make the life of our users easier
in that home buying process and has been
really big year for us and we can't wait
to see what the Android platform will
give us next
