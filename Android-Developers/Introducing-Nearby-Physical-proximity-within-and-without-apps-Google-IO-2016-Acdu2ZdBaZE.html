thanks everybody for coming cool let's
get started yeah hi everyone I'm Akshay
cannon
I'm Andrew Bonner and in this talk we'll
cover nearby a set of cross-platform
api's for devices to discover and
communicate with the things around them
we'll start by talking about the nearby
messages API which lets devices find
each other and communicate simply by
being near each other without having to
be connected to the same Wi-Fi next
we'll talk about how you can use that
same API as our recommended way to scan
for ble beacons along with best
practices for things like background
scanning and finally we'll leave you
with a preview of something new which
we're excited to unveil for the first
time ever today let's get started our
devices today have made it easy to
communicate with anyone whether they're
right next to you or on the other side
of the world however a lot of those
interactions can feel cumbersome if
someone or something is right next to
you and often that's the case today it
takes several steps whether it's
exchanging contact information scanning
the QR code or pairing via bluetooth
just to get some information over to a
nearby device and we believe this
shouldn't be the case ideally you should
be able to just walk up to something and
interact with it the same way that we do
in the real world physical awareness can
significantly improve the experiences in
our apps whether it's facilitating
device to device communication real-time
collaboration or experiences that are
triggered by beacon wood nearby we've
created a simple set of API s for anyone
to bring proximity into their app so
we've been working towards this vision
for for a while in 2014 we launched a
feature called guest mode on chromecast
now in the past you had to be on the
same Wi-Fi network in order to cast but
with guest mode you're going to sit down
hit cast and put your content on the big
screen now to make this possible to
prove that you're in the same room as
the cast device we use a combination of
radio signals and an ultrasonic modem
and it's great when you're over at a
friend's house works on iOS works on
Android and we would like more cross
device interactions to be as smooth as
guest mode so in 2015 we took the
technology that powers guest mode and we
made it available via an API we call
nearby messages it's a simple
publish/subscribe API for message
passing between devices that are like
physically close together it's available
on Google Play services for Android and
on iOS Viera cocoa pod now because it's
cross-platform
you don't have to segment your user base
so that means Android users as far back
as Gingerbread can talk to iOS users
going back to iOS 7 so I think that's
pretty neat there's a number of great
apps that are using it today and more
developers are discovering it all the
time will soon dive into the details of
how you can call the nearby API and as
well as how it works behind the scenes
but first we want to show you examples
of the experiences that developers are
built with it my favorite podcast app on
the Play Store is pocket casts I found a
great podcast the other day that I
wanted to share with Andrew sharing
typically takes me through a list of
contacts where have to search for and
pick out Andrew even though he's
standing right next to me and if I don't
already have Andrews contact information
it's even worse we have to exchange
contact information before being able to
do anything
so instead pocket cast has built a much
more compelling experience for comparing
podcasts with the people around you
using nearby let's check out what it
looks like
so Andrew and I both swipe over to the
nearby section of the app and we tap
search and at this point pocket Cass
publishes each of our list of podcasts
over nearby and I can see Andrew has
some pretty interesting podcasts now
we've got the basis covered here but I
see you are missing the adventure zone
it's hilarious highly recommended and
fragmented awesome all have to do is tap
and now I have them pocket casts use
this nearby to make it really easy to
share content within their app another
great example Trello is a popular team
collaboration tool that lets you get
things done with the people around you
Trello allows you to create boards that
give you a shared perspective on a
projects tasks with nearby Trello has
made it easy to quickly start up
collaborations with one tap you could
share a board nearby it making it
available to the people around you
without having to type in email
addresses the board is online so Trello
can simply pass around a pointer to
their back-end object over nearby to
enable this experience pocket casts
Trello and several other apps are live
on the Play Store today
using nearby so you can install them and
try the experience out for yourself in
fact we launched this API in July of
last year so some of you may already be
using it in your apps today all right
thanks actually I'm going to walk you
through how it works what it looks like
in code and then go into some details on
the permissions and the privacy so let's
start with how it works we've got these
two calls published and subscribe there
for passing messages but what actually
happens so when your app calls nearby we
allocate a short-lived pairing code to
your device and then we use a variety of
means to get that code across the air
gap to other nearby devices and then any
devices that detect the same code they
can then exchange messages so it's a
little different from traditional
location and that it's very hard to
spoof these codes now by default we use
a variety of tricks to get this code
from one phone to another Bluetooth
classic Bluetooth low-energy and
ultrasound using all three of those
helps ensure that nearby works
just the widest possible range of
devices so both Bluetooth classic and
Bluetooth Low Energy are 2.4 gigahertz
radios this is the same part of the
spectrum as like Wi-Fi and old-fashioned
cordless phones and those radio waves go
through walls one of the reasons
ultrasound is an important part of our
offering is that it does not go through
walls and that privacy mode kind of
mirrors what people expect in the real
world like if I can see you and talk to
you you can hear what I'm saying but if
you're in the next room maybe in the
line outside you can and that's very
powerful and it gives a sharing use case
as a sense of privacy that's hard to
achieve with Bluetooth alone and you
know side benefit is that we found that
that using audio in this way it really
does work just about everywhere every
phone has a speaker every phone has a
microphone and it turns out they all
work pretty well in this part of the
spectrum in fact as we learned working
with chromecast and more recently Google
Play Movies televisions are also pretty
good at making sounds we can't hear so
it's quite versatile okay this video
that you see over here on the side this
is a frequency domain plot of our audio
signal that bump on the far right that's
our data it starts around like eighteen
point five kilohertz and it trails off
around twenty point five kilohertz so
technically that's near ultrasound and
incidentally this is a screenshot of an
app speedy spectrum and we had to use
this during the development of nearby
because none of us could tell if the
phones were actually making any sounds
we none of us could hear it and there's
an another reason for that is that you
know the sound is coming out of these
pretty small speakers on a phone and
it's just not a very high amplitude
sound wave and that's okay
we don't need much energy in the sound
in order to decode it on the other side
so if we take this this signal that you
see there and slowed it way down
basically shifting it to arrange that
you can hear it would sound sort of like
a static hiss and that's because it's a
spread spectrum signal so here's how
that works
we take our pairing code and then we use
that to modulate some prearranged static
noise and by encoding our data
inside that static we basically make our
modem robust to like echoes and other
interference so it really does work just
about everywhere okay so enough signal
processing let's take a look at some
code and see how you can use all this
we're going to start with the general
like use all the technology sample on
Android and here it is it's just these
two calls publish and subscribe you call
you call publish to make your message
available to nearby devices you can
think of the message as what your phone
says and then you call subscribe to
receive messages from a nearby device
that's how you listen now the message
it's just a byte array you can put kind
of whatever you want in there with
whatever encoding so JSON protocol
buffers whatever is easiest the only
restriction is that it has to be less
than 100 kilobytes so that means it's
good for sending like authorization
tokens or invites or identifiers but not
for larger content like images or movies
so if we go back to the pocket cast
example they published the list of the
podcasts not the bytes of the audio
tracks themselves and here's the iOS
version it's very simpler very very
similar it's got square brackets and
it's got a hundred percent of feature
parity and compatibility with the
Android version we're very proud of that
now this ear shot feature this is
something special if you want to make
your message available only to devices
in the same room this is how you do it
there's thousands of lines of like
correlation math and signal processing
and under the hood but you don't have to
worry about that we just call set
distance type your shot and well and
that's it very simple all right
last I want to talk about privacy and
transparency so we think it's important
that a user know when an app is using
nearby and that they know what's
actually happening so before an app can
call nearby they have to get permission
so this is our runtime permission dialog
and we're going to show this when an app
calls nearby it explains what radios and
what sensors we use and how and in fact
tapping on learn more will give the user
as detailed an understanding of what's
happening under the hood as the
developer reading our documentation and
that's on purpose in both directions we
want the user to be
formed and we want the developer to be
able to focus on their features so it's
basically this this dialogue by the way
this is a once per app thing so it's
really similar to marshmallows runtime
permissions we just you know took those
rules and backported them to gingerbread
and this is kind of an important point
you don't have to change your manifest
because it's a runtime permission you
don't have to change your manifest you
can just add the feature without
worrying about breaking automatic
updates but because we are going to show
this dialogue you want to have the user
do something explicit to access your
nearby feature and that way you know
when we show the dialogue it's connected
in the users minds with the action that
they just took so maybe have a special
screen like pocket casts or a widget
that turns it on like Trello so the user
is in control they're asked for
permission in context and the the app
developer doesn't have to worry about
breaking automatic updates oh there's
one more thing the there's a
notification there that you see when an
app has an active publisher subscribe
going this shows up and from there the
user can it stop or they can even revoke
the permission so total control to the
user okay
so we've just seen how easy it is to add
peer-to-peer features to your app with
nearby I want to talk about using nearby
with beacons so beacons are these these
simple transmitters they're often
disconnected and running on a battery
and they emit identifiers these are 31
byte strings that you can use to mark
important places or objects and then
your app can scan and get these
identifiers and then figure out if the
user is near something of interest
there's a number of apps that are doing
this today and generally they're using
the platform api's directly or they're
using an open source library on top I'm
going to try to convince you and if your
app scans for beacons I'm going to try
to convince you to switch from whatever
you're doing now to using this new
version of nearby and we've got several
reasons for this and I think after after
we share these I hope you'll agree that
nearby is is a great way to interact
with beacons we really wanted to make
this worth your a while I think we did
so we've got three reasons let's uh
let's start with this one
so this is for developers who they want
to add to scan for beacons but they've
been afraid to add the Bluetooth admin
permission now we want users and
developers to have a consistent
permission story around beacon scanning
and today that's that's just not the
case on marshmallow you can stand for
beacons if you have access to
fine-grained location but on lollipop
and below you need the Bluetooth admin
permission and unless your app was doing
something with beacons from the very
beginning you probably don't have this
permission and adding it is going to
break your automatic updates and that
has real business consequences for many
of you also we're not even sure it makes
sense Bluetooth admin actually lets you
do a lot more than just scan for beacons
so with nearby we are changing the rules
when your app scans for beacons through
nearby you only need access to
fine-grained location on all platforms
so we took the marshmallow scanning
rules and we ported them back to
jellybean mr2 when we first introduced
beacon scanning and this is again this
is an important point most apps will be
able to add support for beacon scanning
without updating their manifest all
right the second reason is you're
probably going to get more scans for
free just by using your by now I'm going
to explain kind of with an analogy here
and I hope you'll see where it's going
so let's take Wi-Fi now if you use the
platform's Wi-Fi Manager you can
passively listen for scan results that
are triggered by other apps so you can
kind of piggyback on the scans that they
initiate but ble in the platform has
historically worked differently each app
has to trigger a scan and then only that
apps use the results of that scan but
when you scan for beacons through nearby
subscribe we will do a scan every time
the screen turns on and all the apps
using nearby will benefit from that scan
we'll route any beacons matching your
apps filter over to you and if an app
explicitly triggers a scan through
nearby again all the apps that are using
nearby will benefit all you have to do
is tell us which beacons you're looking
for ahead of time and then we'll route
beacons matching that filter over to
your app and you'll get to process those
sightings now there's there's one more
important trigger that I want to match
here and that's location history if the
user has location history enabled that
service will do ble scans in the
background throughout the day and if it
finds anything matching your apps filter
again we're going to route them to you
and you'll get to process those beacons
so more free scans when you use nearby
ok the last reason is for folks you know
doing background scans now if you're
doing background scans today chances are
that you're scheduling alarms you're
grabbing wakelocks you're using the job
scheduler you're trying to run a
background service it's it's pretty
involved it's pretty difficult and it's
actually getting even harder with
Android n but if you use nearby and we
find a beacon of yours we will wake your
app up to tell you about it even if your
app has been killed so ok yes that's
that's my one applause line thank you so
this makes background scanning with
nearby just a whole lot simpler than the
alternative so again if any app you know
or location history or that screen on
scan any of those scans find an app for
your find a beacon for your app we're
going to relaunch your app via pending
intent and you get to process the beacon
so for all these reasons nearby ZAR a
recommended API for interacting with
beacons and you know by by itself I
think those three represent a pretty
compelling argument to switch but just
in case you're not convinced there's
there's more coming so we're to be
adding some features in the coming weeks
in particular you'll get access to the
the raw eye beacon and Eddystone frames
directly you'll be able to use your own
beacon cloud registry and you'll have
distance callbacks so we're really
improving this all the time and there'll
be samples for all this up on github
once the SDK drops again we think it's a
win for both users and for you guys for
developers if you want to go deep on
beacons there's a talk happening right
after this in stage 4 about the Google
Thank You stage for the Google beacon
platform deep dive on the proximity
beacon service okay so that's nearby
messages it's available today on Google
Play services for Android and on iOS VR
cocoa pod and we're improving at every
release so really whether you're using
beacons or you're doing something pure
here it's just a great way to add
proximity features to your app thanks
Andrew now on to something new as you've
seen nearby messages gives apps a
powerful set of API s to interact with
nearby devices and beacons but of course
this requires the app to be installed in
the first place what if you're out of
place but you don't yet have the app
that lets you interact with it or
perhaps there's a mobile website that
lets you interact with something when
you're physically there there are often
proximity driven features in apps or
websites that can make our users lives
better but not if you don't even know
about them we want to solve this problem
so today we're announcing a new feature
in Android for you to know about
relevant nearby experiences surface
through ble from the things around you
and we're calling this nearby
notifications so how does it work let's
say you purchase a brand new chromecast
today the first thing that you have to
do is to go to the Play Store search for
the chromecast app find it download it
all before you can start using this
brand new device imagine instead if any
smart device you purchase could
broadcast the setup experience for it
and would nearby you could get the
companion app and pair with it simply by
tapping a notification another example I
recently flew into SFO from abroad and
had to go through US Customs I installed
this app airside mobile passport which
allowed me to go through a much much
faster line dedicated to mobile passport
users with nearby my phone could tell me
that that experience was available and
let me install the app with a single tap
and another more everyday example the
target app has a feature that lets you
scan a product in the store and see
online reviews it's an easy way to get
more information about something before
you put it into your cart and it's
extremely relevant when you're at a
store but it's tricky to get to this
feature if you don't know about it
once again nearby can help we aim to
solve discovery in a quiet but helpful
way so on Android we're introducing
nearby not just as an API
but as a core user-facing feature and
creating new ways for developers to
expose relevant experiences over ble you
can look for this in the coming weeks as
part of an update to Google Play
services this will work on devices
running jellybean mr2 and above here are
some examples of what it looks like when
Bluetooth and location are turned on
will show you relevant content from the
beacons around you so what does this
look like in the real world let's go
back to the target example and imagine
that we're there
I've been running low on shaving
supplies so I'm here to stock up I'm in
the aftershave aisle trying to find the
perfect product and as I'm looking
around one of them catches my eye
caffeinated aftershave could this be too
good to be true I need to know if this
actually works so I decide to pull out
my phone and check out reviews now
normally I'd have to type in the name of
this product and search for reviews
about it but this time target has
associated their app with a beacon in
the store when I swipe down on
notifications I see target scan barcodes
see reviews at this point all I had to
do was turn my screen on in the store
the only requirement for me to see this
was to have location and Bluetooth
enabled my phone doesn't buzz but when I
swipe down on notifications I get this
helpful hint tapping on this
notification launches me directly into
the barcode scanning experience in the
target app if I didn't have the app
installed target could have either
launched me to a mobile website or
directly to their app install which
we'll talk more about in a bit and now I
can scan the barcode
and I can see that it costs 549 I can
tap over 2 reviews I can see that people
have been pretty happy with it it has a
five-star review
and the reviews look pretty good so I'm
convinced and I decide to throw it into
my cart so this is just one example of
the many experiences that you can
associate with a place or device using
nearby nearby introduces an entirely new
surface to Android for proximity driven
discovery and we're excited to see what
you'll build with it so how do you get
started there are three types of content
that you can attach to your beacon first
we support simple HTTP web URLs these
can point to websites or to instant apps
would you heard about in the keynote
earlier today second we support intents
into your app along with a URL fallback
to the mobile web for users who don't
have your app installed and third we're
experimenting with direct app installs
we're tapping the notification will let
you install the app even if it's not
there and then launch you into the
intended experience that's our other
applause line by the way it's still
early days and we want to be careful to
hold the user experience bar high so we
have a set of criteria for early
inclusion in our direct app install
program which we'll talk more about in
the coming slides
so that's your binder nutshell there are
several verticals where we can help
users discover relevant experiences
travel museum sports retail smart
devices and I'm sure you'll all find
more now I'll have things over to Andrew
we'll talk more about the our criteria
for whitelist of app installs along with
the details of how you can tie your
feature to a beacon thanks actually so
we expect many of you many developers to
be interested in this app install
feature we we recognize that installs
are very valuable but we want to be
careful to balance the user experience
against the overhead of an install now
the instant apps that you heard about
earlier that those will change that
equation but for now for the traditional
app install we're evaluating partner
integrations against
some pretty specific criteria these
these criteria could evolve but in the
interest of transparency we want to
share with you what we're looking for so
the first and the most important
criteria is your app has a feature
that's relevant at a place or near a
device if the feature is not
contextually relevant then it's just not
for nearby the second is that we want
features that let a user do something so
not just informational but
action-oriented and then the third is
we're looking at how broadly relevant is
this notification to all the people
receiving it so for example if you
manufacture a smart device like maybe a
smart fridge and that device requires a
companion app as part of its setup
experience then that app is super
relevant to the devices out of box
experience right it's being as you need
it now
other other sort of ideas are a little
bit harder for us to evaluate so for
example if you think about maybe like
sale information at a store like does
everyone in the store care that the sale
is happening it's a little bit hard for
us to say and so for now we're erring on
the side of caution and then the fourth
is really a kind of a technical
consideration you want to be sure that
the user can launch directly into your
promoted feature like we did with target
in the barcode scanner if you can't then
that's something you'd want to address
before you apply to this program okay so
I'm going to take you through a few of
our partners to give you a sense of the
ecosystem that we're building so I'm
going to start with United this app has
many features but I'm going to zero in
on just this one United offers free
inflate movies and entertainment through
their app but you have to have the app
and speaking from personal experience if
you take off and you've forgotten to
install this app your children will be
disappointed in you
so reminding the user to install it when
they're still waiting at the departure
gate it's both contextually relevant and
it's very useful now here's another one
that's a combination of both device and
place so at many CVS pharmacies they
have a photo kiosk and this lets you
print photos right from your phone and
you know compared to like uploading
photos to a website and like waiting for
it in the mail it's pretty magical
but the process is
even more magical if you have the app
and that's because the app lets you
establish a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi
connection with the kiosk and it makes
the photo selection process much much
faster so here again there's something
that the user can do and it's relevant
out of place so one more the broad it's
a new modern art museum in LA and
they've got a great in-app audio tour
now chances are you wouldn't listen to
this tour at home but if you're in the
museum it's very relevant to getting the
most out of your experience so these
were all features that required an app
installed I'm going to offer one counter
example that doesn't require our
approval because it just uses the web
and that's Notre Dame so Notre Dame
besides being a respected Institute of
higher learning is also a popular
tourist destination for its many
historic buildings and landmarks and
they created a virtual tour by placing
beacons around the campus and what they
did was they associated each beacon with
a mobile webpage that has more
information and maybe even a story about
that specific place now they've got both
an app and a mobile website but in their
case the mobile web provided as good an
experience as the app and so it was the
right choice we're taking a lighter
touch when it comes to nearby in the web
really we're just filtering out harmful
links and you know things like Google
search infrastructure would classify as
spam so so that gives you an idea of the
kind of feature that we want to bring
forward we see nearby and Android as
helping users discover new ways to get
things done alright so let's get into
some of the technical details I'm going
to talk you through how to take
advantage of nearby in this new way one
of the great things about this program
is it doesn't require any programming
most of our partners were able to get
things to just work with zero code
modifications to their app now there is
some work but it's just on the beacon
side so I'm going to get into that
there's basically these four steps you
need to get some beacons you need to set
them up to advertise what you want
register them with Google and then tie
them to your app or website so starting
at step one you need something that can
be advertised so if you manufacture a
smart device it's just
the device but for installations out of
place we recommend getting some
Eddystone beacons so if you visit gqo
slash beacons we've got links to 15 or
so beacon partners and their web stores
but if you if you can't wait to receive
your beacons in the mail you can also
turn an Android or iOS phone into a
temporary beacon just by using the
platform's advertising api's okay so
next we have to configure the beacon
provision that we say so some of the
manufacturers will do this for you and
if not they all provide companion apps
this is a screen shot of radius networks
red beacon app but they all look similar
and do sort of similar things so again
so far we bought some beacons we
installed an app no programming now if
you want to use the physical web or
Eddystone URL you could actually be done
at this step here at step two now the
physical web is an open standard for
encoding a web URL directly in that
identifier being emitted from the beacon
it's a it works on Chrome on both iOS
and Android and nearby is going to be
adding support for it in the coming
weeks now in fact there's a talk
tomorrow 10:00 a.m. actually on this
stage but if you want to take advantage
of the more advanced features the app
launching the the app installing then
you want to choose Eddystone UID or ID
start an eID at this step and we've got
two more short steps so you need to
claim ownership of the beacon you can do
that with our beacon tools app you just
get near the beacon select it in the app
hit register now besides unlocking in
the app install and me the app you know
launching features this has some other
benefits the beacon will show up in our
web dashboard and you'll be able to see
it on a map you can monitor its battery
level basically the beacon becomes
location infrastructure that you own and
then last week we need to tie the beacon
to your app or website and we do this
with an attachment now if you're an
expert thumb typer maybe you're a
millennial you can do this directly
inside the app and enter in all that
JSON I personally recommend the the
beacon dashboard it's a web tool against
linked from geo slash beacons all right
so let's let's look at that attachment
it's got these fields and this tells us
what
put in that notification and then where
to take the user when they tap on it now
again the beautiful thing about nearby
is most of you won't have to change your
apps to create these contextual
notifications there's one tricky part of
this integration and that's just this
URL so I'm going to show you a little
bit more on that
now will will provide some tools and
documentation on how to get this right
but here's what to know if the URL looks
like the top one then we take that to
mean that it requires an app install
this is the one that requires our
approval and we'll have a sign up form
at the end and I'll tell you about if it
looks like the middle one then we'll
launch the app if it's already installed
then if it's not we'll go to the mobile
web fallback that you specify
no reprove are required and then for the
last one if it's just a regular HTTP URL
we'll just open the web page now for the
first two the URLs that are going to
launch an app you want to make sure that
the scheme host and path in that URL
matches up to an intent filter in your
manifest and that's just so that we can
launch your app directly into the right
screen again this is all launching soon
all documented at developers.google.com
slash nearby okay so if you want to
experiment with the app install feature
prior to being wait-listed or you just
want to try out an attachment before
making it public there's a way to mark
the attachment as debug and then once
nearby rolls out it'll show up on phones
that are in developer mode but not the
general population okay this is this is
the important part if you'd like to
apply to be white listed for the app
install program there's a sign-up form
again at developers.google.com slash
nearby now that signup form is geared
towards apps like Target and like mobile
passport these are folks who've got
beacons deployed and they've got a
strong user story around a contextual
experience and then of course smart
devices in fact we actually did some
integrations inside Google with teams
like like chromecast and like where to
help people install companion apps but
we're most excited to see what you guys
build on top of this new nearby
notifications platform so there it is
we're building nearby into Android as a
core feature allowing users to discover
things around them whether it's
contextual apps for the place that
they're at peer to peer collaborative
experiences
interactions with another smart device
we hope you like it thank you
