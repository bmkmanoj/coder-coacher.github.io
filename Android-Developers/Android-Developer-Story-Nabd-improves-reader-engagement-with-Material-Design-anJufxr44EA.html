then if you wanted to read Arabic news
on mobile it was very very happy we
decided to solve this problem by
building a personalized how to become a
leader that is able to aggregate all the
news and deliver it to the right person
based on their preference and based on
the location Android has the majority in
smartphone market share that the Middle
East so we knew that publishing adopt on
Android was heat our success since we
launched not on Google Play we've seen
the app rolling massively in a very
short time currently 60% of our users
are on the Android platform the number
of daily installs we get on Android is 2
times higher than other platforms user
engagement is extremely high enough
users can share stories fear with them
or a comment and then within the knop
community every quarter there is over 7
million stories that are being shared on
social networks by Android users and we
found that the average number of shared
stories per user is 20% higher on
Android than other platforms one of the
reasons why engagement on Android is
higher is the fact that implemented
material design when material design was
announced we were impressed with the new
visual side and functionalities it took
us three months to redesign the app
completely and make the transition to a
real design
one of the major changes we've done in
the new version was adding a material
design tab layout we shifted one of the
sections from the side menu to the tab
layout and we found that the users will
discover the section increased by 400%
once we redesigned the app we use
stories
experiments to find the optimal
screenshots and the best order of
screenshots that lead to the highest
number of installs we also found that
having a video in your store listing
increases conversions by 8% material
design had a significant impact on user
behavior for us the most exciting part
was to see that the number of five-star
ratings actually tripled after the
inversion we constantly use Google
Analytics to understand the behavior of
users and how they interact with the app
and based on our analysis we optimize
the design of the app in order to get
the best results three years ago there
was no such thing as no today we're over
25 people across four offices in Kuwait
Saudi Arabia Dubai Egypt and very soon
in Turkey and that feels amazing it's a
joy in action that I can't really
