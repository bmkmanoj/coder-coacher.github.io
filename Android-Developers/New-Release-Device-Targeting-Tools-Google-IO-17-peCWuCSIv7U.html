thank you so much for joining us here in
the audience and on the livestream my
name is Sarah I head up business
development for indie games on Google
Play hi I'm Colby I'm a product manager
for Google Play hi I'm Elena engineering
manager on Google Play we're here to
talk to you about some cool tools we're
launching in Google Play Developer
console to help you better release your
apps and games we want to make sure you
can launch with confidence and better
target your apps and games to the right
devices in a way that makes great
experiences for all your users we'll
start with a quick recap of everything
to change in this area in the past year
followed by talking about some big
improvements we've made to release
management flows in Google Play console
in the past year we will then go on to
announce the new features changes to app
signing new device catalog and device
targeting tools we occurred that some of
these areas are the ones where you would
like to see feedback and insight from
Google most so we're very excited to
show you what we've built so before we
get to the new features let's start with
a quick recap of what happened in this
space and last year so exactly a year
ago at Google i/o we launched open beta
a new way for users to discover your
apps running beta on Google Play and
join them users can find your apps
search them join the beta directly from
the store listing page I'll leave you
with private review which you can see in
the play console open beta is a great
way for you to test your new updates
before you launch them live to your
users so this open beta allows you to
really scale with our programs on Play
and in the last year alone we've seen
more than 100 million beta testers on
Google Play there's another number which
we're really excited about which is at
4x growth in the number of apps running
a large beta program on place
we get great feedback from developer
like what's up telling us how open beta
allows them to get critical feedback
from millions of Vita testers it allows
them to experiment with app when new
features and it's one of the key ways
they're able to deliver such an awesome
messaging experience to so many users
globally and we get this feedback from
team send VP of engineering at snap by
the way stop with one of the early
adopters of video testing on Google Play
they use it for more than four years now
mr. stem tells us how open beta allows
them to deliver such a stable of
experience in is key to their ability to
innovate with new app experiences so
together with those changes we've also
launched a developer program called
early access has anyone here given early
access to try a couple hands if you
haven't highly recommend you to check it
out so this is a program that will allow
you to put your apps or games in front
of early adopters while your game is
still in development so the audience of
early testers they're going to be able
to provide you with really valuable
feedback we've captured and continued to
grow a significant user base of highly
engaged users that are more than willing
to give you that detailed granular
feedback around how your game or how
your app is performing so currently we
have 25 million users and Counting that
are actually leveraging that early
access program since last year 2016 so
one great example here is Omni drone
this is developer of Titan brawl and
they're from Spain and they entered into
early access and they saw more than
400,000 users enter into the game they
started by focusing on engagement that
was the first thing they decided to
iterate on they then went on to iterate
on retention and finally monetization so
with early access they were able to
improve their engagement rate by 50
I mean that's a really meaty number and
then later monetization went up by 20%
this is even before they actually
launched publicly so we're really elated
to be able to see these Android only
tools and services move the needle in a
really meaningful way towards the
success of their Dames launch and Omni
drone has told us that within early
access they were able to get enough
traffic into their game to really
analyze and improve the retention as
well as take on their marketing assets
and test that in-store experiments even
before going live they also told us that
that private feedback was invaluable
you see one of the great features about
early access is that users cannot rate
your game or app at that time so all
that great feedback you're getting from
them does not actually impact your store
ratings it's helped them to improve
their game experience based on that user
feedback which is always a really great
practice to follow the launch of early
access is just one of ways in which
Android and play are continually
evolving in order to keep pace with this
and in order to give you guys the tools
to use all the functionality we build to
to its full potential we have recently
overhauled the entire release management
section in the Google Play console app
releases replace the previous apk page
and introduced some pretty significant
changes in the way how you prepare your
next release and roll it out to users
firstly we introduced the concept of a
release and the consistent terminology
throughout the flow including things
like rollout or artifact is anyone in
the audience using multi apk yes you
yeah quite a few so cause of the release
is generally useful but especially so
for you guys it gives you an apocalyptic
way to look at all the apks that are
active at the time in a holistic way and
also to see which one of them's were
added now and which one were carried
over from previous releases one more
important change is the ability to
separate release preparation process
from it
roll-out previously had to do this weird
dance where you upload some your apks
you deactivate the old ones and then you
have to publish the whole lot at once
now you can create a draft release and
save it in various stages of completion
you can then go for lunch come back make
some other changes in the console and
only roll it out when you're relief
ready ensure one of the primary goals of
the new flow was to enable you to
release with confidence we got plenty of
feedback from from developers like
yourselves they're being scared to
publish because they're not sure what
are going to be the consequences to to
their existing in new users we also got
some feedback that some of our error
messages are not very clear so these
were critical as we were designing new
flows we made sure that everything is
much more explicit in the new flows we
now provide confirmation options at
various points in the flow which reduces
the risk of accidentally doing the bad
or unintended push for your users for
example we now have a new page which
allows you to review the release before
you roll it out
this page will highlight any issue
issues and warned or even block you
depending on the issue severity as part
of this process we actually changed some
of the previously very strict rules
around how we decide toward or block you
this especially applies to things like
upgrades and targeting the cross steps
Android device space at the same time we
have some new rules to give you more
visibility into various other things
that could go wrong with your release
for example we now warn you if there is
you if you're introducing a new
permission which will reduce your app
update rate or when you are excluding
some devices which you were previously
targeting another change we made with
the new flow is making staged rollouts
front and center now we love staged
rollouts we think it's a great way for
you to confidently release your updates
to users you start with a new seed if it
performs correctly you update until you
hit 100% in the new flow we made the UI
front and center it's very easy to set
staged rollout we also show you how many
devices you will
target with each percent of the rollout
and one feature that we already got some
positive developer feedback on is the
new ability to set custom percentages
like the three percent you see right
here since launching the new flow we've
seen a number we're really excited about
we've seen 50 percent increase in the
number of developers that are using
staged rollout we love seeing this you
know staged rollout is a really
recommended best practice and many of
our top developers use it practically to
release each one of their app updates
there's some other really cool features
that we launched as part of the new flow
for example you can see a log of your
release so when you push to 5% 10% or a
hundred percent you can see a history of
all your historical releases and one
feature we think is really cool is your
ability to download historical apks from
the play console so if you're trying to
reproduce the bug from one of your
previous releases you go to the play
console and you download that apk moving
forward we're getting ready for the
world beyond the apk starting today and
you probably heard the announcement
earlier in the developer keynote we are
opening publishing of android instant
apps from the play console using a very
similar flow to the for you're all
familiar with with updating your regular
installed apps so it should be very easy
for you guys to come to the play console
and publish your android instant apps
starting today if you want to hear more
about that come to the session intro to
android instant apps tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. right here on stage 2 now there are
two features that are coming soon and we
think you'll be pretty excited about if
you're using our publishing API is to
programmatically push your app updates
soon will expose the new end point for
releases allowing you to push the change
to the Play console but then go to the
Play console UI look at the validation
pages that Malena mentioned before to
understand the state of your release and
only then make the publishing action
from the play console
and then also with the best tradition of
google launching and iterating once we
launch the new flow we heard your
feedback loud and clear how we should
further improve the process around
release notes oh as we call them what's
new
we know that today it's a bit of a time
sink for you guys especially if you
manage release notes across multiple
languages therefore I'm happy to let you
know that very soon like you see here we
will offer you a new format allowing you
to edit all your release notes offline
and then with a single copy and paste
action move into the play console with a
single tick of a body we think it will
be a big time-saver for you guys in the
feature you'd really like so we've had a
few developers now using the new flow
and sharing their experience with us
for example freeletics care developer of
health and fitness apps tells us that
the numinous releases page gives them a
greatly improved status overview of
their releases and Deliver is pretty
pleased with the ease of use and
convenient overview that they now get
with staged rollouts now they can see
exactly how many installs that they are
expected to get to that stage rollout
while providing them with a whole new
and exciting level of control ok so now
you guys can actually roll out your app
in-game to users with higher confidence
but you still want to understand how
your release is actually performing well
this is why we're launching another
great feature right here the release
dashboard here you'll be able to track
your release health so for example you
can see what your crash rate is doing
what's the ratings changes look like or
how is your uninstall rates fluctuating
this is based on hourly aggregated data
so it gives you a really powerful way to
keep track of your release as it's
getting adopted you can compare the
release performance to a previous
release which we think you guys are
going to really love I mean what do you
think does sound cool awesome that
so hopefully you already know that if
you're running a staged rollout you can
actually halt it at any time if you're
detecting any kind of issues so for
instance if you're noticing your profs
rate is going up or there's a big spike
in uninstall rates you can react quickly
if you halt a staged rollout and the
users that didn't get that update they
won't get it so rest assured then you
can focus on investigating and fixing
those bugs before releasing the
new-built so if you guys want to deeper
dive into that awesome release dashboard
I was just referencing along with some
other cool features that we're launching
to help you improve your app house go
check out making data on play work for
you tomorrow 1:30 p.m. / stage 1 okay
let's move on as Android developers your
signing key it ensures security and
integrity of your app that makes it very
important lost or compromised keys are a
very serious issue I hope that this
didn't happen to any of you but in fact
this is one of the most commonly
reported issues to our operations team
this is why we are very excited to be
announcing another important feature
Google Play app signing if you join this
program you'll let Google Play manage
your key and sign your app before
delivering it to users for new app we
can simply generate a key for you for
existing apps we provide you a flow
through which you can securely hand over
the keys to us after that you don't have
to worry about balancing security and
convenience of access by for example
storing your key in a version control
system you can even delete it
apps uploaded to play will still be
signed but with a separate upload scheme
which we use as a second secondary
authentication this one can always be
replaced if needed ok so first of all
this guy right here is super excited
about it I just want to point that out
thanks for the sunset
we've had several partners actually
using Google Play app signing for a
while now and they love it surprise here
Robin Hood speaks to the layer of safety
that we've added while at the same time
it's just eliminated that worry of
having lobster stolen keys and I guess I
don't have to ask I mean how cool is
this pretty cool it's pretty cool oh
yeah okay so now that Google Play
signing your app you can probably guess
what comes next we can also start
optimizing get on your behalf
the first optimization that we've
started with a few partners is resource
stripping optimization if you opt into
this you can give us a universal or
so-called fat apk based on which we will
automatically generate device specific
apks by stripping redundant resources
for native libraries and screen
densities for example when delivering
your app to an armed phone we will make
sure we strip out all the excess six
native libraries this way the apk we
send out to users is smaller taking
wealth bandwidth less space on their
disk without requiring you guys to use
multi apk this way we're seeing over 20%
a peek inside savings with some of the
partners so make sure you opt-in and try
this out when it becomes available we
are very excited about the Google Play
app signing and all the app
optimizations we can bring you on top of
it in the future this program is
optional but we really hope you decide
to join to learn more about app signing
with Google it's security benefit and
size is the size gains you can get with
the various optimizations please come to
the how to secure and optimize your app
with Google Play app signing talks
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. on stage one okay
now I want to tell you a story a real
story when I joined Google a few years
ago my friend who is an Android
developer asked me for just one thing
can we do anything about this page you
see right here you're probably all
familiar with this page so I asked him
why what's wrong with this page he's
like well there are thousands of devices
there
a little info on each device many
devices actually have the same name
again and again and managing devices in
general is busy work now the Android
ecosystem has grown so significantly
because it offers different devices with
different capabilities at various price
points at the same time it's important
that users don't get an app or again
that their device doesn't have the
hardware to support you know what
happens the user gets annoyed because
the app doesn't work on their device and
then you get annoyed because the user
leaves once the review blaming your app
for something that isn't really your
fault it's really important for us that
you're able to deliver great experience
to your users and to be able to do that
we need to provide your visibility into
the device space it's especially
important for game developers because
we're aware that you guys in many cases
build your games according to a
reference device bag therefore we're
very excited to announce that today
we're launching a new device catalog in
the Play console we'll go with this new
and shiny catalog you can see the full
hardware spec for thousands of devices
that were certified by Google for the
Google mobile suite of apps you see here
what we call the card view but we also
provide you with the list view allowing
you to run all kind of quick operations
on a set of devices take a moment to
compare the old UI versus the new I
pretty awesome right okay so what do you
get in this new color so first you get a
full device spec you get information
like RAM system-on-chip GPU CPU screen
size and density and the supported
Android OS versions for each one of
those thousands of devices you can
search devices by any of these
attributes for example you can run the
search that you see right here what we
call the filter you can search for all
devices for example with Android SDK 24
plus and a specific GPU and one of the
features I like this every time we
you search for devices and we show you
one or many devices we also show you
your app performance on those devices so
we show you how many installs how much
revenue and what's the average rating
that those devices contribute to your
app this is super important when you're
making decisions like prioritizing bug
fixes or making device exclusion
decisions when we gave the new catalog
to pixel berry Studios one of our
testing partners it helped them avoid
making a big mistake on day one
literally on day one so they were about
to explore the device but actually with
the new catalog they suddenly saw that
it has meaningful installs 4.6 rating
and actually some meaningful revenue -
so they avoided excluding it and
therefore avoiding making a major
mistake pixel very studio tell us that
this tool will be a game-changer for the
studio cool another really cool feature
of device catalog our device groups it
is quite common to have multiple devices
with the same brand name but different
system ownership configurations for
example different Samsung Galaxy s7
we've heard multiple times from
developers that it's very hard to figure
out what's happening in those cases and
especially to debug performance issues
so in our new catalog we grouped all
those devices for you while allowing you
to drill down and see each individual
device still separated if you want to
exclude a device you can either exclude
a specific SKU or in entire sets of
devices for a single group now one
biggest addition we're introducing our
device exclusion rules this is the
ability to exclude devices based on
performance indicators for example if
you are developing a rich graphics game
you may struggle to get it to perform
well on devices with less than 512 Meg
or one gig of ram in which case you may
want to exclude the entire group of
devices with with less Rams in that or
if you discover a specific bug you may
decide to exclude all devices with a
specific system on a chip configuration
this allows you to stop deployment only
to problematic devices while we work on
a fix and
deploy to fix all the affected users as
soon as it gets ready when you create an
exclusion rule we also similar to what
Cobie which was earlier saying we show
you which devices you're about to
exclude how much installs you're making
from all those devices and how much
revenue you're making which is a pretty
important information where you're
making a big decision like this and then
to save you some more time we also like
to copy the list of excluded devices
from another one of your apps just kind
of to make it a little bit quicker we
already heard from a bunch of developers
that they really love this feature oh
yeah well so we know you want to exclude
a few devices as possible after all
Android is so great because it has a
vast reach and because users everywhere
around the world are using a great and
diverse device set however we do
acknowledge that sometime you need to
slow devices temporarily or even
permanently and we want to make sure you
have the right feature set allowing you
to make such important decisions
including validation to make sure you
don't shoot yourself in the foot by over
exploding you can see for example that
ei are using new tools to launch more
confidently and ensure players get
better experiences across all their
supported devices
similarly space at eightgames shared
feedback with us where they found a
great way of incorporating new device
targeting tools to reduce costs and
improve kpi's so I'd like to build a
little bit off of what milena was just
speaking to there around device
exclusion so big-fish one of our testing
partners for the device catalog has been
really terrific in sharing a ton of
feedback and insight into the tool as
they've been using it we collated their
experience into a case study that we're
going to share with you today but first
we wanted to take a little bit of a step
back and let you know that we had some
reservations as a platform as Google
Play that we were a little bit concerned
that developers might support less
devices as a result of this but big-fish
illustrates that this is in fact going
to facilitate the opposite it's going to
allow you to support more devices so as
we went down that rabbit
with them with their first days of
interacting with the catalogue -
recurring themes popped up precision and
quality let's start with precision so
big fish's mantra is actually to publish
games to the widest audience possible
and using restrictions as a last resort
but my favorite quote from them is right
here which is we can now take a scalpel
into the operating room instead of a
hatchet it sounds safer to me it's like
what a visual as I'm sure many of you
can relate developers have been going to
the far reaches of the internet
scattered across to leverage several
third-party sources of information
around Android devices and their specs
for years the big-fish team really loves
the consolidated Android device models
and grouping where they can also see as
Kobe was speaking about that install
revenue and ratings numbers for each
device this allows you to make more
informed decisions
so one specific example that they gave
us was that in the past they had this
running list of low-end device
exclusions probably sounds familiar for
a particular business unit they were
forced to search and check against this
running list for every new title and
given that big fish is an extremely
prolific game maker this is a huge pain
in the butt so they can now set that one
time RAM based device exclusion rule and
that it import that into every new game
they launched moving forward
that means no running internal lifts no
manual labor so this newly found
precision is leading to some serious
efficiencies for them and we're excited
to provide you with a lot of oil to
grease those wheels for your team we
actually ask big fish how they
anticipated the new catalog would help
them to include more devices so they
give us a real example in one very
tricky device group they had to use the
hatchet approach that Sarah mentioned
before and exclude 12% of the devices in
that group
with the new catalogue they estimate
they can take down this 12 percent to
two percent which means including many
more devices this is a huge win for both
developers and users so let's move on to
quality now since quality is near and
dear to our hearts here at Google Play
we knew that giving you guys a
significant and centralized device
catalog would surely lead to improve
quality in particular the catalog can
empower you the developer to create a
consistent and elevated user experience
for Google Play users across a broad
array of devices the diversity of
Android devices enables your games and
apps to reach audiences that no other
gaming platform can do we know that this
also though presents some unique
challenges related to that diversity I
think the big fish said it best we're
able to be more proactive in our device
support to do few launches and more
quickly able to respond to real-world
problems
the big fish team gave me this pointed
feedback of how the device catalog is
enabling them to react and solve device
specific issues in record time
it's given them more confidence in their
early game rollout process knowing that
they can iterate quickly against device
support as well so for example they have
a game cooking craze that is currently
in open beta right now they decided to
launch it with actually known
performance issues because they knew
that while it was out in the wild they
could also look for unforeseen issues
with launching earlier and that review
feedback not counting towards their
overall ratings that I spoke of earlier
they could pluck out those iffy devices
and disable support for those devices in
the meantime that then allows them to
iterate regarding device support more
quickly then they were able to insulate
their game from negative reviews and
that would in turn not affect the
discovery algorithms on Google Play
so you know this is a really amazing way
for them to set themselves up for the
best possible global launch right out of
the gate and we understand that you only
get one chance at launch now while you
guys are increasingly focused on
creating gaming experience with lasting
power beyond we understand that that
launch window is still really crucial
it's the foundation that sets your game
up for success since the early days of
the device catalog we're excited to hear
of other new ways that this service will
positively impact your apps and games as
we roll out more broadly please do share
your stories with us we'd love to
understand how the device catalog is
contributing to the success of your game
and your business overall so it's great
to see how open beta where we open the
talk with connects to the device catalog
today we've seen we've showed you a
bunch of new launches new tools we're
launching in the play console and we
also showed you how developers use them
to find success on Google Play we showed
you our new release flow giving you more
confidence and clarity as you makeup
updates we showed you the new validation
step which makes sure you avoid making
major mistakes before your release your
app updates to users we show you how we
made staged rollout front and center
allowing you to see the number of
targeted devices and set custom
percentages we show you how you can
savor your release as a draft and then
come back later to launch it when you're
ready we also show you the new release
dashboard allowing you to keep track of
your release performance in real time
making sure you react to issues as they
show up and then we've also mentioned
that starting today you can publish your
Android instant apps directly from the
Play console we continue by talking
about a new program where Google Play
can take the burden of signing your apps
from you we talked about the security
benefits and about the size gains you
can get with the app optimizations last
but not least we talked about the new
device catalog we'll show you the rich
device specs
we group devices how you can efficiently
search and filter the catalog and how
you can see the dates about performance
of your app on a resulting set we'll
talk about the new rules allowing you to
filter your app on the store based on
performance indicators and here are some
helpful links if you want to explore any
of the things we talked about in more
detail we are sure you will like the new
features and they will help you release
with more confidence better understand
the Android device pace and focus on
doing what you guys do best build
amazing apps and games and deliver great
experiences to millions of Android users
all around the world thank you thanks
