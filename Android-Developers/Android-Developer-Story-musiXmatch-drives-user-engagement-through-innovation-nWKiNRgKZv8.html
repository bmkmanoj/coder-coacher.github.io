and founder of musiXmatch my daily job
is to follow the product team and build
the best experience we can around music
and lyrics the app is called musiXmatch
because we match your music with lyrics
and we show you the lyrics while you're
playing the music the experience with
Google Play so far has been amazing out
of 27 million downloads more than 60
million downloads are coming from
Android Google Play 10 million monthly
active users and that's what growing
faster than any other platform
the floating lyrics experience is a
seamless integration to the media
Hinton's a notification on android so
this means you don't even have to open
the app anytime you're playing a track
from any music services you can notify
instantly and if you touch the
notification openings you get instantly
the lyrics on overlay synchronize and on
time with the music and so this means
much more people using the app for much
more time much more sessions it's only
possible to do that on Android so far
we've seen a dramatic increase in terms
of engagement and she's been two times
more active user and even two times more
behave it's time they spend inside our
Android is really an open system it's a
really fast Iranian platform there are
no limits to the possibilities of what
you can build for example on musiXmatch
we built the floating lyrics experience
it wouldn't be possible in
oh by the bergen system what's been very
important for Hassan Android compared to
any other platform is the way we
directly talk with the users by replying
to each single reviews this has been the
success on Android
listening to the users and having the
way to provide them back the experience
they want chromecast large screen
reading lyrics singing along with
friends in your living room these has
been driving a lot of engagement it's
not only about smartphone and tablets
and you can get the lyrics directly on
your watch the live for Android TV is
great because there are so many use
cases and so many different experience
that we can craft and it's really
exciting for our application the goal is
to reach 100 million people to the
technical opportunity we have by
building the app on Android which we
don't have on other platform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
