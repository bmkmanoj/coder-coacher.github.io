for professionals we are consistently
one of the top apps on Google Play
my name is creeper - and the engineering
managers for lincoin
infrastructure team for the flagship app
we have a million plus reviews we are
constantly forced left start our users
are really appreciative of how stable
the answer is how it really helps them
bring their products amplifying forward
my name is drew Hanny I'm on the Android
infrastructure team at LinkedIn my team
is responsible for the overall health of
our Android applications we take care of
releases Google Play or testing pipeline
for the app or build pipeline one of the
tools that my team has been excited
about is the apk analyzer tools because
we spend a lot of time paying attention
to the size of our app and it required
some expertise to figure out what was
causing your app to be a certain size
but now that we have the apk analyzer
tool we've been able to expand that
knowledge throughout the entire team
LinkedIn was early adopter of Gradle so
adopting Gradle for Android was a pretty
natural fit for us because we can share
a lot of our custom plug-in logic that
we've built and we can also get
consistent builds across developer
machines in our build service one thing
that's really benefited us is the lint
system which has a lot of built-in
checks for common problems and we really
appreciated being able to write our own
custom lint checks were linked in
specific internal libraries with so many
developers checking into the codebase
one thing that helps onboarding someone
new is having a consistent code style
throughout the codebase Android studio
let's define a custom code style that
each developer can add and automatically
have their code formatted in the
LinkedIn style one of the things that we
really appreciate is the automation of
the platform where not only has a lead
back that we had given back to the
developer community and accepted but
also being worked upon in the last
couple of years my team has become way
faster much more agile and being able to
code easier and faster on the Android
studio
