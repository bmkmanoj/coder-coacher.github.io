friends I decided to create a teaching
the first free digit up to follow logic
the idea come from a passion I used to
practice teaching during student 40 and
at this time I don't find very easy to
inaudible solution for mixing today we
have more than 60 million downloads
imaging is the most dollar DDJ app we
are present in 182 countries so I'm very
proud of my team when we launch our apps
on Android it became the largest
contributor for our growth we are on 50%
of our revenues on Android platform and
more than 70% of our noodles come from
Andre our mission is to provide great
music tools for music lovers we think
that what made our success possible in
Android is the fact that we really put
efforts in designing great and quality
apps for our users and this was also
possible thanks to the tools that Google
Play is providing to publishers material
design was a great improvement for our
designer team it was a more unified and
smooth experience it made them really
discover and love the Android world
oh dear latency is really important for
us we are designing music applications
so it has to be very responsive and very
reliable for the jobs you need the
latency to be very very low the on trip
latency is the module gap between the
time we generate the sound on the song
actually came out this paper on the new
Android marshmallow devices like Nexus 9
Nexus 5x and X is 6p we are done 20
milliseconds latency thus we are able to
provide an application more stable and
more reactive so it's usable for the
professions we developed mix fader this
year it lets you mix in scratch directly
from your smartphone or tablet via
bluetooth an Android marshmallow
developers are able to be part of this
big negotiations between an Android
device and nice fader other platforms
are the minimum of 20 milliseconds for
their Bluetooth connections we were able
to reach 7.5 milliseconds latency we
have the best experience a non-return we
initially had a premium business model
but we started testing the advertising
model working with AdMob we multiplied
our revenues by 2 to 3 depending on the
app you love we will play because we can
interact with our users when they
comment or leave a review on the store
we can answer to them directly and we
can upload an update very fast that's
something that's real asset for us today
the JIT is the 10th largest music app to
be sure and our ambitions is to be the
number one within the next 2 years
thanks to the audio latency improvement
on Android we are able to develop new
music apps for users and we can't wait
for this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
