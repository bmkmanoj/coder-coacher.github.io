business a Walkman and also that I'm
leading the global project as well so
today so as we as we talk about the
Google Play is a great place to
distribute your applications then you
can choose whatever you want like
publish your application to everywhere
but today I would like to discuss about
the framework of the go global it's more
like I I'm making them their flame work
on this light then I would like to
explain about each sections about what
we need to think about to go global then
after I explained about the go global
flame mode then today we invited the
gorgeous panelists today then let's ask
them about the there go global
strategies all right let's move on so
fast ball sector light market this is
the most important work for your
strategy so we define their market like
established market like we call like
mature market also the license terms
market which called we call like
emerging market so for instance the
established markets us japan's collier
taiwan so the they have many are the
specific stuff but the is one thing is
it's a high up who users in there the
analyzing spirits market is monetizes
still are compared with the US Japan
then monetize is not that much but the
user basis going glow fost and also the
install base is pretty going for us so
that's the we separated two categories
and also you know then each market is
different phase for instance us has a
different face like diff
uses performance in Japan also call
years also the difference so segment is
different also that each country is also
the same they're different different
faces so let's see the each leg market
for instance like Japan market so this
is a top line king of the Japan then
looks like almost Japanese the vapors
are in the top ranking then super saiyan
here then seems like cute icon is for
fury in the Japan market then probably
you put their cute icons in or cute
characters on the you icons then that
much that would be the group for the
Japanese users then go to the Collier
market then seems like more Western the
book was doing good on the top ranking
also some cute actress but also some
serious guys in top lankan that's a
clear market then let's move on to
emerging market so this is a bloody so
seems like it's more like worse than the
book was doing believe all and the
Bloods of market and seems like a clash
of clans and those clash of kings and
some of us was doing well so those kind
of like pvp stuff and also the import
market seems like so this is a bloody
market then this is Indonesia it seems
like a similar with the blood of market
but more we can see more cute characters
cute icons on here so it's more mix
market we can say so those market
specific like specific understand that
those market stuff then decided where
should we go to the market so that's it
like market then next move on the plan
your approach so once you decided to go
you specific market like Japan or
Collier then you need to figure out how
to fit that market so you should go with
original titles original graphics go to
that market or change the your graphics
to go down market so that's a dish Jones
make you need but this is agent agent s
in western taste so so agent s is more q
andan complicate a UI but more efficient
and then port late mode and then western
place is more like a landscape and the
more simple you is this is on the game
also the material design also their
group fit in everywhere so you need to
you need to localize on the your
services but the design wise you don't
need to figure out that much use the
material design is that's there that's
more efficient then move on the next
localize your applications then don't
just translate so this is most important
part as well so we define the level 1 2
3 on the net localizations so level 1 is
just simple just go to the market just
quick check the your application to
polish to those market then see how does
it work then level two is more go more
local so for instance like changing your
descriptions in the local languages
Cinzia screenshot or change the icons to
the market then chance to your
applications text in the local languages
so that's a level two then levels is go
native then more like a local little
bunt contents so for instance put a
local leader binder contents in the euro
plication like your japanese characters
or co lions are even in that levels
we then get more users thinking about
their local users then I so that that
level is little one to see so you can
step up to level one to level two level
three or you can go through levels lee
dialect from nothing but we're inclined
to check the you localize description
where's the native check so if you don't
have a native check then looks like from
the local users then looks like this
kind of stuff so graphic okay sounds
like great but localizations it seems
like ? so that's the form the local
users point so we recommend to use the
native check on that side so they make
more graphic sounds and local string is
great so that's a metaphor but that
looks like from the local users then
this is the my recommendations to the
stores so isolated store listing also
there in up gains and this is Japan's
call here taiwan hong kong blossom in
nature so we recommended the languages
what we need to localize in for their
users so this is a as a one of the
opening opinion from me but this is it's
too obvious but this is make sure you're
going to that market then localize the
the success Stoli is the music smudge so
data lies we discussed a lot in Japan
market about the Japan market then we
change they change the video trailer
titles thing icons description also the
key images on the screen shot they put
the local talent and the local contents
then put the local languages in there
screenshot then they got there they go
to Lunken number one in the music
category in Japan from 50 also it's not
only for localization also I recommend
to think about the connection
connectivity in the each market if you
want to go to emerging market then you
need to figure the connection speed as
well so for instance apk size might be
smaller is more good for those emerging
market then after the download and
content file size or data friendly or
and also the local pricing as cleansing
mentioned that so those kind of KPI is
we need to figure out if you want to go
to the emerging market so support local
uses so it's more easy but the support
local users in the local languages
that's the important fact to go local
market so this is a Korean double post
deploying the users in Japanese this is
important for going global then launch
test and Italy so as we talked about
like X experiments a be testing the
acquisition channel and also
localizations this is like keep continue
to doing so keep continue to improving
so this loop is important for the go
global so this is the good example for
the apps so they did the experiments on
the our Play Developer console then we
know icon is the more simple ones than
forty-one percent increase of the
download and also this is the game
screenshot then before and they tried a
civil type of this screenshot then they
go to good numbers of
the improve so that's the baby the
experiments is important things for you
know checking on the localizations or
localized of the u.s. screenshot and
echo global strategies so this is before
after finally so so they put all good
improve the numbers of the result then
they change that they're like screenshot
and after so so leverage our local
market experts we have the Civil peoples
in this venue so please reach out those
guys then ask the your SWAT to do stuff
what so that's the my presentations then
they
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
