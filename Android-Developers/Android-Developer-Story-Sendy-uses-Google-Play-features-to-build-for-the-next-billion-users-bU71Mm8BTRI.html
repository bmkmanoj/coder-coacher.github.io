customers and logistics providers all of
them differently is figuring out the
last nine energy six which is our
problem in most developing countries I
mean we don't have things like addresses
here being able to use technology to
solve a problem that maybe nobody has
been able to solve in this region is
probably the most exciting meet sandy
has 200 apps one for the customers and
one for the drivers great thing about
sandy is you are able to drop pins for
your pickup on top of locations so it's
easier for you to identify it on a lot
rather than enter in an actual address
we went with Android because majority of
the users in Kenya East Africans Android
phones and the fact that a process of
actually doing that continuous
deployment to customize is much faster
than other platforms as a start-up that
is constantly trying new things we tend
to roll out features a lot cold feature
in the Google Play Developer console is
the alpha and beta testing groups we
normally roll out our new versions of
the app to groups that help us test and
get as many bugs as possible before the
app goes into final release most people
love it when the UI flow is as easy to
use as possible
material design offers a very simple
language for people to understand and we
found that most girls appreciate it
when developing apps for the can market
there are certain things that you need
to consider need to make sure that your
apk size is not too large because most
people don't have a lot of storage disk
you also need to check the amount of
data your app is using because people
are very sensitive of the amount of data
they use but usage is also very
important people don't have the luxury
of plugging in their phones all the time
one of the key things the most building
trust among your users one of the things
we did in the beginning is provide free
delivery to customers the other way of
building trust is making sure that we
keep the customer they know where their
drivers it's through our Android app the
way we've utilized the Google Play
Developer console to establish user
trust is that first we make sure that
our ratings on the Play Store are high
we also rely on statistics such as their
number of crashes per app version that
is very helpful for me as a developer to
mobile bugs they should escalate and fix
as quickly as possible
I think integration with local pavement
is very very key as well to this access
of customers using your product over 90
percent of our customers pay for
services using mobile we have been
seeing very financial growth within the
company we've grown from a team of three
to eight nine team of about 23 people
being able not only to have an impact to
the end user but also to get drivers in
our platform so giving them an income
that they aren't able to earn a few
months ago is really something that is
touching for me as a person I feel that
we are driving vehicle me in the nearest
way possible but we are still driving
the economy
which is enough for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
