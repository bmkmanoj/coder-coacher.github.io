always been very eager to be the best
online news organization in France it's
always been this challenge to see how we
can get the best stuff for journalism in
the pocket of your readers and take
advantage of this technology to reach as
many people as we could
we heard that many of our readers
started reading women who take too much
time from them we started to think about
a daily that would be truly digital and
that's la mattina when la mattina really
wanted to place new things and to change
the way we were here at noon so we
wanted a newspaper published in the
afternoon but with lomatin and we really
wanted to be present in the morning and
exclusively on mobile devices to come up
with the idea from a canal we analyzed
users feedback and remain up and we
found out two main issues the first is
the price and the other is the time
commitment needed so with lalettan l we
answered those two problems by setting a
lower price and by giving only 20
articles a day Android is a key platform
for Latina since January Android has
become the main source for downloads for
llama Tina also we see on subscription
conversion and increase of 6 percent on
Android Android to other platforms we
think that Google Play billing really
had the increase of subscription
conversion rates and the matching up and
we think that will of the main nation is
the better user experience compared to
what we have on the main tab with both
living user don't have to fill out and
less forms just click on the button and
they are now subscribe to a magnet
subscription conversion on the Latina
compared to the lumens main app is 14
times higher so this is something that
tells us with la mattina we have
something really cool
la mattina was the first product where
we implemented cool labeling was
straightforward or developers took like
week and seeing how successful it was we
decided to implement it all the main app
because we really wanted to let me
direct casual videos we have in the main
app we decided that the best way to
promote an imaginary was in ruins main
up on the home screen we have a banner
from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. that
promotes today's edition of vanity net
with the logo and the title of the
edition which is the main headlines for
today the nation in terms of engagement
latina is a success as we see Android
users come back more often launch per
user is 3.5 times higher than compared
to other platforms it's another matrix
that bones Paola Medina is a success in
terms of engagement I think now that we
need to grow our wellness around the
meta now to let more people understand
its value how with just a few minutes
every morning you get a comprehensive
view on the news
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
