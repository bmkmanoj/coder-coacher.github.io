some stuff you can control and then
there's other stuff that you just have
to be aware of and work around my name
is Colt McAnlis and CPU frequency
scaling is one of those harsh realities
of mobile development that you can't
control but can have a significant
impact on your application C in order to
conserve battery Android devices can
reduce the amount of voltage supplied to
the CPU this means that the processor
will draw less energy to execute code
with the side-effect of slowing down
your CPU in the process essentially your
code will take longer to run and this is
a very regular occurrence your Android
device is constantly trying to throttle
voltage to the CPU to save as much
energy as possible the interactive CPU
governor that Android uses constantly
checks the CPU workload to determine if
the frequency can be scaled back or if
it needs to be ramped up
the ramifications of such are a little
weird to you as a developer firstly when
the frequency gets throttled you'll
notice that normal operations take
longer to execute so don't be surprised
if suddenly your frame time spikes start
to shoot above 16 milliseconds and
secondly changes in frequency take about
20 milliseconds to occur meaning that if
you come right out of a low frequency
State the first frame of rendering may
be slower due to the fact that the CPU
hasn't had a chance to ramp up yet
in general you need to remember that
this is working as intended battery is
everything on mobile development and to
the Android system it does a really good
job of balancing processing speed versus
battery drain on your behalf so you
really don't need to worry about it in
fact there's a whole bunch of things
that does to avoid this problem where
performance is critical like bringing
the frequency all the way up as soon as
the user touches the screen but other
times like if you're using a service or
responding to an event you can see these
issues manifest themselves just keep in
mind that if you start seeing framerate
spikes or things taking longer than they
should be for no reason that frequency
use scaling could be the culprit to
confirm this you can run a syst trace
profile enabling the CPU frequency flag
you'll notice a nice bar at the top the
details where the current frequency
values are so you can see how overall
it's impacting your performance and
performance is all about understanding
what the hardware
is doing and how your code should react
accordingly in this case there's not
really much you can do but in all the
other cases there's a ton of things that
you can work on so make sure you check
out the rest of the Android performance
patterns videos and don't forget to join
our Google+ community for other great
tips and tricks so keep calm profile
your code and always remember perf
matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
