this is Android tool time with what's
new in Android studio 2.3 after the
feature-packed released that was 2.2 we
are starting the new year with Android
studio 2.3 which offers many refinements
and fixes to existing components as well
as some exciting new features the first
thing I'd like to mention is the
overhaul of the instant run UI we follow
the advice from developers and now
provide two buttons run which you will
use to deploy and start your app and
apply changes for any subsequent code
and resource modifications this uses
instant run to quickly update the
running app using cold warm or hot swap
and now requires a device or emulator
running lollipop and above in case you
happen to see any unexpected problems
you can always use the Run button again
to force a full app restart speaking
about speeding up build times in
androids Gradle plugin 2.3 we've now
enabled the build cache by default the
build cache is a shared directory on
your machine where libraries are
extracted and compiled to be used across
all projects making both incremental and
full builds faster we've also made some
general performance improvements and
products Inc and the Gradle integration
in this version of Android studio and
moved to Gradle version 3.3 the ID
itself brings the new features of the
IntelliJ 2016 point to release such as
the new inspections tool window
overhauled notifications breadcrumbs in
the Java editor and more the layout
editor received some updates to and the
pallet window we now show widget
previews and support sorting and
filtering by name the property inspector
here on the right now lets you add the
most used properties to your favorites
for quick access on the overview page
and finally the visual editor has a new
set of controls and refined visuals for
constraint layout editing including new
icons an easier way of adding baseline
handles and support for too big features
of the constraint layout chains and
ratios by the way constraint layout is
not a default when creating new projects
with Android studio template moving on
the vector drawable import dialog
received a small
highly requested upgrade you can now
search the material icons catalog by
name which makes it a lot easier to
locate the one you need for raster
images we've added weddy support in the
IDE what is an image compression format
developed at Google that can replace
both JPEG and PNG images with smaller
file sizes and similar quality you can
now convert images to WebP II straight
from the IDE by right clicking on a file
or folder and selecting convert to epi
since we're support varies across
Android versions we've also added lint
checks that look at the content of your
images and will warn you if they're not
compatible with the min SDK version in
your project next up we have the app
links assistant it guides you through
the process of adding app links support
to your app which concludes creating
instant filters for URLs modifying
activity code to handle those intents
and generating a digital asset links
file for your website for fans of lint
we have some new and updated lint checks
we now support additional annotations
such as restrict to and visible for
testing and the lint report HTML file
now has a material design look with
syntax highlighting the biggest addition
however is lint baseline support which
lets you save the current set of known
lint errors and ignore them for future
builds this gives you a way of
progressively dealing with technical
debt in your project while still having
the benefit of being informed about any
new warnings and errors that you might
introduce in the SDK tools we've
recently added a command-line interface
for the SDK manager called SDK manager
you can use it to automate installing or
updating SDK components for example in
scripts or on your CI server and lastly
the espresso test recorder you know from
previous Android studio versions gained
a few improvements and is now considered
stable so you can use it for adding
espresso UI tests to your applications
