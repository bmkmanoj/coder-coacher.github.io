leaks from their application they tend
to focus the majority of their energy on
the most impactful issues however one of
the biggest most frightening leaks are
often hanging around the code-based
going unnoticed my name is Colt McAnlis
one of the worst things that can get
leaked in your Android application is a
view object for the most part views are
simple little gizmos that help us update
the screen and display information we
generally don't think of them as
potential memory hogs which I mean is
kind of true by themselves views aren't
much of a leaf problem rather it's what
they reference that can cause a horrible
leak situation remember that the garbage
collector system in Android can only
reclaim objects that are no longer
referenced by anything else inside of
memory a leak is an object that is no
longer needed but there's still a
reference to it somewhere in the system
this problem can cascade when that
object references other objects and
those objects reference other objects
none of them in the entire chain can be
removed from memory because of the
existing references from that root leak
so here's the problem
views contain a reference back to the
activity that created them and
activities in turn tend to reference
lots of internal objects and other
memory items this is why a leaked view
object is such a big issue when a view
leaks so does the activity it references
and all of the other data involved
basically the entire activity sits
around in memory which can be an extreme
problem in certain situations for
example when the user rotates their
device a configuration change will be
triggered causing the current activity
to be destroyed in a new instance of it
to be loaded into memory but if a view
from that first activity was leaked then
the original activity can't be cleaned
up now and so it'll just basically sit
around hogging memory that should be
given to the new activity instead now
imagine if this happens in the user
rotates the screen back again suddenly
you've now got three separate instances
of an activity in memory all fighting
for space so avoiding leaking view
objects should be the top priority for
your memory management policy to that
end here are some simple patterns that
you should watch out for number one
don't reference views inside of async
callbacks that a sync event may execute
at some point in the future where things
aren't ideal I mean in one situation the
activity may have been killed before the
callback is triggered but the view in
the activity
as such will be kept around until the
async function completes and releases
its reference to the view and in a worse
situation your callback may be executed
after the view object has actually
legitimately been destroyed
thus dereferencing an invalid object and
causing your application to crash really
not that important for performance but
you know the whole crashy crashy thing
tends to shine bad on users anyhow
number two don't reference views from
static objects the issue here is that
static objects persist for the lifetime
of the entire process that's running
your app which by the way is not the
same as the lifetime of the activity
that declares the static object as such
having a static object reference to a
view can cause issues when the activity
is destroyed say during a configuration
change because the view is still
referenced by the static object and
these static object then of course
references the activity as well neither
the view or activity will ever get
cleaned up because of the lifetime of
that object and number three avoid
putting views in collections that don't
have clear memory patterns for example
using a weak hashmap object to store
views as values since weak hashmaps
store views as hard references you can
end up in a bad spot anytime something
destroys those views this type of weak
hashmap behavior has led it to be
nicknamed the leak hash map leak because
it's the we cache now if you're ever
wondering where your memory is going
make sure to check out the allocation
tracker tool inside of Android studio if
you see content from an activity that's
not supposed to exist you might need to
take a hard look at your code and taking
hard looks at your code is what Android
performance is all about which is why
you should check out the rest of the
Android performance patterns videos and
check out the Google+ community for
other great tips so keep calm profile
your code and always remember
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
