where we help you build better apps I'm
Ian Lake let's get to work let's think
about how you navigate through an app
you navigate to a detailed view from the
parent view or you can navigate between
sibling views
that's where tabs and view pages come in
so what is a view pager that's what
controls the actual swiping between
different pages of content view pager
gets its content from a pager adapter
this could be a generic view one for
each page or whole fragments if you use
a fragment pager adapter or fragment
state pager adapter fragment pager
adapter keeps each fragment it creates
in memory making it lightning-fast to
switch between already loaded tabs
however doesn't get expensive memory
wise if you have a large number of
fragments something fragments state
Pedro adapter solves by destroying and
recreating fragments as needed only
saving the state there isn't a lot to a
pager adapter you'll need to override
get count to return the number of pages
you have then in the case of a fragment
pager adapter you'll need to implement
get item which returns the fragment
associated with each position here we'll
just do a simple switch statement
selecting the right fragment for each
position but you have the flexibility to
use any approach you want the other
thing we might want to override is get
page title returning a string describing
each page why would you want a page
title well those page titles will be
really helpful if we want to have some
tabs associated with your view pager
tabs give you there's a great way to see
exactly what those pages contain without
having to scroll through each one they
also allow users to jump between pages
by tapping on a tab the tab layout class
part of the Android design sport library
makes it easy to implement tabs with all
the material design styling and it's
backward compatible to
to point one let's hook everything
together first we need to hook our
viewpager up to a pager adapter using
set adapter then hooking up a tab layout
is just a single method set up with your
pager with just that you'll get tabs
from the pager adapters titles and
swiping through pages will change the
tabs and tapping on tabs will change the
pages as you'd expect get started with
the tab layout and view pagers by adding
the design library be sure to check out
the design guidelines and the detailed
training Docs thanks for joining me here
on Android development patterns use tabs
and view pagers to build better apps
