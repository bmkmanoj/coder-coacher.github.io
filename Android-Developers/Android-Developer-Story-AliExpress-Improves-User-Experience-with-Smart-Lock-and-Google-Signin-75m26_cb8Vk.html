on Google Play we implemented Google
sign-in last year it allows users to
sign into Aliexpress with a Google
account now over 10% of our users use
Google sign-in more than any other third
party signing feature that we offer we
also recently implemented the small off
Legion it allows users to save that
password and use the safe password to
sign in we continue to see positive
feedback from users so we progress to
allowing users to sign in automatically
when they open our app after we
implement it smaller our sign-in success
rate increased from 84% to 92% we
realized early on that the material
design makes it easier for our Android
users to navigate the app so in early
2015 our app went through a significant
design change to make sure we are fully
compliant with the material design
guidelines after the update we receive a
lot of five-star user reviews praising
our design and our user rating improved
to four point four six many mobile users

have raped a number of benefits in terms
of user engagement by leveraging the

best to implement them as fast as
possible to further improve our customer
