out to London for playtime this is my
first play time so I'm kind of a rookie
at this but I've been making games for a
long time and I absolutely love this
this is one of my favorite topics
talking about you know the games that
engage us all on a daily monthly weekly
basis to keep us all playing and coming
back for more this is one of my favorite
topics and it's an absolute honor to be
here talking to you guys about this so
thank you all for coming out and again
case it wasn't obvious my name is Adam
Gunderman I work on the business
development team at Google Play and I
focus on game design and consulting with
developers on promoting the best game
design best practices on the platform
there we go so here's the agenda today
first we're actually going to define
engagement because it's a it's it's a
pretty straightforward topic but there's
a couple of distinctions that I want to
make just a kind of level set make sure
that we're all talking about the same
thing and then we're going to talk about
probably the core component here
actually designing games for engagement
we're going to talk about Google Play
game services which the way that Ben and
John described it just now is quite
obvious it is a toolbox for creating and
great engagement for your game it is
literally all the tools that you'll ever
need and number four we're going to talk
about community because community is
very very important and the way that you
engage developers the way that you as
developers engage users with your game
so what does engagement I think
everybody here probably knows how to
measure engagement for sure I mean we
talked about retention rates d 1 d 7 D
30 and certainly one way we figure out
how you know people are engaging with
their game but they're sticking around
and playing we talk about sessions per
day session length as well there's
another one that we talked about which
is like a stickiness factor which is
daily active users / monthly active
users dau over Mount it's a percentage
but what is engagement in essence we
know how to measure it but what is it
there's actually kind of two types that
I want to talk about first type is
direct engagement and this is the one
that we see on a pretty much daily basis
and it's kind of the obvious one is when
people are actually using your game than
playing your game this is a game called
two dots this is right after I finished
level
23 this is direct engagement it's very
straightforward is everything players do
while directly interacting with the game
but there's a second type and we'll get
to that later but I just wanted to call
it out now because it's also very very
critical I call community engagement and
think about it this way think about your
hobbies and this is really interesting I
came up with this example before I saw
the opening video that came out before
poornima kind of gave the opening
keynote this morning thought about this
example about fishing and there's a
apparently an incredible fishing app out
there which is exactly the type of thing
that drives community engagement with
the hobby of fishing so it's actually
really well timed and just it is one of
those moments in synchronicity I
couldn't have planned any better so for
example when I was a little bit younger
I was visiting my hometown move Houston
Texas which is right on the Gulf of
Mexico in the United States it's a great
little fishing town right outside of it
called Galveston and my friends and I
decided one night let's just go out
fishing because it was just a nice
beautiful night we went out we did it we
caught a 10 kilo fish last 10 minutes we
were out on the ocean and honestly it
was one of the best nights I've ever had
as a fisherman that right there me
telling you this story and talking about
it you engaging with that out that we
showed earlier today in the video that's
community engagement it's everything
that you do when you're engaging in a
hobby or a game when you're not actually
engaging in the hobby or the game you
know when i'm out casting my real what
I'm out playing two dots or some other
game that's direct engagement the second
type is community engagement but it's
equally important we get to exactly why
later designing games for engagement so
we've defined exactly what engagement is
now let's talk about how to design for
it and I could go through game after
game after game after game and tell you
exactly how these games are designed for
engagement but that wouldn't be super
helpful so decided to kind of narrow it
down to three games three games that
I've been playing for a very very long
time three games they're all very very
different three games that have been out
actually all for about the same amount
of time about a year
and a half and all very very successful
in play those three games are two dots
who hears played two dots raise your
hand yeah like fifty percent of you I
love it there's another game might be a
little bit more us-centric it's called
Family Guy quest for stuff from TinyCo
hands couple of you love it no for you
you I love it okay and the last one is
gonna be hearthstone who's played that
game from blizzard yeah okay about the
same numbers two dots fantastic these
these three games are amazing they're
all very very different two dots is
pretty much as casual the game as you
can get tecnicos family guy is kind of a
builder very much like a Sim City game
kind of in that bid core range and heart
stones almost as core of a game as you
see on the platform so try to pick three
very very different games and game
design style genre across the board so
let's talk about these games and have
their design this is family guy quest
for stuff I found this image on the
internet because it's a quite quite
descriptive of how this game has been
engaging for so long this is a year's
worth of content in the game we're a
year and a half in but this is exactly
one year of content in the game and the
cycle for how this game is operated and
run as a service signing Co releases new
content players build the content they
experience it's a builder game it's kind
of like a Sim City type game or a farm
bill or something like that players
build the content they kind of go
through it and then they have the
content in their beautiful city and then
tanika releases more content players
experience in building and kind of go
through it and this cycle continues on
and on and on and tannic Oh kind of has
to go through this cycle very very
quickly every couple of weeks release
new content and I call it not
pejoratively because I really love these
games but I called a Content furnace and
a furnace you know the way it burns
things up the reason I call it a Content
furnaces TinyCo ships this content and
then players kind of experience it they
burn it up it's just kind of like you're
you're putting coals in the fire just to
keep the fire going and if you were to
stop putting coals in the fire that
furnace what kind of died off it's one
way to keep players engaged but it's
very very resource-intensive and very
resource heavy and then that way
the content furnace actually doesn't
scale very well my content for its
another way I want to say this it's kind
of just single-player content one piece
of content equals one piece of
engagement once you kind of experience
it you really can't experience it again
it doesn't scale very well so the
question is when you're designing games
for engagement this is one model but
what what scales how can you get more
bang for your buck out of your
development hour in your development
dollar there we go let's take a look at
this example from two dots half of you
have played this game so I don't know no
don't need to explain exactly what this
game is about but it's for those of you
who haven't it's a match game it's not
unlike candy crush for cookie jam and
matching games actually are very much
content furnaces in their own cookie JM
and candy crush each have over a
thousand levels which is incredible
amount of content each meticulously
designed and balanced two dots itself as
over 400 so there's definitely a content
furnace here they release new levels
there how most highly engaged players
will go through them very very quickly
and then just kind of wait around come
on guys release new levels there's
definitely content ferns here but the
story doesn't end there here's the most
interesting part so again this is my
score on level 123 it's 242 I got one of
three stars and here's my little face on
the leaderboard here my friend Aaron
actually has a higher score than I do
and on beating Eric so what could I do I
could go on and play level 124 continue
to burn through the content because it's
a Content furnace but the subtle thing
that's going on here is I'm being
encouraged to actually replay this level
two different ways in fact i'm reading
encouraged to go ahead and get a higher
star rating achieve this higher star
rating which is set by the developer i'm
also being encouraged to go ahead and be
tearin in this little smiling face
because he's going to talk to me right
there with his high score so chasing
that personal achievement like a
three-star rating or trying to beat a
friend's high score these actions
actually drive repeat engagement with
the same type of content this actually
scale
enhance in this way replayability of
your content is what scales this is the
key message here if you want to get more
bang for your buck for your development
dollar for your development our
replayability of your content is the key
one unit of content instead of equaling
1 unit of engagement like we saw with
the Thai Nico example in equals many
units of engagement now we talked about
on that previous slide which go back to
a real quick this achievement here the 3
stars it's kind of a limited achievement
once I hit it I'm actually not going to
want to try to hit that again once i hit
my 3 stars with the leaderboard here
let's say i do go back and I try to be
Terrence I score and I beat them maybe I
post on Facebook or Twitter or email
them directly or just run into him and
say hey man abhi your high score well
he's probably gonna be encouraged to
beat me but maybe then you know eric
gets in on the action and this could go
on back and forth and back and forth and
back and forth for a very long time so
where is this personal achievement up
here which is set by the developer of
getting up to 3 stars is something
that's kind of a limited thing high
scores and this type of competition
infinitely scales so we talked about how
replayability is what actually gets
things to scale in general multiplayer
competition competition in general
scales forever and scales infinitely
honestly we could be fighting over a
high score on this level forever when
you saw this back in the early days of
arcades back in the 80s when people were
fighting over high scores and their
arcades and pac-man and still happens
today it's a similar system so promised
I would talk about hearthstone here's a
hearthstone tournament got this rich set
of multiplayer competition going on
right here it's kind of amazing
hearthstone has been around for a year
and a half and it doesn't seem to be
slowing down at all the question you
know you might ask yourself well you
know should I just ship multiplayer to
my game it's that kind of the magic
bullet well it's certainly a good
starting point what else can you do to
actually drive success of that
multiplayer it's a bit more subtle than
just kind of less
multiplayer and see what happens
hearthstone has actually architected
their game in a very specific way to
drive engagement for a number of
different users across a number of
different levels and with different
types of cadences as well so let's take
a look at that this is what I see when I
first log into play art stone daily
quests can win two games is a mage or a
shaman or paladin or a warrior and if I
went through all these I can earn all
this gold 140 gold here is what it would
total up to and these parts would
refresh themselves at the end of the day
after 24 hours so can come in kind of
fill out these quests on a daily basis
very cool stuff they released a feature
pretty recently called the tavern brawl
when i took this screenshot it actually
wasn't available but i decided to stick
with this one just to kind of show off
the cadence of it it's a wednesday
through sunday competition at the end of
sunday the rewards are kind of tallied
up and you know your placement the
tournament is kind of shown but it's a
weekly tournament and i got to come back
in the data to start this one so this
one's you know this type of action here
it's a daily thing this one's a weekly
thing this is a screenshot from the
march 2015 season in the play mode level
six top 3% is anyone want to guess if
this was me or something that i pulled
off the internet i pulled it off the
internet I'm not this good wish I was
this good I finished 10 ones but yeah
this ranking here that you see March
season 2015 it's a monthly ranking so we
had daily quests with weekly tournaments
we have a monthly ranking and see what
they're doing here let's look at how
they designed this they've got many
modes of play with their multiplayer
including solo play they've got solo
adventures in the arena which you can
pick up and play anytime it's available
for anybody this is your anytime always
on content you have your daily quests
rewards that you get on a daily basis
for engaging with the game you have a
tavern brawl weekly competitions and you
have the play mode with your most core
users kind of competing for that monthly
ranking you see what they're doing here
they're designing their multiplayer
they're designing their entire game
around the multiple ways that people
want to engage with your game whether
it's on a daily basis a weekly basis or
a monthly basis they're looking for any
way to kind of cater to a user that has
a particular you know way of wanting to
engage with the game whether it's super
casual or super core or somewhere in
between I think this is absolutely
brilliant so we've talked about quests
in this game we've talked about
multiplayer competitions in all of these
games we've talked about leaderboards we
talked about achievements all this
should sound pretty familiar we just
heard to talk about all of it it's
Google Play game services Play game
services is one hundred percent a
toolbox for developers to develop all
these amazing features which keep people
engaged in your game throughout the life
of the game I pulled these images from
the play games app which by the way has
over a billion installs and you guys
should open it today if you've never
opened it it's a beautiful app and it's
the way I kind of manage the way I I
gained this a is a player on our
platform I open the app to see what's
going on let's take a look at these
things we've got leaderboards this is a
game I play called three's one of my
favorite casual games out there doug is
a much better player than I am I'm
second to him certainly incentivized to
go ahead and try to beat his score
here's another very very popular game on
our platform called boom beach I've got
about forty eight percent of the
achievements and I'm slowly working my
way up I know that a John and Ben are
doing better than I am and plus for
example here's a game from penny cap
penny pop called battle camp anytime a
new quest shows up shows up here in the
play games app and I'm you know very
much encouraged to go ahead and play it
and we also have multiplayer we have
turn-based and real-time multiplayer
matchmaking that you can plug right into
and that's kind of the key thing we
talked earlier about getting the most
bang for your buck out of your
development dollar for your development
hour you can go ahead and build all this
stuff if you like but you know to be
frank Ben Franklin dove made it very
easy for all of you guys you can plug
right into our services
right into achievements to leaderboards
to multiplayer it's all right here and
ready to go it is the toolbox that you
need to drive engagement with your game
there it is so go back to this image of
hearthstone it's a beautiful-looking
tournament here lots of people playing I
don't even know how many screens do we
have here like 10 screens there or
whatever but notice there's a lot of
people that are actually not playing
hearthstone and there's viewing screens
up there this is community engagement
this tournament itself people are
playing and watching and talking about
it they're not actually you know playing
the game all of them these people that
are not as we defined earlier there and
get engaged in community engagement why
is this important you might have seen
one of these in the past this is a
pretty typical marketing 101 marketing
curve this is tracking the adoption of a
product over time you've got your
innovators your early adopters your
early majority late majority in your
laggards you read a Malcolm Gladwell
book you've definitely seen this as well
now here's the thing the people that
influence other people to download games
to go fishing to buy a magazine to try a
restaurant those people are actually
involved in community engagement and
they're the influencers the influencers
the mavens that you always hear about
and they actually kind of reside over
here they're the most engaged people and
whatever product you're talking about
this applies just about any industry
that's why this is important when you
get people talking about your game and
you get people posting on various social
medias about your game when you get
people you know creating YouTube videos
anything that pretty much again falls
into that category of community
engagement that's so critical because
community is actually an engagement and
marketing channel for your game and this
is the critical thing user acquisition
is incredibly expensive these days
sometimes it costs upwards of fifteen
dollars to get a user
on our platform or on pretty much any
platform however community engagement
the fact that it can drive new users to
your game for free it's incredible it's
one of those powerful things that you
can do to kind of drive long-term
engagement and long-term acquisition
with your game one last point I like to
make about social engagement and I wish
I knew which community manager I was
talking about talking to when I heard
this but it's really really interesting
it's kind of a very very critical point
we've been talking a lot today about
getting the most out of your development
dollar your development hour because
we're all resource constrained the thing
about community you can develop your
community in real time without bothering
an engineer without bothering an artist
without a product manager without going
through a QA cycle without pushing out a
release on google play without going
through a review process you can develop
your community in parallel in real time
as your game is being developed kind of
an obvious thing but it's also a very
very critical thing your community is
always on it's always engaged you can
always be doing more to engage your
community and again you don't have to
bum you know kind of work with your
development team and kind of slop things
and kind of fight for resources your
community manager or your community team
it's completely independent and that's a
pretty critical aspect one last thing
about community we've talked about
community in sort of that online sense
I've shown images of kind of Twitter
feeds and talked about YouTube and
things like that but probably the best
way you can engage with your users is in
real life directly one-on-one so I want
to give the example of glue been working
with glue for a very very long time
they've got two of the biggest games on
our platform racing rivals which is the
number one racing game on our platform
and Kim Kardashian Hollywood which I'm
sure you all are very familiar with
they've done community events which I
think are quite unique
and kind of display the power of of what
community can really bring to the table
let's look at racing rivals again racing
rivals since been around for many many
years it started out as a facebook game
and out some mobile and it's got a
cohort of users they've just been
playing this game and collecting cards
for many many years they're very very
passionate about the game they spent a
lot of money they're super engaged with
it their gear heads as people like to
say people really into car it's really
into this game so the studio down the
long beach as they were kind of
developing the next suite of features
they thought to themselves well you know
what we've got a core group of people
involved in this game it should probably
have a little bit of input as to what we
develop next you know because you look
at the road map of things you could
develop you could develop it in a vacuum
or you can do a glue did they flew out
to Long Beach 20 or 25 their most highly
engaged players and had a roundtable
discussion about what should we do next
in racing rivals they talked about it
they kind of scoped it out and they
essentially turned their community into
game designers and I guarantee you when
all those guys and girls flew back to
their their home states and home cities
or whatever they they probably spread
the gospel about racing rivals and say
listen I had this amazing experience I
went out to Long Beach and SAT with the
racing rivals team and help them design
the game and I guarantee you beyond just
engaging those players and their friends
in a deeper deeper level in the game
that word spread I'm spreading it to you
right now this right now is community
engagement and raising rivals similarly
with Kim Kardashian they had a contest
in the game and flew out some of the
most engaged young players in the game
to meet Kim they didn't talk about game
design it was just a meet and greet but
I guarantee you every single one of
those people that flew out and met Kim
myself included you can look at pictures
later on my phone if you would like come
find me later I wasn't allowed to put
them up here I guarantee you every
single one of them is spreading the
gospel about this game this kind of IRL
real world community events where you
you meet your consumers and you talk to
them directly and you get their feedback
this is the most powerful type of
community engagement
and really drive and it pays back in
spans that's all i have for you today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
