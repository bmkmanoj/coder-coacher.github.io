for android framework I can ovaries
right over there I wish I could join you
the sun's going to come and get me what
I want to talk to you guys about is
background limits and a lot of the the
infrastructure that we put in place you
know and it is a starting point and I
wanted to try and have this talk give
you a glimpse as to how we're
approaching the problem and so you don't
just think we're trying to ruin all all
the apps and everything you doing the
background we're actually trying to find
a balance of enabling users to have
battery life they can rely on and an
able knowing developers to do the use
cases that they think are great and that
users respond positively to and so to do
that we're going to talk a little bit
about the past a bit a lot about the
present and then a bit about the future
where for one of the two times we're
going to give you a glimpse of the space
that we're trying to go longer-term so
in the past we have those and stand by
those and those light were introduced to
try and save battery in two main
conditions one being when the device is
off for a long period of time so a good
example this is I take my tablet I toss
it in my desk and it's just there for a
few days in that you really want the
device to last a long time and those was
introduced to make that device last up
to a week and it was largely successful
when it was introduced those light was
trying to take that same concept and
apply that to the phone is in my pocket
it's not on but it is on me and those
wasn't identifying that situation and
does like I was trying to target that
and they start slowing down applications
and limiting what's happening throughout
the day and F's and I was very similar
in concept but have been about is the
user interacting with the application
very often and if not begins throttling
that up that back we also look to have
broadcast removal and this was when we
targeted an initial set of three
particular broadcasts and the best
example of this was
we were finding you take a photo and
suddenly all the applications are
getting really excited about that photo
because they're listening to that
broadcast and they would all be waking
up and going what's going on with the
photo is there's a restaurant nearby is
should I back it up what should happen
and the user is going I'm really just
trying to take a photo like god forbid
you trying to take two photos because
the first photo triggered everybody to
wake up and the second photo is now this
resource contention and so we found this
was really successful to pull these guys
back from being these general broadcasts
and instead being a bit more targeted
and and so that's kind of like the
lead-in to then the president where we
started looking at then a general
strategy for back iron limits I'll also
talk about alert window as well which
has a very similar problem space and
then a bit about how we're trying to
bring a data based approach to improving
system health on Android I don't mean
health like my personal health but more
rekted device elf and then I'll pepper
in a few best practices as we go as we
go through so Becker in limits why so
what we're trying to do is two parts one
is to save battery
this one was round the limits that we
put in place for location and the goal
that we're trying to get at is we want
multi-day battery life that's what's
going to take us a while to get there
but that's what we're trying to go and
to do that we know we have a pretty
large task in terms of what's happening
in the background it's a nearly six to
eight percent efficiency improvement
from where we are today and that's like
the backdrop if you will how how we're
thinking about it and then these are the
kind of initial steps in setting the
framework for how we're going to get
there the other part is about RAM
management and working on how broadcasts
are being fired to applications and also
dealing with how applications are
running in the background with a
long-running services so just to give
you a concrete example of this is you
have this chart of screen off
performance over over time and the one
thing you can see if there I can't see
my monitors anymore the Sun has totally
killed me up here but the one thing you
can see if there is overtime you're
going to have a slide of your screen off
batting performance but longer the phone
is in the
you'll also see that the jank jank rates
are slow UI frames get higher the longer
the devices in the field and so these
are things that we really want to help
remedy and make adverb us into the
platform so we can really smooth these
out
I got obviously every time device at age
and physics comes into play and the
march of time happens but we really
don't want them to be anywhere near that
steep another example that is as a
device is on in the course of even days
this one's measured all in initially
hours and then in days you can see just
uptime starts to take a toll on the
device and so these are the things that
were really trying to target and to
improve so let's dig in a little bit
it's not some of the changes that we're
introducing background limits and on the
save Ram the part is we want to restrict
services and broadcasts and we want to
reduce the amount of churn that's
happening on the device and the safe
battery we're looking to improve
background location scan rates and Wi-Fi
scan rates and to reduce them and make
them be more of a trickle than these
really bursts the events that we're
seeing happening in the in the ecosystem
so for for background limits the big one
here is we want to reduce that RAM usage
and to do that is while it's like the
same that's with the skin so how we're
doing that is with broadcast receivers
by pulling these guys back you're able
to then say okay
oh whoa all these broadcasts before that
were implicit and waking up applications
are going to be silenced your if you're
running at the moment you're still going
to get them but if you're not currently
running we're not going to wake you up
for them except in the case where they
explicit and explicit ones we say
something really important has happened
or you've been targeted or you've
registered for some wakeup and those
things will still work completely as
normal as they did before and so that
follows like alarms and notifications
other ones that were still keeping
around who completed locale changing and
these are really events that are not
happening
as the users trying to do something else
and that's really been the target of how
we approach which things should continue
to work in which things should we start
deferring the the other one here is free
running background services should no
longer be a thing and the idea behind
that is we want users to have visibility
so
what's happening on their phone and so
if an application is doing something
really expensive in the background we
want there to be some awareness for the
user we don't with the device to be
toiling away in the background without
any awareness this also means we want to
then start stopping those services after
they're running for a little bit we want
to start throwing we're start doing an
exception if you start to start a
background service when you're not in
the foreground or when you don't have a
foreground service running and this is
also the very last one is we're starting
releasing wake box and there's some more
conditions you still want to manage your
wake locks for don't think the OS is
going to handle it for you but we are
adding more protections in different
scenarios where they might have been
leaked or the the developer was a little
axe in there clean up the we still have
the white listing strategy that we had
before so there will still be a white
listing strategy that is around when GCM
fires off a broadcast to your
application you'll still get woken up
you'll get a short exemption to handle
that message from there you can kick off
a service you could bring your
applications at the foreground if it's
appropriate or you can just take the
take a note run it to schedule a job or
alarm and have it be scheduled by the US
and happen you know when it happens
there's also the flexibility still for
OEM if you're relying on some OEM
specific intent or something behavior
that's not built in the AOSP
Android open source the OEM will be able
to define on their own which things are
explicit which things are implicit and
should still be fired and which things
are implicit and should still get the
breaks apt on them so you might be
thinking at this point like this all I
guess the user part of my brain is
really really happy probably the
developer side is going wait I need I
have things to do I have things to say
how can I communicate to the to the
developer like it's really important
then what are you doing and so there's a
number of strategies and I'll talk about
them right now of how to do these
operations though with the user on a
timely basis and be still be respectable
battery but then also be able to tell
the user know I'm doing something
incredibly important so the first one to
look at is using firebase or Google
Cloud messaging and using the high
priority and normal priority messages I
hope your takeaway from this slide is
not like fire all torpedoes at high
priority
really want you to be kind of balanced
and saying if something is important
like say my fire alarm is going off at
home and I want to send a notification
to the user use a high priority
notification kind of a big deal if
you're say using a oh the users
scheduled for TV show that they like and
that TV show is now available and they
can stream it at their leisure use a
normal priority notification and it'll
make a big difference in the bet and the
battery life of the device and it really
adds up when the ecosystem set technique
needs approaches the other one here is
something new is called the job intent
service and this is coming out we just
missed the window but I still wanted to
talk about it for what came out with the
new twenty six beta but it will be
coming out shortly before o launched and
it's a strategy of you can use job
intent service auto to give you back
words can pass the board so that you
will use then jobs when you're on o and
you'll have an automatic fall back to
using services for you the really nice
part about this when you have that fall
back is will handle the wakelocks for
you so you don't have to worry about are
you going to make a leak or make a
mistake there so definitely take a look
at this when it comes out it's going to
make your lives a lot easier to adopt
the other last one here is about alarms
syncs and job scheduling these are all
good strategies to run jobs on a cadence
in the background that gives the OS
flexibility about when it runs so easy
an example if all these applications
before when we had a world of these
broadcasts being fired and that
applications can start services they'll
all start at the same time and the OS
really has only nukes to deal with this
problem we can only kill your process
there's no ability to throttle we can't
try to squish Ram it's just you live or
you die and when Ram becomes contentious
we start thrashing pretty rapidly when
you're using jobs and alarms the US has
now flexibility to defer to run one drop
at a time a few times at a time and
spread it out across the lifetime of the
device and that avoids and resource
contention it avoids janky UI in the
foreground because stuff is happening in
the background so I've made this really
exciting flow chart for you if you can
look at look at it later but the idea
behind it is roughly looking
one of the different stages that are
happening and what is the right choice
for you as a developer and for the user
to have like the the best most efficient
experience for the use case that you're
trying to achieve yes the end of this is
maybe you should do it in the background
and that'sthat's the one I really want
you to focus on it's think about it do I
really have to be doing this is the user
going to understand what I'm trying to
do if the user is going to understand
what you're trying to do and a great
example of this are like navigation apps
music playing apps various exhibit
accessories exercise applications all of
those scenarios if you're running a
foreground service and the user sees a
notification it's going to make sense to
them you're going to be really well
aligned so in those scenarios please go
do that and other ones where you're like
I don't know how to explain this to a
user then you should definitely be
considering jobs or just be considering
not running it in the background at all
so transitioning that that was the
battery saving and executions portion
and now going to transition a little bit
to talk about location limits and the
idea here was to put some upper bounds
and what we're seeing happening in the
background around geofencing polling
than others and it was causing really a
significant amount of drain and the
reason its location is power-hungry and
there were really no functional limits
on what an application could do when
it's in the background with respect to
location and so it would end up with two
different scenarios we'd have and most
of them to be honest or accidental one
being is that applications are
aggressively requesting location and
this could be because they Rangers are
interested in where you are or they have
a particular use case but the one that
was really sad was this idea of least is
that if you're running in the programs
you're that you're navigating you're
going to have a really high rate of
query when you lis go to the background
that high rate maybe isn't necessary
anymore and the intention of the
developer was to reduce it but one of
these another similar memory leaks to
wakelock leaks it's still running full
blast and that we saw a lot of a lot of
applications pulling at once every
second getting a location request and
that's just going to completely destroy
battery and so those are the two areas
we're trying to target here so the idea
now is not to say that you can't run the
Brown as we're still enabling that but
the idea is to spaces out once every 30
minutes with a cycle of accuracy of two
to three minutes within those 33 updates
30 minute updates so you can think of it
as you have a 30 minutes layer off Li
with send an update accuracy of 2 to 3
minutes within that 30 minute cycle the
same thing will apply with Wi-Fi the API
is a little bit different we don't have
the kind of convenience for scheduling
but the idea is if you're banging on the
Wi-Fi scanning query you'll keep getting
the same results if you're going too
fast we won't actually do the query and
so those are the two strategies that
we've taken for location and for info
Wi-Fi so just a highlight you know
there's a number of options here that
are lower battery impacting that you
should be looking at one is fasting
batching geofencing and in the complete
last case again is to consider the
foreground service if you are using the
foreground service and the user
understands what's happening that's
really kind of critical but if they
understand what's happening that will
enable them to say okay yeah you're
running the background if you're
expensive I get it moving on but and
you'll have a relaxed relaxed
requirements when you're in that mode so
the other thing I wanted to talk a
moment I know it feels like a lot about
battery and then suddenly I'm talking
about alert window but um I want to take
a moment talk about it is there's a
number of use cases that this is coming
up with and to be brutally honest with
you
this was only intended for what the name
is system alert windows it was never
really consciously intended to be used
the way that it has been but we were in
a simpler world and API one and it was
left public and people have found really
amazing ideas and solutions using this
API and so we don't want to get rid of
it however we do want to try and put it
on Rails what we're really worried about
as many applications rendering on top of
each other
conflicting with each other there's no
attribution of what applications happen
to rendering an eight point in time and
so the idea was that can we add some
layering can we add some attribution
within the model and that's what we did
with the application overlay and so the
idea is here is with an app overlay is
the user can now manage what is floating
above their application activity it's D
org is he ordered properly unto
themselves and
you I and the application below and it
will automatically show a foreground
notification in the notification menu so
the user is aware if there are multiple
applications simultaneously using this
feature this way if they see it they're
unhappy with it they can go to the
application control the settings if they
want you should always make sure your
users are aware of using this because it
can be kind of surprising if it doesn't
happen and the other thing that we
changed was for targeting on oh if you
are now using this new overlay type you
will then see fit above the legacy views
so this is maybe your incentive to adopt
a new model is once you're using that
everybody will you properly Z ordered in
a kind of hell are you fashion and then
you'll sit below system UI but above
things like the keyboard and other
components so now in a transition a
little bit about talking about how we're
going to improve the system with with
data and you know that I don't mean to
blame anyone because it's not that's not
my intent but it's really a story about
applications and that phones are amazing
and you can do so many things with this
portable computing device however we
have resource scarcity mostly in the
frame of battery and the question that
comes up well then how do how do we
balance this and the big thing that we
realized and you might be thinking at
your seat like yeah no duh thanks but
weather really isn't great tooling up
until very recently to help developers
understand their impact and when we
reached out even internally at Google we
would find they didn't realize they were
doing it there and so that kind of
brought around a number a number of
profit I'll get into in a moment and the
other one is this kind of tragedy of the
Commons and that you have so many
applications on your phone and if any of
those applications say stick away clock
back it won't need one to do it and the
cost is now your CPU is unable to go to
sleep and you'll have a very recipie
distrain on your battery over time and
when you have one just wrapped and only
one needs to make a mistake you're
pretty much guaranteed to have a bad
time and so what we started looking at
is how can we get to a point of
sustaining performance introducing
accurate measurements for developers and
bringing online new dashboards
so let's dig in a little bit what these
are and the talk on bad behaviors it was
earlier in the day if you haven't seen
it please go hop on YouTube and go take
a look at it it's very very good the
guys that presented it are right here in
front staring at me good thank you but
the big one here is we're looking for
egregious behavior that we can all agree
on and so a good example of this is
wakelocks
is if you ask a developer you are
holding a wakelock for six hours
straight you weren't in the foreground
and the user wasn't interacting with
your application and pretty much
everybody said yeah I shouldn't have
been doing that and so the district
though it was it wasn't really good
instrumentation to help you understand
that was happening and that's where the
play console is coming in coming into
into its own and bringing out these
features so you can now see these type
of situations that are happening other
big one has been really severely
dragging frames so frozen frames frames
take over seven milliseconds to run also
really hard to figure out where in your
application they're occurring and even
if they're occurring and if they're
occurring what devices they were
occurring on and then the last one was
around crash looping in a number of
other crash crash things the other one
is we're also looking at the OS size not
to say that everything is about apps
it's not we do have to bring a level of
sanity and attribution onto the
operating system one you know good
example of that was the improvements we
made in boot time and really looking
hard at how the OS is structured and the
other one is also going to be started
looking at i/o throughput how many scans
are happening in the background in
different parameters and all these
things will start coming out and being
available for you guys over the over the
coming years so just to give you an
example of this I have a selection of
Google apps I have hidden the names to
protect the innocent flash guilty but
what I have put up there is a half line
and the hash line is effectively the
threshold that you're going to see of
when we say an application has crossed
into the territory of bad behavior so
you can see the majority of applications
in this cross section and these are all
major google apps most of them are quite
good and there's a few outliers that are
having issues where a wakelock is
getting stuck on their applications and
you can see the percentages here like
they look small but when you see these
numbers of like half a percent here 1%
there
this is just one act and as I mentioned
before only one app needs to make this
mistake for your entire device to suffer
multiply that by 100 amps if you work
out the ratio you're going to have a bad
time the next one here we're talking
about for drug classes and helping our
developers understand repeat crashes for
P defenders rapid crashing in the cycle
we generally had good instrumentation to
help the bubble to understand if you
crash but not necessary the severity of
repeated crashes versus sporadic crashes
do I have a population of 5% crashing
really extremely or does it really
spread across a population of 95% the in
the very last one here is about frozen
frames and you can see another example
of most applications are actually doing
pretty good and in this case there was
one it was a little not as good and we
passed this data along to the team
they're like crap you're not there in
sense obviously but it really makes the
experience the device not not really
that fantastic especially their
application and it makes the users 100
is my device wrong if the app add what's
happening so giving this information
back to developers and they're able to
start remedy remedying these problems
and solving them so the big thing here
is visibility and this is visibility
both for you guys as well as for the
user on their device so new developer
tools we're also doing a lot of outreach
both internally and externally with
bizdev to reach out the teams and form
them hey do you know this is happening
in your apps and many cases we don't an
easy it's a quick fix and especially
when it comes to wakelocks it's usually
a fairly straight for fix once you know
which way clock is the one that's been
stuck and the last ones here is better
than federal settings and the place to
run I'll talk a bit about that and then
OAM dashboards is we also want to get
this data over to OEMs
so they can see what's going on and they
can make sure the devices are
intrinsically good and I do have a
strong base to work on that you're not
seeing jank because of the device
freaking out but you're seeing you're
having a good experience and then you
have a deep data to control your own
destiny
so battery menu on here is about this is
the nuo battery menu and it was
redesigned with the idea of being
actionable for users we wanted to make
sure that you go to this menu you don't
go
okay I see it Google Play services the
settings Android OS and screen like what
am I supposed to think if I see this
there's really nothing actionable here
and while it was technically accurate it
wasn't necessarily useful to what you're
trying to do is to understand what
applications are impacting your battery
life so this is how we restructured it
and we also included though your
foreground interaction with those
applications and this is something that
happens really quite commonly and I'll
give you just a quick anecdote from
internally I had a bug file something
and it was about Android Oh battery life
it's horrible I don't make it past three
o'clock what's going on and you know dig
into the bug report look at what's going
on and what happened on their device was
they were playing Pokemon go for two
hours on Thursday at 1:00 p.m. and I was
at my reply was like that's pretty
amazing that you got this much battery
life at a Pokemon go on your phone also
it was Thursday at 1:00 p.m. Googler but
you know the thing was that I took away
was they didn't realize they played it
that long and so that has happening it's
quite often you'd see an athlete hydric
battery drain but you don't necessarily
recognize oh it's because I use my phone
like an extra hour today and it's hard
to remember how long did I really have
the screen on so that's how we really
structure it batteries they help inform
you of how long you're using the device
how long are using different
applications and so you can make this
like comparison that what is happening
in the apps we don't want to pass
judgment on an application being good or
bad it's not necessarily a bad thing if
an app uses 20% of your battery if you
were live-streaming an event that's
pretty decent especially if it was for
an hour or two so we're not trying to
say intrinsically things are bad if
they're high but we do want to add some
visibility so that a user can see this
is an app I didn't engage with for days
why is it taking up 5% of my battery and
then those questions who started
happening on the user's part and giving
you guys feedback and then you can see
the same data in the play console so
this is where I will transition to
talking a little bit about the features
so so you can kind of get an idea of
where we're going this is also my
suggestion to really look at background
limit to look at targeting though to
transitioning away from background
services to jobs alarms GTM etc and and
the thing is we want to get to this
amazing battery life that I started out
with multi-day battery life and to do
that there's a few things we're going to
have to have to change if you will but
I'll talk about some principles one is
we fundamentally believe applications
should be able to run in the background
we want much more well-defined
rules about when applications are able
to run today you can see a number of OEM
is taking strategies trying to solve
this problem independently and it
becomes really difficult for developers
to deal with that world when you don't
necessarily know what the rules are so
we want to get a lot of CRISPR there we
also want users to better understand
battery impact you could also you could
argue my previous statements about the
settings menu words like what the user
has to like do math in their head about
how much time that it uses how much
battery used and I agree with you
completely we want to get to a better
place where it's much easier for a user
to understand what's happening and we
want to then enable a user who says I'm
not okay with this and if the
application doesn't offer the control to
give them another option and
uninstalling the application something
other than the nuclear option and then
the last one is we really want this idea
of consistent device performance
that you shouldn't be worrying will my
device make it through the day today or
not will it be able to make it till I
get home on charger we want that to be
something reliable one of them like all
these use cases that were doing on
phones and all the properties from
Google all the properties that you're
making as app developers you can't
really rely on this stuff unless you
know your phone's going to be there and
so that's that's really the underpinning
for this general strategy and so how do
we get there so there's three can I big
here is we have to consider what is the
API contract we don't want to break the
promises we make to you however we do
make a lot of promises that we later
regret and so an example of this is a
wakelock
if you were just if you two genuinely
described awake
you're saying we've given the
application if any application can tell
the OS stay awake until I say to go to
sleep indefinitely and when you give
that level of control and there's not
really a way to close the loop you end
up with varying battery lives and so we
do figure out what is the right promise
to make to a developer and what is the
range of that promise that we should be
giving to enable the use cases but make
sure that the OS can be responsive in
the face of adversity or many
applications taking advantage of the
promise that's being made the other one
is that attribution that I mentioned
before and the controls so the user can
take advantage of the stuff and together
the three of these things should give us
a much better better structure and so
this is a all of this is again like you
see this little exciting badge of a
pending review on there these are really
just ideas to articulate how we're
approaching the problem because we know
it's a big change and so we're trying to
broadcast this change really early so
you could take advantage of it
you can start moving over to background
background limits and targeting node now
so that you're not going to have a bad
time later on and so some of these
things we need to look at more limits on
background scanning we have to adjust
those limits that we're doing we haven't
really gotten around to Bluetooth yet
we're also looking at applications
listening to other events on the device
and one of those things should be
happening or not the big one here is
deferring work we want the OS to have
more flexibility to have discretion
about when jobs run when it's all
services based the OS has really no
control if an app if a single largest
fall based application makes a
unilateral decision to increase its way
clock time the OS today and the user is
powerless to do anything about it and so
that's why we're looking to make these
transitions and the balance should be
now users are more in the driver's seat
about what features the application is
giving and whether the user finds value
in those features running in the
background and then they can articulate
that the defaults for all these things
is on and the model you can roughly
think of as long as you're cool the OS
will be cool or never going to be cool
oh and it's great it's in the scenario
though applications start getting
aggressive battery starts getting high
scanning rates start getting higher we
may start telling informing the user hey
this stuff's kind of heavy on your
battery do you want it to run in the
background and then they can articulate
that particular texted it back to the OS
and then we can begin having a control
surface for how we manage individual
applications and so then the user can
say these ten apps I care about a lot
these are the wraps not so much we're
not suggesting that we need to have a
micro managing menu that's not the
desire but using things like how users
are interacting with the application how
often are they interacting the GCM
messages when the application gets woken
up how often do they interact with
notifications
these are all great signals to inform
how the OS should dole out its limited
resources namely battery and so the last
one is we have to beef up the idea of
foreground service and figure out how do
how does that as an API surface and how
does that as a UI construct not turn
into all the applications rushing the
exits of foreground service and then
we're back in the same the same mess
that we are now at no control surface
again we want to find a balance so that
applications can generally do everything
they need and that in the extremes the
user is able to articulate approval for
these extreme situations and we're
hoping that that's going to result in a
much more stable much more reliable
device in the long run and so hopefully
that gives you a bit of insight about
how we're approaching Android health and
in mostly battery life and resource
contention so oh I forgot a slide but
the idea last one was attributed
attribution and value and so we want to
really make that make that identify it I
already talked about the points I want I
won't bore you repeating it and thank
you very much for the for your time
