and president of SGN sgn is the fastest
growing mobile game developer at scale
in the West four of us founded the
company and since then we've grown to
over 200 employees our goal is to
continue that growth right now we've got
four games that are top grossing and we
want to continue to expand the portfolio
top grossing games all of our products
launch across multiple platforms
simultaneously getting that right can be
very hard if you want to succeed in this
industry you have to make sure that
you're constantly iterating on your
product when you're at scale that can be
very difficult because there are tens of
millions of players every day enjoying
your game I'm Matthew caster tano I'm
SVP of game operations at sgn testing
has really helped us move from
subjective criteria to objective
criteria the inability to test led to a
lot of qualitative decision making now
with the tools that we have were able to
make quantitative based decisions and
use a very short feedback loop for
cookie jam we ran a really interesting
eye contest in which we toyed with the
background of the icon this led to an 8%
increase in our conversion rate we use
the agency that specializes in the
Preferences of Japanese consumers and we
came up with a icon that we used heavy
pinks and yellows that perform 12
percent better with the Japanese
consumers another game that we ran
experiments on was panda pop previously
we had an icon with a baby panda flying
through the air surrounded by bubbles
our designers came up with a cool
concept with the baby panda instead of
flying he was frolicking among bubbles
when we switched over the icon we saw an
uptick of 25% in organic traffic and an
uptick of 4% on the install rate we ran
a really interesting eye contest and
book of life the icon that featured
Moorea performed 10 percent better than
the icon that we had previously which
featured Chuy
additionally for book of life we tested
different copy for a description we
found that the enhanced copy which was a
little bit more direct and shorter
performed four percent better than the
existing copy that
the store store experiments has helped
sgn improve its ROI equation by
improving our costs through higher
conversion rates and improving our LTVs
through higher retention rates each test
that we've run we've learned something
new
it's provide us with actionable results
that have helped to improve our business
my first piece of advice is no matter
how big you are you have to stay nimble
be willing to innovate be willing to
fail you also have to love what you do
so we love to play casual games
I think that's core to making a
successful company and to making a game
that people want to play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
