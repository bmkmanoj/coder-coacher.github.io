cofounders of aviary there are thousands
of photo editing apps out there what
we've always looked to do is simplify
the experience for the end-user we want
something that no matter what your
background in tech is you could just
literally pick it up in less than six
seconds understand how to use it and
make your photos look great one of the
most amazing things about the Android
platform is our communication with our
users it's not really us responding to
bug reports that we see it's really this
ongoing to a dialogue we have with
people go through beta tests and also
through ratings reviews we can see
things as they're happening in real time
we can talk with our community to find
out what features they like and what
they don't like and what things that
would love to see in the app that we
haven't even thought of and implement
that in real time working with the
Android dev console has been amazing
compared to other platforms in
particular with Android we are able to
see metrics about them we're able to
search through them were able to
actually respond to users with the new
tools I would say that we're able to
identify issues twice as fast it makes
it easy for us to search through the
reviews contact users when we need to
get more information from them and just
in general it has saved me a tremendous
amount of time anywhere between five to
ten hours a week
Android in general is hugely impactful
to the aviary team it's it's over
two-thirds of our user base we use
search within reviews every day we use
it to validate new features for example
we recently released a new discover
feature we'll search discover to see
what users are saying about that and let
us know if they like it or if there are
problems with it and that helps us make
product decisions the ratings and
reviews feature has been immensely
impactful having the ability to quickly
drill into issues by device by app
version by Android version and then also
anecdotally sift through what users are
saying and the actual words they're
using is pretty unique to the platform
and it helps us develop much more
quickly
responding to users in the deaf console
has been immensely impactful for us for
instance recently we released a version
that I resolved a pretty major bug that
was affecting many of our users I went
into the dev console responded to all
the people who are experiencing the bug
and about 50% of them actually went back
in and ended up updating the review one
of the things I love about building for
the Android platform is how quickly we
can test and deploy on it we have this
fantastic beta community on Android that
can test out new features and that helps
us identify bugs or what features they
like or don't like much more quickly
being able to do that allows us to
iterate two to three times faster on
Android compared to other platforms
which is hugely impactful for our app
photo editor by aviary is meant to be a
dead simple but powerful photo editing
tool having that dialogue with our users
through the tools developer console and
the Play Store gives us we're able to
iterate much faster and deliver on an
easy simple interface which is really
powerful for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
