world is a great way to find new users
and increase your revenue we've gathered
10 tips developers have used to be truly
local while they go global in order to
find success many of these tips apply to
apps to design your game with
localization inline going global starts
with the design of your games code and
at screen layouts allow for variations
in language sentence structure
characters and number presentations that
you'll encounter when localizing for
example building in 30% extra space in
UI elements will help avoid issues in
other languages store all the content
you'll change when localizing in a
resource file so you don't have to
recode when you localize use system
provided formats for dates times numbers
and currencies so your app automatically
matches the user selection don't rely on
a data connection cheap reliable data
connections aren't yet available to
everyone a game that continues to run
without a data connection can
dramatically increase its potential
audience make your games installation
package as small as possible users
sometimes skip installing big games due
to device memory or bandwidth concerns
research local audiences thoroughly
understand your audience and everything
that matters to them look out for
significant cultural differences game
characters levels or scenarios that
could possibly jar with local
sensitivities look out for local
interest in specific game genres casual
games featuring cute characters do well
in Japan and Korea for instance whereas
war strategy games are big in Germany
and Russia look out for how local users
pay for games and in-app content if
carrier billing is common monthly limits
might affect how many and how often
users make in-app purchases research
general expectations in America and
Europe there are many common
expectations among Western markets peer
users are more engaged by simple
character based game icons without words
prefer screenshot showing actual
gameplay like to get started quickly and
discover new features gradually and a
deep meta game can keep them coming back
Spahn to item prices ending in point 99
research general expectations in asia
there are also many common expectations
among Eastern markets for example in
Japan users like casual games to have
icons with cute colorful characters in
the anime and manga styles but more
hardcore games icons should reflect
their games theme prefer colorful
screenshots that illustrate game world
content and theme engage with casual
games with a fairly steep learning curve
expect app prices to end in zero often
pre-register to get in game items as
rewards consider this a starting point
for your own research use the app
translation service you should try to
engage a professional third party app
translation service or even your local
fans to do a high-quality translation of
your app you can also make use of the
app translation service in the developer
console simply send your original text
in resource files you don't need to
amend your development processes to
accommodate the translator you should
also add your Play Store listing text so
that too can be localized test
localizations thoroughly testing is
still essential because even small
translation errors can prove
embarrassing and no matter how good your
localization efforts are they may leave
some text truncated or incorrectly
formatted test via locals reach out to
your user community you'll find a wealth
of language skills and local knowledge
there start marketing locally a
localized app needs localized marketing
local marketing can include a localized
store listing support from local user
community members spreading the word in
their language on global social media
and local channels to a localized press
pack sent out to key media and bloggers
and localized ad campaigns to kickstart
local installs and boost local launches
create a gameplay video trailer for your
store listing users like to get a good
idea of a games gameplay before they
install it adding a trailer to your Play
Store listing will help them decide when
you're creating a trailer make sure you
create market specific versions
highlight features of the game that will
hold most local appeal go for a
localized voiceover or use translated
subtitles if you can't support and
interact with your local users the
developer console automatically
translates google play reviews so you
can read reviews from users around the
world respond to these users let them
know their opinions matter and how
you're incorporating their feedback
users will appreciate the effort if you
can respond in their language you can
also use beta testing to test your game
and games localization with enthusiastic
users in a specific country before
launching more widely for more
