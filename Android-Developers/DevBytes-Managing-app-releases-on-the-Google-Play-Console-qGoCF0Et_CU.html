version of an app is an exciting moment
for every developer it's a critical
moment when you have to pay attention to
all the details to make sure your users
will have the best experience with your
app to make this process easier we're
announcing a new way to publish apps the
manage releases page in the Google Play
Developer console you start by creating
a new app listing click create
application and you can access the new
manage releases page in the left side
nav it takes you to this page which
shows the tracks to which you can
publish your app the production beta and
alpha tracks of course we recommend
running a beta test for all your apps is
a great way to test new features before
you launch them publicly if it's your
first release the page will be empty and
you need to select the tracks to create
the release for example select manage
production and then new release clicking
on upload apk will open the usual pop-up
and you can pick the file you want to
upload after uploading the apk it shows
up in the apks to add section the
release name is filled in with the
version name from the uploaded apk and
if you're releasing an app update don't
forget to fill in the what's new section
in release you also get the chance to
provide localization for all the
languages you already support in your
app listing and one of the best things
about the new manage releases flow is
that at any moment you can save your
draft release date and you can work on
other parts of the listing and come back
to finish it later to resume to your
safe State navigate back to manage
releases manage production and hit
resume once the release is ready to be
published you can click on review and
you'll be presented with a summary of
the release if you've got no validation
errors click on confirm rollout to
publish your app and you'll be
redirected to the releases page the flow
is slightly different if you're updating
an existing app because when you choose
your track and click on new release a
new draft is created like before but the
draft is based on the previous release
the apks of the previous release will
all be added to the list of apks of the
activate of course if you want you can
choose to retain them click the retain
button and you'll keep the old apks
because maybe they're providing support
for earlier API versions you can add as
many apks as you want at this stage and
for each upload you'll see a bay
pop up with information about the APK
and it's here that you can also attach
expansion files when you're done with
new apks like before you can edit the
release name and the what's new after
filling in all the information you're
ready to review your release if you're
releasing on the production track you
can change your rollout percentage
directly in this summary screen rolling
out your app gradually is a recommended
best practice and it has been for a
while
especially for significant app releases
it helps you identify problems and fix
them before your app update it's 100% of
the user base helping avoid bad reviews
and low ratings you can read more about
Stage four all out in the Google Play
Developer Help Center now whenever
you're ready you can adjust your roll a
percentage by clicking on update rollout
and just changing the value if you have
any doubts about what percentage to use
we have suggestions there for you so if
you have any problems on your ongoing
staged rollout it's now easier than ever
to halt it just click on the halt
rollout button and confirm the action
it's worth being aware that halting of
staged rollout will prevent new users
from being able to update to this
version but users who already have the
bad update will still have it so make
sure you introduce the fix as quickly as
you can once you've got the fix create
another release upload it and then roll
out that release simply keep the bad
release halted of course if the fix was
made without creating a new release
maybe you fix it on your servers you can
just choose to hit resume rollout at any
point another new feature we're
launching to help give you greater
control over the releases is the
artifact library artifacts include apks
expansion files and any other app files
and you can see the update in the apps
artifacts if you go to the artifact
library under manage releases you'll see
everything uploaded with your release
app with the new manage releases
functionality managing your app release
is now smoother more transparent and
easier to track gives you the ability to
manage your app releases with more
confidence
