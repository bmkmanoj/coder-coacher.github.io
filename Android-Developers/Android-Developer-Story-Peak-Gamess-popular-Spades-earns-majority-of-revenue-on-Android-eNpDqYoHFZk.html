to create global technology products and
regional ins of users we're based in
Istanbul so we started targeting Turkey
but very quickly we expanded into other
countries we take the classic game
experience and migrate it to mobile
creating a very socially dynamic
interactive community driven game so
that people can socialize have a fun
time send each other gifts chat in a
digital environment additional to that
we also build casual games the level
based tapping swapping matching type of
games our aim is to scale up all of our
games specifically in their target
markets and be a reputable player
globally
Andre is our priority mobile platform
currently we have
65k of installs every day from Andre for
Speight spots for example we have more
than 70% of our mobile revenue coming
from Android platform most of our games
are dependent on scale they get more fun
while we have people chatting gifting
each other and getting more users and
under it is a lot easier than any other
mobile platform it's dynamic structure
it's flexible asset ratio cycles allow
us to quickly fix something if something
is not going well this gives us a lot of
flexibility because most of our classic
games depends heavily on user experience
Google Play Station of absence six
critical bugs before the game is
downloaded by millions of players after
adding new features to our games we
release the update to 5% of our users
then we monitor the user feedbacks that
if everything is ok we increase the
percentage and make the game visible to
all of our players we've seen that the
app store images and change the
conversion of an app up to 20 30 % and
we've also seen that short description
long description all have an effect on
your conversion and even up like 5%
increase in our conversion corresponds
greatly to our cost furnace tools to our
marketing ROI and eventually to the size
of the game Android has been super
helpful in growing in international
markets we've seen that the user
acquisition was easier and it's massive
in scale there are a lot of companies
that you can work with in terms of user
acquisition
average cost per acquisition and Android
has been around turkey 40% lower than
the other mobile platforms and adverts
is our strongest source of acquisition
it's connected to all other Google
products that allows us a greater
visibility on how we're performing this
type of things create a long lasting
business for big games and for the last
two years we're honestly focusing on
Western Europe and North America and
trying to grow our games in
international markets because that's
where we believe our feature is lying
