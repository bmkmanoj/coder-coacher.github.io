change the way that apps look and feel
to create more magic moments but devices
running earlier versions of Android
don't have all of the same options I'm
Joanna Smith and one of the coolest
things that material design gave us were
toolbars which are now even more magical
because they're backwards compatible as
well a toolbar is a view that is richer
and more flexible than the traditional
action bar in fact toolbars are part of
your view hierarchy so they can be
animated or even react to scroll events
because it's a view you can use the
toolbar as a standalone element anywhere
in your app providing the user with
options and controls that don't need to
span the entire layout with at the very
top of the screen you can even have
multiple toolbars if the structure
depends on the content of your layout or
if you're providing user with many
differing controls to populate your
toolbar with actions and options you can
inflate a menu onto the toolbar to
display those actions to the user you
can also create your own controls like
adding a navigation button to go up to
the parent activity while toolbars can
be used in any part of your layout you
can also choose to use the toolbar
instead of the action bar whenever you
simply want more control over the
appearance and functionality of that
action bar so you use a toolbar in a
place of the standard action bar you
first need to disable the action bar the
easiest way to do this is to have your
theme extend from theme app compat no
action bar or it's light variant then
create your tool bar the way you would
create any other layout in your app and
call set action bar to designate it as
the action bar in the activity or
fragment by calling this method the
system will add the standard action bar
options for you so you don't need to
inflate a menu now you may be convinced
of how awesome toolbars are but how can
you use them in versions of your app
targeting older SDKs well toolbars were
added to the support library for app
compat v21 so now it's as easy as
calling set support action bar instead
of set action bar to replace action bars
on older devices so check the
documentation for all of the support
options available so that you can bring
more magic moments to your users and for
more tips on making sure that your app
is at its best check out the rest of our
Android development patterns content or

most importantly just continue to build
better apps
