ni-lewis we'll be looking at home screen
widgets and interviewing Kevin Barry of
Tesla coil software to learn some tips
and tricks for improving the efficiency
of your widgets or the next 30 minutes
on this week's app clinic home screen
widgets are an interesting category is
they can be either released by
themselves or value adds to existing
apps by providing window in your app
directly on the home screen we're just
going to be a powerful tool for
increasing user engagement and
encouraging people to get back to your
app now to get started you really need
to think about how you're going to
present your widget so perhaps more than
any other app type which is really neat
a lot of attention to detail on the
design side even before you start
developing that's right because they're
always there and they're very very small
absolutely so start by checking out the
widget design patterns on the design tab
at developer android com and then it's
time to head over to the app widgets API
guide where you can learn all the
practical details of exactly how you put
your design in action so we're not going
to go into the specific details of how
to build an app as all of that
information is already available online
but we do want to do is have a look at
some tips for making your widgets a
little bit more awesome right users love
widgets as way to keep information front
and center and as a way to customize
your home screen so that's designed
uniquely for you now with limited space
available on the home screen it's
important to do a good job to keep your
widgets and help them stay front and
center right you don't want people
getting annoyed with your widgets and
uninstalling them exactly so it comes
down to doing things like this not
draining the battery making sure that
they're have timely up-to-date
information that they have a UI that's
consistent with the platform but it's
still representative of what your app is
trying to do and that there should be as
interactive as they can be yeah
absolutely it's really annoying to have
a widget that's just sitting there being
a larger version of a shortcut if you
want to be able to not only put
information on the screen but also make
it accessible so for instance that the
calendar widget does a great job of that
and so over the years the power of
widgets has increased as the platform
has developed to give greater support
for how they can be integrated with the
now this started with support for
collection widgets including lists and
galleries and then we added the ability
to resize widgets which tell me that God
says my calendar more recently also
provided support to embed widgets
directly into the lock screen and this
is open up a whole new world of
possibilities absolutely yeah this is
extremely powerful it allows you to
users to perform actions or view data
without even having to unlock their
phone now as is typically the case along
with this great power comes similarly
great responsibility so it's really
important to take a few proportions when
allowing your widget to be locked
screened enabled the first thing what I
think about is being careful about
exposing information so the thing is
your lock screen is what you see when
the phone is not locked or when the
phone is locked anyone can you know pick
up the phone and see that information if
you're exposing things on that lock
screen that have to do with your
meetings you're having at work that have
confidential topics you know people that
are phoning you whatever you have to
remember all of that information is
going out into the world absolutely in
many cases that's a decision for the
users to make particularly with
something like calendar or email it's up
to you how sensitive you think that is
but you need to make sure as a developer
that it's really obvious to your users
what data or actions that they're
effectively removing that lock screen
protection from now for most user data
that's fairly obvious but especially for
actions important to protecting actions
that might cost the user money or risk
exposing private information you may
want to make sure that's an act in an
activity that's launched from the widget
not directly available on the widget
itself and you know even though it's a
it should be obvious to the user what
they're exposing when they add a
calendar or text message or recent calls
a widget to their home screen you might
want to give them a little reminder
anyway because a lot of times you think
oh yeah I'm going to put my calendar
there and you don't dig deep and think
wow sometimes my calendar has some
pretty sketchy stuff absolutely so today
we're going to look at three home screen
widgets starting with the minimalist
shortcut and care
clock widgets and then we'll break out
the scalpels for a particularly
penetrating look at dash clock from our
very own Roman Nurik who turns out isn't
a very good designer at all in his app
is garbage I'm just kidding let's take a
look at minimalist shortcut ok so I love
that this widget maintains its
philosophy within its logo and banner so
it's all about minimalism and if they've
taken that approach here I probably go a
step further though and consider
removing the declutter your home screen
text and really tighten up that banner a
little bit more I think doesn't really
adds a lot of information and actually
just makes it a little bit less
minimalist so you know I actually have
the opposite feel right now I think it's
kind of cool actually okay well there
you go um now this is a screenshot
provided in their Google Play listing
it's worth noting that it's not
immediately obvious where the widget
actually is but that's as much a feature
as it is a bug in this particular
instances the point of this app is to
try and have these very minimalistic
widgets now one of the confusing things
is that each of the screenshots has a
different wallpaper and a slightly
different layout so it's difficult to
tell what's a widget and what's a
background and when things are changing
and how so in any case you can see what
they're trying to achieve here with each
of those tiny little androids really
light gray on the dark gray background
along the edge of the screen now I want
to start by calling out a common
challenge for widget developers and if
you're building the app that happens to
have a widget then there's a variety of
things that you can do to help encourage
your users to check out the widget and
even if they never find it they can
still use the app but what if as in this
case it's just a widget while a lot of
developers will still choose to include
a launcher activity to help users find
and activate that widget and there's
nothing wrong with that that's that's
perfectly appropriate it stops people
from hitting install and then going I
installed your app and I can't find it
but as this is going to be the users
first interaction with your app it's
really important to make sure that the
aesthetic of your app is maintained in
this introductory activity so in the
case of minimalist widget that means
paying a little more attention to the
padding and maybe even considering
switching to something like a light
style with a white background something
which matches the banner the
this idea of minimalism it's also worth
noting that the specific instructions
like the ones given here they're going
to change depending on the OS version
and in fact on my jellybean device this
doesn't work long pressing on the on the
home screen doesn't bring up the widget
chooser so something you want to think
about when providing specific
instructions that you may want to check
to see what version of the OS it is and
even still a lot of users are going to
have their own custom launches their own
custom home screens which are going to
be different again so you really want to
consider perhaps providing links to
external resources or rather than
telling people exactly what they should
do as forth mentioning that when you're
talking about the padding this is one
thing that makes your app look really
unprofessional is when they you just got
a big block of text and goes all the way
across because obviously you didn't
really do any layout but as I learned
that while we were trying to do some
sample apps last week it's actually
really really difficult to make that
look attractive so we're going to put
out a sample app fairly soon hear about
making good readable text layouts that
work from froyo on up you can do it with
spaces on jellybean but you jelly bean i
think actually is not yes haha but pre
ICS you didn't have it so the purpose of
minimalist shortcut as I've kind of
implied already is to let you have
shortcuts to your favorite apps while
keeping your screen as simple as
possible it's basically a way of having
shortcuts without covering up your
awesome wallpaper I know they're
currently in beta so if this sounds like
something you're into now would be a
great time to download the app provide
them some feedback help them build
something even more awesome now speaking
of which here's a little bit of candid
feedback for you guys to help you create
an even better app this is the config
activity that's displayed when you add a
new widget it's got everything you need
but the presentation could be a little
challenging shall we say now this is
something that comes up a lot on the Act
clinic and I know a lot of developers
you know find this to be kind of really
nitpicky advice so I'm going to explain
just really quickly why this is so
important why we keep harping on about
this most users are going to judge both
the utility and quality of an app within
the first few seconds of opening it up
now fairly or not most of that judgment
is instinctual and it's based on the UI
aesthetics and the usability of that up
so that first impression here is if
something really quite complex there's
this list of options that's totally
comprehensive but that also means it's
really long so I'm scrolling for a long
time before I see everything that's
there now as a first time user I'm not
sure which of these settings is required
which are optional and in fact the most
important setting the one which lets me
choose the shortcuts and the icons that
I want to use isn't obvious to find and
in fact it's not even here on the front
page now getting this right is a
challenge and in fact it's probably the
area for a lot of widgets where you're
going to need to spend the most time in
terms of your design is figuring out how
do you present this one off config
settings to people in a way that they
can find intuitive and not you know not
challenging you want to have the things
you need there without hiding too much
of the functionality but you don't want
to display everything and intimidate
them until they go away so in a lot of
cases this is where good defaults and
easy editing comes in really handy just
need to make it really easy for me to
create that first widget and then with
some really sensible defaults so in this
example you may choose some of the most
common you know pre packaged apps build
shortcuts to them directly with what you
think of the most common icons and then
make it really easy for users to click
something within your widget set to to
edit that and modify it alright so
that's that's all I want to talk about
in terms of in terms of minimalist
shortcuts pretty good app I think it's
basically some submit picky UI changes
as you can make it even more powerful so
let's take a look at Tara time by a top
developer sterling doodle now I love the
icon a little less excited about the
banner she's a little crowded wouldn't
you agree uh yeah I this is one of those
banners where it feels like there
there's a lot of effort put into a
certain set of elements on the banner
and then the rest of it was like handed
off to an intern or something Tara time
there is it's in a really flat font it's
it's not probably the best font for this
it would be very difficult to read on a
small device but the background bitmap I
love it
absolutely and it gives you a really
good indication of the app now I should
point out having looked at Tara time and
this is this is not a new app you can
see that sterling is in fact one of our
top developers so this is a really
popular app that a lot of people love
and once we get to see some of the
screenshots you'll see just how
beautiful it is and so making sure that
that first impression is consistent with
the awesome graphics of the app itself I
think is you know a really simple but
important first step that you can take
interesting now unlike minimal shortcuts
Tara time is an app as well as a widget
so it has the advantage of being able to
show this when you launch the app and
now this is a pretty stunning you I
you've got the earth semi lit based on
the current time you've even got the
lights in the night sky you know showing
on the area that that is currently at
night which is incredible but we're not
looking at apps today so let's take a
look at the widgets that you can install
so there are in fact two of them and
this is what they look like and they're
both visually stunning they're really
good examples of the power of a widget
to really customize your home screen and
make it something that you really like
to look at and I think it's fair to say
that both of these options are
significant improvements over the
default analog clock widget I think yeah
so Sterling's biggest challenge here is
really around efficiency he's got this
rich dynamic content that needs to be
regularly updated and when you're
building widgets it's vital that you
minimize the required update frequency
of them and also minimize the amount of
data that you're regularly sending to
your widget so you'll note for example
that there's no second hand on the
display so most he's only going to need
the need to update that widget every
minute and hopefully he's found ways to
do it even less frequently than that
it's also great to see that both widgets
are resizable and they're available as
lock screen widgets as well and in fact
after playing with this today I've set
the globe widget as my new default home
screen icon lock screen icon because it
just looks so stunning and they've done
a really great job in that it scales
really well between when it's sort of
full lock screen between when the
keyboard is available
and that the globe is compressed so
really thrilled really impressive and
then we're going to learn some of the
tricks that you can use to have
something like this as rich you I
without draining the battery or you know
risking crashing the launcher when we
talk to a cabin later today so let's
finally let's take a look at dash clock
and you release from our very own room
and Urich I think you looked at this in
one more deep yes yes and let's just get
it out of the way right now this is
master piece of beautiful clean
intuitive designs that's the standard by
which all maps should be meant measured
and I it's the last lock screen widget
you will ever need so let's rip it apart
a little bit um so first off the the
lock screen or I'm sorry the UH now we
had the feature graphic I think could be
a little bit better done and the the
title has more space that it could take
up I don't think you should be afraid of
letting your title overlap other
elements in your scene it needs to be
really really big so and especially with
extremely minimalist feature graphic it
could really use a little bit more in
fact i would take out the device with a
3d look and maybe just zoom in on the
widget itself to help people understand
what it is but um really it just bid it
because there's all those gradients in
the background I know he never left meet
ingredients I think he has the gradient
license well it makes me feel a little
bit better that he still feels forced to
use that that horrid blue that he makes
us use
okay so this is a wonderful app on that
this is what you see when the app is
launched I there's a very obvious set of
extensions it's really really easy to
understand how you're going to add an
extension because he went ahead and put
an ad extension button as the last thing
in this list it's really easy to manage
the extensions in fact the only
complaint I had was that probably
because I'm old I wasn't able to
rearrange the extensions very easily you
know once you get a lot of extensions in
here Roman did put in a great drag and
drop rearranger it's very very fast it's
very very fluid but it only works if you
grab the absolute left hand side there
where that little bit map handle is the
one that says grab me obviously but the
reason I I feel like this is it worth
talking about is that you can swipe the
notification or swipe the extension to
dismiss it just like a notification and
you can swipe it from anywhere so the
horizontal swiping works when your
fingers anywhere on the extension and
vertical swiping only works in one place
not that kind of confused me I thought
that was unnecessary you'll notice that
some extensions but not all have extra
screens available and notice that Romans
put really nice-looking Chevron's I'm
just kidding he put a Settings icon on
the ones that have settings so it's
really obvious how to get to the second
page if there is one and it's also
really obvious which extensions don't
have a second page so Bravo there the
second page is also an interesting study
in how to do an action bar right so he's
gone to a page of settings for an
extension which may or may not have been
written by the author of the app because
dashclock actually accepts third-party
extensions really kind of cool so he has
changed the action bar from blue to
black and then of course put a nice
little icon in the corner there to let
you know when how you can get back to
your main settings page when you
actually use this widget it can display
in two different modes there's sort of
compact mode here where you see just the
clock and a minimal version of some of
the widgets or extensions that you've
chosen or the full mode where you can
see all of the information the only
thing that I thought was difficult to
use about this app actually was that
while I can customize a great deal about
the appearance I couldn't customize it
with a preview that was on top of my
wallpaper so as you can see it was
difficult for me to get a set of
appearance settings that actually worked
with the kind of busy wallpaper that I
have on my phone so a little
disappointed in that I was also a little
disappointed in some of the extensions I
actually don't know which ones Roman
wrote and which ones other people wrote
but as you can see in this shot there's
a couple of extensions you know for
instance the upcoming alarms or the mail
extension that are perfect just a little
icon with all of the information you
need but there's a couple of other
extensions that get cut off and ellipse
ified and that seems to me to be a
really big problem i don't know if that
area is just too small or if it needs
some somewhere design thought or maybe
Roman this needs to do something about
third-party extensions but as soon as
you see ellipses in that area and you're
really confused the only other thing
that I was a little bugged about was the
appearance dialogue which I don't have a
screenshot of and the reason I don't is
because I've got a lot of nitpicks but
they're all designed knits and they
don't have really have anything to do
with the app clinic so Rome and I are
going to have a little
meet up in New York and I'm going to
show him exactly what's going on and
then if I'm lucky I'll be back to the
show okay yeah all right so let's go
ahead and move on so some of the most
important aspects of building good
widgets are pretty much invisible to the
user yeah but they're not invisible to
the app that's hosting your widgets so
luckily we have the developer of several
app widget hosting apps Kevin Barry of
Tesla coil and he is the developer of
the app launcher nova launcher yeah we
interviewed him yesterday to find out
what he's learned about good widget
design so to find out a little bit more
about how you can build really great
quality widgets we've got Kevin Barry
from a Tesla coil software developer of
a very popular home screen replacement
nova launcher now he's been developing a
nova launcher which is a replacement for
the home screen which means he can see
first hand what happens when you build a
widget which doesn't really work very
well so let's let's throw it over to can
find out a little bit more so can you
start off by telling us a little bit
about yourself and Tesla coil software
oh sure so as Rita said I'm Cavanaugh I
do nova launcher and widgetlocker which
both can host widgets tessa quests
offers just me oh it's a small operation
I nova launcher is built off the open
source android launcher so that is Nick
good a good base to work with excellent
excellent and so it's just yourself are
you able to do this full time or is this
a hobby that you do on the weekends
again it's been my full-time job for
like widget just would you like her
alone was enough to be my full-time job
so that is fantastic what's it out for
me always good to see ya someone who's
able to take care something fun and turn
it into a day job so nicely done all
right so I guess what we're talking
about today is widgets and so can you
tell us a little bit about how you know
how is it that you're able to give us
some of these these efficiency gains or
how do you get that extra insight into
what makes a good widget also a lot of
the launcher is slaying the widgets
being fast and smooth um and disclaimer
the widgets is a lot harder than going
to think the widgets are generally
content rich which it makes sense for
the widget provider and it makes sense
for the user they want to sit with
beautiful images um but it uses a fair
amount of memory and so this just using
the memory nova launcher can hit its
memory or any launch its memory limit
from having too many of these widgets or
changing out these images can carve
caught us garbage collection which is
going to slow the scroll on the floor
laundry um so really I like to see the
well-designed widgets that are just
using the way finished side to that
using these images they're sending them
officially so it's less work on the lawn
chair and it's-- everything so alright
so basically the the better the the
better the widget the more smooth fast
and efficient you launcher can be yeah I
mean users care about this and they will
start noticing it's not the launch it's
the literature and the last need for
rigid recommendations nice so that's a
yet another vested interest it's
interesting it's something we found last
year at i/o we made a big deal about you
know project butter making everything
smoother and faster and everything else
so it becomes incredibly important when
you're embedding someone else's app you
know their widget into your app you know
if you want what you're doing to be
smooth and buttery and users like you
say really do care it's important that
the things you're putting in their work
as well so what are some of the most
common best practices or I guess maybe
anti-patterns either way you want to
look at it that you you've seen widget
developers use or not use which you'd
like to share yes so we are the main
thing I want to talk about was how is
that the images and so there's two
popular ways of setting images on what
is to use the remote views they have a
odd set it now per second if you than
that and this is pretty nasty if you use
it for a small bitmap that's fine and
it's convenience you just generate your
bitmap and you
send that who has to have been here is
first your service young your widget
service has to make a copy of all the
pixels of the bedpan so that's a large
amount then it gives it to the android
framework where that has to hold on to
it for a while then it sends it to the
launcher the launch of in has to fun
carcel bat so it's creating another copy
of it saying a large amount of double
the memory needed for the image and then
we can ultimately display on so this is
its craving garbage and android has a
transaction size limit so you
individually can only transfer so much
and I only other chili can receive so
much and it's like five too many widgets
saying that bits at once oh I can't
handle it I'll crash I'm so this you
sending the next through through parcels
through binders is just it's bad um
there's a better method we're just used
to em if you set image you are I on and
so this mean that you're flying overhead
is really small you're just making your
eye and sending that over then the
launcher itself loads ax um this odd
there's some tricks to use it as though
to it means you have to have your ice
you need a content provider for it um
and previously a scene which is use the
file colon slash slash as the URI and
this worked but some future version of
Android is going to have the read
external storage permission and the
default launcher doesn't have that at
this time I kind of doubt a go getta so
you don't want to be using this file and
such as you are I stating need to create
your own kind of wrap or your I we can
just open up the input stream and said
that send it on um I don't have a good
example that is not making the witcher
goes for senior another downside of the
site majorities it's not a synchronous
um but neither is the set the second
interview bitmap this is something
hopefully future version of the android
framework can help with is blending
widgets obvious asynchronously not
lagging the launcher and you still want
to use small images here because even if
you're now you're not creating a copy of
it but your still giving this
potentially large image to launch
display and vilandra just has to
down that's taking time to scale i am
using uncle mantras memory buffer um
I've seen like some context which it's a
scrollable contact which is still look
nice you can flame through me scroll but
when you fling through those and it's
they're loading like the full-size
contact I think it could be like a
thousand pixels while nice and you're
just landed in 96 x 96 that's a good
luck scale those ahead of time save them
as best ink however save them to your
initial surge of something and then just
give the launch of the smallest version
you need that makes a lot of sense i
wonder if along the same lines using
something like i can't remember exactly
the name but a drawable we were able to
set the image level so that you have
basically rather than having to send
through the the bitmap of the drawable
every time you want to change it you
could just basically send through the
the int value of the level that you want
to display would that sort of approach
work similarly yes for something like i
imagine like a clock you could use
something like that but for something
where you're getting dynamic content ah
you know it's not your resources you
have another do that makes a lot of
sense so going along the same lines you
know you're mentioning that you know if
you get too many updates from too many
widgets at the same time then that's
going to cause you problems in
processing all of those and something
which we've talked about before as well
which is widgets it's important to keep
them updated but it's also important not
to refresh them too often from your
experience you have sort of a best
practice what you would recommend as an
appropriate frequency with which to
refresh your widgets um I guess is it
really does happen when it happens like
a normal and Richard tries if you're if
you're scrolling through the screen it
tries to gonna defer those which are
updates um but it's tricky to do than a
friend recently though for that so it
can't always manage to do so um really
the only building real calm we've had is
when they people have animated widgets
which android does not support animated
witches and but then you have to do it
is it slows the whole system to college
really don't do it on it absolutely I'm
it's one of the key tips that we say is
you know you should really only be
updating kind of on demand and certainly
no more frequently than every sort of 30
minutes it's almost like you want to
send as much content to a widget as you
can and then have it use things like
imagepages to you know modify the
content without having to sort of send
stuff to it to constantly have to
process so I wonder you know efficiency
aside are there certain things what
you're seeing a lot of people making
mistakes on things causing crashes in
widgets which you then have to deal with
women within your launcher um yes some
widgets can crash cannon do crafts
launcher um so uh nova launcher tries to
catch these and just brush the widget
not all thing but then i say crash
report so i can try to contact which
developers um but i can't always so some
common things are there's a
illegalstateexception it can happen if
you update a list you adapt or not from
the UI thread without I just have an
analyst field but it happens to which
bits do too um so when you're updating
the adapter used for your scrollable
widget make sure you found the best
practice is there you're updating it
from the UI thread and you're only
finding changes um there's transaction
two large which I kind of touched about
before which isn't generally that's sort
of the next but no matter what you're
doing don't don't embed a huge amount of
information in your widget update I'll
try to get it from a content provider if
you can um oddly enough there's security
exception sometimes um sometimes the
sometimes wishes will ask the launch of
Justice place than from account provider
it doesn't have access to it like
getting something from a context
provider or whatever um I imagine these
are caught pretty quickly but some like
the LG launcher does have more
permissions it has permission to the
contact provider so you can just test on
some skin phone you're not certainly
going to see these so you only want to
test on the third party launcher as well
yeah that's a good point as well right
in that
the widgets themselves are running
within your or the launches process
which means that the permissions which
your app needs are which a widget needs
are dependent on what the home screen
that the launcher actually has and you
can't like your new electric she does it
is able to read for nasty car because
I'll use it for other things um you
can't count on a lunch or having that
the defaults Android launcher doesn't um
what does now because androgel Alex
anything to but one android doesn't the
android lock the default launcher
probably wanna and the different
launcher is a difference this is
different from the widget crashing but
the on the galaxy s3 the default
launcher and samsung's launcher doesn't
apply any padding diligence um but Ice
Cream Sandwich said that we just get a
live it's generally a DP of padding so
if you test your widget in samsung
launcher than you test it in a
third-party launcher were you tested in
but a stock Android not sure you're
going to get patents different um and
there's no you can't really control this
you can't detect what I'm running on
samsung add extra pending because they
might be using a third-party launcher um
so just test it looks good either with
the padding that the stock android has
or without touch which doesn't have yeah
it's a really good point the testing as
well sorry guys not going to go there
one more exception i wanted to point out
was um when you're when you're doing
with a list view and you have different
few types so this is sometimes you have
a hatter and then you have a actual item
um you have to return a count forget you
type count instead of normal app if you
don't return the correct value here
while you're scrolling through it your
Apple crash in the case of widgets if
you return the wrong get you type count
up in the launch itself is gonna crash
on listening right index out of bounds
exception on and scrap use the key there
so there's fixes to probably increase
your getting you type count to the
correct number alright that's a good tip
that's actually a good point you made
earlier as well about testing I think a
lot of people are going to you know just
use an emulator or whichever device they
happen to
to test their widgets not considering
the fact that not only are you going to
have different home screens from
different manufacturers but in fact
users may download things like nova
launcher to have their own in a
third-party launcher so i think it's a
good tip for people building widgets to
test on multiple launcher
implementations to make sure it doesn't
just work on stock android great oh
that's that's definitely really helpful
i think a lot of really good tips there
for people building widgets it would be
remiss of me not to ask what some of
your favorite widgets are um one which I
like but met other developers apply like
the users volunteers at munger um which
it shows your app sales for the day or
whatever you're so nice that's nice time
on your home screen keep an eye on how
you're you're actually doing absolutely
Andrew the pro budgets is another nice
stuff they have scrollable widgets for
like Twitter and calendar and everything
contacts and I work with the developer
there to work out some performance
issues so they're pretty good for now
about using proper sized images
excellent cool all right well thank you
very much for your time I very much
appreciate you coming on and sharing
some of your experience and wisdom on
widget creation with our audience so
thanks very much and we'll hope to talk
to you again soon thanks right so some
really useful tips there from Kevin
thank you Kevin that was fascinating
yeah thanks for thanks for stopping by
we appreciated and and would invite any
of the developers who zaps we're going
to be looking at 20 to get in touch and
go out you know for some of their own
feedback so our next step is to take a
closer look at today's apps and see how
close they are to being pure Android so
to do that as always we're going to pass
them through each of these checklists
until then we can you can find our pure
Android collection at bit ly / pure
Android and you can nominate your app
for consideration by adding it to you
how Trello page you can find that by
searching for app clinic Trella we've
actually updated this recently to give a
little bit more insight into exactly
what we're planning to do week over
where
so we're going to be reaching out to
some developers specifically to ask if
we can review their apps online and we
would encourage you to self nominate by
going there finding out what's what's
happening in the coming weeks and
throwing your app in there would also
help us out if you give us some contact
details so we can reach out and talk to
you beforehand absolutely now before we
go I got to ask you this because we
talked about how the minimal launcher
had an app icon mm-hmm that's in the
launcher so that you can get to its
settings page Romans a widget larger
does not hmm I think it should what do
you think I think it's a really
interesting question I think if you're
building if you're building a widget
we're just going to target pretty much
every Android device which can have
widgets and I think it probably makes
sense to have some sort of icon there
the challenge or opportunity with Romans
is that it's only available for devices
running Android 4.2 and now especially
that tends to be pretty new phone
purchases more at the sort of upper end
of the techie geeky sort of equilibrium
so the sorts of people installing and
using the app may be more likely to be
able to find the advanced features such
as lock screen widgets so I think it's
it it's kind of a tricky call but now i
think you know some of the challenges
that we talked about the fact that you
know you can't even give really simple
in step-by-step instructions on how to
install the widget means that well you
know if you're the one who has to
explain how to install widgets your
chances of them finding it and find it
useful or probably pretty yeah i always
used to hate it when somebody would
install an icon for their live wallpaper
right then yeah and the only thing that
made me think otherwise was that Romans
widget is not just a widget it's also
container for other widgets yes this is
a good point something to think about
we'd love to hear what you guys think
about about another question so go ahead
and give us a shout out on google+ and
we'll be back next week don't forget to
join Roman Nick and Adam on Android
design in action next Tuesday and until
they until next week I'm rate of mine
and I'm in the Lewis and this has been
the app clinic goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
