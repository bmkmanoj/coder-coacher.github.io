right I'm sure
us share the next speakers so I'm hamaji
from the representing the platform team
on Android and this is tu anari
representing the tools team which will
not share for her for us you're here for
race official speakers so Roman and I
have been incredibly excited about this
official announcement of Kathleen we
both love Colin in case you haven't
noticed already and we don't want to
take any more time from the speakers of
honor so without further ado here they
are
so hello everyone
ah that's nice so you know I was
thinking the other day at the first time
that I ever did a talking Colin it was
like a four and a half years ago and
they gave me a room for 900 people and
seven people showed up so it's kind of
nice to see more of you show up today
thank you anyway I'm got I've got
roughly around 30 minutes actually study
a little bit less 28 minutes to give you
a whirlwind tour of Colin so I'm not
going to cover the entire language I'm
going to try and show you as much as I
possibly can and how you can use it and
where it provides you with some benefits
okay so I'm going to try and do it all
with live coding so if it all goes
terribly wrong there's a Google video I
mean there's a YouTube video of this
somewhere as well so you can watch out
okay so we're going to start with
something very simple that you've
already seen data class and I'm in a
function I'm in a file called main right
so data class I'm going to create a new
type called money and it's going to have
an amount which is of type int I know
don't say anything so now and it's going
to have a currency of type string okay
and this is both properties and they're
going to be read-only properties so this
is something that you're already
familiar with it's essentially a data
class let's go ahead and compare that to
a Java one that I have done earlier so
split vertically and let's get the Java
money up as Studios get it on this side
Java money so there you go that's kind
of the equivalent of what I've just
written right a Java Bean essentially
data class that provides two getters
they're immutable so they read-only and
this data modifier over here what that's
doing is essentially giving me a whole
bunch of things like the two strings
it's giving me the clone which in cotton
cotton is called copy it's doing the
equals it's doing the hash code now you
say okay well that's great
brilliant but why do I need that
because any good IDE is going to
generate that for me it is true it does
but the problem is that that's code
you're going to have to maintain and
every time you add a new property you're
going to have to go back and change our
code and the other issue you're going to
have is you don't know in fact if that
code is the standard stuff that caused
it that you're you know the ID has
generated for you or you've tweaked it a
little bit okay so it's not just about
saving on typing on the on the first
line right now what I'm going to do is
go ahead and create a function main
let's close this guy over here and this
is like the top entry point of calling
so you have a public stack public static
void main in a class you don't need that
in Colin so in calling you can put
everything in the top-level it's kind of
like JavaScript in a good way and so you
don't have to like and just I want to
reiterate like every every function and
everything that I'll show you today I'm
going to just add it in the file at the
top level thing but that doesn't mean
that you don't have any more member
functions anything any class even a data
class can have member functions but for
brevity and for the purpose of what I'm
showing you I'm just going to put it as
top-level okay so I'm going to create a
new instance of money and we're going to
call it for example tickets and I'll say
money 100 and it's going to be dollars
right and I'll get into the explicit
type here but it's essentially here what
I'm doing is type inference so Colin is
very strong in type inference and as
much as it can infer it will for you so
you don't have to explicitly tell the
type and I'll say for example a popcorn
let's say ticket Chloe right so that's
what that's going to do is basically
copy the previous one for me and all of
the properties so if I don't pass any
parameters in it's going to just take
the same values as it has before okay so
I comparison the new parameters say like
you know I mean in Spain for example
popcorn is seven times the price of the
entry of the cinema so that's going to
be like 500 euros right and now I can do
things like for instance you know if a
ticket is not equal to
popcorn then trendline they are
different right so what this is doing is
a property comparison one by one it's
not doing a point of comparison for
points and comparisons we have the
triple equal right different to
JavaScript there isn't like a chart of
600 different positions you have to
remember so and this by the way is found
ligatures so don't get confused with
that we didn't introduce a new symbol
okay so I can go ahead and just like run
this and I get they are different and if
I change this to a hundred and I put
this as dollars and I run this it's
going to say to you that nothing because
they are the same okay now one of the
features we keep posting about is the
interval between Java and Kotlin so we
have this Java money one over here so
I'm going to go ahead and create an
instance of it and I'll say Java money
equals Java money and it will be a
hundred and it'll be dollars and then if
I do Java money you can see that I don't
have any getters what I do have actually
a getter so I can do get amount but if I
write get amount completed the ID is
already going to replace that for
property because we don't have really
like getters and setters we just have
properties so that's consuming Java from
codling and if I go over to the java
over here and let's go ahead and create
a public static void main and i'll do so
let's say I've got a declare the type
money equals new money 100 and dollars
and of okay that's the other thing the
semicolons in Kotlin are optional and
the reason they're optional is so that
you can have endless arguments over
whether you should use them or not
we're trying to compete with JavaScript
that okay so money dot get amount so now
I'm using a Java type sorry a calling
type from Java so I'm getting together
than the setters right so idiomatic
depending on how you are using it okay
and that's just you know different Java
files different calling files in a
single project working seamlessly
without any issues right so now let's go
ahead and create some functions so I'm
going to create a function called send
payment that take some money and money
and it's going to print line the money
out and of course we have string
interpolation so I can say sending money
dot amount and you don't have to put
these curly braces if it's just a single
property that you're passing into the
wheel we'll just see in a moment so now
I can call this and say for example send
payment tickets right now calling we
also have notice one thing here I'm not
defining the return type okay by default
it's unit which is kind of like void but
it's not it's actually a object which is
essentially a single tenant single
instance of an object and if it is a
unit you don't have to put it there
right so I'm going to add a new
parameter here and I'm going to say for
example with message and this has gone
top string and you can have default
parameters so here notice that there's
no compilation error because I made a
default parameter this saves you a lot
in terms of overloaded function
overloading member functions right I can
just you know have these four parameters
and then do what I want and you can have
multiple default parameters and since
you can have multiple default parameters
and you can you know alternate in which
one you want to pass in you can also do
named parameters so in fact I could say
message equals good luck and money
equals tickets right and this is kind of
useful as well when you are using you're
talking to legacy code for example you
know some function that you can't modify
and it's got 600 parameters and there
probably 800 if 500 of them are true and
false boolean
it kind of gives you some insight into
what parameters I'm passing in every
position
oh yeah my lover when people crap oh
crap and and I'm thinking to myself well
this is going well anyway right let's go
edit that out like them adult
supervision right
one other thing with Collin is that when
we have functions that are really really
easy like essentially returning a single
value you can just do single single
expression functions so I omit the
return type explicitly I omit the curly
braces and I just returned the actual
function that I want to do okay so in
fact this is like the concept of
expression comes in many places in
Collin so for instance let's create
another function that's called convert
to dollars convert to dollars and this
is going to take a money money and it's
going to return money and then what
we're going to do here is when statement
so that's essentially a case right so
when money currency is dollars then
we'll do return money as is right
because I don't need to do anything and
if it's euros then what I'm going to do
is return a we're going to do money
amounts times sorry I've got to create a
new instance money and then it's going
to be money amount times a big decimal
one point ten and then that's going to
be dollars right and else throw illegal
argument exception not the currency
you're interested in okay so this you
can actually treat a win as an
expression so I can return I can remove
this return over here remove this return
over here put it just here and then this
just makes the when always return an
expression and in fact you can even
remove the return here
we turn remove the money here and remove
that there and you get a single
expression okay single expression
function now one thing that you notice
here that this is giving me an error
because this is you know I'm trying to
operate a big decimal with an int so
we're going to go and refactor this I'm
going to call it big decimal okay now
talking about big decimal oh here we go
big decimal big decimal one hundred and
big decimal I love typing big decimal I
love it okay so we've got this over here
now if you look at actually on big
decimal so if I create a new big decimal
we'll call it BD 1 equals big decimal
100 you can see that BD 1 gives me a
whole bunch of functions like divide
multiply all of these things what if I
wanted to do something like a percent I
wanted to do a percentage of big decimal
now normally you would basically inherit
from that and then create your own
version and have all of these things but
in calling one of the features that
we've added and if you're familiar with
C sharp is called extension functions
which essentially means that you can
take any class any type and extend it so
I can take font a function big decimal I
put the name of the class that I want to
extend and I say I want to do a percent
and what is the percentage that I want
to do for example an integer and then it
would be let's see so given that this is
an extension function it's going to have
an instance of that class of that object
right so I can use that reference out
with this and I say this multiplied by
the percentage and then this has got to
be wrapped in a big decimal again
percentage and then that divides and
then another big decimal 100 and what's
wrong with this that should be
percentage so percentage okay so now
what happens is that on BD 1 I have
percentage okay and I can do percent 7
that would give me a Samson and that
extension function gets included
anywhere where it is defined in the
package right so here in this case I
have it in column J brains rgo and that
will get included there right so you can
create extension functions that will see
that the standard library actually
consists of a whole bunch of extension
functions now we'll take this one step
further because I can actually expand
everything so let's go ahead and expand
an integer so I'll say fun in percent
off and here we'll do the reverse so I
want like 10% of something right so I'll
say money for instance I want 10% of
money and that's going to return the
let's see it's going to return money
right then it will be amount multiplied
and then here it's going to reference
the actual instance so it will be this
and again this has to be wrapped in big
decimal and then divide by 100 okay and
I think I got that in the right order if
the implementation is wrong doesn't
matter who cares anyway
so now what I can do is something like
this seven percent off big decimal 100
ok oh no sorry money so I can do money
no don't clap yet' money let's just take
the money I have seven percent of
popcorn okay nice
let's let's do a little bit nicer what I
want to do is I in fact something like
this I want to do 7% of popcorn that
would be nice and you can actually do
that you see that little Wiggly there
squiggly alt-enter a dim fix there you
go
okay so any extension function that can
that has a single parameter can be
called an infix notation and what I've
done is essentially add the in fix over
there and this is some of the things
that allow you now we call in to kind of
create the whole DSL approach to things
right so one thing that I hates it doing
here is all of this big decimal that's a
pain right and in calling you when you
want to create a value of type long you
can say long 100l and that will be a
type long and it will be awesome if I
could do like you know well BD 2 equals
100 BD but you can't and we don't have
that built in but what we do have in
Colin is called extension properties so
they're exactly like extension functions
except they extend with properties so I
could do something like dot BD right and
now or let's uh yeah so now see it even
says hey do you want to create an
extension property on type integer
yes so this is going to return a big
decimal right and then here I'm going to
do return big decimal and this which is
the instance right and I can in fact
convert this to an expression to make it
easier right so there you go now I have
100 BD so when I'm passing that in it
looks much nicer than big decimal I
could just do 100 DB ok
and one other thing around functions
that you can do is there are certain
operators that you can extend so you can
extend for example the plus operator and
what I'm going to do is I'm not going to
type this out I've just got a nice
little thingy that has done that for me
see how fast I am are typing so what
I've essentially done is now overrides
the plus operator for money so now I can
say how costs equals tickets plus
popcorn right and that allows me to add
to monetary amounts okay and you could
do that with plus minus multiply a bunch
of building up conventions that you can
follow for certain operators that allow
you to do that
okay so we've been creating a whole
bunch of pipes here and let me go ahead
and delete all this stuff so we can
focus we've been creating a bunch of
types here notice that in any of these
types of I've created I've never
actually specified the type and you can
so I can do for instance valve train
costs for example train is of type money
and then initialize it to some new value
right 100 dot B D and then dollars now
if I go ahead and do train equal null
it's going to give me an error and it's
going to give me actually two errors one
of them is because that's immutable
variable so I can fix that I've now made
this mutable you see that the ID
underlines it so it kind of like wants
to point it out that you know this is
really something you're going to shy
away from we don't enforce immutability
in column but we kind of do recommend it
like all of the lists and all of these
things are immutable by default so I
can't assign null in Colin because Colin
tries to get rid of the null pointer
exception by saying that types aren't
nullable by default right but there are
times when you want to have a type that
is not able for whatever reason you
you're bored and you can add a question
mark and then that will give you the
ability to assign null to that type
right now normally when you're working
with calling you probably don't want to
do this you probably don't want to have
multiple types but since we're
interrupting with Java Java
we know so if I create a function here
that is for instance Han Java money and
that takes money of type Java money and
does whatever with it right so let's say
I do print line money dot amount is
valid so this can be no it could be you
know if it's called by an instance that
a function that for example is returning
this type it could be now and you can
indicate that by adding the question
mark when you do that you can see that
the IDE is going to give you an error
right it says only safe operators or the
double exclamation mark are valid here
because it's essentially saying you're
going to run into a null reference
exception so there's two ways you can
solve this first of all you can say for
example money not null and then do like
if not null then go ahead and operate
with it you know put this put this one
up upstairs in there okay that's one way
all the shorts away is just to use the
safe operator or Elvis operator which is
over here so now we just say if money is
not null then do something now if you
want to have fun you can also do that
and that says I know it's now but I want
to shoot myself in the foot okay and you
got to be careful with that because you
have but a lot of times when people
start with Kotlin they get all of this
like little squigglies over here and
they're like well i actually don't know
if it's going to be not because i really
want it to not be null so I'm not going
to handle the case wearing it's not null
so I'll just do that and then they run
the app and they're like wait a minute
you said calling got rid of null
reference exceptions yes okay what else
right so let's switch to some other
stuff like higher-order functions now
you're all familiar with a higher-order
function which is basically a function
that takes a function or returns a
function and we have those in Kotlin so
we can say fine emails users list of
user and then I'll create a new function
which is critical so I'm passing in a
function here write a function that
takes a string and returns a boolean
okay
and then this probably is going to
return a list of users so essentially
what I'm doing is I'm filtering on a
list of users right so I'll do this
later to do later okay this to do by the
way is built-in you can use it instead
of non implemented exception and not
implemented error and it does a
additional thing that we won't get into
but nothing is actually very nice in
Kotlin but we won't cover that up it's
nothing to worry about I just made that
up okay good okay thank you so now how
do I use this so I can do find emails
right and I'll say I actually have a
user let's create some users here so do
this from JSON file and I have some
users over here so uses JSON so this is
actually this is actually a function
that I have ready which is basically
using JSON to read some users from a
file and this is a typical data class
that you already seen the only new thing
here is that this also got a enum class
of probably the property role okay
so now I can do like users and then I'll
pass in that function now I can pass in
the name function by using the colon
colon reference or I can pass in a
lambda and in Carleen lambda follows
this syntax you pass in the parameter
name and then you say for example the
parameter name ends with dot-com right
so I'm getting a list of users that end
with com now when you have a single
parameter in Colin you can actually
admit having to explicitly mention it
and replace it with it okay
so similar to Ruby you can just use it
the other thing that you can do in Colin
is when the last parameter to a function
is another function you can actually not
include it in the brackets so it feels a
little bit like it's outside and this is
again one of the characteristics that
allow us to create nicely ourselves and
you can even do this like multi-line so
if you look at fine emails now in a
sense it could actually feel like it's
part of the language but it isn't it's
actually a function
and when we have we implemented a
synchronous programming with co-routines
we didn't like you know if you're
familiar with c-sharp c-sharp does that
sink away their keywords in the language
in Collin they're not they're
essentially just functions okay so that
gives you the flexibility of deciding
how you want to do different things now
you don't have to do all of these things
because all of these things are built-in
so for example if I say comm users I say
users filter and you can see that as I
complete this it actually opts for the
version of including out of the
parameter so I can say the email ends
with comm and then I can go and sort by
it dot ID and then let's go ahead and do
for example map that to a pair of it dot
email and it dot username okay so all of
these functions are actually built-in in
that small standard library that ships
that you're not going to have problems
on Android it's very small and they're
all in essentially extension functions
on top of collections generic
collections right so you have all of
those functional things that you know
are very in fashion these days and so
this obviously gives you a parent in
fact you can do this even nicer if
instead of doing pair it to so map email
to username and guess what it is
it's just an infix function that creates
a pair okay
now sometimes I don't want to go through
the whole map I just want to for example
say get back a single element and what
you can also do is D structure classes
data classes in in Kotlin so I could do
something like ID username and email
okay and then I could just like you know
use the ID and this is great but then
the ID complains and says well this
variable is never used in that case you
can actually replace that with an
underscore right so there you go and you
can D structure the values you want
anything that you don't want to use
replace it on the score and you're good
to go right so what else can I show you
okay so I've got some other code here if
you're familiar with the concept of
algebraic data types it's essentially
one type a type that can be a one type
or another like for instance a boolean
now I'm calling the way that we do that
is with Co classes but before I get into
that let me go ahead and do an open here
right notice the first thing here that
user result is giving me an error
because by default in coddling you
cannot inherit from classes so all
classes are essentially final if you
want to inherit from classes you have to
use the open modifier right now I've
used the seals and the field is
essentially saying that this is the
hierarchy that user results has like
there's not going to be any other class
anywhere that is going to inherit from
user results everything that's going to
inherit from user results has to be in
the same file or you can make these of
course subclasses so I could move this
up there and this would be a subclass
but then I would have to prefix it with
user results right okay now I've just
created it as classes outside so why
would I want to do this because it looks
good now well this is actually good
because when you're doing some things
it's often like you're invoking a
function and you're like okay well if
it's successful I wanted to return a
value if it's not and I'm going to pass
in a message and then you get up like
this type that contains the values that
you want to return when it's successful
it contains the types that you want to
return when there's a message and then
you've got to figure out the semantics
of which properties are applied to an
error situation which properties are
applied to a non error situation or you
can just throw an exception in this case
you can use a function that basically
returns two types and then based on the
result do different things so here I say
for instance when let's create an
instant Val result equals user resolved
sorry retrieve users okay so now I can
do when result is success then we're
going to do for instance well we're
going to get the result and then I'm
going to do users for each for each
print line the name okay using it and
then we're going to do if failure result
print line results start message okay so
now based on the result based on the
type that is returned to me I can do
different things
I noticed one thing over here that this
has gone green I don't know if you see
it on the big screen but this has gone
green and this is a smart cast so that's
another thing that we have in Coleen and
you saw that when I was doing the null
check that it said this is not null
because it's smart casting so you don't
have to explicitly come over here again
and say oh you know I know that this is
of type success let me go ahead and cast
this to type success to then access the
property the compiler will do that for
you that's what the smart casting is
right and that's where not least before
I hand it off to Andre quickly just
mention also that a lot of the things
that you've been doing seeing with the
filter map all of those things those are
essentially eager eager evaluation right
but we also have the ability to do lazy
evaluation so I can do Val
for example sorry generate sequence and
then have something for instance one and
then here we'll do it times ten and then
we'll do values right now I'll say
values take ten and then for each print
line it now this is essentially creating
a sequence a generator that is infinite
it's never going to stop it's going to
start at one and multiply by ten but
what I'm saying here is that I just want
to take ten elements and then print them
out and what I will do is basically
consume
until it hits 10 it prints out go away
it prints out a beautiful Christmas tree
that's one sided okay pyramid whatever
and stops there and anything that you
have like for example the users that we
had of you know users from Jason users
JSON you can say as sequence and convert
it into lazy evaluation as well okay
that's all we have the time to show you
today obviously there's way more to the
language go online learn everything
about it and thank you very much and
I'll hand it off to Andre Thank You
Hattie hello everybody so I've seen
Colin already has many things in store
but I'm the nasty person who adds new
features before you learn the existing
ones so I'll be telling you stories now
but I'll need to find a clicker you'll
have a clicker no okay okay so I'll be
telling stories without a clicker so my
job here is to tell you about what we're
going to have any future versions of
Carlin oh thank you very much okay and
first big thing we're working on now is
platforms supporting different different
platforms so historically common
compiles to JVM bytecode same as the
Java programming language so we can run
on a server on the desktop and of course
of course on Android and it's just the
same bytecode everywhere this is why we
can run old versions of Android as well
as new ones but the story doesn't end
there because we are adding new
platforms and recently we've added
oh the God doesn't like platforms really
we add a JavaScript which means cobbler
can now compile to JavaScript code and
run in the browser or on ogs so now we
support three major the very popular
virtual machines JVM Android dalvik
JavaScript VMs but there are many use
cases where a virtual machine is not
practical or it's simply unavailable for
example for iOS virtual machines are
severely restricted you can do dynamic
code generation or for a small embedded
system a VM doesn't fit in or for say a
Linux command line tool the VM will be
starting to for too long so to now go
there and that's why we're working on
something called column native it's
currently available at the technology
preview and there we basically use LLVM
to compile cutting down to native code
to standalone binaries that can run on
different platforms currently we support
iOS Linux and Mac and Windows is in the
works so this is taking us to you know
this vision was common when it can run
inside an every component of a modern
application on any platform you like so
thankful stack web applications was the
server and the client both written in
Catalan or think we use a code between
mobile platforms Android and iOS for
example or mix the two previous use
cases and get like a real multi-platform
scenario so our vision for Kotlin is
having different modules in the same
project compile to different platforms
and of course you you want to share code
there right because if you support so
many different things you want to run
the same code in different places and
we're working on making that possible
but there is a very important thing
because previously many projects try to
unify platforms and this often ends up
being like the least common denominator
when you take only things that are
available on all platforms you're
basically stuck with a minimal interface
and that's something we don't want to
have there so we want you to be able to
use all the platform specific fancy API
is like the newest version of Android or
something else as much as you like and
if you want to share some code only then
you have to resort to some common ideas
so the idea there is that you have a
common module with lots of business
logic and stuff and it can work side by
side with a platform specific module
written also in Catalan and those two
can talk to each other so when you need
you leverage the platform API and when
you need you use the common code so
takeaway here our future is multi
platform next oh yeah next big thing is
four routines so the rationale there is
pretty straight forward everybody needs
to write asynchronous code right because
the world is too big now for sequential
execution and it's yeah it's our reality
but it's hard right who's written a
synchronous code quite so many hands
those of you who don't actually will be
doing this very soon and the problem is
it's rather hard actually to write
sequential code or it was hard before
languages learn to to support you in
doing that because the language can help
you there a lot so basically what we
have with four routines in coughlin you
write asynchronous code the same way you
write synchronous code so what do you
use in synchronous code loops if breaks
and continues things like that right and
it's the same things you're using with
routines for asynchronous code so that
the language keeps track of everything
and you don't have to express any
intricate control flow for asynchronous
computation in your code no callbacks no
fancy functional structures it's just
plain old sequential looking code and
isn't it cool
thank you yeah so the idea with Cortines
is that you basically have the same
abstraction for asynchronous and
synchronous and also it's it's a nice
metaphor to think of them as
almost three of free threads like here
is the only code example I'm showing you
basically very many things that are
traditionally done with threads can be
done with four routines but core genes
are extremely cheap so here on the slide
I have a code that creates one hundred
thousand proteins think about that one
hundred thousand fourteen is existing in
parallel and each one of them wait for
one second and returns one so this
program completes in completion one
second
almost one second because all the
co-routines wait in parallel of course
but if you try to do this with threads
it just doesn't work a hundred thousand
threads don't fit into memory that's it
so with four teams it's a win-win
situation you get lots of performance so
it's it's very efficient and the code is
simple so take away here check out for
teens because our future will likely be
even more asynchronous than our present
so I'm almost done and if you want to
learn more about Cullen check out our
website we have a section for Android
and also we'll have a question and
answer session right after this talk so
come over to the developer sandbox
section see myself and Hattie will be
answering questions there so thank you
very much for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
