indie developer making a game all by
myself called bomb squad I started
writing bomb squad purely as a hobby
back when I was finishing up art school
I just wrote it as something to play
with my friends at our little dorky
get-togethers I really enjoy creating
models so everything in the game whether
it's a character or a set is created in
real life and then brought into the game
which gives a really unique style and
for many years it just existed as a
hobby and then a few years ago I decided
to you know put it out and see what I
could do with it and now it's my
livelihood
the four player analytics I was pretty
much blind I was just guessing what my
players were doing and what was causing
them to spend and where they were
spending their time but I didn't really
know when I started using the tools it
was a very eye-opening experience I
could suddenly see the low-hanging fruit
where I could improve retention or
improve monetization in the game bomb
squad is a multiplayer game at heart but
90% of my players were going down the
single-player path so that helped me
kind of focus my efforts and add more
content and more things for them to do
when they were on that side of the game
player analytics showed me that players
were earning more than they were
spending in the game so I was able to
rebalance my economy and make a
significant positive impact in my
revenue I immediately saw 140 percent
lift in average revenue per user as well
as a 67 percent lift and average revenue
per paying user by looking at the player
progression chart I also learned that
players were having a hard time getting
past level 2 or 3 in my game it was too
hard so I went back and rebalanced it I
added an easy mode and after that I saw
a 3.6 X increase in the number of levels
the players were completing which helped
increase my retention the events viewer
is useful in a number of ways one way I
use it as a sanity check after I
released the game I can check the events
viewer to make sure people's friends per
second are still good and everything's
running well with the game another thing
I learn from the events Viewer is that
my tutorial is too long and I see most
people skip it after about 10 seconds
player analytics really helped me to
kind of open my eyes and see what I was
doing right what I was doing wrong and
sort of correct the ship to a point
where now it's it's working financially
my biggest piece of advice to developers
is put something out there see what you
did wrong look at the numbers use tools
like player analytics correct things and
try
again just be persistent and eventually
you'll get it right
