inspire other developers that creating a
global audience is possible picnic
started out purely as a photo video
editing and sharing app but today has
evolved into an interest-based community
content discovery and social commerce
platform my name is Calvin Khazana CEO
and co-founder of Nov dia the developers
of pit mix today we have more than 27
million users worldwide mainly on
Android devices 65% of our users is
international we realized that to appeal
to a global audience we needed to create
a very high quality app we decided to
take advantage of Google play's
developer tools i'm sandi : dom
co-founder at nvidia the developers of
picnics
we needed an intuitive interface and the
only way to do that is to follow the
same set of guideline that Android was
put on which is material design before
we implement the Google material design
guideline the time our users spend in
the app was like two minutes it jumped
to eight minutes now and we see a
massive increase in likes and comments
big mix main feature is photo and video
editing so it's very crucial that our
users can easily access the create new
photo and video button and then we saw a
huge increase in the numbers of photos
being created by first-time users and
this was when we really began to see
traction with our user base on a global
scale
another thing we did was to improve the
quality of our store misting on Google
Play this allowed us to test multiple
versions of our store listing and to see
which one our users liked best
so all this thing experimentally helped
us to avoid making big mistakes we
decided to change the big mix icon to
pink to coincide with the Valentine's
Day but the download rate actually
decreased by 8% so this was a very big
learning point to us and obvious choice
was to go back to the blue cart one when
I first started this company four years
ago I never imagined it can be so
successful just like today especially on
the international scale
my advice for other developers out there
use the tools key providing your product
keep innovating and make your
application success just like picnics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
