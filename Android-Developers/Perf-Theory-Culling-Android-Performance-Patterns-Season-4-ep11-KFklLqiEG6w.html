everyone should follow its avoid doing
unnecessary work I'm Joanna Smith and as
simple as that sounds it can be a
challenge to find the places where your
code spends time working on things that
don't matter let me show you an example
so that you can visualize this courtesy
of overdraw / drawers where pixels are
drawn to the screen by your application
only to be drawn over by some other
pixel or view at a later time basically
all that work you did the color in the
pixel the first time is completely
wasted work a technique to fix this is
called coaling which essentially means
removing the code or situation where you
are wasting processing time not only
will calling take you from this to this
but it will also help you get from - Wow
now as you're actually fixing your
overdraw problems you try not isolate
the portions of the screen that want to
be drawn but won't be seen by the user
and then avoid drawing them while I'm on
the topic let's talk about drawing
drawing objects takes time memory and
battery to perform and if you can
identify fuse that won't contribute to
the final scene and avoid drawing them
then you get some frame time back like
those objects that are over drawn when
they're obscured by another layer of
objects but you also want to avoid
drawing objects that are off-screen
which is a complete waste of time in
memory so for all those obscured and
off-screen objects learn to clip
generously but Cola isn't just for
drawing let's consider searching a
database for a user that meets several
criteria like maybe they live in Texas
are very bald and obsessed with
performance unimaginative developers
might start at the beginning of the
database and search every user entry for
an address in Texas for a hair color
that's not applicable and for the use of
the perfmatters hashtag in their profile
description but that would take forever
clever developers would order their
queries to reduce the set of users that
need to be searched for each successive
criteria such as isolating all the bald
people first we've just called our list
significantly then they could eliminate
every address without a state or a zip
code for Texas which leaves us with a
much reduced list of users now we only
need to run the expensive search of
their profiles for the perfmatters
hashtag on that very small number of
Records and what do you know we found
our guy colon is valuable everywhere
from drawing the UI layer to searching
databases to using real time services
like location for example if your app
alerts users based on local happenings
such as an Android developer
with barbecue then it doesn't make sense
to check for updates to events outside
the area where the user lives in all of
these instances the basic principle
remains the same check whether something
is relevant before spending time on it
because in most cases actually
processing the object is more expensive
than taking the time to determine if you
should process the object at all so take
the time to think about the user and
what matters to them and then use
calling to help you focus on those
things which gives you not one but two
wins less work to do in your app and a
better experience for your users : is a
great start but there's a whole world of
performance out there so watch the rest
of the Android performance patterns

community for tips tricks and help so
keep calm profile your code and always
remember perf matters
