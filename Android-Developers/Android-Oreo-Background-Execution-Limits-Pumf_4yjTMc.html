whether it's synching with the server
for the precious content or crunching
data for your app however running
background processes leads to a tricky
compromise for the operating system even
if 20 apps have requested very important
background work the app that the user is
actually interacting with needs to run
smoothly Android Orio introduces a
radically different way to think about
background services apps cannot run
freely in the background
this is implications for apps lodged
forbid implicit broadcast as well as app
starting services in the background
here's a quick list of affected api s
location api's are also affected but i'm
not going to be covering these now more
details on location updates are the
notes below these changes are true for
all apps targeting o but even if you
don't target o users can turn these
limitations on so you need to be aware
of these changes anyways first of the
list of background behavior changes or
services calling start service from the
background will cause an illegal state
exception now this does not affect
services started when your app is
visible and of the foreground nor does
it affect bound services here are a few
more situations where the app is
considered in the foreground when your
app moves from the foreground to the
background there's a short grace period
before your service is shut down the
service shuts down as if it had called
stop self now these changes affect
everything that is a service so our
intent service is affected well yes our
pending services affected not when
they're created but when they are sent
so yes this even affects services you
started the background that you intend
to promote to the foreground the good
news is that there are a few options for
saving your services unless your app is
an alarm clock app 90% of the time your
best option is to replace your
background service with a scheduled job
well you are no longer allowed to start
services in the background job
scheduling can do background work on
your behalf this allows the framework to
take all the scheduled jobs with their
different constraints and figure out
which jobs to run one there are a number
of different solutions for job
scheduling depending on your apps needs
i've linked to the documentation which
explains the trade-offs but if you want
my advice
I would look into using firebase job
dispatcher and the new job in temp
service job and temp service is
especially handy to replace in temp
service next is the temporary service
whitelist there are a few special cases
is listed here when the app will be
temporarily whitelisted and act for a
short period of time as if it's in the
foreground if you want to trigger work
web data on the server changes consider
implementing firebase cloud messaging on
your server and app if you use a high
priority FCM message you will receive
that message immediately even when the
system is a doze you will also get on
that handy service whitelist so you can
start a service as if the app were in
the foreground now if it's a normal
priority FCM message the message is
delivered when a user turns the device
screen on or during the DOS maintenance
window you are not white listed to start
services though so if your app perceives
both high abnormal priority messages one
approach is to try starting the service
and if for any reason that failed have a
fallbacks just such a starting a job if
the service is something the user might
interact with or once a monitor you can
make a foreground service instead
foreground services have a persistent
notification on screen which informs the
user that they're actually running
timers and navigation apps are common
examples of apps that employee
foreground services effectively the
thing is the old way of starting a
foreground service for the background
will no longer work instead switch to
the new API to start a foreground
service the steps are first use the new
start foreground service method this
creates a background service that you
must immediately promote to the
foreground within the service make a
notification your foreground service
notification should always be of low
importance or higher so that it's
actually visible to the user it should
not be of mid importance the final step
is to have the service promote itself to
the foreground using start foreground
and the notification that you just made
if you need a pending intent to start a
foreground service you can use pending
intents new get foreground service
method and then follow the same steps to
promote it to a foreground service if
none of those options work for you you
might consider deferring your work until
your app is in the foreground now if you
need to test your app under the new
restrictions I've also included links
below with the adb commands to make the
app run in the background and to force
background limitations for your app okay
let's switch to talking about implicit
broadcastreceiver limitations
broadcast receivers that are statically
defined and listening for implicit
broadcasts will not receive those
broadcasts implicit broadcasts do not
have the
carga component attributes set and
static broadcast receivers are defined
in the Android manifest
prior to Android Orio implicit
broadcasts would trigger any component
listening for them in the manifest now
in resource constrained situations this
would cause memory thrashing as a single
broadcast triggered the creation of a
bunch of different components from
different apps so here are your options
for replacing static implicit broadcast
receivers now there's a short list of
exceptions so you should absolutely
check that list first if the broadcast
is on that list it won't be affected and
it will function as normal this list
contains things such as changing locale
or plugging in headphones the full
document is linked if your broadcast is
not on the exception list you might be
able to replace it with a job jobs can
be triggered by the following conditions
some of which have been added and owe in
particular content provider observers
can trigger jobs for variety of
situations such as what the user saves
to do picture on their phone now if part
of your app is already running when the
broadcast is set you can switch to a
dynamic broadcast receiver instead this
means moving your broadcast receiver
code out of the manifest and then you
create register and unregister it during
runtime like I'm doing here even though
these situations focus on background
processes the benefits will be felt for
those using your app in the foreground
with less jank and fewer crashes this
will be even more impactful for users
who don't have access to the most
expensive or fastest hardware I've
touched on a number of strategies and
API changes if your app is affected and
you want to learn more and get started
with code examples check out the
documentation
