update to Android wear since its launch
in 2014
I'm hilum and I'm here to take you
through three highlights of Android 2.0
first material design has arrived on
Android wear the new Android interface
uses a darker color palette which makes
the watch blenny more in social
environments
it also helps save battery by OLED
displays we also suggest that developer
adopts vertical layouts and reserve
horizontal swipe for activity dismissal
in our research this makes user
interface easier to understand to help
developer implement these new design
patterns we have introduced new user
interface components such as the
wearable draw layout and wearable
recycle of view check out the material
design for Android wear site for more
details
the second highlights for Android wear
2.0 is watch face complications before
Android wear 2.0 if a watch face wanted
to display data from another app they
need a one to one agreement in both
business and technical terms to
alleviate this complexity with Android
2.0 we have introduced the complications
API complications are a traditional
watch making term for areas of the watch
face that displays information other
than the time such as the date or phases
of the Moon we have extended this
concept to smartwatches
so any app can be published data for
watch faces to consume and watch faces
can display this data in a style that
fits into their unique designs for app
developers this helps increase user
engagement and mind share for watch face
makers
this adds utility to the watch face
users can now choose whichever watch
face they want as well as getting the
data that they need
check out the watch face and
complication sections of the developer
documentation for more details last but
not least standalone functionality
previously Android wear 1.0 apps require
a phone app to communicate with the
cloud with angel wear 2.0
apps can access the internet directly
without the need for a corresponding
Android phone app installed this means
the angel where app can access the
internet even if the user has an iphone
to help with app distribution we have
also put the Google Playstore on the
watch users can now download apps
directly on their wrist apart from these
three areas of improvement material
design complications and stare long apps
there are numerous other enhancements
with Android 2.0 check out the Android
developer site for more details i'm
hilum happy coding thank you for
watching we have also got a series on
the angel wear performance check out all
these videos to find out more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
