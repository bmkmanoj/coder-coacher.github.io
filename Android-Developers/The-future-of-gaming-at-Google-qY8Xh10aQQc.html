of hands how many people in the audience
here have any kind of engineering
background all right it's quite a lot of
year one of the questions that was asked
is should I actually so show some of the
technical slides that I have here and
I'm going to show them but I'll go
really faster than probably you art so
when I thought about the future of
gaming at Google and I thought and I saw
all the things that were going on here
at play time what I realize is that you
are already seeing a lot of the future
in these other talks you're seeing the
really cool stuff that we're doing
around tooling all of the great
improvements we've made to Android
studio the addition of the NDK better
performance tools for game developers
and that's obviously to continue you're
seeing the great stuff that we're doing
with player analytics and you're seeing
all of the work that is being built on
to give you more and more data to help
you optimize your engagement so when I
was thinking about the future I want to
make sure first of all that we're
covering all the other stuff that that's
in the friends you might not know about
so here's about me I have been a
developer for years and I'm a gamer and
I like animating slides so to reiterate
here we have a billion Android devices
and I just love this picture so I'm
putting it up but more importantly most
of these devices are obviously phones
and tablets but the future of Android is
not just phones and tablets it is that
device we have sitting upstairs he had a
chance to play that it is Android TV and
the idea being here is very simple we
create one platform and one distribution
system and we allow to use the same
middleware the same storefront pretty
much all the same technology that you're
using today to build your games with a
little bit of incremental work and bring
it to a whole new ecosystem so part of
the future is saying hey let's leverage
all of this work that you're doing to
target these billion users that we're
talking about here on another platform
and of course we're building a whole big
ecosystem around here I'm you know some
of you may have seen this slide before
but there is just an amazing amount of
stuff not only do you have TVs that have
integrated we've got these great
over-the-top boxes and micro consoles
and if you haven't played with the
Nvidia box it is awesome and then we
have use these integrated service boxes
it
people's houses from SFR Giga and LG U+
in Korea so it is a really cool thing I
wanted to do a little shout out here
before I started talking about the rest
of the future
all right so basically we have a couple
of different groups at Google that are
doing neat stuff for game devs now how
many of you have actually heard of fun
propulsion labs by a show of hands all
right so it is a team at Google that is
passionate about creating cool
cross-platform game technologies and
basically here's what they do okay they
iterate they build games they release
game components tools and all that
source and then they repeat see
animations so here's how they got
started they went and they created this
really really cool library called liquid
fun now how many of you have ever heard
of liquid fun by show of hands okay
liquid fun is actually a really really
cool 2d particle simulation library and
you know they wanted it to be Pease
portable performed and practical and
what do I mean when I say that so what I
mean about portable it is basically
everywhere you know we have ported
ourselves to just about every platform
out there it is integrated into into
major game SDKs like gaming for studio
in Corona SDK it is available on Windows
in the Mac and it's performance because
we're really smart about the way we deal
with these thousands and thousands of
particles basically we look at the
diameter of the particles we put things
into really cool data structures so that
we can actually figure out okay if we're
this particle how many other places do
we actually have to do calculations for
these collisions which is what's
expensive when you build a particle
simulation and you might say all right
just based upon the diameter you'd
actually be able to look at these
particles and then we do them in order
so by the time we get to particle seven
we're actually only we're looking at
particle nine so that's how we make
things fast and it's practical and you
know what and pry practical is we built
it on top of box 2d so it just literally
slots in if you're already using box TV
and you want to add really cool particle
simulation so it can flow around all of
your existing box 2d objects you can
just integrate this librarian and boom
all of a sudden you've got water and
cool liquid effects on
top of it so this is what gives you a
whole bunch of additional options it's
gain developers and designers so I'm
gonna play a video now which is from the
firt from the game that we built we
actually built two games around this and
as you can see these particle
simulations can affect both themselves
but also they can affect the box2d
object so as our hero moves he actually
can be transported by these little
fountains of water and it's actually a
part of the whole physics simulation of
the game and again all the source code
of that is all available so that's one
thing we're doing that was our first
game the second thing was this thing
called PI noon and this is we really
started to get to get into the groove of
things so we actually started to put
together a whole bunch of technologies
that are all that also are available as
pieces that you can integrate into your
games and the first piece of this that
we integrated into the game well I'll
show you the game first that's probably
the important thing so if you haven't
seen this this is a cool PI fleeing
simulation done sort of 3d and and it
really was a chance for us to see how
these technologies actually work in a
real game of course we have Play game
services and other stuff let's continue
on to the action to talking about this
so what did we do so first of all we
wanted to make sure the game was small
make it your game small is extremely
important you know as you as you know we
now support up to 100 megabyte apks yay
but even with that you still want to
make it small because the smaller your
game is the more downloads it has and
WebP II is actually pretty cool for
making your game a very small package
online so a lot of people see this it
says web they assume it's only for the
web but actually all these libraries are
available on mobile devices as well and
we actually show you how to do it inside
of all the source code for pi noon all
right it supports lossy and lossless
compression with lossless alpha channel
support in both cases and it'll give you
a considerable size improvement over you
know things like JPEG and PNG files so
again making your game small is import
so how do we do this we started off with
Targa files which of course were
enormous we then created lossless pngs
and then we compress those the web key
inside of our tool chain so what this
actually looked like in real terms
so our target files are obviously
enormous you'd never want to ship those
unbel our PNG files were really
relatively small but when we got down to
web P that's what we're looking at so
you'd be shocked we actually did some
studies and we found you'd be you'd be
amazed how many developers are actually
shipping PNG s for all of their assets
and the truth is you might as well go
with something like this so here's
actually what it looks like you probably
can't tell based upon this projection
actually the difference in quality with
these believe it or not that is the PNG
that is the web P this is another lossy
web pain this is an onion in this one
you can just start to see there's a
little less detail if you look really
closely there's a little fringe almost
impossible to tell the difference
however we wanted to be look to look
perfect so we chose that one there
almost no distinguishing differences at
all of course this doesn't get you off
the hook from using GPU optimized
textures because they're smaller they
take less fill rate I'm not saying
everyone should use WebP II for
everything but if you're using PNG s to
ship textures already really think about
using an instead all right let's talk a
little bit about mats and the next thing
we did is we needed to create a library
for math and actually we were doing this
independent of Pi noon but pi new just
gave us an opportunity to actually take
advantage of it
a lot of you were like god we really
want a cool math library for Android and
this is awesome because it can be used
for physics or geometry and it uses
Sindhi compiler intrinsics and that's
really important because using compiler
intrinsic so we actually made it five
times as fast when running on our Nexus
devices or actually when you're running
on the desktop it's just ludicrously
fast so it's streamlined which means it
doesn't maintain that the kitchen sink
yeah and you know it's not useful for
doing things like protein folding or
something like that but it is really
good for games and we actually used it
to calculate the arc for example of our
PI's as they get thrown parabolic pi
paths it's great and it all begins with
peak so let me talk a little bit about
the next thing we built with some
called flatbuffers now when we designed
Voltaire we actually ran into a huge
problem is that it took forever to load
levels and that's partially because the
system that we're building was not
optimized for games I'm not even gonna
tell you what we used to build it but
but trust me it was amazing so we wanted
to make sure when we did our next game
that we actually didn't have this
problem so we decided to look first of
all at protocol buffers now you know
those are pretty cool but a kind of
heavyweight still for games and we
thought we could do better so we
actually developed this technology
called flatbuffers and I'm excited to
say this has actually gone a lot of play
even outside of games there was a great
post recently by Facebook where they're
actually using flatbuffers inside of
their Android application and they
talked about how great it is so what's
great about this is it's really memory
efficient the time the code base is
really small and it's super flexible so
you know a lot of you as an and don't
you don't you don't have to be
embarrassed about this but a lot of
people are actually shipping JSON to and
from their applications they're actually
storing this in the app and that's
really really bad for a lot of reasons
you know it one reason why it's bad is
for example it's really hard to optimize
because your JSON parser has no idea
that those are actually enum then it
actually has to store them as string so
that's really slow and really
heavyweight and you get things like this
number you know what does that number
what does that type mean so it's by
definition I'm pretty inefficient but
it's human readable and so people love
it so what we did for flatbuffers is
very simple we save a schema and we
generate C++ code from that and we
actually support more than just C++ by
the way but that was the original
language we supported and then we then
can take an object and turn it into a
byte array or vice versa
pretty straightforward so the best part
is no JSON except for the fact that
people still like using JSON so you can
actually build that schema with JSON if
you want to if that's not confusing so
what's great about this is now you can
take JSON use to define your schema
generate the CPP file byte array and
everyone is happy so of course this
doesn't take away all of your other game
loadings
but basically by comparison to JSON it's
like this and if you're actually looking
at network so it's like it's like four
hundred times faster than actually
parsing the JSON and if you're looking
at network stuff it's huge so once again
anything we can do to make less network
traffic to make the game smaller to make
the game load faster we know all of
these things lead to better retention
all right we also do audio I'm not gonna
get into great deal about this but
mostly this deals with sound bake
management
some very cool things which STL doesn't
normally do and that's what we're
building our stuff on top of we of
course have an animation framework all
the stuff for you to build for pie noon
we actually build performance tools so
in addition to the great performance
tools that are built into the platform
now the stuff the indicate team is
working on we have our own set here
which actually gives these great graphs
and visualizations to what's going on
and we actually build some build scripts
to do it so again this stuff was all
open sourced with a pie noon project so
the question is where do we go from
there release we want to show you how to
take advantage of the unique kinds of
multi-screen
game experiences you can make so one of
the by casually looking at Android TV we
said it turned our original fast-paced
pie throughout familiar I let them to
pitch strategy game you plan your moves
in secret on your phone then watch the
action happen on your TV screen check
out Pine noon on Google Play and give
multi-screen gameplay a try then take a
look at our source code and github to
see how you can use nearby connections
in your own games happy gaming
so one of the things that we actually
did help Android TV and it's actually
part of play games but it's only sort of
part of play games is actually something
called nearby connections and nearby
connections allows you to very very
easily use your phone as a controller it
allows you to go and find other devices
that are that are actually potential
controllers that are that are that are
near your TV and of course we
implemented this in PI noon as part of a
second experience and that's available
now as well we also have a cardboard
version of Pi noon
which is pretty cool I'm not going to
talk about that here but it's a pretty
cool codebase it shows you a whole bunch
of different ways in which you can
engage users from a fairly simple game
alright so what's the future so this is
a preview of what we're gonna be
shooting next this was shot very very
low resolution you know off of my device
just a few hours ago
and basically what you see is we've
taken the engine we built for PI noon
we've actually added full-blown 3d we
actually have skeletal animation system
built into it and again we're taking
this is a cardboard based game and it's
gonna be pretty cool I'm not gonna talk
too much about what we're doing next
here mostly because I don't want to
steal their thunder but as an initial
preview that's what's coming next so
again we're taking all these
technologies and we're extending them
till all of you build cooler stuff
here's a whole bunch of links where you
can find out about it and again
flatbuffers is really cool I really
recommend taking a look at it we
actually have a c-sharp binding for it
now we have Java bindings for it it is
it is very very cool alright I still
haven't really talked about much the
future only talked about one more thing
before I get to that how many of you
know about firebase here that's nice I
like that ok so firebase is actually
something we acquired last year and why
did we acquire it because it was used in
nest and because it was awesome you know
like it is it is it is a it is a very
very cool product that allows you to do
all of these things and it's used by a
lot of different companies to do
real-time stuff so what is it well first
of all as its name sounds it's a
database it's an it's a no SQL data
store the interface with with JSON the
restful api
and most importantly it's a real-time
database so as you make changes updates
are automatically sent to every client
that's listening and it's really really
easy to use like seriously once you
actually have set up a firebase instance
you can literally just set values into
it and start using it so it is really
often for prototyping and I actually
even even if this isn't the final back
end you want to use although for me it
is it is really really great just a
prototype stuff and the other thing that
that's cool that it does is it actually
has the both of the mobile SDKs actually
supports synchronization so if you go
through tunnel your your data still gets
sent up to firebase if you want to
actually build a full offline mode for
your game which is really cool because
it turns out that a lot of people get
really annoyed if your game only works
online so this actually allows you to do
all of that it has most of the hooks to
do that built into it of course it
sports off that's really important and
it also has a security model allows you
to say okay I've got access to this part
of firebase depending on how we off and
it's in the cloud as you'd expect from
something that we're hosting it's
production-grade
it has things like you know CDN cached
assets as well that come with it as well
as one-click rollbacks which is cool so
this is a a multiplayer version of
asteroids and I just is just running in
two different tabs on my desktop but you
can see even for this you know this this
again this is not optimized to play
asteroids I will I will I will say this
you know you know firmly it is it is not
doing stuff like using you know
potentially lossy you know it's
networking lost you networking but if
you want to play with this actually if
you just go to MMO asteroids at firebase
app comm everyone in this room can
actually play together
it supports lots and lots of
simultaneous players blowing blowing
themselves up and you can actually look
at the code and see how it was build
this was just built you know in an
afternoon with firebase and it's pretty
cool alright actually I've got more than
this I'd like to say I'd like to say we
because we haven't even gotten to the
future yet right so let's talk a little
bit about the future so this is really
really cool
when you guys have seen the cardboard
stuff upstairs but this video here was
actually done by Volvo and it was done
in partnership with Google and it really
shows what it means to have the VR
platform that has absolutely no limits
in terms of of how easy it is forgets
people so Google so Volvo was actually
able to to give anyone a cardboard unit
get them into this experience with the
xc90 right away anyway and what's great
about having an open spec like this too
is that you know we literally have
people that are building their own
cardboard units out of whatever boxes
they happen to have around and of course
we're also making a specification so for
we've actually updated our cardboard to
cardboard 2.0 which is more rugged it
has better optics especially if you've
seen the most recent ones and it also
uses the touchscreen instead of using
the magnet which was a brilliant
solution if you saw the original so it
which has better compatibility and
reduce latency of course you know about
our partnership with you master that's
all been announced to bring cardboard to
a whole new audience
so clearly VR is a big part of the
future of games at Google what we're
doing more than that because you can't
just build a spec for VR you actually
have to help build content so if you I
don't know how many of you saw this at
Google i/o but basically we partnered
with GoPro to build this rig and then
more importantly we build really really
cool software that takes that video
that's recorded by that ring and turns
it into true stereo VR video and of
course once you've built that video you
need a place to host it so of course
YouTube has built-in hosting for VR
video with YouTube 360 and finally if
you're building apps you need to have a
place to find them and it turns out that
place is Google Play so we have
marketing and promotion for cardboard
apps today so once again you know this
is something that is really already
happening but it's just getting more and
more exciting as we've seen more and
more people jumping onto the bandwagon
of VR now the next thing we're doing of
course is computer vision how many of
you got to
play with the tango demonstrations
upstairs okay and I know I know some
people might be watching this and do you
like what's going on upstairs but it's
really really cool because this is an
exploration into the future of computer
vision and what's exciting to me is that
we just recently made project tango
development kits available in Denmark
Finland France Germany Ireland Italy
Norway Sweden Switzerland and of course
here in the UK so we finally have gone
and gotten these kits out to more of the
rest of the world which is awesome
it's basically technology that gives
devices a human-scale understanding of
their surroundings so there's three
basic technology to combines one is it
mode it has motion tracking and six
degrees of freedom it has depth
perception so that it can read the
depths of its surrounding which is
important for mapping 3d spaces an area
learning so this all combines to build a
view of what of what it sees detailed
and accurate internal representation of
its surroundings I can be used for
things like indoor wayfinding and
augmented reality and also things like
room capture and measurements a lot of
people are interested in using this to
build content and so what can you do
with it well you know this is one of
those waves of innovation that may start
with games but it's gonna go way beyond
that you know you know imagine being
able to scan in your furniture and view
it in a possible new home or you know
home furnishing ads or sales that are
linked to stuff like that or being able
to quickly preview flooring tiling other
jobs while doing things like generating
estimates and Bill of Materials all
these kinds of things are possible even
beyond the gaming applications of it
which means that obviously people are
going to want to have this in their
devices okay one final thing I wanted to
mention I remember how do you tell you
how many of you've heard of project soli
okay well I'll play this video here
because this is pretty cool stuff we
actually talked about this at Google i/o
and I'm not gonna say anything more my
name is Evan probative and I work for
advanced technology and protest group at
Google
the hell is ultimate in the device it's
a silly pea-sized it's extremely fast
and it's very natural for us to use it
right
capturing the possibilities of human
hand was one of my passions how do you
take this incredible capability fine ass
of human actions of fine ass of using
our hand but applied to the virtual
world we use Radio freaks to spectrum
which is radars to track human hand
the Raiders has been used for many
different things to track cars big
objects satellites and planes we using
them to track micro motions twitches of
human hands then use it to interact with
wearables and in terms of things and
other computing devices our team is
focused on taking radar hardware and
turning it into a gesture sensor radar
is the technology which transmits a
radio wave toward the Tarpan and then
the receiver of the radar intercepts the
reflected energy from that target the
reason why we're able to interpret so
much from this one radar signal is
because of the full gesture recognition
pipeline that we've built the various
stages of this pipeline are designed to
extract specific gesture information
from this one radar signal that we
receive at a high frame rate
from these strange foreign range Doppler
signals
we're actually interpreting human intent
radar has some unique properties when
compared to cameras for example it has
very high positional accuracy which
means that you can sense the tiniest
motions we arrived at this idea of
virtual tools because we recognize that
there are certain archetypes of controls
like a volume low or a physical slider
volume slider imagine a button between
your thumb and your index finger and the
buttons not there but pressing this is a
very clear action and there's a natural
physical haptic feedback that occurs as
you perform that action the hand can
both embody that virtual tool and it can
also be you know acting on that virtual
tool at the same time so if we can
recognize that action we we have an
interesting direction for interacting
with technology so when we started this
project you know me and my team we
looked at the project idea and we
thought how are we gonna make it or not
yeah we don't know but we have to do it
because unless you do it you don't know
and what I think I'm most proud of about
our project is we push the processing
power of the electronics itself further
out to do the sensing part for us the
reader has a properties which no other
technology has it can work
so materials can embed into the objects
it allows to separate precise motions
and what is most exciting about it is
that you can shrink the entire reader
and put in a tiny chip that's what makes
this approach so promising it's
extremely reliable there is nothing to
break there's no moving parts there is
no lenses there's nothing just a piece
of sand on your board
now we're at a point where we have the
hardware we can sense these interactions
and we can put them to work we can
explore how well they work and how well
they might work in products blows your
mind usually we see things people do
that I'm really looking forward to I'm
really looking forward to releasing this
to development community I really want
them to be excited and they're motivated
to do something cool with it mine
all right so to conclude from the
evolution of advanced analytics to help
your business from you know from play
games you heard about in previous talks
to leveraging your Android investment
across phones TV VR and even wearables
so technologies that help you make
better games with native Android tooling
an open source game tech from fun
propulsion labs to power a firebase
real-time cloud and the future of
computer vision and sensor hardware so
Google's future and your future have
definitely got game and now really thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
