mobile was getting very very exciting
and that really gave us the energy to
start Hutch we are a mobile studio based
in London and a lot of people in studio
are petrol heads all they do is talk
about cars
so we're wholly focused on racing games
in the past racing games are typically
very skilled and we're trying to find
new ways to engage players of all skill
all our games come from govern stinked
so we do a lot of concept and
prototyping with the game teams but the
mission is to get that game into
player's hands as quickly as possible
Google Play beta program is incredibly
important it's part of the tools that we
use in order to allow other team to make
decisions so we can then start moving
from gut instinct into more informed
data Google Play allows you to go
through beta to your soft launch right
through to global launch constantly
getting feedback from users and this
allows us to look at real data and make
the best possible game for our players
during the soft launch period of MMX
hillclimb we were able to utilize store
listing experiments to test different
icon covers and we found the best
possible icon gave a 20% boost to click
the paste on MMX Hill Climb is a
traditional casual racing game as
fantastic social features and one of the
things we found through the a/b testing
it's the harder we made it at certain
points the better it retained using a/b
testing we were able to test vehicle
stability and track difficulty for the
start of our game in order to best
improve the user experience for new
players
in one particular example we found this
particular level took over 60 attempts
which was many more than other levels in
the game
so this allowed us to focus on making
this level less challenging for the
particular point in the game away it was
game analytics are so important because
they allow us to get out of this room
and when we're creating content for
updates we know what's been engaging the
players
it makes hillclimb has had over three
million players on Google Play we're
seeing engagement times around 48
minutes per day so it's proven to be
very addictive just super exciting
using reviews can show us problems that
might not necessarily be clear in the
analytics they can provide opportunities
for new content updates or they can
suggest that we've not explained
particular features in the game
particularly well analytics is
incredibly important to us we've been
able to improve our first-time user
experience and past games and increase
the LTV by two times each year we detain
over 10 million new players on Google
Play I've seen revenues increase in the
last four years by three times and
engagement is going up and up and up in
the long term we're really focused on
making the best place for developers to
work to make the best games we're trying
to create the studio dreams</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
