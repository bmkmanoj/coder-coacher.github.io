Greer they wanted to create an open web
platform for developers and Indies alike
they originally called it the YouTube of
games my name is Mike Gordon and I'm the
vice president of publishing here at
Kongregate we saw a lot of web
developers making the transition to
mobile and we saw a need for a partner
like congregate to get into the mobile
space
I'm Peter Ackerman's and I'm a senior
producer here at Congress some of our
early challenges when we moved to mobile
were really getting a grasp on what
players in the mobile marketplace we're
looking for we knew what we were doing
on the web to figure out what players
would like and wouldn't like but we
didn't really have those tools on mobile
so we're really struggling with figuring
out how is this going to translate
I'm Tammy levy and I'm the director of
product for mobile games here at
concrete the Google Play Developer
console provides developers with a ton
of really useful tools in a really
accessible manner we didn't necessarily
have a good way to distribute builds so
using the alpha and beta testing
frameworks within Google Play we were
able to very easily do that we can add
lists of emails groups of people Google
communities and rather than emailing out
individual apks we're able to actually
just say hey hit this website accept
tester status and go download a build
and that's all we need to do that's how
you do experiments right you don't roll
out something to everyone it's not good
how can we improve it before we just
push it on everyone else
one of our first uses of the store
listing experiment was running a head
head icon test one showed an iconic hero
from the game against a helicopter which
was one of the units inside of the
players who were shown the helicopter
icon we saw a 92% increase in downloads
of those users versus the ones who saw
the iconic hero
so we then moved on to testing
screenshots where we saw over a 14%
increase in downloads for the players
who were shown the new variant we then
moved on to the text about the game
where we indicated more about the
strategy the types of Units player saw
by testing each of these in line we saw
increases across the board
when you tally everything up we saw over
a 45 percent increase in downloads for
players hitting the new shop so it's a
very successful experiment for us we
basically started going crazy and just
applied this to every single game we
know that the results that we're getting
are actually actionable and from there
put it all together and make sure that
we're presenting the best game possible
our advice to all developers out there
would be utilize all the tools in the
developer console to make sure you setup
yourself for success there's a
tremendous amount of information that
just lives in the developer console
that's accessible by you at any moment
it's really easy to use really
straightforward and the information
there is incredibly useful to be cliche
you only get one shot at a first
impression so make sure you test
everything because you just want to be
sure that the art you love is the art
that your players are going to love and
you might not always be right
