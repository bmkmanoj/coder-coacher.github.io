passion I also learned how to program
computers and then in 2001 we start the
first video games companies for mobile
phones in Spain called micro docks in
2015
my Studios acquired by a big company
some of the guys and myself we decided
we should do something try something new
and we founded only one patent troll is
a real-time strategy game it's a
considerate as a modem always a massive
online battle arena but especially the
same it for mobile devices the game is
to the SATs thanks to the early access
product we exchanged many things from
the learnings from the community since
we launched the game on early access
without modern full million instance on
Android devices we target in the early
access program back at the very
beginning of it the difference between
relaxed program and traditional
documents is that users are actively
giving the team speed so you don't only
check the metrics you have but they also
provide possible solutions so you end up
by doing the game players want to play
the thing about not having the ratings
but do having the constructive feedback
was very clearly exposed a great
opportunity for an individual person
when sorting and perky for dynamism
when we started with the early access
program we have brought it in different
stages so the idea was at the beginning
to focus on the engagement of the game
once we sorted that out we focus on the
retention of the game and finally we
focus on monetization to do a budget
product for the market we manage with
early access to improve our retention in
a 41% the engagement by 50% and the
monetization bartenders from the very
beginning of the program team worldwide
launch the game I feel very happy
working on the video games industry
because it has been my passion since I
was a child and it's really inspiring
the true home is run with a real chance
to shape the new pair of video game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
