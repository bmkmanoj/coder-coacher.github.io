mad at Joanna wait what your toolbar
video did not even cover scrolling
gestures what's with that okay hold on I
only had two minutes and the Internet
has the attention span of dory wait wait
don't leave it's okay this is important
we'll get through this we just need to
cover the whole scrolling toolbar as an
app bar thing okay so let's go over some
scroll flags that's not just scroll
flags we have to talk about the whole
thing
fun fact the app bar is actually just
the action bar with that fancy new name
well it's not just the fancier name it's
actually the anchor for your whole app
if that were true don't you think they
would have called an anchor bar silly
name android sdk is nothing silly of
course not but anyway you can customize
your app bar if you choose to use a
toolbar instead of the standard
framework choice thanks and like I
explained in my dev byte it's really
good you should what go watch it thanks
and but it doesn't actually answer the
question where's the scrolling magic
well it's an app bar layout of course
but you're right I still haven't talked
about swirling gestures you're right
you should probably talk about it it's
kind of a big deal okay so I was just
about to so you want scrolling gestures
in your app to help you put content
first in a pretty fantastic way by
hiding the chrome of your app right okay
so when you decide to use an app bar
toolbar you'll need to three things the
first is a coordinator layout on the top
Thanks and and then you need an app bar
layout containing the toolbar Thanks and
and finally you want your main
scrollable content such as a recycler
view thanks and now if you forget to
specify the layout behavior attribute
your app is going to go all cattywampus
and overlap so don't forget it and then
finally the layout scroll Fox attribute
is the magic that I'll make it go take
any Wampus is that really a word yes
well if it wasn't a word I would not
have said it I believe her some of these
scroll flags actually do for your app
well so if values like scroll indicate
that the whole thing will scroll off the
screen enter always indicates that it'll
return as soon as you scroll back Wow
a quick return pattern it's actually
very common
precisely so hopefully that helped clear
up some of them Thanks scrolling magic
for all of you eager developers thanks
again and so go out there and build
better apps already stop build better
apps
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
