and I traveled around the world and it
was during our travels that we came up
with the idea for hooked this is the
bench in Costa Rica where I love to
write and think of new ideas hooked is
an app that tells short stories in the
form of chat conversations I love
writing I grew up reading a beautiful
literature in Arabic and I really wanted
to share that experience for the
children and the only way to reach them
is to speak their language I decided to
create my cuca world after years of
dreaming about it
Micucci world is an interactive app
offering stories songs and games all in
Arabic coin symbolizes perseverance
hardship and attaining the highest goal
that you can have
thank ye shows the journey of a koi from
a baby boy to Dragon which boy I playing
with
my mother and my aunt taught me that no
matter what challenges you face
you learn how to fall so you will just
stand up again keep trying
I think that's influenced the way I work
the beginnings were not easy because
it's a completely new medium for me but
they were worth it I did not have any
investment that meant that I needed to
put my time my own money and have a very
small team we started we didn't have
experience in the industry we are people
from film and animation and comic books
we have really different backgrounds we
learned a lot working for others but
what we really wanted was to make our
own game still around stories and it was
difficult to get support ratings and COI
was hot journey for us and we decided to
go ahead with it even though
we didn't have much money to complete it
the launch of hooked was definitely
scary I had a lot of doubts you know my
biggest doubt was am I just a one-hit
wonder after all these years of
struggling and learning it was amazing
when we finally got to work in our own
game realms of the void the turn-based
strategy came with the first 20k
installs we were really believed 10
happy that it finally came through and
that player playing our game right now
st. croix has a total of 9 million
installs we kept going and after a year
of iteration and testing we translated
the app in seven different languages and
launched all over the world and hooked
was the number one app in over 25
countries we've had over 13.5 million
installs on Android what gets me out of
bed every morning is knowing that I'm
going to go and create something that I
wish to create my entire life
zanko was made possible with a little
luck lots of perseverance and support
from family and friends
it's a very important message to pass on
to my daughters that they can do
whatever they want to do as their
parents I have responsibility to show
them that I'm achieving my own dream so
that they know they can achieve their
I'm very lucky to have found our team no
matter what the future bring us we'll
just keep working hard and keep doing
what we love when you're building a
product that you love and that you want
to see out into the world it really
keeps you going this is the way that you
want to have an impact in the world
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
