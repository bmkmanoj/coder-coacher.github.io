development manager for the UK and
Nordics and now I've been involved in
mobile content since 2001 and I can tell
you I am so excited about how well it's
the industry it's growing and I think it
just makes me really happy to see the
rich potential that we're building for
partners like yourself in the Android
ecosystem so I think you know we've
heard a lot today about monetization and
in improvement monetization is not just
about pricing obviously I think we've
heard today some great tips from people
like Ellie and Michael about quality
being the cornerstone of success you
know things like design using the
platform tools like beta testing and
staged rollouts and if any of you
attended Mateos session on engagement
techniques it was absolutely fantastic
so things around understanding your
users to drive engagement retention and
understand lifetime value so let's see
is that so let's look at the the growing
opportunity now I know that we we
touched on this earlier in the day so in
marks welcome speech he gave you an idea
of the really the growth for the Android
and I guess you know what I'm trying to
get across here is there is a massive
capacity to earn and they're
increasingly more ways for people to pay
I know we touched on this earlier but
local forms of payment like direct
carrier billing gift cards and PayPal
are opening up new audiences for you to
target and you know I've actually seen
with my own eyes when we launch a new
form of payment in yes New Zealand we
actually got new users and incremental
sales so we're actually opening up new
audiences for you to sell to in New
Zealand they buy contents so we've seen
great success two dates we've actually
just a couple of key pointers you know
we've unlocked the domestic market of
Germany when we launched a new local
payment we saw a 70 percent growth in
your nearby growth and one thing I'd
like to call out as well is just to show
you that the capacity of
of place and money we had 38% here near
growth from primarily international
sales so give me this increasingly
global market how should you price your
quality application no I said quality
because you've heard everything today
and I know you're going to go out and
implement it so the global market is
ready for your products your application
is built you've improved the design
you're using all the platform features
pricing filip globalization is very
important and my esteemed colleague
Yoshi who's getting miked up somewhere
and is talking up to me about go global
so he'll tell you more information about
other factors on that but I'd like to
start with a few key points on setting
and managing your prices now you may say
to me our attempts in that's common
sense and some of it is common sense but
you'd be surprised how few developers
actually implemented so I'm going to
call them out today really quickly and
you can tell me to sit down if it's
boring and these will include matching
the model to the market taking into
consideration purchasing power parity
which is how much consumers can afford
local price preferences is purnama
mentioned with the 99 cents not going
well in Japan audience segmentation and
just checking in on your pricing
strategy regulus so to kick things off
matching the model to the market so we
know that there are multiple ways to to
build customers at Google Play free
freemium premium subscriptions etc so
it's really important to make sure that
you you carve out a pricing model that's
going to meet the cultural and an
economic you know factors within that
country so if you are targeting a
country that has very high prepaid
penetration and perhaps very low credit
card penetration you might want to
consider more transactional type of
payment models like in-app billing or
premium to take into account perhaps the
the less regular cadence of top ups they
might have on their phone and of course
the model should support the value
proposition of your content for example
if you have a subscription offering make
sure that the content or the
functionality is refreshed regularly or
that the user has a reason to go back
into it daily to get value out of it
and hands up here who has who heard
about our minimum price reduction in
India
excellent and who actually did lower
their price and go into India fantastic
if I had a fruit basket I'll give you
one so and what we did recently is we
lowered the minimum price that you could
charge at on the Google Play Store in
India from 50 rupees to 10 rupees now I
guess to put it in context a can of coke
in India cost about 10 rupees but it
cost a dollar in the US so okay that's
fine that's fine but we know that a
dollar so we know that actually one
dollar u.s. equals sixty six rupees if
you take like yesterday's exchange rate
so then hang on a sec so they're
charging ten rupees Minister in India
but sixty-six rupees in the u.s. so what
we're seeing here is a clear example of
coca-cola basically pricing to what the
market can afford purchasing power
parity so that's kind of what we were
trying to get at is we know there's a
market exchange rate but there's always
a soft consumer price that kind of will
get you more conversions so some results
after the after we launched the minimum
price was that after four weeks we had
five hundred and sixty titles across two
hundred and twenty developers I changed
the prices for India so you're one of
two hundred and twenty six and as a
result we've seen an eight hundred
percent increase in revenue I mean
that's outstanding and the great thing
that we like to point out is you based
in India or the UK or in me UK so you're
one of the seventy five percent of those
two hundred and twenty developers who
actually change their prices for the
Indian market so it's it's a very
international market we're happy to see
and one call-out I'd like to make is
Nova so Nova do a browser launcher and
they originally were priced at 499 USD
which equated to about 325 rupees a
slight thirty two cans of coke so they
took advantage of this offer and they
changed their price to I believe two
fifteen rupees and you can see the
impact there I 136 encrypt percent
increase in orders and 27 percent in
in revenue so again a very happy
developer oh and it's live so you can
still you know if you haven't done it
yet and you still want to target India
you should get in there and we know that
many of our top partners are doing their
own testing on prices across the world
one amazing learning application did
some ABCD tests in the US and Russia
recently and they found that for the USA
they tested four different price points
and the optimal one was 23% lower than
their original and that generated them
ninety five percent increase in
conversion and fifty two percent percent
increase in conversion in our proof
similarly for the their Russian tests it
was a 12% drop you can see the stats
there so I guess the caveat here is
don't take these price drops is what you
should do because your content is unique
and your markets will be the ones you
choose but if you can find a way to test
two different prices across your markets
we recommend this is a way to find the
optimal price to help you increase
conversion and gain incremental revenue
now again we touched on this earlier but
so you know I'm from Australia he's
probably not New Zealand and one thing
that really annoyed me is that going to
the Play Store and I've you know going
for an app and then finally app
fantastic and it would say oh you'll be
charged $1 16 or 3.74 right well I kind
of feel like the developer doesn't care
about me so and we we know from what we
discussed before that in Japan they
prefer whole figures like 700 yen not
701 yen so in the developer console we
actually enable you to customize the
prices of your in-app SKUs or premium
prices or subscriptions by country and
the great thing about that is you do it
once and then we will on our side
convert that to the local currency so
that when users see an optimized price
and a value offering that works for them
they're more likely to if they like the
content to make the purchase
and who here attended Mateos talk about
engagement excellent okay well so this
may seem familiar terra-tory but i just
want to touch on it again because it's
so important so we know that users are
not homogeneous it's best practice to
know who your customers are what their
behaviors are like and what they'll pay
if you can do this you can carve out
different strategies to help them along
the purchase journey potato talked a lot
about Google Analytics but but any
analytics are important and really if
you can find a way to differentiate your
segments to then identify who's who are
the spenders and who are the non
spenders in hearing they engaged and who
are not engaged and then present them
different offers we've seen good success
so wish for example use the system and
for those of you who went in with tails
feet which basically created different
product offers so cheaper offers for
less engaged users and more expensive
product offers for the more engaged and
saw a 10% increase in conversion anyone
anyone sell to Russia here a few so
you'll probably be familiar with this
this graph but essentially one of the
last best practice pricing initiatives
is really to check in on your pricing
regularly for example if a developers
set their price in 2001 in february 2014
february and didn't change it for a year
they would have seen their gross revenue
from russia
nearly half because of the Forex changes
so we recommend going and checking your
your pricing regularly so you are you
can see where you are versus your
competitors and versus exchange rate
fluctuations so we've just touched on
all the best practices and i'm running
slightly late so i'm going to continue
on that the running theme here is that
not all users are the same they've got
different price sensitivities and
different needs so how can you deal with
this when you're talking about a global
market so I'm going to touch now an
AdMob and then give you a bit of an
update on what we're doing with
subscriptions come on okay so and
anyone here use AdMob and I won't be
upset if you don't great excellent
so AdMob for those of you who don't use
it is our industry-leading ads and
mediation platform it's earned over
650,000 developers over 1 billion
dollars in the last two years and as you
can see here the growth statistics are
very very impressive and it tells us a
bit about AdMob of course but it really
tells us something about the ecosystem
and what it says is that advertising is
a very important part of that
monetization and it's growing each year
in fact Gartner projected and says
Gartner but by 2017
they'll be nearly 270 billion app
downloads and majority of these they
think will be free in premium or
freemium and with the growth in free and
freemium of course is the growth in
mobile advertising so we talked about
consumers differing between markets
because of disposable income and
cultural differences but we we believe
you shouldn't be forced to choose
between only monetizing through in-app
advertising or through through ads but
today you haven't really what we haven't
really given developers the option until
now so AdMob actually is trying to help
you find the right monetization model it
feeds in the opportunities process
information looks at your ads your app
your users your advertisers and it will
deliver the right experience to them so
what this means in a nutshell is that
you can create you can have it set up in
your apps so that either users which we
identify being as high spenders will see
an in-app purchase ad for your product
and those who we identify as being low
spenders will simply see you know an
AdMob ad or one of your third-party ads
in this way we try and help you monetize
all users not just the high spenders and
not just those who are not going to
spend
so this is another example of a tool
called audience builder with an ad month
it allows you then to go in and I guess
fiddle and create deeper segmentation if
your audience is to give them different
offers and one example here is that you
know if you do have very high paying
users you might not want to show them
ads at all and the AdMob platform allows
you to do this
so in-app purchasing and ads two great
ways to make money but there's a third
one who here likes recurring revenue
excellent so let me tell you a bit about
subscriptions another question for the
team who has an implicit Netflix account
fantastic who's got a mobile plan so you
can see here the subscriptions are a
tried and tested model that people are
quite used to and they like from a
user's perspective it's great because
then there's no bill shock once you've
signed up you can expect to get free
access to the content ongoing
furthermore it builds trust in the brand
for developers recurring revenue gives
you greater certainty around your cash
flow and helps you you know forecast
your investment in Android and did you
know that subscriptions are actually the
fastest growing business model on Play
you see the statistic here we have two
and a half times growth in subscriptions
between 2013 and 2014 and we think this
is due to a couple of factors the first
factor is that people are becoming more
used to pain and the second factor is
that leading developers like yourself
improving the quality of the
applications that you put on the Play
Store so a big thanks to you a couple of
case studies I'll call out because I
know I'm over time is that busuu one of
our good partners actually has invested
so much in their Android application
over the last year and their focus has
really been about improving the
onboarding flow of users to sign up to
subscriptions and what they've done is
they've they've overhauled their design
so that users get they can really see
the value that they're getting for
signing up so there's a large portion of
free and then it's a graduated you know
call to action New York Times I have to
say this it's fantastic but they were
out using a paywall
and moved across to Google Play billing
and they actually reduce their signup
flow from
three two minutes two three seconds and
this is this speed of sign up has been
due to the fact that all the customers
signing up already had a payment you
know form of payment on the Play Store
and that resulted in one hundred and
twenty five percent increase in
subscription conversion so there's heaps
of functionality to build a successful
subscription business there's grace
periods to help people who may be you
know run out of you know there might be
a prepaid top-up and their DCP direct
carrier billing doesn't work or it might
be someone who simply has not paid the
credit card bill so with grace periods
you can give them a chance to fix their
form of payment without cancelling their
subscription which works for the user
and also works for you because you've
got less churn goodwill credits are
really great for rewarding people who've
done a good customers giving you good
feedback and upgrades and downgrades
that one way to again ease people up the
purchase or up you journey and of course
this is the one slide I was really keen
to share with you today but I'm really
really really pleased to announce that
as of tomorrow will be launching
quarterly and six monthly subscription
periods
so and you can use these to do many many
different things I mean the first one is
you know it's like illogical pricing so
you know you can look at the way that
you price your your your packages and
make it more attractive for someone to
sign up to a six monthly versus a
quarterly and again what we hope to do
is in this way give you more flexibility
on your monetization options so thank
you very much I'm sorry I went over but
I just want to touch on their wrap-up
which is number one Google Play is a
growing market and I think we've touched
on that many times today pricing is one
lever for monetization but quality is
one of the I guess the the key elements
to consider and you can achieve success
by following some best practices and and
please consider the subscription models
that you can now use thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
