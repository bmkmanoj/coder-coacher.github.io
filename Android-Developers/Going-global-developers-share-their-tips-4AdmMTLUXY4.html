the give me the your show interaction
the what you doing what are you the
business doing and then what is your
goal global strategy from probably more
yeah more from jelly button-- games and
one of the co-founders and seal our main
business is casual free-to-play games
our first hit is Pirate King which is
currently has around 50 millions of
downloads good today and we still going
global it is more or less you want to
talk what do you want to talk oh how
about the google voice app is your time
to go go go or we should talk later yeah
perfect let's talk later okay messing
everybody my name is Massimo everybody
called me mags easier oh baby yeah I
didn't I must much easier and i'm the
co-founder and CEO of music's match
music Smith is the world largest
database of lyrics I'm not a singer
unfortunately and we have so far more
than 50 million downloads everywhere and
thanks for inviting me all right thank
you i'm just i'm andras i'm CEO and
co-founder of social point we are a
gaming company based in barcelona so we
are morse known because of dragon city
and monster legends and to give you some
numbers dragon city has been downloaded
more than 150 million times so and we
are quite global mhm yo que tu hello
this my custom I know is they okay
right okay one two let's go home to
one's for by two
no hello I'm Gil I need design at City
mapper it's a transport app specifically
built for the city so we take all the
crazy data that's out there try to make
sense for it and build and design a
product around it basically for you to
get to find out how to get from A to B
we're currently live in 30 cities 10
countries yeah hello my name is Regina I
lead a google play BD for Latin America
especially Brazilian Mexico and it's a
pleasure to be here all right so let's
get started discussions but i like to
make more like interactive by the
session here so i was through there one
questions to you guys then making them
more interactions then then ask the
audience to you have if you have any
questions then please jump in alright so
the first of all i would like to ask
about their what is your global strategy
actually then what is your challenge and
a global like Marquette if you want to
if you go go into there then what's your
challenge what was your challenges okay
um Gil I mean basically as you can
probably imagine we're very like
localization is is the key the key thing
we have to figure out our strategy has
always been to to localize the product
very heavily so whenever we launched a
city we hand design all the transport
icons we travel a lot the cities we have
people taken care of specifically one
city so so also culturally it's been
it's been always the humor the kind of
tone of the of the app also when we
localized strings it's very important to
to really understand the local tone and
kind of we partly solve that by a higher
people that speak the language and come
from these regions so it's kind of an
in-house sort of that's that's when it
gets the most natural when adium check
and I native a check and there your
company yeah okay I go cool go ahead for
us localization it's it's everything
because you know when we talk about
music and lyrics we're talking about a
huge space to provide you some numbers
the number of unique you know trucks you
know music truck in the ward you need so
that they are unique in any just once in
a Hubble it's around for millions out of
that like you know sixty percent of them
are you know mainly English track but
then this is a huge long tail with
Spanish Chinese Japanese Indian
Portuguese Italian German French and
whatever so we have actually in our you
know database we do cover we have to
cover so for us to localize it the
localization is a kind of must I mean we
do cover more than 80 different
languages in terms of content so the
challenge for us is musics match is a
crowdsourcing platform so I mean the
more we grow in a country the more you
mentioned Japan before Japan it's been
incredibly important for us because the
more we were growing that the more the
Japanese user were adding the content so
we give the power to the users to add an
localize the code without that deep so
what I want to share is that if you run
a cut an app I mean the content inside
Europe whatever you do from lyrics
whatever your content must be localized
must be offered which it doesn't mean as
you said just translator ah you have the
he show of offering your local
brazilian typically they don't they like
the certain kind of you know music
different from German people and like
you know an us different from from
Japanese people so for us the
it's really a mast to get the local calm
then plus ensuring the local right
because we pay right soldier in every
single place of the of the word you know
but you know I must say that it's kind
of key challenge and strategy for us
without that we couldn't really i mean i
mean be present in any country you know
like four hours being in Japan without
having japanese you know lyrics it's
kind of further faster you publish their
application then you don't know cause to
Japanese right I mean in general we
don't mean an application install a
listing I mean we generalize it
immediately application also you know
back to applique to out localize the
application you know our our you know
goal is we empower the user to translate
it okay yeah their contents yeah the
Conte and also the app itself I mean
when they complain they said can you
help us so that's been extremely
important to you know beside using you
know the absa you know translate sure to
the new offer about we let them adding
local content you know I think that's
very important to empower your user and
get suggestion from your user and then
you know we try to listen to any of them
I mean by analyzing data I think all of
you guys mentioned a lot of things you
can do with Google analytic I think
that's a key resource for us you know
you can I mean analyzing continuously
data you know from any single punch okay
I'm cells here haha I i would like to
move on we have the games hi yeah we
have a share a little bit different
aspect upton we aren't having i have
some have questions for the game tight
alright i had our I had a talk about the
culture wise or you know they go into
market was characterized or just
localizations then I'd like to ask the
more under us about how do you think
about you like to go with original apk
and localized language or
a separate APK to that market so first
of all I think that everybody I think
that everybody wants to go global it's
all about yeah the efforts focus and of
course market market potential and cost
cpi's are getting extremely high so as
an early developer you have to be really
focused and you really have to put a lot
of tension in that so I would say as
when we started pirate came for us it
was we had to think like a strategy wise
how to reduce the barrier localization
because it was a very early stage
company in game developer and we cannot
afford a lot of money and a lot of
marketing of course expenses in to go
into going so save the budget first have
to if you were an early developer so
what we really believe is like focus on
the product and as as much as you can
and make the Cygnus and a beautiful
experience from the product size so I
would recommend for like everybody would
want to see it was a beautiful lecture
of George fan which is the creator of
plants vs zombies it's a little bit 2010
but it's a beautiful lecture about how
he convinced his mom to play plants vs
zombies and we really inspired across by
pop cup and a lot of beautiful a process
they made them and there he speak about
a lot of how to make this process of
first engagement in localization and he
has many tricks and very beautiful
things and even not to use more than
eight words pop ups and we understood
the peak we're in early-stage developer
we have to use as much as quick as we
can without really inspired from this
process so in pirate we embedded those
processes later on of course we built
this strategy with the Google Play team
and of course with our marketing team
and gradually we started in back we're
located in Tel Aviv Israel so we started
in Israel and then we started to grow in
Singapore and Malaysia and Thailand and
all around Southeast Asia without
localizing or culture people told us you
cannot get into Thailand without
localizing or cultural and we said we
believe that the product is everything
and we believe that we
can bring this experience to our users
so in our tipping point like in our top
it was 450 thousands of installs a day
only from Southeast Asia and seventy
percent of that was google and you know
lies there like that is no nothing we
only lost establishing in a English yes
and we have a little bit localize the
stores we use a lot of content community
strategy we worked really close of
course with the plating very focused on
that strategy and then combining it both
it was very very strong so as an early
developer return it's really important
to be very focused on what you can do
comparing to the market to the effort
and then you can combine it to a
beautiful strategy and now that we're
launching going global now that we can
afford being going global you really
have to again focus on the emerging
markets and of course we're aiming to
latin america and the u.s. and of course
europe so for us this journey was very
strong oh how i I'm just for us we we
always launch the games globally so we
we check the boxes of all the countries
around the world gasps and then we
launch always with one single epic I
because it's easier for us to manage it
and then depending on the results that
we see on the KPIs with engines
monetization all the KPIs it when we
start to doing special focus on some
market so apart from the core mechanics
from the game we change many many other
things we change the Play Store dart we
change the title of the game we market
so we do a special marketing actions for
each market quite different from one to
another we'll obviously we we translate
with local partners we change the icon
so we have different price points for
for some markets and also we do some
live verbs or some authors that are
different from one market to another you
have the office outside of the
Battlement what you have the office
outside of the box elder
we we are opening an office in Tokyo so
it's not okay we don't have anyone
physically there okay but we have so so
point Tokyo company that we are we are
willing to grow them okay so we have
only five minutes so do we have any
question between the panelist haha if we
don't have then let's move on to ask the
audience if you have any questions in
each other no no okay let's move on to
you ask the audience any questions to
the panelists or or you can ask any
questions okay question for you guys
with changing icons globally like good
for localized markets do you guys ever
worry about keeping a consistent brand
for your for your developer company this
is something you guys have dealt with
you mean changing the bread yeah you
keep if you change the icon it could
obviously change the perception of the
brand it's not tied to your brand we
like specifically for that reason we
didn't touch the icon because it is it
is part of the brand and what we use a
be testing a lot for is is the
screenshots and so we do a lot of a/b
testing on that but the icon I think at
least in our case maybe four games it's
a bit different but for for being a
utility app I think the icon is is too
much part of the brand yeah but I do i
do wish i could kind of because I would
be curious if there were there were
strong effects if we change the icon in
my case I remind 11 you know example
that really you know scared me we got a
lot of we use screenshot with you know
of the app which you know
Colts you know the album's heart so in
that case we had a minute Katy Perry
images obviously all these things we pay
the ride more and she was in a bikini
and but she was it was not offending
feature we got tons of compliance you
know by you know I remind Arabian you
know users and this was not anything we
even planned that you know and neither
you know how could you plan you know how
could you think you can really offending
people so at that point we starting
doing av-test with all the screenshot
and we so I mean these going much better
I think it's like you know when you go
in your company in a country you don't
know there might be something then in
terms culturally different and this
depends you know I mean country by
country you know so you have to deep you
know understand you know but you should
ask your users you know I mean since
you're growing so fast i would ever
always ask users you know get feedback
from them and you know every testing a
be testing another things very useful i
think you know which we should all be
thankful to google it the beta testing I
mean I I say we have like fifteen
thousand better day I say we have 15,000
employee for free people testing your
heart immediately since you release and
providing you feed but it's kind of
amazing but not all hubs are using this
for us we have changed the day iconic I
mean for example monster legends we have
changed the icon between for Japan we
had one specific item or for Europe or
the u.s. we have other icons and also we
have changed the icon inside the same
region so for example now we launched at
a new version of the game that we have
ally answers and we change the icon from
the previous one to a new one but when
we do this kind of changes we we are
worried about the brown and is a good
point so we try to maintain the essence
of the icon keeping the decor of the
icon and adding a loop saying to the
users a there is something new on the
or you know so we we take Carol of the
ground making changes on the icon but
carefully one question here all right
thanks I'm Alexis from Republic labs a
question may be more for more and
undress d price localization part how
important is it the price cyclization I
mean for example I'm thinking of a
country like Latin America where maybe
certain games have a hard time
monetizing do you see a really important
effect on not just on revenues would
also maybe on retention and as part of
that if you have a multiplayer game
which is your case do you see maybe
players kind of nicotine complaining hey
I'm paying this in the US and you're
paying that and how risky is that we
have not seen that users complaining
from one region to another so what we
normally do we I mean for example latum
its twenty percent of our tau and it's
four percent of our revenues know if you
if you check the payments that the type
of payments that they have their it's
totally different to what we have a new
rub or what what we have in the u.s. so
we have done changes on pricing we have
seen improvement from ten to twenty five
percent in some regions and some markets
so it's I would say it's it's important
without the prices I wouldn't do it at
the beginning I would launch the game
see which is the dark pool there will be
you that you are seen and then do
improvements to try to boost revenues by
ten fifteen twenty percent descanses
just to add here I think we've been
actually doing some pricing experiments
in the region and definitely this is
something new in the emerging market i'm
not talking only for brazil and what in
America but all the emerging markets
google actually is investing quite a lot
we are putting not only the technology
there but really people there we are
spending consumer market we are
really educating these users to buy
digital goods we are not in Japan that
people are used to buy digital goods or
us or UK these people are just learning
how to choose a smart phones and engage
with digital goods or games or apps so
we need actually to educate that we just
launched local forms of payments in in
Brazil and Mexico for instance so until
last year we didn't have only
international credit cards were
accepting this store so this is
something that it's a big afford that
we've been doing not only in Latin
America but all the emerging markets and
we're going to be pushing that in
educating the users but I definitely
believe changing prices specifically for
some markets are important it's very
hard for you because there are a lot of
markets know so I would recommend maybe
prioritize okay what is my maybe twenty
percent of the installments are coming
for that market is that up is there a
market there that I have to explore and
if ya if yes try to find out what is the
right pricing point or what what are
using actual what is the user behavior
at that markets really build your
strategy but this is something that
we're going to be investing quite a lot
in the next month and ten years and and
if you think that most of these emerging
markets like eighty percent is Android
it's a big thing so this is where we are
really working to make sure that users
understand that they can consume in a
store and I think that's our approach
all right all so far apart from rising
and because some more time or another we
need to finish them you know if you have
any comment then you can know I know
Alexis life I can get with him and
excellent hear us ask him that later so
all right so thank you thank you for
joining us then then okay let's finish
the goal global sessions but if you have
any questions and please reach out reach
out reach out ask then ask your
questions all right thank you and then
thank you and then give the the big
applause to the punters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
