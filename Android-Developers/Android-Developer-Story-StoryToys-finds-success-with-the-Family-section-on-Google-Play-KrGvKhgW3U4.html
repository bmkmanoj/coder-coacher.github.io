children's app content we make
everything from original IP to classic
fairytale books right the way through to
licensed content what we do is we
combine a reading experience with
interactive scenes it's a nice
combination of an educational reading
experience with slightly gamified
interactive experience so they don't so
much interrupt the reading experience as
draw the child in make them feel part of
the narrative one of the biggest
challenges of working in the children's
app space is that you have two audiences
first you have the children but you also
have to sell the app we have to try and
create an experience that's both
appealing but also to the parent
represents good value has sound
educational values effectively something
that the parent can feel good about
letting their child interact with since
the launch of the family section on
Google Play - our experience with
Android has been completely transformed
we saw huge uplift in revenues and a
downloads to Google Play Earth is now
our number one channel it's been nothing
but positive for story choice and we're
delighted to be involved the family
section on the Google Play Store has
really provided a safe trusted creative
space for families to find new content
Android is fantastic for rapid iteration
and prototyping absolutely hands-down
the best you can beat a test on the
store I think we've got fantastic
opportunities to do that with much wider
audience too
the Playstore delivers global reach as a
distribution channel it is unrivaled
Google Play allows you to customize
pricing per market that's an extremely
powerful tool you can then use the
translation services on Google Play and
extremely efficient way to get all the
content in your app translated quickly
Google Play has allowed my very hungry
category to reach some pretty staggering
numbers we found that kids playing with
the app in general have engaged with
this between 80 and 120 minutes we found
that kids cumulative lis have made more
than a million butterflies and they've
fed The Very Hungry Caterpillar more
than a quarter of billion pieces of
fruit with Indiana we're really excited
about the next few years for storage
owns and particularly focusing on
education and the opportunities that lie
there
