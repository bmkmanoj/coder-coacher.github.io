own music collection to that same cloud

millions of ebooks available on Android
Market a great selection of titles for
new releases to old classics also a
terrific reading experience so any book
that you buy in android market is
available to read on your tablet on your
phone on the web if you know you're
going to be in an offline situation a
disconnected situation like taking a
flight you can bring that content down
to your device and cash it locally
google music is a complete end-to-end
music experience that includes the
ability to buy music in android market
and then a very unique feature that
allows you to share the songs that you
bought or the albums you bought two
friends on Google+ who will each receive
a full play of that song or album for
free
