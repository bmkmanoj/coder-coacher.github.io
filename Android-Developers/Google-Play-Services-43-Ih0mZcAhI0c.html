will show you all the new exciting stuff
in Google Play services 4.3 if you're
new to Google Play services you have
come to the right place because Google
Play services rocks for you as a
developer this is great news because you
can get your hands on all the latest
blazing hot stuff we develop here at
Google and incorporate into your apps
let's look at the highlights of this
version first of all we'll show you a
brand new address API then we'll go
through some exciting new features of
the Google Play game services we'll also
cover the Google Analytics and Google
tag manager API which are also brand new
to the Google Play services family and
we'll round it off this time by showing
you new stuff in the Google Drive
Android API let's get started
ladies and gentlemen
that's right we got a new API let's
welcome the address API with a round of
applause get back to work
yes sir how many of you have tried to
buy something on the internet from your
smartphone and then come to the part
where you need to fill out the delivery
address ah nightmare experience big
fingers on small keys but of course if
you want to ship to your current
location then you can use the location
API to fill out the address which makes
things easier but what if you're at work
and want to ship it to your home that's
exactly when the address API comes to
the rescue with the address API your app
can present a user interface which
displays all addresses registered by the
user the user can then select an address
such as John Smith in the example on the
picture and voila the address will be
made available to the awesome bike store
app to complete the purchase there is no
more messing around with thumbs on small
keys isn't that great shopping on your
smartphone just became a walk in the
park
thanks to Google Play services now over
to Google Play game services mobile
gaming is bigger than ever and we're
continuing to pack new features into
this API with this release we've
introduced game gifts which allows
player to send virtual in-game requests
to anyone in their Google+ circles or
through player search a player can now
send a wish request to ask another
player for an in-game benefit or item
and another player can send a gift
request to give an item or benefit or
something making both players happy in
the end
this feature complements the multiplayer
functionality released earlier and will
enhance the social engagement between
players and your games an example of
using gifts is to request more lives
from your friend in case the last round
of playing did not go so well this
little video used to liquidfun physics
engine you should so much check it out
so great stuff from the Google Play
services be sure to use them all in
Jorgy
let's now move over to the Google
Analytics and Google tag manager api's
and ladies and gentlemen that's right
these are all new api's let's welcome to
Google Analytics in Google tag manager
API with a round of applause get back to
work
yes sir so these api's have actually
existed as standalone api's but have now
been fully integrated into the Google
Play services API family this is great
since this reduces the fat memory
footprint of your app and these api has
become accessible side-by-side with all
the other ones ready for you to use to
create that shiny app so let's look at
what these api is contained we'll start
off with the Google tag manager which
lets you use tags in your apps instead
of hard-coding values these tags are
then substituted for values that you
have stored in the tag manager at
runtime this can for example be used to
manage background colors of your app
game settings and localization settings
since the values of the tags are stored
in the tag manager this eliminates the
need to push your entire app from Google
Play again you can simply change the
value of the tag in the Google tag
manager that brings us over to the
Google Analytics API and if you haven't
used Google Analytics before I strongly
encourage you to take it for a test ride
Google Analytics allows you to get
detailed statistics on how your app is
being used by your users for example
what functionality of your app is being
used the most or which activity triggers
the users to convert from an
advertisements app to a paid one so that
stuff can be pretty pretty good to know
to get your users happy but also to get
your next month's paycheck so be sure to
check the Google Analytics API out
because it can really provide lots of
valuable information to you which brings
us to the Google Drive Android API as
you may know the Google Drive Android
API will sufficiently released in the
last version of Google Play services and
it's off to a flying start with a number
of API enhancements first off is pinning
you can now pin files that should be
kept up-to-date locally this is yours
that the app can work with these files
even when the user is offline then we
have app folders which allows your app
to create files which are no longer
visible to the user for example to store
temporary files in a photo editor this
is the same function as the application
data folder in the Google Drive API that
have existed for a while with this
version we also have changed
certifications which makes it possible
to register a callback and receive a
notification when the file or folder is
changed this means that you no longer
need to query drive continuously
to check if the data has changed just
put a change notification on it and the
API will call you when it happens and
then we've also made a number of
enhancements to metadata information
which is something you can never get
enough of well to satisfy that craving
you may have a metadata you should be
happy to hear that we've added a bunch
of new fields in this version so that's
it for this release of Google Play
services but stay tuned because we've
got lots more coming up now it's your
turn so go out there and create great
apps and don't forget to tell us all
about it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
