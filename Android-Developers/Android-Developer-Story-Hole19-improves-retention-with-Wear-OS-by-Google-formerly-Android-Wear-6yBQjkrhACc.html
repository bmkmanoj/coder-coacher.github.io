19 hole 19 is building the largest the
most engaged network of golfers we're
connecting the world of golf we want to
be part of the golfers journey before
during and after the
Golf has always been a passion of mine
the idea came about 2007 when I was
working with a golf coach so was a
platform to track my stats and connect
to the golf coach to help me improve
starting a company in that space is a
great way to blend my passion with
business we built the product in
Portugal we were in Lisbon we found a
design team that could help us build it
four and a half five years later we
moved close to million users the moment
we found out about Android wear it was
clear to us that we had to be there from
day one in the golf industry already
technology actually pulling out your
phone is often frowned upon and we just
felt that a smart watch on your wrist
just made sense combining hardware and
software we felt that Android wear which
is the perfect solution for us since the
launch of where we have seen a lot of
positive feedback from the users and we
have grown our user base more than
double on the last six months we've seen
that our Android where users have 40%
monthly active usage Android wear brings
a much more engaged community to our in
fact some of our users are only using
all 19 on the Android wear and we think
that it is a consequence of the big
effort that we put into developing it
moving to you Android wear as a
developer was relatively easy given the
quality of the wearable allows one of
the most important things on the on
course experience was checking the
distances to determine that was a core
feature that we had moved from the phone
to the watch one thing that you have to
take into account when developing apps
for wear is that the phone and the app
communicate at all time for this we have
used the data layer API that makes our
life really easy because it is just a
matter of exchanging the right small
portions of data with the new launch of
Android wear to Vacarro
we have access to a whole new set of
features that can improve the user
experience we are already using the
complications API because we want the
user to feel connected with augmented
you want him to
to the watch face and have quick access
to information life is handicapped is
average score how many days have passed
from the last time in the airport both
it's been amazing looking back when this
company started when I was in my
basement mapping golf courses for six
hours little did I know that you know a
few years later we have 1 million users
I didn't really expect it to be this
powerful and also didn't expect to you
know bring 30 people into this company
2 million reward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
