one technique that governs all of
computing without it your computer
basically would not exist or work at all
I'm Joanna Smith and caching is as
fundamental to performance as it is to
the design of the hardware in the phone
that you're holding if you think about
it there's a pretty clear reason why
computers have RAM it acts as a data
cache to access recent information fast
like super fast compared to having to
get it from the hard drive and this is
basically what a cache is a place to
store data that's frequently used so
that future uses happen as fast as
possible anytime that you have an
overhead cost for computing a piece of
data or loading it or finding it a cache
can help you do it faster and more
effectively the second time and the
third time and they you get the idea so
in your app the most common place where
you can win with caching is when you
have data that has calculated multiple
times but the result is always the same
no one would ever argue to move
non-variable work into an inner loop but
it may surprise you how easy it is to do
this by mistake
consider a simple example where you're
calculating the derivative of a four by
four matrix to use when calculating your
loop control variable but that matrix
never changes within the loop so you're
actually wasting performance re
computing the derivative on each
iteration instead compute and save the
result outside of the loop and let the
inner portions of your loop reference
that cache result this may sound obvious
when presented like this but you would
be surprised how even seasoned
developers get caught by it like when
calling get current user inside of a
loop in a single user environment like a
mobile game caching also acts as a
fantastic resource for a limited
resource environments for example let's
say that you have about 2 gigabytes of
images that the user might need to
display but you can only fit 50
megabytes of them in memory at a time so
the android framework will help you out
as much as it can if you use an adapter
view but you can make this more
effective by keeping track of what
images to keep in memory in which to
evict so the framework doesn't need to
evaluate the full two gigabytes of
content then there's the less common
form of caching known as pre-computation
this is essentially where you spend time
offline to calculate a huge lookup table
or a massive XML schema so that our
runtime you can simply fetch that data
rather than executing all that expensive
overhead
your user is waiting and that's the
whole point
avoiding unnecessary work so if you're
looking to make performance improvements
or trying to build a new app that's
already perf perfect take a pass through
places where you loop or load data or
have heavy computation and see what you
can shift around also avoiding
unnecessary work is pretty much all we
talk about in the rest of the Android
performance patterns content and in our
G+ community which is why you should
check both in the mouth so keep calm
profile your code and always remember
perf matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
