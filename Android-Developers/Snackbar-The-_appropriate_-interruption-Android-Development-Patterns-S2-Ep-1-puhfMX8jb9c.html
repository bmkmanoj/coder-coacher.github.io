information that your user might like
how can it share that info without being
disruptive I'm Joanna Smith and I'm here
to tell you how snack bars just might
change your life forever
or your app at least one of the finer
points of communicating information in
your application has to do with
on-screen notifications but when that
information is critical or requires the
user to make a decision you probably
want to use an alert historically you
had two approaches here first a dialog
could present information to the user
that they would then act on but
dialogues are interruptive and forced
the users to stop what they are doing
and deal with your dialogue I mean do
you enjoy being interrupted
do you love confirming that you really
wanted to do the thing that you were
doing do you just like pushy dialogues I
mean this is kind of annoying isn't it
so dialogues should really be used
sparingly which brings us around to the
second approach toasts which you can use
to confirm that the thing that the user
was doing really did happen but what if
the action was destructive like a
deletion your user might not have meant
to do that and now they are panicking
and looking for the undo and wondering
why you didn't double-check before
deleting that super cute pic oMG are you
trying to ruin my life and that is where
the snack bar comes in snack bars are
similar to a toast but they are more
versatile and that they are interactive
like offering that undo your user is
still searching for a snack bar animates
upward from the bottom of the screen and
you can swipe it away or not if you do
nothing it will timeout on its own and
automatically disappear then snack bars
contain a short string message and they
can offer a single action such as an
undo so now you have three components
that will help you interrupt your users
in the perfect way use the dialogue when
the users response is critical to your
app flow because you need to be
disruptive in these moments but use a
toast to give a user a tidbit of
information that doesn't change anything
and for everything in between the snack
bar is your new best friend and so there
you have it another great material
design principle brought to life in your
app so check out the design library for
all of the support you need to introduce
snack bars to your own app and have fun
in the world of non-disruptive alerts
but most importantly just continue to
build better apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
