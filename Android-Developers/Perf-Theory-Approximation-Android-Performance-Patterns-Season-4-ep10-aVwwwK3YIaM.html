computing a less precise answer you're
gonna get a performance win I'm joining
the Smith and I'm going to show you how
to balance the DRI for perfection
against the need for perfect performance
while still keeping your users perfectly
happy approximation is all about cutting
corners and making things good enough
for users and then convincing developers
that it's okay to do that consider a
trip planner app that uses the users
location to offer reminders to get gas
or suggestions on where to eat or cool
things to see now the app doesn't need
the device's location down to the foot
to do this a zip code might actually be
all it needs until the user accepts a
suggestion and then asks for navigation
directions that would be the moment to
increase the GPS precision and this is
approximation in action using less time
calculating a less precise result that
still meets the users current need so
how much time is your app wasting with a
more precise result when something less
precise would not be noticed by the user
put in this slide via potential for
savings from approximation is everywhere
like with our trip planner app while the
user is driving on that long long road
it's not necessary to pull the server
for updates exactly every five minutes
instead your app could batch and
schedule requests less precisely and
less frequently to save battery which
the user will need if they get a flat
the app could also calculate a path
between two cities on the trip and then
use the estimated travel time to set an
alarm for some future time when it will
wake up turn on the GPS and start
offering suggestions again because until
there's a point of interest nearby worth
offering to the user there really isn't
much use in tracking the user's location
along that long empty Highway and of
course there are approximations as
simple as allowing your images to be
slightly at a lower resolution in order
to save memory space and increase
rendering speed because when the user is
scrolling through a list of potential
stops along the road they don't need the
fully detailed image yet you can load
that when they are contemplating the day
car of their chosen restaurant now I'm
gonna take this again so listen this
time for a large majority of your code
you don't need a hundred percent exact
results by demanding less from your
hardware and still giving users
everything they need you can potentially
gain a lot for your frame rate and for
the device's battery life so at its core
approximation is all about trade-offs
which in reality is just like everything
else
performance and that's why you need to

performance patterns content and
consider joining our G+ community for
tips tricks and help so keep calm
profile your code and always remember
perf matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
