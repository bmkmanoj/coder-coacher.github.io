casual game studio over the years we
became a powerhouse and developing
mobile games from multiple platforms
we've been making games for Android
since its inception it's been great to
see how their focus on developer tools
and also their global reach has helped
us make games better for a much wider
audience one of the great things now is
we're able to use tools like open beta
to really get early access and
information to allow us to actually do
more of a user centered design focused
development historically we've put games
in a pre-launch that we were already
very comfortable with and we just waited
to sort of validate that we had what we
thought we had now that we're using open
beta were really willing to put a game
out there to the world much earlier in
its process cooking craze is a time
management game in which you play from
the perspective of a chef big fish
published cooking craze working with a
partner named EleFun who developed it
this is their first free-to-play time
management game and it's super fun they
really knocked it out of the park when
comparing our previous game launch to
our more recent one cooking craze where
we used open data we saw a dramatic
reduction in crash rate about 21%
decrease we also got a much higher
volume of feedback as well about 10x the
other thing that we noticed based on the
larger sample size was with cooking
craze we had no surprised 1 &amp;amp; 2 star
reviews whereas our past game release we
had a few that were
characterized one of the benefits of
being an open beta is you can still be
released globally this allows our
marketing teams to optimize their
processes their paid acquisition
partners and campaigns that they weren't
able to do in a geologic soft launch
before using open beta we would pre
release our games into a small number of
soft launch countries and we would use
them to see all the metrics that we're
looking for with open beta we're going
worldwide right off the bat and we're
able to gather data from a much wider
range of players that is much more
representative what we'll see when we go
to our official launch with open beta we
have said no restrictions go out go live
see what happens and we're able to react
if there's a problem instead of assuming
that there would be a problem we're
looking at the core game KPIs we're
looking at the team that's delivering
the game in their ability to scale we're
looking at a lot of the metrics that are
in android vitals when we're in
pre-launch we start by looking at
retention numbers are people coming back
on the second day are they coming back
in the third day we're typically looking
at d1d 7030 retention then we start
looking at the monetization metrics but
once we're comfortable with those
metrics then we know that it's time to
start moving toward our official launch
we were able to increase our retention
numbers fairly significantly we went
about nine percentage points up on D one
retention about eight percentage points
up on D seven and about five percentage
points up on D thirty one of the great
things about open beta is that were able
to gather feedback from the beta players
without having public facing reviews and
ratings so we're able to fail harder
without having sort of negative reviews
that stick on our permanent record for
the lifecycle of the game
my recommendation for all developers out
there is to take a close look at the
tools in the play console we use a lot
of them and we benefit from them
tremendously just in the last year we've
changed the way we've developed and
released our games substantially based
on open beta alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
