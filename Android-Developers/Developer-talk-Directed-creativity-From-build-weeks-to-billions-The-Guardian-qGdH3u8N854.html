ungrouped product manager for mobile and
devices at the Guardian I'm also really
really aware that I'm the final
lightning talk with the final session of
the day so I'm going to make it as
lightning as possible because you know
drinks so I'm really going to talk about
how we've tried especially the apps team
over the last year to introduce some new
ways of working to really unlock the
creativity that's embedded in
development teams themselves it taken
quite a long time for the industry in
general and to be frank the publishing
industry specifically to understand that
development is a creative process in and
of itself and teams of developers and
designers have really creative ideas and
the task for us is to really try to
unlock them now there are loads of
different ways to try to unlock ideas
and to try to get features out to the
public and there are loads of different
ways to plot them as well but for the
sake of this talk I'm going to plot them
along two different axes so along the x
axis then you've got kind of self leg
creativity ideas that you come up on
your own yourself and you try to make
happen and at the other end you've got
imposed creativity stuff that's given to
you by other people and then along the y
axis we've got a business return right
so you've got features that when they're
eventually deployed give really really
high value to the business and high
value to your users and it's worth kind
of saying those two things are
essentially synonymous and you've got
things that are low value so either that
nobody uses or that don't help the
business at all so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to look up a few different
ways that we work and how they plot
along these two different these
different axes so would be a good
example of the top right or strategic
features right if their strategic
features there might be very very high
value because it's aligning to the
entire strategy of your business and
they're also likely to be imposed
because the business is saying team I
really need you to do this in our case
it might be team I really need you to
get many many more users signed into the
app then you've got things like backlogs
now I'd argue that backlogs they tend
towards being slightly more self
creative because developers especially
in
functioning agile teams can go and pick
up cards that they think are really
important but they are also tend towards
being all they do tend towards being
imposed right people like me help kind
of shaped backlogs then you've got bad
ideas bad ideas they tend towards being
or especially bad ideas from senior
management I'm kind of I'm admitting to
this um impose creativity and low value
we really need to do this team crap it's
failed then you've got bugs in debt now
I was trying to solve where to put this
right so our teams at the Guardian are
really enabled to genuinely care about
the quality of their products and they
pick up individual bugs individual
pieces of debt as and when they think
it's really really important now
individually they tend towards being low
value although I don't want you guys to
think I'm not saying that quality is
important quite the opposite qualities
critical taken together they might be
all the way up there but if you look at
them on an individual basis their
comparatively low quality but they're
slightly more self led now the next
we're going to look at is hack days you
put your hands up for you know what to
hack days okay so not huge numbers keep
your hand up if you participate in a
hack day okay roughly the same number of
numbers okay so a hack day is where you
get loads later develops into a room
together and you say go away and build
something and then were at the end so
it's kind of in some ways the purest
example of self leg creativity now
sometimes hack day projects are hugely
valuable fact the Guardian has an
internal suite of analytics called ofan
which is phenomenal it's fantastic that
grew out of one of our hack days but
very often so it were saying that we all
work here but very often hack de
projects don't align to the strategic
aims because they're really an
opportunity for developers to go away
and play sometimes they're an amazing
idea but they don't have enough resource
beyond them and they can't do because of
other things the business are doing
sometimes frankly they're just playing
to the crowd so sometimes hack day ideas
are very very high value but very often
than not hack days have a low hit rate
for long-term value to the business
now by this way I'm talk about feature
specific there are loads of other really
really good reasons to hack days giving
your developers a chance to work
together it's a fantastic tool to to get
people who never talk to each other
actually talking but if you're being
brutal about just single features hack
days in and of themselves on long enough
and on focused enough to live a
consistent return for the business open
so for me the key question is what can
fit here can you construct a way of
working which is both very high-value
unleashes the creativity of your
development teams and has a really good
return of the business and for us the
thing that fits in that ? is the build
week now the build week is you might get
is a bit like a hack day but instead of
just hacking something together as
quickly as you can just a demo it to an
audience you build it and you build it
to a point words in principle testable
instead of being a day it's a week and
the reason it's a week is that gives our
development teams and our engineers and
I UX designers enough time to actually
build something which is really really
compelling but like a hack day it
unleashes their creativity by giving a
huge amount of self led our creative
self worth so they really get to choose
what are going to build and there are
few rules to it the first and this
important to unleashing the strategic
value is there's a strategic scene so
ones that we've run over the last year
have been around mobile monetization
around editorial innovation around key
personalization and about making our
apps quicker and more responsive
solutions aren't imposed the job of
someone like me is to simply give the
theme and then allow the teams as large
as they can be to get on and come up
with the most creative ideas they can on
their own to try to meet that theme we
take time at the beginning of the
project to deeper the beginning of the
Harrier the build week to deeply
understand what we're trying to do and
critically the output is testable this
needs to be able to go somewhere where
we get actual feedback from actual users
so this is an example of one of the hack
works um recently this is my lovely team
working on it it's worth pointing out
that the team isn't just engineer's
you've got Frank there he's
designer your chip shit he's our mobile
editor you've got Helen up there who's a
UX researcher for our hack weeks who
tried to make a team which is as broad
as possible now I said that what are the
key things is the output is testable and
I wanted to cut a dwell a little bit on
what I meant there because I do the
build week is you're coming out with
tangible useful things for users so what
do I mean by testable well at one end
you've got testing in our UX lab now
that's great but really what we look for
for a bill week is something which can
be tested slightly further afield then
we've got our alpha program now we use
the alpha program on Google Play to do
nightly builds of our Android app that
go out to any of the internal users
within the Guardian and the Alpha progra
is a fantastic way at the end of a bill
week to testability across six hundred
users it's also great to get
stakeholders really excited there's
nothing like somebody suddenly seeing a
feature they didn't know existed for the
first time that really answers one of
their needs to get it rapidly into
production we also use our beta program
and if you're interested in signing up
to the beach program you can follow that
URL at the top I'll be to program runs
at thousands of Android users and we
often take some of the fantastic ideas
that come out of our build weeks are
whack them straight into beta or we also
do staged rollout mvt and a/b testing in
our live environment as well but the key
point is we're asking the teams to spend
one week deeply understanding a problem
and coming over the most creative ideas
they can to solve that and then proving
if their ideas work on them answered
approvable is this provably successful
do i have concrete example so this has
worked it's quite telling that when I
was pretty slides together or the
contacts in google kind of content we
went shouldn't this be probably and i
was like no no this is provably it's
demonstrable so what are a few examples
just to wrap up where the built weeks
have really helped the Guardian well the
first where is our hide ads button so if
you look at the investment on the
right-hand side there there's a lovely
little high button they screw out to our
mobile monetization week and it drives
users to our ad free premium
subscription now one of the developers
came up with it it seems like an obvious
idea but because of completely
understandable internal debate within
the Guardian we've never got to the
stage where we are actually rolling this
feature out
because ads and subs are in our app
mutually incompatible and they're two
different revenue streams having this
already built as part of the build week
allowed us to test it really really
rapidly and come to the discussions
about whether it was a good idea with
real statistically relevant data to
inform the decision as you can guess if
any of you use the Android apps that
decision was to deploy it alive because
we did and it delivered a huge increase
in subsequent version rates search from
profile it was a bugbear for
personalization that all of your read
history wasn't available and one of our
developers build this lovely kind of set
of profile and search this went straight
into the UX labs it was loved so much we
deployed it to live within I think three
weeks it's another kind of wonderful
example show real benefits for users who
are looking to go back over articles
that they've read before so what's
coming up and our personalization bill
week then one of the developers got
together one of our server side
developers and build a new
recommendation engine which were
probably going to call discover this
isn't live yet but it's probably coming
out this quarter it's the kind of
investment in the business as a whole
probably wouldn't have made if it had
been asked to strategically decide what
it was going to do initially but because
it was kick-started by the build week it
allowed us to really really rapidly take
it into the alpha program similarly read
it to me read it to me uses the speech
to tackle the text-to-speech engine in
Android to allow you to consume any
piece of Guardian content without a
screen what's really nice is as of the
build week last week it not only works
on your phone but also interfaces where
and now interfaces the auto as well now
this is another one where the guard is a
whole probably was spontaneously come up
with this because we're so concentrated
on the written word which is completely
understandable but by putting editorial
innovation which was the theme of the
build week to are you to our engineers
we came up with a feature that what you
really really hopes going to
substantially increase engagement and it
makes us happy these are my happy team
so what's the takeaway that I'm really
suggesting to you here now those views
run hat weeks they're fantastic those of
you who run a very very top-down
development that sometimes required
needed but there is a fantastic middle
ground that fantastic middle ground is
well describing the problem and allowing
your teens to go away and engineer their
solutions and then test them so if you
don't take anything else away from this
just try that out at least once and see
what you get because you hopefully will
be presently surprised thanks very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
