apps and games business development team
and in my day to day job I worked with
both apps and games developers so I
thought it would be interesting for you
as app developers to learn more about
what successful games developers care
about and not only that I will try to
extrapolate some some rules that you can
apply in your day-to-day job and also I
will show some examples of how these
rules have been applied by apps
developers but before that I want to
spend some time talking about why we
think games and apps should learn from
each other what are what are the
relevant things that are they have in
common but I don't want to oversimplify
this actually I wanna address the
elephant in the room right away it's
much more difficult to make money on
apps and games we all know that and it's
not only because it's generally more
accepted to pay for games and apps but
also because games have much more
flexibility in their mechanics in what
they can do to actually monetize users
they're also selling virtual goods so
there's endless possibilities what they
can sell and the price points they can
put together so they basically can do
whatever they want in terms of selling
virtual currencies or build virtual
goods in a game for apps that's not
possible
but the math is always the same apps and
games in both cases that the model the
dominant model is the freemium model
that means that this equation on the on
the right here that is always true CPI
the cost per install for for your
installs should always be lower than the
lifetime value of the users that you're
bringing in and that means that in a
world where CPI is rising because
there's more competition for
serviceability for user acquisition in
order to make this function work you
really need to focus on the right side
of this equation and lifetime value is a
function of retention engagement and
conversion and modernization but it all
starts with retention because that's
what drives engagement that's a measure
of engagement and that's what drives
monetization so engage retention is is
sking this data from mobile intelligence
company Quechua show how actually this
is so important for both apps and games
here you see comparison of retention
curves of apps based on Google Play
Store ranking here you see that the top
games and the top apps they all have
better retention than the ones below so
even if the curves are a little bit
different games tend to have shorter
term retention because they are less
they have less than Java t-then apps in
general this is always true so it's not
only something that games developers
should care about also apps should
really care about retention and going a
bit further in retention the the thing
the key metric that you look at you
should look at when you try to optimize
your long term retention is frequency
because that's where that shows how many
times a user comes back to your app if
users come back to your app often
chances are they will get hooked by it
they will make it part of their daily
day daily routine that means they will
be retained and it will become your
users forever hopefully that shows this
this graphic shows how different apps
category and game genre have they
they're mapped along two metrics one is
the frequency per week so many times the
user visits on average those apps in a
week and the day 90 retention so the
long-term retention the end of that
curve that I showed before you see that
while they're different it depends on
you know where you are in this category
there is a direct correlation between
the two all right
so retention is king and gains know this
very well they spend a lot of time
optimizing for that and you see how the
icon is repealed so you see how pretty
much every successful game developer in
your if you highlighted here they tend
to be before launching a new game to the
public they do what we call soft
launching they pick a test market or a
better community and they spend a lot of
time optimizing their game tweaking it
to the point where the retention figures
are satisfactory and this is a this this
requires a lot of discipline a lot of
games get skill get killed during this
process but it also ensures that they
invest resources in the right product
that actually has a chance to be
successful and and where that equation
that I show you before it works if you
don't do this already retention can be
measured very easily through Google Play
it's so sorry to Google Analytics and
this is the report that you can look at
that shows on the top your retention
curve this is your apt retention curve
and also it shows a breakdown of
retention figures by cores of users that
install the app in a given day so you
can also optimize and see how it impacts
retention all right so now let's talk
about some things that you can actually
learn from from the games world and
apply in your day-to-day job the first
one is focusing on engagement cliff this
is a very important I'll show you again
I'm showing you again the chart with
retention figures because that's there's
something else that can be noted here
you see how in each case every what
regardless of how successful the app is
most of the users are lost in the first
seven days that's where everyone loses
and actually that the top apps are the
one that are doing a better job
especially in the first seven days after
that the curves tend to flatten for
everyone so there's not much difference
between different apps but those first
seven days are critical here you see on
the right an average day 7 retention so
after those 7 days how many users are
still in the app 4 different categories
on average again this is quite from data
and you see how it varies between 40%
and 15 that means that on average 60
percent to 70 to 85 percent of users are
lost in those first seven days and
that's because users need to try an app
they need to they install a lot of apps
but then they try it and those first few
days they actually decide whether they
want to still using it or just leave it
there once they decide once they add app
is good enough then chances are this the
users will stick and actually that's why
the curves flattens here but those first
7 days are critical
Gamze know this very well in a game
onboarding is quite challenging you have
to teach a user new rules new mechanics
why you should care what is the story
lots of things so it all starts with a
tutorial and I want to show you an
extract of a video of that we should
recently shot with a very successful
game developer called pixel berry that
has a great completion rate for its
tutorial is 73% of people that actually
start a tutorial go through each each
question of the tutorial so let's play
the video and players coming in we hit
them with story right away and we try
and do it in a way where it's a little
more natural you know we are cognizant
that a lot of people playing games on
mobile phones may not want to read too
much text so we tried to ease players
into that but by the time they finish
our tutorial we're hoping that they're
already caught up in the lives of these
characters and they want to learn more
about their backstories and what's going
on I think it is important to give
people kind of that sense of progression
in a game especially in mobile games
because I think a little lot of games
that you can reach a certain point where
you're just repeating the same actions
and you want to feel like you're doing
something different I think story is a
great way of differentiating that and
saying you know oh now you're dealing
with a new villain or now you're dealing
with a new issue that's come up so they
talked about two key things one is the
story they use story to players right
away and they rely on that to to make
sure that it's compelling for it for the
user to stick around for the old
tutorial the other thing they talk about
is progression progression is very
important in games because if you think
about it the game is always presenting
you with a new challenge if you if you
get a sense of progression you keep
playing the game otherwise it gets
boring those challenges shouldn't be too
challenging otherwise you leave the game
so it's always finding the right balance
between making you stick around for to
play the next challenge but it's not too
difficult for you and I actually want to
show you how this concept of progression
and onboarding goes beyond the tutorial
with another example of play dots
another very successful game developer
this is a chart that shows all their
levels they are mapped along two metrics
one is revenue per player in that level
and lapse rate how many
people left the game in that level by
tweaking the difficulty level and and
and experience in the levels that are
below the red line so the
underperforming ones they actually
managed to improve not only retention
but also average revenue per paying user
so again the message here is this is
very specific to games of course but the
message is it's not only about the
tutorial is about how you communicate an
enforcer a sense of of progression
within the old game ok let's try to
extrapolate some some rules for apps now
the the important thing here is that in
the first seven days there is an
engagement cliff the user is presented
with a new app they have to understand
how it works and start playing with it
understand the value and you want to
ease that cliff as much as possible to
help them going through those seven days
to the point where they they will
probably stick around so the first thing
to do is finding features that provide
value to the user without much without
asking much from them something that you
can show them and and they can
experience right away and after that you
need to understand the activation
moments what are the key things that you
want the user to do in order to fully
experience the your app and that
requires some engagement some commitment
for example creating account uploading a
video finding some friends adding some
preferences something that personalizes
and and makes the experience deeper but
requires also some some actions from the
user and you should present those things
gradually you should help them going
through each one of them step by step
instead of of overwhelming them with
everything at this at the same time as a
consequence also a part of that is is
that you should manage the appearance of
paywalls especially in those first few
days you don't want to scare people off
or or overwhelm them with with the
requirements so that's a general rule
and it's something that can help you
optimizing your app around along this
rule is the flow report in Google
Analytics this shows you how users on
average move between different screens
in your app you can see the path they
take and more importantly
with the red lines here you can see what
where they get out of the app where
what's what are the friction point what
are the roadblocks and potentially
remove some of them if it makes sense so
very useful reports to use and and I
want to show you an example of an app
that did a great job applying these
rules recently when they redesigned
their onboarding flow over all the
achieved set 20% better set day Simon
retention which is a great figure the
way they did it is that first of all
let's talk about dating sites and apps
they they require a lot of things to to
set up before you can actually enjoy and
use that dating app you have to create
an account you have to write something
about yourself you have to start
answering some questions about yourself
liking some people and uploading a photo
a lot of things to do before you can
actually use the app they they redesign
their onboarding to make it more gradual
and step-by-step and I'll show you what
I mean exactly first of all this is what
they had before they required you to
write an essay about yourself upload a
photo answer some questions and like
some some people all together in the
same section of the app and with a
series of modal windows with no clear
sequencing so that the user felt a bit
overwhelmed and I go wow there's a lot
of things that I have to do before I can
even use this app and if you see on the
right that's just answering the
questions even when you go in one of the
tasks it feels quite overwhelming
because you have to do it's it's not
that engaging and there's a lot of
things you have to go through so this is
how it looks 1 after the redesign the
first thing you see when you download
the app is five questions about yourself
it's very easy to go through them right
yes you swipe right it's yes wipe left
is no once you finish that then you're
only then asked to upload a photo if you
want you can skip this so you can enjoy
the app even if we don't want to upload
a photo now but that's the only thing
you need to care about after that then
you can start enjoying the app and you
are also reminded of other things that
you should be doing too in order to
fully experience the app but it's just
an act call to action and you can do it
whenever you want and again this is step
by step once you do this then they push
you another
action to do so it's it goes from a very
low engagement very easy to go to tasks
to a bit more complex once you actually
start enjoying the app all right so now
users have decided to stick around
you've done a great job at onboarding
and communicating that sense of
progression but let's talk about how you
can monetize them I want to talk about
how games look at this even the most
successful games no matter what you do a
big percentage of users will never spend
a dime in that game and in games
developers are cognizant of that then
the key thing there is identifying as
soon as possible the users are more
likely to spend and start targeting them
and even then once you undertand fight
the people that are actually going to
spend understanding how much they are
willing to spend is is really powerful
because different users will have
different propensity to buy and
targeting them with a different
experience or different offers is where
you can optimize much more than applying
a one-size-fits-all approach I want to
show you what who does a great job at
this this is space ape a successful game
developer their games are summarization
rival Kingdom what they do here is they
segment users based on the first
seven-day behavior it's and they
calculate they predict the lifetime
value of each user based on the way they
engage with the game and also they
attack them with different spend
patterns the way they spend and buy
things within the game and then they
start targeting these users with
different offers let me show out how it
works here all the users they're eating
space safe servers they start say space
ape starts analyzing them and then there
are scientists a segment here they have
five segments I'm gonna show you just to
expose an example one is predicted to
have a medium lifetime value but the
pattern here is that they spend a lot in
one single chance in one single purchase
and then they tend not to spend too much
too often the other group is I are
actually lifetime value but in a single
span they spend less even if they
think that over time these users are
spending more in a single spent point
they tend to spend less and but the
frequency will be higher so then they
expose them to different offers
different bundles of items where the
medium lifetime value with a single span
point and loss pen frequency sees a very
big bundle with lots of stuff in it
quite expensive but it's just buy it
once and probably you never come back
you're gonna use it and and for the rest
of the game while the the medium
strength spend point sees a smaller
bundle cheaper but probably you're gonna
come back and buy more so that's very
powerful and if you want to extrapolate
a rule for from for the apps world is
you first I'll have to realize that
different users are gonna want something
different from your app and especially
they will have a different value
perception and a different propensity to
spend and if you can identify them and
target them with a different offer that
is more customized around that that's
where you can optimize your conversion
much more effectively effectively an
exam I'm a tool that you can use to
start learning about your users and how
they're the different segments behave
and start thinking about what you can
actually do to tailor their experience
is again Google Analytics this is the
segment builder in analytics it lets you
create segments with lots of options I
want to show you that just the behavior
category of those options you have
sessions days since last session
transactions and session duration so you
can create a segment based on that for
example and here we have two groups one
is highly engage people and the other
one is less engaged users and those
segments will then be exposed in pretty
much every report that is in Google
Analytics so for example this is the
revenue report and you see instead of
one line for revenues you see revenues
for highly engaged users and revenues
for less engaged users so you can really
start understanding how they behave and
what is bringing you each segment who
does a great job in the apps world
targeting different users with different
value proposition is a swish it's an
e-commerce app and very simply they have
a group of people that are less engaged
and one is more engaged
let's engage people the the feed of
products that they recommend is less
expensive because it requires less
commitment and less engagement to
actually thinking of purchasing them
well when once they see more engagement
and and and some conversion they start
recommending more expensive product so
quite simple but it led to 10% better
conversion just by doing that alright
the last one I want to show is selling
umbrellas where and when rains this is
how you sell products instead of what
you sell if you if you look at this
screenshot from pretty simple another
game developer pretty simple games it
they made an art not only a science out
of this and I want to show you an
example of how this can be really
optimized play dots again that the
developer we talked about before with
the progression chart they also
redesigned their purchase flow across
the old game and overall they achieve
better ten percent better revenue per
active user which is a big number
because it's all for all users so
including the ones that are not paying
so overall ten percent revenue per user
is quite an achievement and I sure I'll
show you a couple of examples of what
they did the first one is before you
start a level you see you see a card
that shows you some stats of what you
have and it prompts you to buy things
that you might need in that level it's
not the old store it just prompts you to
buy specific things in this case it's
boxes that you might need in that
specific level and similarly when you
die you know in a level basically you
ran out of moves in the thing you see
the first thing you see is is a button
that lets you buy extra moves that lets
you finish that level instead of
starting over again and just going back
to the store and buying those you can
buy them now and keep playing the level
by doing this they obtain 6% more paying
users just by adding this tool called to
actions the other thing they did they
move some products some in-app products
within the game experience so instead of
having them exposed in the store only
also I light them on the bottom of the
game so whenever you want while you're
playing you can purchase them it's one
tap this led to 5% better our pool
overall if we wanna simplify and
generalize this for apps it's about
selling umbrellas where and when it
rains it's not only making purchasing
accessible and easy for for users so
that it's as close as possible to their
experience is one top away or two taps
away but also triggering some call to
actions when and where is very relevant
at specific product at your selling who
does a great job at this in the apps
world is TomTom they recently moved from
premium to freemium and they saw two
point four times more paying users and
that's because they they moved in the
right way they actually thought about
their business model and now they could
sell upgrade to premium in a very clever
way I want to show you how the model is
that you have seventy five kilometers
for free you can use the app for seventy
five kilometres and you don't have to
pay it's a real metering model in its
real meters and then you can upgrade to
one year or three year subscription and
the first thing they did is that they
made that upgrade button always
available there it's on the bottom of
the app whatever wherever you are on the
app you see that it's one type of way
you can upgrade and you also see the
countdown how many kilometers for free
you still have so 75 74 73 you see the
progression and and you you know when
you need to eat that button the other
thing they did very similarly to the
other example I showed you they trigger
some call-to-action when it's quite
relevant for example if you start a new
trip they know that you're probably
gonna run out of kilometers because that
trip is quite long and you only have 40
kilometers for example they trigger a
call to action says do you want a great
now it's better probably because you
don't want to upgrade when you're
driving or you might not have connection
or you're abroad so things like that
they also trigger a call to action when
when you're running actually out when
you're actually running out of
kilometers and when you when you run out
of kilometers but that the point here is
that it's relevant and it's easy to do
it and I understand why I should
purchase they're great in this moment
alright to wrap up the rules are three
one is addressing the onboarding with
with as an engagement cliff and so start
by analyzing your date one today seven
retention figures in analytics and
thinking about activation moments that
are gradually more invested for the user
and how you can introduce them in the
app the second one is embracing your
apps multiple personality disorders so
understanding that different users want
different things and you can target them
with different different ways especially
when it comes to in app offers and
propensity to buy and this the third one
is about not only how you what you sell
but how you sell it and we say that it's
like selling umbrellas where and when it
rains make it easy for people to buy but
also very relevant and triggering call
to action when you think the most
chances are that the user will convert
