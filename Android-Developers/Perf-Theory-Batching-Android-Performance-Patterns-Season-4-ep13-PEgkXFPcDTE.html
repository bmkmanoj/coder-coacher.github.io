performance problems that get you it's
the little insignificant cost of small
functions executed over and over again
that add up to big problems I'm Joanna
Smith and rather than suffering the
death of thousand cuts you can utilize
batching to keep your app alive almost
everything in computing has some
associated performance overhead that
goes along with it this can be something
big like decompressing an image which
requires a bunch of memory allocations
to store the intermediate data or it can
be something small like the extra memory
copies and pointer management that tag
along with recursive functions now
typically these perf taxes aren't much
of a concern but when executed multiple
times where multiple is some seriously
big number this overhead can become a
serious performance burden for your
application and this is where batching
comes in handy batching is the process
of grouping together identical instances
of a task
this way the associated overhead happens
once not once per instance for example
if you're going to render the same image
20 times try loading it once before you
begin instead of loading it for every
render after all nesting your
computations together gets you more bang
for the buck for Android one of the most
important places you can leverage
batching is with networking requests
basically there's an overhead cost each
time you need to turn on your phone's
cell radio so if you're sending a packet
out once every 30 seconds you're paying
for that cost every packet instead you
should Group one to two minutes worth of
requests together turn the radio on once
and send all of those requests at the
same time but batching is pretty helpful
in other situations too like rendering
custom views rather than computing a
transform matrix for every item you
could group them together and make small
changes to a larger transform matrix
saving you precious resources and then
there's the most obvious case for
batching where some function needs to
compute a lookup table before working on
the data so making a version that can
batch together 20 pieces of data for one
lookup table creation is a clear
batching win in fact batching is so
important that all modern processors now
come equipped with mathematical batching
support single instruction multiple data
functions allow you to execute the same
mathematical functions on multiple
pieces of data
all in parallel so instead of spending
individual CPU cycles on each of the
four pieces of data you can spend one
cycle and get the same result and that's
really what the core of performance is
about finding every opportunity to
reduce even the slightest performance
overhead because a one millisecond
overhead called sixteen times in one
frame is all it takes to destroy your
frame rate so to see other improvements
and find more perfect bytes

importantly keep calm profile your code
and always remember perf matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
