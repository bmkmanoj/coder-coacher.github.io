staring at our IDE so we care a lot
about our tools I'm Rotem aya this is
Android tool time time and this is a
turret studio 1.5 Android studio 1.5
includes a number of bug fixes and
enhancements that includes an upgrade to
the memory profiler this new analysis
feature can analyze a heap dump to look
for known problems such as leaked
activities to use this feature open a
heap dump and look for the analyzer
tasks window on the right in the
analysis window you can press the Run
button to perform an analysis and then
drill into the results here's an example
of a leaked activity there are several
new lint checks - here's one which warns
you if you're attending to override
resources referenced from the manifest
hmm looks like bug fixes hide module
selector where only one module in theme
editor correct title set for creating a
new module in your module wizard provide
documentation and XML attribute values
completion this can't be right Jamal yes
is that right did I miss something it
seems just like a bunch of stability
improvements and some bug fixes
basically a lot of good book fixes ok
but you know this is my first what's new
in Android studio video so I was kind of
hoping to make a big splash you know
look I understand that but these are
very important bug fixes I guess ooh
what about this box can I tell them
what's in the box no we can't talk about
the box you sure it looks pretty
interesting look rito we could
definitely not talk about the box why is
he even here we should really focus on
the bugs ok well the theme editor now
has a preview of the theme that's about
to be created
it's a number of bug fixes in the editor
area where we've been working hard to
polish code completion for resource and
manifest files for example you can now
use short names when doing code
completion for custom views we also make
sure that Android studio doesn't steal
your focus if you switch virtual
desktops during the build and run
download Android studio 1.5 now for
these and many other bug fixes and
stability improvements
that's Android studio 1.5 this is
Android tool time and you should totally
forget I said anything about the box
seriously I shouldn't have mentioned it
stop talking about the box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
