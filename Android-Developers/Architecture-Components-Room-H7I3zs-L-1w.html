in Android has several drawbacks you
have to write a lot of boilerplate code
you have to implement the object mapping
for every query right it's difficult to
implement database migrations it's hard
to test the database and if you're not
careful you can easily do long-running
operations on the main thread to solve
these problems we created through a
persistence library that provides an
abstraction layer over SQLite here's
what you need to know to start using
room in your app let's say that you want
to have a table of users and you want
every row of the table to be an instance
of the user's class you need to annotate
your class with entity define the table
name the primary key and the column
infos room will take care of the
creation of the user table for you to
access the data in the database you use
data access objects dolls for short you
need to create an interface annotate it
with tau where you declare all the
methods needed to work with the database
and write the corresponding SQL
statements Rome will take care of
implementing these methods for you and
running each of them in a single
transaction room supports insert update
delete and query the SQL statements are
checked at compile time meaning that if
you write an invalid query you'll find
this out immediately the class that puts
together the entities and the dolls is
the room database create an address that
extends the room database annotate it
declare the entities and the
corresponding dolls let's take a closer
look at the queries all of these queries
are synchronous meaning that they will
be run on the same thread you are
triggering them from if that's the main
thread your app will brush with the
league of State exception so use your
preferred method of handling threads in
Android and make sure your of the main
thread room also supports asynchronous
queries when working with live data our
RH Java even more the queries that
return live data or flowable objects are
observable queries meaning that you'll
get notified every time the data in the
table updates whenever you alter your
database schema either because you've
added or renamed the new column or table
you'll need to tell room how to handle
this change to do that in your data base
class you'll need to first complete your
database version second
implement the migration class that
defines how to handle the migration from
the old to the new version and third add
that migration as a parameter in the
database filter after triggering the
migrations room will validate the schema
for you to ensure that the migration was
done correctly so we have our entities
Dowell's database and migrations how do
we test them to test the Dulles you need
to implement an android gene unit test
that creates an in-memory database the
in-memory database will hold the data
only for as long as the process is alive
meaning that after every test the
database will be cleared to test
asynchronous queries at the test run
instant tasks execute our rule to
execute each task synchronously in your
apps implementation you'll end up
referencing the dowels in other classes
to unit as those classes just mock the
doll with the help of frameworks like
mojito here's another tip extend the
counting task executor role and use it
in your expressive tests to count the
tasks as they start and finish finally
don't forget to test on migrations we
have another handy test role for this
the migration test helper this class
allows you to create your database in an
older version and run and validate
migrations all you need to do is check
that the data you inserted in the older
version is also present after migration
so let's boilerplate code compile time
check queries ease of implementing
migrations high degree of testability
and keeping database work away from the
main threat all of these qualities of
room make working with the database
easier and pleasant helping you deliver
better apps
