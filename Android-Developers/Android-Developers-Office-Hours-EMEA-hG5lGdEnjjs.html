Android developers office hours it's
2:00 p.m. here in London social regular
and dose of all things Android
development so here in London my name is
Nick butcher and I'm joined by an
international show coming to you from
from Jordan yeah G Jordan over here
where it's 5:00 p.m.
believe it or not Richard Hyndman as
usual talked about on the stage at the G
Jordan event actually because it was the
only room that was free so I'm in
somewhat a large room save if you track
sound the only even it it seems to be
holding out so far there's no in fact
your challenge how many people can we
get in that room by the end of the
Hangout send them in and this is a G
Jordan advanced one step up from
previously as well now you have to
actually be good what's gonna be next
year it's gonna be like okay except we
have some regular and regular listeners
during his viewers whatever you want to
call yourselves over call and Al we've
not seen you for a few weeks how are you
good thanks it's good to be back and
I've got December back in my event so
I'm a happy man and do you have any
hardware you could show us I have a
little circuit board sitting below my
monitor but I don't think I can show it
to you yet it's a prototype one but
there's eat all of the lucky people who
are gonna get dev kits they're all
shipping out by the 28th of December so
it should be arriving as a New Year's
present just just saying that actually
happens to be my birthday I didn't put
you on the list I think you'll be number
sixty eight thousand seven hundred okay
I'll swap it for the next generation of
Nexus phone yeah you go to Nexus for
what is that you see I asked al if you
got these as a Nexus 4 phone no I
haven't got hold of one yet but I
believe there's one winging its way to
me so are you by Christmas I will be a
people you got you ordering yesterday
when they went back on sale yeah yeah I
was lucky inand with the one to two-week
delivery time so since you go a little
bit smoother yesterday than the first
time around there were there are a few
errors but I mean that's what happens
when you get thousands of people
pouncing after the latest hardware so
yeah I don't think I've seen anyone who
tried to order one who've got an
absolute blank wall or mysterious things
like stuff disappearing from their
baskets they all looked a lot better
than last time
you got one yep presents galore so yeah
a few more regularly joiner is your hand
how are you doing all right
fine are you yeah yeah very good very
good your hand of course from the
world's famous dutch android usergroup
we just came back from two weeks ago
today I guess we were there when we're
doing a live show from from Amsterdam
and a wonderful event it was as well
that was a good fun for a sec dear
hopefully bigger and better next year so
we're already thinking about this so
cool who else we've got there mr.
Christopher Baines hi guys how you doing
yeah good thanks still not working very
jealous of you
there's a spot for you and games
consoles if you want to Chris coming
over chat and who else we have on the
call uh kissing on the call like it's a
corporate VC thing who else is hanging
out we could you say Fierro and
breathing red nice what's this beauty of
question I'm sure and Matthew I don't
think there's nothing if you've got a
camera or a mic thank you say hello no
okay all right and so as usual we're
here to talk about all things Android
development we're not here to talk about
any future unannounced unreleased
products and stuff that we don't know
anything about because we can make
updates but we just don't know there's
no point asking us that kind of stuff
and but yeah well while we're here is
anyone in the Hangout live in the
Hangout got any development uestions
Richard
Oh
Giuseppe needs muting that's getting
it's getting I thought we should kick
off with the map fragment of course
which came to Google Play services on
Monday Google Play services making it
backwards compatible with all devices
from point A to point C what would which
is absolutely excellent they have to
have OpenGL to but I think every 2.2
upwards device has OpenGL 19.8% of the
devices in the market that must be all
the 2.2 s upwards right they must be
don't know I guarantee that it supports
a hundred percent of the devices that it
supports so yes let's zoom in really not
too hard to implement at all you can
just add the map fragment in and you get
all the powerful capabilities of Google
Maps inside your Android application
they told vector based finally so none
of those bitmap downloads it caches to
the external memory you can have the
satellite imagery you can have traffic
data you can do animations you can give
the camera a new location and tell it to
animate to it or a new zoom level all
right single line of code awesome stuff
and the most complicated bit is just
getting your Maps API key and then to be
honest once you've done that once it's
not too bad just go to the api's console
and turn on Google Maps API version 2
for Android services and then you can
create your own new Android application
and I think in waiting for a map update
a map view maybe yes the biggest
developer ask we've heard for a while
it's been baking for a while so we're
quite excited to be able to talk about
this pilot
anyone here taking a look at the new ed
guys just started yesterday but
hopefully until the end of the week I'll
have mock up to show some features are
you wanting to implement cool
maybe our open sourcing yeah absolutely
there's quite a nice little demo app
isn't there that comes with rich so how
to accessorize all the different API
eyes yeah there's some samples that come
with
in the Google Play services samples
folder on your in your SDK once you
downloaded Google Play services actually
the seam should been another update to
it today as well
well stars doing this live on stage
today I said all you need is Google Play
services version 2 and show them in the
SDK manager and it incremented division
tree I don't know why I was in there but
maybe there's a been a bug fix already
so make sure you're using the latest
version of Google Play services and you
get yourselves a support map fragment
wonderful I think every app that I write
over the next even ultimate stopwatch
it's gonna have a map you mean just
because when you made this time I love
it okay so we can carry on now I just
want it to get that out we can go into
the normal hangout stuff does anybody
else in the Hangout have a question yeah
I do have a question posted in a
moderator when I use this Spotify app
every list view as a spinner on the on
the right and when I click that a
subview folds down and two questions may
be is there an acceptable UI pattern or
are you maybe suggesting to go for pop
out or whatever and the second question
maybe is how to best do that when do you
see this in Spotify if just any list
yeah if you look on the right and you
click on the spinner I think it's really
cool to fold out additional stuff for
every song or album or whatever so my
question is how to best achieve that
kind of animation do I add an extra few
group holding that that's a particular
sub display in every list item and make
its view or visibility gone and then
animate
animated when they click it or do I add
an extra few types to the adapter or yes
sir
I don't know you daddy 20 individual
child Ison but I do it's a viewstub yeah
so it's only inflated and actually
memory when you need it and then just
animate the only way you can get the
animation is by doing new animation
frame like that so wise what laughing is
as soon as you go visible on the Ison
you'll get a big gap appear and then it
was kind of sliding so you'd only get
that sort of nice sliding motion with a
new animation appeals panel at least it
backwards compatible then Chris in no
way no way
okay okay so spun fireman speeding same
funky mmm it only works on other
platforms yes it will still work but
whether it's exactly the same user
experience now I'm saying they're
getting it they get the nice slide down
transition right yes yeah but even on
devices before sort of gingerbread I
might be using nine old androids on that
yeah okay I've invited Marcus the
developer of the Spotify app to the
Hangout to see the maintenance and but
he hasn't doing it we'll see if he pops
in okay yeah I think those good
suggestions yesterday and the new
animation API you talk about Chris is
the a predefined yeah the API you talked
with Chris is the enable animates layout
transitions isn't it what's a cool move
it knows it no it's just just the view
animations okay friends like XML the
rest of it
because the layout transitions are when
you haven't actually added remove views
remember rightly and whereas if you use
the old style animation explored and
rotate flipped lesson and you'll get
different experiences that sort of the
honeycomb animation a few lines okay so
basically in short if I understood
correctly a few stop in the row layout
and only inflated when I need it and
then animate with the new animation it
sounds good tonight and if the Spotify
developer pops in Nick we might have a
pretty resolution okay thanks guys
you
and aha and we're back
what do we miss interesting I didn't
miss you guys maybe that's what it's
like when we drop out from the new
picture space there nobody even knows
you've gone it's just like it's good to
see this from the other side of the
camera for once we just look like we
just stopped talking for a while if we
don't know the answer isn't it that's
the new change you're talking about and
then because there's been for a little
while in the API there's been you can
animate additions to ListView right so
every new item would like animate
gracefully and rather than just appear
not any when you're actually animating
the bounds of an item vinius ListView
there's a new changing animation which
you have to turn on explicitly what you
find sure quite cool yeah so also you
talked about it from the UX point of
view as well it's a slight abuse of it
like I think they're little and the
right hand triangle drop down it's
pretty strongly tied like you say to
this spinner idea like the idea is that
you push this and you have this kind of
you have this fixed concept of what's
gonna happen you're gonna have this kind
of drop-down list come out so it's kind
of a riff on that like I actually think
it's okay it's kind of similar to what
the Google music application does so in
strict terms I guess it's not the right
kind of affordance to show what's going
to happen but I think it's Nokia
validation I think is quite cool yeah
okay thanks any other hangout I just
wondering how many people saw a roaming
Keys performance analysis it was a
really cool post that he put up of
fulcrum Pro where he took it out and
showed all the overlays and stuff like
that yeah is anyone else played around
with the show overdraw developer option
with their own apps yet I haven't but I
didn't even realize it was there until I
Brady's pace it's absolutely awesome I
hosted a ballot weeks it's G Jordan is
running it all the time on their device
that's quite amused to actually see them
being to use it live are you ready for a
couple of days on every single app it's
weird it's a bit matrix here at first
like you know all you can see is like
red blue green after a while just blonde
brunette
yeah there's a really nice thing though
for the sliding drawers the different
sliding drawer libraries some of them
are leaving they draw behind the view
so as the view list Scrolls you can
still see the drawer behind it if you
have the epidurals turned on
and some of them as soon as you slide it
and it goes off the screen and replacing
it with a view stuff and it disappears
and these ones obviously aren't
impacting the ListView scrolling
performance but the ones that leave it
behind the list are so we tried three or
four different libraries out to see
which ones
guess what Google+ does hey youtube
it disappears as soon as the drawer
closes and then it adds the layout back
in as soon as it starts working again
nice yes it's a good trick when you're
using other people's libraries to see
how efficient they've been by turning on
over tools and anyone else them tried
tracer for OpenGL ES yet yeah I leave it
it's pretty cool right yeah it's pretty
much coming in to follow all the tracing
or if nicely they know what it is it's
basically a tool which lets you and kind
of go through each frame that you're
rendering step-by-step of rendering
operation so in this article which I was
talking about and Roman guy takes a look
at a twister application and you can
step through each drawing command
basically so you can see that he's
drawing the full screen backgrounds and
then drawing another completely opaque
background right over the top of it and
then I think a third actually on top of
that so I mean those are just completely
wasted time spent drawing and memory
being copied up to the GPU and all this
kind of stuff so you know you can just
get rid of a couple of those calls and
just gain a little bit extra rendering
time for each each each frame so you can
hit your 60 frames per second buttery
smooth performance it's a really really
cool tool to understand exactly what
your apps doing check it out yeah I
think it was just a really nice walk
through all the tools as well like this
one those things way you can easily open
them and then just get blindsided by so
much information so it's kind of nice
the way he kind of explains what he
looks for when he's doing it as well
what you can kind of see from it as well
see it's definitely worth checking out
life definitely needed those other
things before and just gone whoa too
much yeah so thank you you've posted a
link to it for those watching the video
later
check out curious dust - creature dog
and I'll post it on the hangout on
Google+ also I'll be cool yeah that's
awesome so I guess we should stop
Guiseppe from having to wait any longer
been waiting for an answer for this
question for two or three days yeah but
before you start to do once with my
question I would like you to make my
question what is it carry on
Guiseppe sorry alfredo joined and he had
some feedback on his speakers we just
muted him what why were you
congratulating Yoshi publicly strike yes
because they had an interview on TV yeah
we went on CBS yesterday on the San
Francisco Bay Area and also review by
CNET for either yeah yeah that is very
good because you usually the TV don't
speak too much about Android to let's
say that very cool if you guys thanks
Congrats well what is my answer I'll
jump in all right do you want the short
version or the really short position
it's not good news
so I've been looking into it there's
only three Bluetooth profiles that we
enable you to interact with directly and
objects object file exchange isn't one
of them so the the file exchange is
provided at a Bluetooth stack level and
other devices can inquire to see if your
device supports it and if it does the
file is handled and
stored there's no way of interacting or
interrupting that process inside Android
without yeah from an external
application that you don't own sending a
Bluetooth file fluid through objects to
your application it's handled by the
device so you can have it inside your
application that you detect Bluetooth
devices and that you make a serial
transfer but if you want someone to be
able to do shit via bluetooth and do an
object exchange file transfer into your
application then this isn't reported at
one okay interrupt this is a system
level thing are the only ones you can
play with our a2dp and health and
headset are three profiles that your
application can interact with but the
other profiles that Bluetooth provides
networking file exchange things like
that thankfully speaking after a long
research I am more in dispute I thank
you I think we need to welcome Alfredo
into the Hangout at Politecnico di
Milano hey guys we muted you so if you'd
like to say hello you can today some
questions from the guys so if you want
to so let's take welcome first of all
welcome all of you thank you for joining
us let's take one question from you guys
to start with them we'll take one from
the moderator and then we'll come back
to the floor again see who asked
questions so he would like to ask a
question from as you say
I have some reasonable today Google
Cloud messaging about how can we use it
to push notification we can manage when
the user is not online how can we cancel
the race to the notification and send
that a huge notification about something
that thousands of people when he or she
loved one who wants to take that one
donation so Google Cloud messaging
I assume you've looked into the
documentation the initial documentation
which says how it works you build that
into your application and then your
application registers with your server
to say that this yeah and then your
server sends notifications to our server
when you want to send push messages to
the handset so anything outside of that
flow you would have to implement
yourselves if you want to know if the
handset is online or not either I mean
the notifications will get sent to your
application regardless of whether your
application is open or not
but if the handsets not online it's very
hard for you to detect the situation
because you can't necessarily tell your
servers that the handsets not online
because it's not online it doesn't have
a connection no the only thing that we
have in our toolbox that really helps
with this is you can send the message
and when the handset comes back online
it will receive it but you can also set
the time to live for the message so you
can say this message is only valid for
the next 10 minutes and if the handset
doesn't come back online in the next 10
minutes then your message will be
discarded then try sending another one
later on but you won't know I mean it's
going to be very hard for you to tell
whether the handsets online or not
unless you're keeping an open commission
to the server and you know when that
connection starts you can assume it's
offline but we we wouldn't recommend
that because that's just going to drain
the battery of the device very quickly
Al's just posted there the GCM docks as
well
but yeah GCM you can now have up to four
kilobyte payload so you can send some
data along with the message you can
message up to at once
can you explain I would be tempted to
ignore the case that they are offline
and just send it anyway and as soon as
the phone comes online they'll receive
the notification that this bird has been
seen hopefully they're online and they
can get it at the right time to maybe go
and see the bird okay in which case what
you want to do is just use your
notifications to say that there's an
update waiting for them so even if they
receive ten we'll bundle them together
anyway but even if they receive ten all
that the application knows is that
there's some new information for them to
read and then the application goes to
your server and finds all the updates
and or there's the collapse key right
yeah absolutely so you can set a
collapse key which means and we're
weaning from the docks it's used to
collapse a group of messages so for
exactly this case when a device is
offline it'll just get the the last one
from that group but the important thing
is that all those messages would have
contained this you don't actually want
to lose any data right so if the only
data you're sending is the fact that
there has been an update yeah then you
can collapse all those just phone to hit
your servers to find out what the update
is indeed okay thank you okay thank you
very much ok let's move on to a question
from the moderator then so one of you
guys in London have a moderator Aden yes
you're organized it's just refreshing
great and you live questions while we're
waiting yeah I have one image filtering
the renderscript as I saw renderscript
was duplicated in 4.2 only the display
renderscript yeah so basically any
suggestions on how to apply filtering to
images not via renderscript rotated that
part and now your filter scripts not
deprecated really yeah I need the kind
of OpenGL drawing tool to get the actual
image processing stuff that's very alive
and kicking oh okay because I didn't
really got into it very much just
started to know yeah it's definitely
still alive yeah if you look at the
filter script it's like a subset of the
entire render script specifically aimed
at doing image processing so that's
definitely saying it's been actively
worked on okay and that should be still
alive yeah it's just updated in 4.2 I
don't know the best places to live
examples yeah I'll just posted a link on
Chapa
thanks al yeah exactly render script
compute render script examples are
always a little bit tricky right and
render script documentation yeah yeah
there was a great talk at Google i/o by
Jeff Sharkey called doing more with less
I think where he gave her a good example
of using render script 13 yeah yeah has
been their own website they also live
and oh okay
that's what started my intrigue to
looking more into it cool and
interesting it this device here the
Nexus 10 as well as the first device to
have hardware support for renderscript
built into the the GPU chip as well see
it's phenomenally fast to do that kind
of operation on this device so hopefully
coming from West's thing
cool okay let's take a question for the
moderator
one which must be in a density so Damian
Henry and mr. drew tux in Oxford says is
there a way to form an intent so that if
the app is not installed it'll go to the
Play Store so he knows about you can
advance his package managed to say is a
to this intent but he's saying he's
actually flinging the intent to sue a
Google TV yeah so is that he said we
can't do that to stage check and then
yeah this isn't an ideal way of doing it
with trying to work on something
different that will hopefully allow us
the system to basically go this isn't
installed and then either give you a
kickback that says no it's not installed
or actually just go straight to the Play
Store and say we already know what
you're trying to do so we'll go and grab
the app for you at the moment the
anymote library doesn't support that so
it's kind of a bit of an odd situation
where you can't need to just ask the
user whether it's got installed or yeah
I'm not so sure I think the best
solution that I can come up with is try
and launch the application and then try
and have some communication with it by
your own proprietary sort of solution
because when you use the anymote
protocol you can get the IP address of
the Google TV so try and connect through
it through that and then if you can't do
that because your app isn't there then
try and install it but there's not a
really nice solution for it I think
we've kind of cater towards the case of
ischium you've got both apps installed
or if you've got 180k then it kind of
simplifies things a bit but not much
so short answer there's no nice solution
at the moment but we're working on it
yeah cool
I'm gonna go back to another live
question anyone in the room or back to
the Milan office I wanted know if our
GPS model works forever better I want
know if either when I have to give our
dicas model it compute my position every
every instant or every every interval of
time order it is I use it only when I
Colin are that uses
for example when I open Google Maps at
it if the compute my pajayjays compute
my position when Google Maps is not open
GPS continually is a breathing space so
I see the answer is a it's only the GPS
is only fired up when an application
asks for the GPS provider so it's not
going to be running when an applications
in the background unless you know a
background service or something is
pulling the GPS that makes sense
okay this is for energy saving say
Sadie's because I think that time user
when when wanted to save power
turn off the GPS and one not on my app
that use the GPS a lot so I want to know
this so how do you get around it when
the GPS is switched off can you access
the course location yeah so you won't be
able to get a code GPS lock if these is
turned off the GPS setting that's
exactly right
this is why you kind of like wanna be
able to handle that case and you can use
either the the criteria object when you
are querying the location manager you
can pass it a bunch of criteria which
describe you know the kind of fix you're
looking for then the accuracy looking
for and it'll give you the best thing or
you can actually like tell it you want a
GPS provider in which case you know it's
just not gonna work for users to turned
it off so yeah the best advice is always
to kind of like you know start from the
most course fix and then get a you know
and then wait while it gets better fixes
and as always we tend to set point
people towards there's an awesome couple
of blog posts by reto meier on Android
developers book called and location best
practices where he open-source a bunch
of code which walk you through exactly
the right way to do this or a couple of
people have taken all this code and open
sourced it in a couple of library
projects so if you look at one chord and
no vacation yep there's a couple of
libraries which will kind of just do the
right thing so do exactly what you want
they'll give you that
you know they'll give you the course
location first and then they'll keep on
updating with with better and better
location updates as they get them so you
know if the user has turned off the GPS
provider you made still get you know a
pretty good fix from the course location
provider which is going to use things
like cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots to
try and make it so I think Al's put in
reto Myers blog post the link to no
vacation library sure it's busy finding
the third link as we miss you use Google
for search does that does that answer
your question
so was it am i missing the point yes yes
but if I can I ask another question
ships in capitalism if I if I go hunter
for example at enable Wi-Fi or GPS can I
turn my horn and my my module without
asking user ID apply during my manifest
but I yeah yeah there's a way to do
Wi-Fi but not for GPS but I wouldn't
advise you to just slightly turn Wi-Fi
on and off that's the kind of behavior
which users tend to not like when you're
kind of changing these system-wide
settings you know unless you explicitly
you know have a Wi-Fi toggle button I
mean in that case that's not so bad but
if you're just signing the background
changing the settings I'll probably want
to do that the advice advised you Exodus
is to you know if you look at something
like Google Maps it'll say you know
you've got Wi-Fi off for a better fix
and turn Wi-Fi on and if you click the
thing it doesn't turn Wi-Fi on right it
sends you to the Wi-Fi screen where the
user can turn it on so the user still
feels in control so yeah I wouldn't
y-you do have technically the ability
and you know given that you asked for
the right permission to turn Wi-Fi on
and off I wouldn't advise it
I would probably prompt the user and say
hey why don't you turn on Wi-Fi to
obtain a better fix
yes you can if I can add something to
his question
it's also better to ask to the user to
manually Wi-Fi because you don't know
the context in which your wife is
activating maybe he's in a car please
Oh officer so you don't know if the user
to configure the website so just fine
adapter could be not laughing okay in a
stable connection yeah and that was why
the best this is very new yes is the
same but GPS is different because you
can ask them to the people to the person
if you can bring the England to the GPS
settings and then only okay can ask
question
deceptive yeah Thanks
I have a web service that send the
unlicensed email to the user okay I
would like to know if there is any
chance to register my application she to
make possible to open the attachment in
that email automatically I mean can I
register some my me type or some
extension type to make possible from the
Gmail application for example to open
the attachment to my application in your
activity you can have an intent filter
which will activate on URLs so for
example we use it inside YouTube so all
YouTube calms when you click on the link
opens inside the YouTube application
yes feature of the recent work or when
there is a some link or some that you
are ever but not in the attachment I try
it already
yeah but you have to put a link or a URL
this is the only way that I know of is
context for a link or a URL like this
that the application will get launched
from another application but you can
also say you handle a Cernik
tenshun type rate as well yeah one yeah
yeah you say you can support the
specific mind type and then you just
make sure the yeah would it be just the
file extension that would do that we do
need to set the file yeah you can just
do the mime type yeah with them every
time like an image slash PNG is offered
it will offer up to your application to
open it and maybe you can have your own
mime types always pros flash image and
then set the mime type of this an email
you could try that yeah it can control
with both ends and yeah definitely did
if you have the email application yeah
because because I think that I think
that the future is not working on the
extensions working on the Miami type so
I must you mean that I must send it from
a the server the file with the mind of
type already dead
right I would play around with that I'm
not quite sure inside an email when you
embed an attachment you can specify the
mime type right because I create to the
finder to runtime so probably I came to
eat in my room man type I'd have a play
I think the difficulty might be if guess
what the mime type is you don't see so
another problem yeah yeah I think it
definitely feels like you should be
possible that you need to play around
with its find the exact you for that is
there any idea or any suggestions can
they ever some link some word to look
which think it's down in the right-hand
side of the chap I've put a link to
where you can find the mime type section
of a data tank the in an intent filter
and if you register for the action of
view you should be able to get your
application fired up when anyone tries
to view anything with that mind type I'm
pretty sure the email application will
try and guess the one type there so it
won't give you like a full month of
you'll be a wild card type so you'll
have like audio slash star or asterisk
and
your try and guess anyway really no and
so it's mental telephone you sending and
truant open mm-hmm right right right
already with the data part I over the
extension with the moment I try to use
all the intent filter that are there in
the documentation but Knox anxious with
the attachments engine is your
attachment
I just mean put an extension like txt
and also the same I cannot open from
sixty simple txt files I started to try
to with my own extension like L I see
all L where something like that then I
found impossible then I tried to teach
the text file but nobody to register my
application with the to open the
attachment yeah I can just do to some
link with the Mimi type etc and the
application will open it it for sure but
the attachment this is not working at
all in she have you tried using path
pattern for your extensions pattern -
yes yeah button - yes yes I have an
intent filter that is along one
kilometer now I have tied it with
asterisk is like she's like she had a
backslash for next week again okay cuz
you're in control at the other side of
it what about doing it movie URL with um
just link to user to click on some link
and W me yeah yeah that's really is a
workaround yes I was just looking if I
can open the attachment directly because
he can append parameters to a URL so you
could pass all the information you were
putting in your file in that URL exactly
yo just get delivered to your app in the
intent the launching intent you'll be
able to get the data field after
launching intent and grab the activation
code or whatever it is from that do you
mean that to store the file on somewhere
on the server and to make the the use of
downloaded
no no suggesting instead of a fire why
didn't you create a URL which includes
the activation code or whatever the
license file is and containing in the
URL itself is a parameter I've put an
example in the chat sorry I put an
example in the chat the kind of thing I
think you meaning yes so you you
basically get past that long number at
the end into your app and bloom in and
the sparkly dot Cybercom yeah that's
right
it's not working deadly a white day and
if you construct the URL oh yeah I was
thinking that is a link okay son
sorry no worries
so basically I found something on Stack
Overflow for all the intent filters and
the first link is a bit way way way more
than you need and the second one I just
posted the intent filters your email
attachments or file bar file browsers
also the link is here just second just
searching for registering my app to open
email attachments so second link the the
last link yeah thanks thank you very
much missing man you think it's the cuz
I look so exactly what we're talking
about right isn't the pattern but I
think what you missed was the view
default pattern the category default
yeah default for email and so on so give
it a try and she said being if that's
not working I
I will I will thank you very much to
yours thank you very much also thanks
well because his link was the trigger to
my search it might be worth putting the
kilometer-long intent filter on
stackoverflow somewhere as well so we
can all take forever yeah both of them
are Stack Overflow links so basically
you can check them out also post them on
the G+ page for developers yeah cool
all right then rich you saw there
because I bought a couple of the new map
few questions I know you've been playing
around with it so Shane in Wisconsin
asked with the new VT of maps is it
possible to get styled Maps like the
JavaScript API I saw there's an API for
URL tile provider we can provide your
own tiles but I don't know if you could
use that with Google's JavaScript style
Maps doing try it but I saw that you can
do a 3d map and everything on the
fragment yeah so basically we it's quick
always that we do open up the whole
whole like tile rendering architecture
so if you can supply your own tiles then
you can plug that into the Google Maps
engine and get the whole kind of like to
finger panning rotating yeah in an out
type behavior but do you know if you can
plug in like a JavaScript API
you are our API is just allow you to
create a tile provider so that when we
ask for a tile for a certain location
you can provide an overlay for that tile
only also URL tile provider so that you
can do that direct from the Internet as
well with the URL format but we don't
have the JavaScript API for their Maps
on Android he's asking can that URL for
the URL behind it be a quick Google map
is it compatible with the Google Maps
JavaScript API can you send it to us
it's a good question you should try and
link that back around I have not seen
anything in the documentation that's
just it just says that URL tile provider
is a partial implementation of tile
provider that requires a URL that points
to an image if you can somehow freak
that
so that when the it's going to call get
tile URL with a longitude latitude and
zoom level if you can translate that
into something that's using our
JavaScript API then yeah there's no
reason why it wouldn't so yeah the short
answer is we don't know but it sounds
better try it I think like rich says
just constructed you know URL which
calls it from the just get stroke Maps
provider or perhaps go to I think mano
marks holds a similar office hours to
this I know he's been quite involved
with it and with the direction of the
product so if you look for the Geo
office hours or at developers.google.com
slash life and try those guys they may
have a better idea than us cool any of
questions life should go back to you
that's a man I do have a question I just
started developing on Android like for
just over a month and my question is
very broad is there a recommended
development pattern design pattern for
Android apps for example I mean I'm used
to developing in the like the
model-view-controller pattern he
suggested pattern for Android so yeah I
mean they're all kind of set ways of
making a life a lot easier in the
Android platform so when you kind of
create your first hello world software
you'll start noticing that we create
values file select strings dimensions we
have certain ways of distributing images
so you pick the right size for the right
screen density so you kind of want to
stick with things like that as best you
can but ultimately you also get to a
point where you are capable of having
kind of the model-view-controller
structure as much as you want to put in
place but I'd strongly recommend that as
you start looking in the documentation
we talk about things like activity life
cycles fragment life cycles surfaces and
it's when icing is where you definitely
want to stick with all of those rather
than just kind of saying
know how to do this in Java because a
lot of those suggestions are for good
reasons and they are there generally to
make your life a lot lot easier I sleep
with the platform so yeah there's a it's
a very open-ended question but I'd say
that if you look at like the really
basic documentation on activities that's
a really nice place to start as well as
resources that would become of my
suggestion there's obviously the Android
Academy I'm sure there's some awesome
tutorials for that kind of stuff as well
training yeah yeah something like to me
what I'm facing is that I see activities
strongly associated with their views and
so it's like even data for example the
key value store that is offered by
Android one of the versions is attached
to the activity itself so to me it seems
as if each activities is like separate
and then like it's like you're designing
each activity by itself so that's what
I'm feeling is that the user interface
is shaping the way the app is being
designed I think we've lost London again
which is why they're not answering
I know they are they're doing a very
good job at sitting still oh look at
that they are only I'm supposed to take
over when that happens I was answering
an email
sorry what was these did someone who
knows the answer in their hangout yeah I
can take if you're rich this is done it
was yep the case that activities were
closely tied to the user interface so
you'd stick with particular layout for
each activity
Ainge user-interface l
in and out a lot more easily so if
you're looking at supporting older
devices so pre Android 3.0 so before
tablets and things like that
you can focus on using sort of an
activity with a fixed user interface but
if you want to support a more modern
look and look more up-to-date it's worth
using fragments and having a look into
fragment tutorials and look at the
Android compatibility libraries which
will provide you with those features on
earlier devices as well no problem
thanks how you guys back in London now
just about hey yeah we rejoined seems
like you've got a better internet
connection in Jordan than we do in
London
I do have a room which is seats a
thousand people all to myself though I
assume the Wi-Fi in here is pretty damn
good and a beautiful backdrop and well
that moderator maybe Chris in London
says he's playing with NFC tags and
using NFC right on the Galaxy Nexus all
works great but when opening a URL only
opera is listed as the chooser even
though I have other browsers installed
any idea why links from Gmail getting
the full browser list of things yeah I
would inspect the URL the NFC tag and
look at what format the chips and the
the URLs in because that sounds crazy
and I think there's probably the NFC tag
there yeah yeah absolutely it's
interesting the Opera seem to recognize
it but the other browsers don't
I mean you guess you could always peek
their intense they're registering in
their manifest and see what they're
looking for and see why that wouldn't
work for other people yeah we need a
little bit more information on that if
you can grab the lobes to see what
intents being fired or anything or if
you know any more details about the tag
or the mime types we could look into it
but there's not quite enough information
to figure out what's going on with
yeah any other live questions carry on
was that the NFC tag yeah I missed it
even if you only really receive NFC
intensive you register you manifest with
the intent tag found intent is it so I'm
guessing only offers actually have it
that's that manifest well you know that
the attack read is actually reading the
tag and then is going to just do a open
on the data of it okay yeah it doesn't
say that actually says he's using NFC
writer to write the NFC tag and her is
listed when he tries to open it again
well I know I have nothing special sword
and I can launch URLs straight from this
absolutely so it sounds like his mime
types a bit funky yeah what tag are you
writing not just any tag tell us a bit
more about the NFC tag you're writing
okay
one interesting question that I've not
really considered how to do before on
the Google+ post which was someone's
essentially got in their layout they've
got a view and they visit fill parent or
wrap content and they essentially when
they start going to landscape they want
to use a fixed dimension to 100 dips say
that they're putting in a dimensions
file now what they'd like to do is on a
phone just then switch back to match
parent or wrap content now I understand
how I do that in code but I never
thought how you do that by our
dimensions file anyone have any
experience to undo that mentions file to
generation could you just set it to
minus 1 or minus 2 yeah you can set it
to minus 1 or minus 2 but
yeah that's a weird one that I've not
really thought of before set in code
maybe I'm code yeah I'm code this
configuration change about an XML
so you basically must override on
configuration change on both ways even
that just extract that let that part of
layout into an include and then have
different layouts for layout land and
layout port
yeah and the include will put in the
right one yeah but basically he mentions
a phone and a tablet or just a phone no
he's talking about doing a phone and a
tablet so the way he's doing at the
moment is to have two separate layouts
whether he's doing includes or not I
don't know but I think yeah he was just
wonder if that was possible or not it
sounds a bit no yeah I do it once like a
couple of months ago did XML with minus
1 and minus 2 and it works but it's not
a good convention I think for values V
11 and put of refs XML file in there
values V 11 landscape or whatever format
your honor values we're at styles yeah
very funny you've learned Wheatley
Oakland or yeah no but you could you
could have values land and those values
folder right and have a different style
in yes and stars XML which can define
the layout width that's that's why doing
writer yeah I use fames the styles yeah
yeah so you keep working on photo pnau
Facebooker doing the same thing I don't
know probably not its twenties for me
mana spokes it's probably feet you can
play you're done there's not and you
cannot want to put to it so I'm going to
just be there so yeah I mean it was only
supposed to be submit I wanted a feature
I wanted so it's just I did notice that
they're version that only sinks when you
open the app right
than just anytime you take a photo which
is interesting does it I don't know I
mean looks at it I just read the veg
story okay it's meant for backup though
isn't it they don't stop upload it's
more for backup photos that's what
they're trying to push that reminds me
as well one other potential solution to
giuseppe's problem which doesn't work
very well was just a monitor the
Bluetooth files directory for whenever a
Bluetooth file is dropped in their place
we'll be doing something similar by
monitoring the images directory it's
what suddenly triggered it in my mind
and now the Bluetooth files directory is
slightly different on different handsets
but it's always under the SD card you
can get external directory and our
Bluetooth to it so giuseppe potentially
could just look for new files appearing
in the bluetooth files directory and
then process them to realize you got
your service hmm yeah yeah it's one of
those broadcast receivers that needs a
service like I can't be registered
dynamically that's a shame okay screw
that okay left but an interesting
questions come free on the G+ read where
Kathleen asks can we configure a sync
adapter to sync only on Wi-Fi don't
Dennis before yeah you can just check
your telephony manager that's one
approach right so when the sync kicks in
right just check is Wi-Fi on and only
continue I'll just kill yourself up to
be
next time you cancel Wi-Fi just starting
yeah basically but you have also a
setting on just second is resetting on
sync adapter that one yeah just and
that's whether I want to check it's
finally the guys in London come five
o'clock they just leave that's really
rude Noga hello to two minutes left now
do you just punch a clock and run away
on your own rich am i sorry you are
still on your own or if we lured anyone
in to join you
ah there's like a technician who keeps
changing the lights the problem is their
system so there's people
you
i digging through the android developer
documentation right he knows like he's
digging through his own mind I know I
had another approach for dealing without
checking his wife I not on or so I was
gonna say when you register a broadcast
receiver for the Wi-Fi state change and
you know when it gets turned off then
you use package manager to turn off your
sync adapter and when Wi-Fi goes on you
reenable it because that way you're not
having to wake up up Wi-Fi off go back
to sleep and consume resources yeah sure
even the amount of time Wi-Fi goes on
love is it worth it how often you sync
your sync to me so I mean that will stun
are basically the system sends all the
adapters the broadcast cuz if one sync
adapter that's what widow also had a
demo about how to use the broadband and
connectivity in more efficient way on 3G
and stuff so basically when the yeah
yeah you you you basically you smooch on
different adapters sync no yeah on that
bombshell we're unfortunately out of
time so thank you everyone for joining
us nice to see some new faces in them
the Milan office as well thank you guys
very much for joining us I hope you some
of your questions join us again at the
same time next week
also check out snow the O show so we're
gonna have the app clinic going out on
Friday more designing action coming at
you on next Tuesday as well fully and
fully packed schedule at
developers.google.com/live slash Android
and so thanks again and see you soon
