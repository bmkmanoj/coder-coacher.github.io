that Android adheres to is that it's a
multitasking operating system users can
have multiple apps running and can
quickly swap between them as needed my
name is Colt McAnlis and in order to
make sure that your app is performing
well regardless of what the other apps
are doing on the device it takes a bit
of prep work and a few handy api's at
its core this has everything to do with
the tragedy of the Commons
specifically apps will act in the
interest of their specific situation
without consideration for the larger
environment now by themselves this isn't
necessarily a big problem but remember
that each running app is taking up a
small piece of the device's limited
resources and when those overall
resources start running out the user
experience suffers each running
application has a set of resources that
are resident in the device's memory for
example it's state information graphics
resources and for the most part all of
its allocated heap objects stick around
in memory even when the application is
in the background over time the device
will as expected run out of available
memory since it's being taken up by
other apps and will need to kill an
existing app in order to free up memory
for the active application remember that
the whole reason we keep background
application in memory is so that
switching to a background app between a
foreground app is a pretty fast process
but this doesn't apply for killed
background app so if your app is killed
and the user comes back to it then we
got to start from scratch
meaning relaunching the app is though it
had never been loaded into memory in the
first place which of course is a much
slower operation than just swapping to
it from the background but the good news
is that your app doesn't have to be
killed instead when memory gets tight
your app can offer up some of its
allocated space back to the system in
order to avoid the pain of being
terminated to facilitate this ritual
sacrifice of memory transfer android
offers a set of callbacks that will be
issued to your app that you need to
respond to but first let's talk about
what things happen when they go horribly
wrong once all of the other background
applications have been killed in order
to save memory the active application
will get an on low memory callback which
signals that things have gone horrible
and then it should immediately release
any in memory resources to help
stabilize the system if you have things
in memory that aren't needed right now
this is the point in which you need to
free them but sadly this callback only
happens after all the background apps
have been killed it would really be
if instead of simply killing those
background applications they were
allowed to collectively release some
memory back to the system which would
help move everything along but also keep
them from being killed off this is the
exact reason why beyond trim memory
callback was provided with the release
of Ice Cream Sandwich this callback is
issued to all running applications and
gives them the ability to release memory
rather than being killed this is
facilitated by an integer value that's
provided to the callback the trim level
that's given to you is the value between
0 and 100 but there are also a handful
of values that are defined which you can
check again
for example the trim memory moderate
value means that the device is beginning
to run low on memory and it's a great
time for your app to start evicting
things like your bitmap thumbnail cache
while the trim memory background flag
means that some background applications
are starting to be killed and that your
app has recently transitioned to being a
background app this is a great time to
start freeing up memory that won't be
critical if the user comes back to your
app really quick oh and if you're
comparing against these values you might
want to make sure to use a greater than
equal comparison though just in case we
add new defined values in the future and
the best part is that in order to help
you free up memory from every corner of
your app this callback can be overridden
on activity fragment service content
provider and application classes but in
order to produce the best user
experience your app shouldn't just be
reactive to type memory situations but
also proactive depending on the device
the activity manager is low RAM device
API that was added in KitKat can be used
to help detect if your application is
running on a device with low memory
currently a return value of true
typically indicates memory of 512
megabytes or less this condition should
be used by applications that help decide
what features to maybe enable or disable
depending on whether or not it's going
to be a good user experience for these
low memory devices of course playing
nice with the rest of the system is just
the tip of the iceberg
which is why you need to check out the
rest of the Android performance patterns

Google+ community for other great tips
from other great developers so keep calm
profile your code and always remember
perf matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
