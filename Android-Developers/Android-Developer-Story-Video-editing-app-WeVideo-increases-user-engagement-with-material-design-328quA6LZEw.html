making digital storytelling and video
creation accessible to anyone anywhere
when we for certain Android we clearly
saw that there wasn't a compelling
application for video creation combine
that with the ask for the mandroid
platforms we decided to go Android first
since then majority of our investment in
smartphone development has been a what
separates us from other applications on
Android is that we key leave a full
capability of the device in our
application you are able to take
different clips trim them and we were
able to do that because the Android
platform gave us access to the OpenGL
layer which allowed us to real-time
rendering and previewing since the
launch of a new application mobile
monetization is done very well for us
driving on Android has doubled every two
minutes almost 85% of our users are
enamored with launched a material design
we decided to redo the application and
redo the user experience and take it up
to the next level many of the material
design concept really resonated with us
we were really able to create the device
to experience our users and as a result
we saw 100% increase in user engagement
being able to reply to reviews is a
great feature
every day we go through every single
review and analyze the data that's
coming in and most importantly if
somebody who's having a problem we can
help right away and the session games
feeling when you can see someone who
gave you one star reviews and version
that 4/5 stars
we love running experiments on the Play
Store for example just recently we have
dated our screenshots with with the
colors the text and we saw increase in
conversion up to 50%
making it available in different
languages is critical for you to succeed
in global market we saw increase in our
installs up to 200% in some regions
after localized our app and deploy store
description recently revisit our
purchasing flow in the app we wanted to
see if we can convert more people to buy
our linear products we decided to change
colors of the background concise way out
of the elements we were able to deploy
quickly in terrain just within a few
days and we sort of increase up to 60%
in conversion rate the Android platform
has been a great platform for us to
iterate through our application with a
fast app publishing process Play Store
listing experiments feedback from users
and monetization using Google Wallet
this is led to a tremendous increase and
success with installed and ready
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
