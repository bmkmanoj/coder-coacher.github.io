product lead for the Google cast SDK and
the cast integrations with OEM TV
partners I'm joined here by Sasha my
name is Sasha Buda I'm heading up the
Android TV team and this is not my
twitter handle so whoever you message
please be nice also who of you is
actually here for the session and who is
here because this is a room with shade
and quite cool ok no hands go up who is
here for free devices ok very good there
are no free devices so we're talking
with you a little bit about the living
room today and Adam will talk about cost
I will talk a little later about anyway
TV so heading over to AB great so we're
gonna talk about building integrated
experiences for the living room and for
many of you you may not think this the
stakes are that high but let me take you
through a scenario that you've probably
experienced millions of people will go
home tonight or tomorrow and turn on the
TV and if they're unlucky very unlucky
they might end up watching 5 to 7
episodes reruns a possibly the worst
reality TV show there is and what's
scary about that is that you probably
have an idea of the show you think I'm
talking about or you have three to four
candidates in mind we're talking today
about an experience that should be much
easier for consumers than turning on and
struggling to find something we're
talking today about our vision for the
living room which is unified by Google
cast Google cast is a technology that
connects the mobile phones that billions
of people have with entertainment
devices whether they're extender devices
like chromecast or integrated devices
like Android TV or will soon talk about
cast TV what this does is it brings
entertainment from the smallest screens
that you have on to the most beautiful
displays in your home and sound to the
best speakers that you have more
specifically if this wasn't a bit
confusing for some folks Google cast is
about the mobile experience and taking
mobile apps and extending the content to
larger screens or larger speakers so
focus in on that if you're a mobile
developer Android TV is about taking the
full power of Android and realizing it
in a TV form factor controlled by a
d-pad remote Sasha will take you through
a lot of that in the Android and updates
in a few minutes the goal cast
experience for those of you haven't seen
it is unified by the idea of a cast
button which takes the apps that you
already know and love and adds this
extension to a large screen so if you
press this button it takes the video
onto the screen or if you press this
button it takes the music into your
speakers and millions of people love
this what's amazing about this too is
that we've enabled thousands of apps and
if you want to see which apps we've been
able to go to g-code cast apps and these
are the same apps that users download
and use on their mobile devices with
cast added so there's nothing else for
the user to do on the app side for
everybody in this room that's probably
enough that you could probably figure
out how to make all this experience work
great but there's a lot of people who
aren't at i/o or in different places
that look at streaming is still being
too far away they look at it as an HDMI
port connection and saying I don't want
to plug hardware into my device or they
look at an experience of input switching
and say this is a recipe for disaster
because before I push the input button
everything's working and when I push the
input button something else happens and
I probably have a one in four chance of
getting it wrong because I have four
inputs on my TV so we took this message
to heart and worked with the team at
Vizio to launch the first TV with cast
built in and in particular this is one
of them it's a beautiful piece series
display and it has 4k casting as well as
Dolby vision casting and that's the
first integrated device to do this and
it's gorgeous and we get to see them out
in the sandbox as well and what we did
is we made it possible for that same SDK
that developers use that cast to enable
the TV to switch to cast so as soon as
you push the cast button instead of
having to hope that you're on the right
put it's just a seamless experience for
the consumer and Vizio has brought this
technology into their TVs as well as
their speakers and sound whores so today
we're also proud to announce the Google
cast for TV program extending this
capability to Toshiba Philips Magnavox
and Polaroid to take this technology to
millions more consumers
what's amazing for the developer
community is that you can now reach
millions of endpoints not just on
chromecast not just on Android TV but in
a class of device that integrates cast
purely just cast and what's amazing
about this is that it's that same cast
button that I talked about in the first
experience and many of these devices if
not all will also have another feature
which is the idea that they can wake on
cast where if you press that cast button
the TV wakes up without the user having
to do anything so instead of having to
find the remote control turn on the TV
hope to get to the right input your one
cast button away from the content that
you love so that's the consumer journey
and enabling more eyeballs for the
developer community but we also are
proud to announce today is the new
Google cast SDK and this is our first
major update in a few years and it's
based on a lot of the feedback that
we've gotten about how cast works and
one of the things that you may think is
you know I've explained this very simple
UX model where you hit a cast button and
video goes from a small little device to
a big device there's a lot of edge cases
and corner cases and things to think
about for the developer in that
experience and historically honestly our
sdk made you think about a lot of those
things what we're looking at in our new
sdk that will come out in the next few
weeks is us taking the burden on
implementing every single one of the
cast UX guidelines which are these
corner cases and manage these best
practices additionally we think we can
really reduce development time by not
only offering that but also offering the
right abstraction between what you're
developing and what the cast SDK
provides I'll take you through that a
little bit
for way more detail on all of this come
to our talk at 9 a.m. on Friday and if
you don't get up for 9 a.m. s on Fridays
that talk will also be recorded so the
cast life cycle to go into a little bit
if you don't come on Friday is about
four major steps three of which are done
almost all the time and one's kind of
optional
the first one is discovering trying to
figure out do I have a TV do I have a
chromecast do I have an Android TV on my
network and that's trying to figure out
again how to discover devices the next
step is actually connecting to it
launching the what's called a receiver
app the third step is then controlling
because in the cast model all video and
all streaming is going directly from the
cloud to the device and you send small
messages back and forth what this
historically has been is kind of tricky
because if it all goes well great but if
not there's all this also complexity and
reconnect where if you lose Wi-Fi if the
user leaves and comes back
or you change different Wi-Fi networks
some of these steps get actually pretty
complex for the the end user experience
we also made it complex for the
developer we made you become aware of
every single one of the steps of this
process so our life cycle became your
app life cycle and at first it's pretty
simple and you may have adopted the cast
SDK and copied some boilerplate code
into your apps and the first time you do
that it's it's actually pretty
straightforward but if we make any
changes or any updates this became very
very tough for you to manage both from
where do I make the changes and then
also where the externalities in making
every single one of those choices so
what we've done in this new SDK is
implemented a much better abstraction
where cast handles both the state
transitions as well as provides default
UX for this very unique type of
interaction model between a phone and a
larger device more specifically we're
offering two major areas again state
management and user experience in state
management you'll now find something
called the cast context which is a
singleton that manages all phases of
state
discovery all the way through connection
and launching of the receiver app we
also offer an optional reconnection
service for those of you who don't want
to deal with trying to figure out if
there's a still a chromecast or still a
cast TV on the network and this is
optional because some people have
innovated quite a bit in this space
already so you can choose to use it or
not on the UX side we now provide as
soon as the user hits the Kasbah and all
of the different steps of cast beyond
that press so that you don't have to
worry about callbacks and trying to
figure out what's the state of whether
users gone in or backed out of that flow
we've also for optional use added what
we call an expanded controller and a
mini controller which are part of our UX
guidelines alongside our philosophy of
saying if it's in our UX guidelines our
SDK should provide it and we'll see that
in the next few slides so the new cast
button and you seeing Android and iOS
the new cast button is fully provided by
the SDK and in Friday's talk we'll
actually go through adding the cast
button and getting all the way through
casting media the SDK fully now supports
drawing and managing all routes
including the top level of knowing what
to do with the background and then the
next level and B of actually describing
what actually the users about to take
see choosing essentially a particular
device and D saying well maybe
something's already going on on that
device
you don't have to worry about any of
those states at all you essentially have
a factory method to say what color
should the cast button be and you're
done the next part that we've done is
we've created again these customizable
controllers so at the bottom of the
screen you'll see a mini controller
which is a persistent play pause button
but you can actually customize which
button is most useful for your app so
that this allows the user to always be
in control of the streaming experience
so if you're a live app or you're a
music app and you really care about skip
forward or a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down
or a heart or star and that's the most
important button for your application
you can put that in the mini controller
we also offer an optional expanded
controller which takes the best
practices of a full-screen control and
allows you similarly
to control the buttons that are present
again both of these screens are optional
and in both Android and iOS we can wire
our state transitions to your
controllers if you've already invested a
significant amount of time in figuring
out the best ux model for your users
across the board and I'll use Android as
the example we also provide the mini
controller the expanding controller and
lock screen controls and these lock
screen controls also work with Android
wear so if you're just literally a couch
potato and can't even pick up the remote
you can hit play and pause on your watch
for those there's last one screen is for
those of you who are trying to introduce
the fact that cast is now in your app or
have recently changed where cast is
slightly located or aspects of that we
offer Android compliant notification
that says wear cast is and at first you
might think this is pretty self-serving
for the cast team to say cast more we
would only do this though if it actually
benefited the developer community and
what we found is in the apps that we've
tested this concept with it drives
longer session times as well as longer
adherence to the app itself so we offer
this as an optional behavior pattern
that you can call for both Android and
iOS in terms of
in terms of timing we're gonna be
launching this over the next few weeks
the apps that you see are full demo apps
where you're going to be able to dive
into the code itself so by about
mid-june you'll see the core SDK and the
middle of the summer you'll have access
to the fully customizable controllers
we're launching iOS and Android first
and we'll add and layer in the
capabilities for the web sender as well
as a new web receiver that's compatible
with all of this so with that all of
this is enabled by the cast out and I'll
shift to here what's great about the
cast app
is that not only can you discover
content you can control all of your
devices and you can see I have a caste
TV I also have a chromecast and the
first device that showed up was the
Nexus player an Android TV and to talk
much more about Android I'll turn it
over to Sasha thank you so now talking a
little bit about Android TV I think this
show is how Google sees the living room
has one big ecosystem right we we bring
in other platforms into the cast echo
system we are actually making sure that
Android TV is a prime cast endpoint
we're actually spending a lot of time
making sure it really is so one of the
things Adam already touched touched on
is with cast being a very mobile mobile
centric approach on getting the consumer
to the content on the TV with Android TV
traditionally being being more of a
remote control driven like a Leanback
experience you sit back on the couch you
just grab the remote control from the
table and start playing content but also
with cast built-in we see that often
times in families for example that the
kids like to just cast the content from
their iPad or their Android phone to the
Android TV device while the parents
might like to use the remote control and
so the nice thing about a no TV is
combining the different approaches to
interact with the TV and also giving
give us developers the power to create
rich new first screen experiences on
that TV device and one thing I like to
highlight and I won't spend too much
time on these marketing East slides but
one thing I really like to highlight is
energy TV is not something for TV builds
on the outside of Android and voted on
top it really is extending the Android
core framework to make TV a first-class
citizen that is important right because
that only that way you as a developer
have the guarantee
that Android API will always be there
for you and serve TV content always so
your app is not being broken by an
Android update no you with every new
Android version you actually got new
features for the people who saw this
slot on the schedule and thought I need
to get out of the Sun so I will sit down
here or they were speculating on free
devices just a super quick summary what
is Android TV actually so it's really a
TV platform like Android has always been
a platform for mobile Android TV is the
platform for TV devices which you can
interact with as a developer with all
the standard tools you know from
developing for Android on mobile same
SDKs the same developer tools and you
can enable a bunch of different device
classes on Android TV a smart TV so
obviously with Android TV right built in
we see a lot of success internationally
with paid TV set-top boxes so cable or
satellite or IPTV providers bringing
their set-top box to you running Android
TV and so you basically can get your
apps on there but you also have all your
cable or satellite channel content and
also the other category are of course
streaming devices game consoles things
like the Nvidia shield for example in
the market right now these are then also
great devices where consumers have apps
games available to them and it's all in
on the same platform so talking a little
bit what happened in the last year also
with and with Android TV we are actually
the ecosystem is growing we have more
and more partners coming to Android TV
and I think it's a very good story to
see partners who actually already
launched in the first year on Android TV
now recommitting new and actually
extending their lineup of android TV
models for this year so talking about
Sony Sharp Phillips actually bringing
you new models to the market but also
it's great to see new arrivals like
and especially in new regions like TCL
vostell RCA or Baker launching devices
on Android TV over the coming weeks and
months and we also are quite happy to
welcome another new partner on the
Android TV platform you see that orange
logo there on the right we are actually
really excited to announce that a new
partner for Android TV is Xiaomi with
bringing their first Android device in
the US on Android TV so show me will
soon be launching the me box here in the
US and it's a first Android TV product
and it's a very powerful device it's 4k
capable HDR capable you get you get all
the high quality content from 4k HDR
enabled content from YouTube Netflix and
so on it has all these capabilities
comes with a nice sleek remote control
that is voice enabled it bluetooth
remote control and yeah they also they
will also ship as an assess obstinacy
astoria gamepad so you can enjoy Android
TV games on your Mii box device if you
want to find out more about this
starting tomorrow at 12:30 we have some
people from Xiaomi over here so it's
starting at 12:30 tomorrow Hugo Barra
from Xiaomi will be in the Android TV
sandbox over there and you can try out
the device in the Android TV sandbox
play around with it Hugo will talk about
the device you might have to take a
selfie with him if you want to see the
device but that's up to you moving on
from devices and talking a little bit
more about content because let's face it
in the end on the TV device you want to
have content we are really happy how the
Play Store on Android TV has grown over
the last year we have we have lots and
lots of new of new apps and content the
games on the platform and over the
coming weeks we actually see a
new arrival so we're really happy to get
ESPN with a native app on Android TV
we have additions like CNN MTV Disney
Comedy Central crunchyroll that will all
launch the apps on Android TV over the
coming weeks or actually some of them
even this week also more international
content was a very important focus for
us so it's we're really happy that for
example Spotify is launching the app on
Android TV
we have Deezer and so on so really the
ecosystem is really growing also on the
content side and we're really happy
about that
so you already heard from rock star Dave
this morning a little bit about what's
new with Android n and he showed already
one new feature in the keynote but I
want to spend some time talk about what
are the new TV related features in
Android n so a big aspect for us was
when looking at Android and especially
from a consumer perspective was we
thought it was a little bit too easy on
Android TV to get disconnected from your
content so if you're watching something
if and you have the video fullscreen if
you just wanted to look up something
maybe look up for some other content or
look up what other recommendations you
might have you get immediately you got
immediately disconnect from content and
especially if you are a little bit of a
power user and you're jumping very
frequently between different kinds of
content apps for example live TV and
Netflix or in between YouTube and Hulu
it was the system didn't handle that too
well so one of the things we did was
actually introducing reasons as you know
it from mobile also in a very remote
control friendly way so to see how that
looks like let's take a look at the
video so you know the typical Android TV
Leanback interface with easy to to store
content and if you are jumping a lot
between different apps so you're looking
for a YouTube snippet here and then
jumping back to live TV looking for apps
reasons allow you to bring up all your
apps you have recently used scroll that
easy we
remote control if you don't like
something in there you can also just
quickly dismiss it and then jump to the
to the app where you actually wanted to
watch the content so it's very easy we
spend a lot of time thinking about
what's the right interaction model if
you just have a remote control right you
don't want any special buttons you don't
want anything that is very complicated
to use and so we think we we got with a
we got to a good solution here and it
will be available in every Android TV
and device another topic also very much
related to what I said earlier about
losing contact with with the content or
actually for you as an app developer
content provider losing contact to the
user the moment he he or she decides
they wanna they want to look up
something one of the things we wanted to
invest in was also having multiple
content sources at the same time visible
on the screen so I have a picture in
picture mode that where you can actually
while you're browsing for new content
they'll be connected to what what you're
watching so to see how that looks like
let's start this video
that's great so we exported all our VIP
or demos into videos because demos
always fail
yeah next year the YouTube offline mode
okay so as an example you're watching
live TV if if it you hear something
that's interesting for you for example
in this it's a report about a game that
was that was just released on Android
you think oh that's that's interesting
why don't I see if I can find that and
you bring up search you search with your
with the boy search for pac-man and you
see oh actually I can install that and
play that on my android TV device but
all the time content is still ongoing
you're not disconnected from what you're
watching and we think that's a very
important experience especially with
more and more content coming to the
platform and be available to you so what
we allowed you as a developer to do is
do basically an able picture and picture
in for your application
you can basically pin the video in in a
specific section you can add a special
button to the media controls in the
control bar if you choose to do so
which can easily switch to pip mode for
devices that do not have a dedicated
picture and picture button there are a
bunch of devices like smart TVs that
already have a picture-in-picture button
but we wanted to design an interface
that with every d-pad remote control you
can enable this experience and you can
really easy an able picture in picture
mode for your app by basically just
adding this capability to the your app
manifest there's an activity on picture
picture mode change
you basically just implement that and
you're good to go
also one thing that we have driven from
the beginning is traditional TV
functionality I know we all like apps
and we liked roulette games and like to
have as many apps possible on your TV
but still a lot of content a lot of
content consumption in the house is
traditional TV so from the beginning
Android TV since Android L implemented
something called the TV input framework
which handles things like HDMI input
switching like physical cable tuner
control and also apps can expose
channels via this interface and in L it
was just simple channel switching
channel metadata a program guide we
extended that an N word M with adding
time shift capabilities so if you bring
your content into a live channel you can
take advantage of time shifting now
Android and we are also adding recording
capabilities so you as a content
provider with your channel input can
actually offer easy recording
capabilities and expose those to the
user like you know it from any DVR so to
see how that looks like we take a look
at this video and here so this is like
free-to-air antenna this is like some
device with an antenna tuner you bring
up the guide you know that by the way
this is engineering UX I had to fight a
lot of fights to actually show this and
fighting fights mean I didn't ask or a
UX person so this is not the final
version that will launch but we will
provide an update to the live channels
app in the Play Store and you can see
all the standard things like recording
management schedule management you can
delete recordings you can you can
schedule recordings just as you know it
from any traditional DVR and as a
content provider you can choose to opt
in and provide this this experience this
here is an example of how also sub
features like fast forward rewind
obviously work we have plug-ins for that
in our
Media controls and so very
straightforward and you can try it out
as part of the Android SDK preview hour
as already mentioned we we provide a
standard set of features get a schedule
start stop recording list your
recordings including metadata it can be
managed through TV app we Google we
provide one TV app which is on for
example on like Nvidia shield Nexus
player and so on which is the live
channels app some TV OEMs provide their
own implementation but they all support
the TV input framework and you can
basically as a developer if you want to
bring content into live channels that
you want to make recordable you can add
this by implementing the new recording
session class it's described as part of
the end developer preview SDK
documentation also one of the things we
will demo it with is we will soon
provide support for external USB tuner
as an open source sample you can
basically plug a USB tuner an antenna
tuner in to your Nexus player for
example you get the end you get the
content right to your next player and
you can play around with recording and
all these the three management I just I
just mentioned we will provide that as
an open source sample as part of the
live channels app
another really important topic for us
for Android n was supporting HDR or high
dynamic range properly so as you know
with all the UHD new UHD TVs HDR became
a big topic
it really makes gives you the ability or
give describes the ability to display a
wider range of colors and in the right
natural color schemes and so one of the
one of the problems we saw is that there
are a lot of different HDR standards out
there so you have you have HDR 10 you
have to all be vision you have hybrid
lock gamma and all these and as a
consumer both of the consumer and a
content provider it's confusing right
because how do I know which I have to
support which standard I have to support
if I have a Content app and want to play
out beautiful 4k content with H
formatted in HDR which of the standards
do I use how do I even know what the
device supports so in Android n we are
adding new api's to support HDR and we
addressing to two cases one is the case
for device manufacturers so they can
actually probably plumb up their HDR
decoder in the system and signal to the
system and say hey I support these HD
these high dynamic high dynamic range
standards and as an application
developer for example a content provider
for example Netflix they can query the
system and see okay these are the
standards that this device supports and
then make the choice which stream to
deliver and that could be everything
from the standard like the HDR streams
they have for this device or they can
make the call well this device actually
does not support an HDR standard that I
need so I'm just delivering a plain 4k
4k stream we added to get get HDR
capabilities API it so that apps can
actually query for the capabilities of
this device some important things to
note here the decoder capabilities will
also be exposed to that and we have some
requirements around that HDR 10
yhe bc decoder to support HDR 10 main
ten dolby vision requires a special a
TVC decoder and hybrid log gamma
requires vp9 profile 2 by the way this
is the this is the profile that YouTube
announced earlier this year they will
support HDR in another important topic
especially at i/o for developers is the
is the Leanback library right Leanback
libraries our tool set to enable app
development very very easily on android
TV so if you already are used to Android
development on mobile on tablet on any
form factor we give you with a lean buy
lean back support library we give you
tools head to very easily bring your app
from mobile to the big screen and over
the last year we saw lots of developers
use our tool set and we got a lot of
feedback so there are certain things
that they were missing there were
certain use cases we actually initially
didn't envision and we for once listened
and we we are providing an update to the
Leanback library very soon it's around
the end timeframe and we adding for
example support for custom fragments in
the Browse fragment the Browse fragment
is one of these things that basically
allows you to to display multiple lists
of contents in your app very easily but
we had a very strict approach to that we
had basically one thought and how this
should look like and we got lots of
feedback that yeah the browsing itself
would be nice but in my app I would like
to have it a little bit different I
would like to have a different metadata
I'd like to have a different order and
by building a custom fragment into the
Browse fragment that will help you a lot
without reinventing the wheel we also
improved the media player a lot to
support custom actions media details and
media actions specifically that allows
if you have a very content heavy app
that wants to display a lot of the the
content metadata and interact with that
during playback that will help you
and also we make branding easier so a
lot of a lot of the feedback was if you
if you are actually using the Leanback
library as a standard to build your app
it was a little bit hard to get your own
brand in there again make your app a
little bit different from the other apps
and we did a bunch of work to allow you
to brand it easily without reinventing
everything and build and build
everything yourself again for this this
is only a super high level teaser on
what's going on here there's a session
this week and we're listening those
sessions later that goes really really
deep into the Leanback library
inner-workings so if you're a developer
wanting to develop for Android TV that's
a great session to attend three of our
developers will go through a bunch of
use cases and explain a bunch of these
news and how the Leanback library
actually works underneath on android TV
so after all these news new things how
can you actually interact with that SEO
as you heard in the keynote the Android
n Developer Preview is already available
so you can download that already and you
should get started with that all the
Android TV features are included as part
of the standard Android SDK there's
nothing special for TV it is just
Android so if you download the Android n
Developer Preview SDK the Leanback
library will be included all the new TV
features will be included and we also
updated the documentation and some of
the sample apps as part of that also we
got a bunch of feedback on the emulator
for TV it having horrible performance
which was valid feedback because it
indeed had very horrible performance we
updated that quite a bit we think it's
much better now it's actually usable as
a Fredi standard development tool you
don't necessarily have to use the
hardware anymore
and also for those of you who have an
excess player you can sign up or
download for the Android and develop a
preview image
you can flat you can download the image
and flash or you can sign up for an
online Oh TA directly to the device and
one important thing we have a bunch of
sessions that go into a lot more detail
than this overview session so if you are
interested especially if you if you're
working on media streaming apps join the
exoplayer session both valid from mobile
and TV today we have office hours with
living room both cast Android TV
tomorrow at 10:00 and the at 3:00 p.m.
the talk and I just mentioned deep dive
into the Leanback support library at
9:00 I think it's your talked into going
even and introducing the new cast SDK J
and I will talk at 11:00 on Friday about
bringing live content to Android TV also
much more detailed than this session and
at 2:00 p.m. on Friday is a great
session if you have a mobile app and are
wondering how to bring that to TV how
does that transition actually work what
are best practices what is the easiest
way so that's a good session to attend
then we also have our support community
developer communities you see the links
here but I think with that I think we
should open for questions I think we
have microphones somewhere if there are
any questions I think there should be on
the sides I think I see one there and
one right here so if you have a question
come up ask your question if not I'm
totally cool with that and just so you
know our sandbox is literally about 100
yards that way and we'll be there for
good chunks of today tomorrow and Friday
yeah hey
I have a question can you hear me yeah
actually you always talked about living
from about Google cache Thanks on
DirecTV I work for education technology
actually and I'm wondering about
streaming interactive content to the
smart boards in the classroom video even
supports other formats and video and
audio for testing I can answer so in
tricking folks who are leaving just be a
little quieter for one second
the main aspect of interaction or a
classroom aspect could be served in a
couple different ways if you have a
mobile app that wants to display
something on the big screen like video
content or voting from different
students in a class the cast model is
really powerful for that so you could
and we could follow up or join the
discussion on Friday and we can talk a
little bit more about that I'm talking
about custom content for example html5
or flash so currently on cast we support
effectively an html5 player and a couple
different media formats I'm happy to
speak with you afterwards and go into
much more detail on that
I'll join you right outside the the Play
Store on Android TV is kind of lame and
I'm wondering if they're like my app is
buried at the very bottom and there's
really no way for people to to get it
because you just have to keep scrolling
to the right and nobody's gonna go
beyond you know three or four let's say
five apps down the list because I guess
you're using the Leanback library for
the Play Store as well so is there gonna
be any improvement to that so that my
app can get discovered I mean it now
with the Play Store filling more up with
more and more apps it's a little bit
it's the same it's the same way as
mobile a little bit right you can't
expect with millions
of app to it we have every app being on
the front page no one scrolls through
million religion of app so we are
focusing more on bringing categories
more up and doing more doing some one
word about featuring app and also
improving search but it is now a pure
scrolling model with thousands of apps
being in the store becomes less and less
of a model what we are trying to do is
very soon come up with a new model
around categories so that drilling in
into different types of apps for the
user will be easier
so discovery by browsing categories
depending on what they are looking for
well it will be a little bit easier cool
is there a way to like feature apps that
are not Netflix and like all the big
guys and like I'd be curated a bit and
try and get the little guys a little bit
up there so we are we are actually we
have guidelines if you look on another
common stash TV we have guidelines for
example UX guidelines to be even
considered for for highlighting then
again it depends in what region your app
is available what content is there what
competitions you have we can always only
merchandise or like highlight a very low
number of apps right so we are really
investing more into like category
navigation bringing and disk up more
discovery options on on the energy be
play store and search cool things cool
