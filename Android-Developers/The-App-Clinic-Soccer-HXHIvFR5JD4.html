Neil Lewis we'll be looking at football
apps and taking a deep dive into low
latency high efficiency data transfers
all in 30 minutes in this week's app
clinic the most controversial aspect of
this week's app clinic is the name
football soccer either way we're talking
about the world game that is the
otherworld game that isn't baseball
American football or cricket which
actually I think is probably you know
more worldly well certainly more worldly
than any of the examples you can I just
want to I just want to make sure that we
understand that rato wrote the script
for this and when I hear football I'm
still thinking yeah when he when he he
is football he thinks throwing a bowl
exactly we're talking about a
rectangular pitch to 45 minute halves
and no hands except the hand of God
really is that what they say when
they're doing soccer so I say what I'm
doing socket nice all right to help us
out this week we have a new bug droid
mascot the extremely exclusive uncanny
reto meier doppelganger I had to uh do
things to get this little guy things
that I'm not comfortable talking about
but don't let that take away from
enjoying the addition of our newest and
most productive team member he just sits
there
yeah it's he's not making us go
backwards and that my friend is forward
progress now all we need to do is find a
bug droid that's an uncanny resemblance
to me and we can put our early
retirement plans into action
excellent so this week we're talking
football or soccer the only thing more
fun than playing is watching and the
only thing more exciting than a game is
tracking all the games and that's what
this week's apps are all about why
didn't we do this with beer is that
thing do you have beer with I think
that's a sporting thing right a beer
goes together like sport and beer huh
all I had today was a mountain Dew well
so here's a few of things that we looked
at with each app any sports tracking app
is going to live or diet based on the
depth and breadth of their coverage if
there's a team player or country that
you want to follow and it isn't
in the app you're going to find another
one that does include it so that breath
needs to be matched by depth for every
league I let's say I'm a fan I want to
be able to track all the games in the
ladder and each player and there's
statistics all the way down to live
commentary maybe some clips of fantastic
plays if your sport has them and any
other information that's going to make
my enjoyment of the game more intense
and all that surface area means that
navigation can become really important
as does the use of things like
notifications and getting regular
updates so it's really easy to get lost
if you start pivoting around teams and
players and data and statistics so you
really need to be able to easily
navigate around and find your way back
out once you've dug in as far as it can
be exactly and that's especially
important with this work you know I have
to admit I think there are more soccer
teams in this world and then grains of
sand on all the oceans throughout time
but it applies to a lot of other things
too and it so even if you're not into
sport I think that the things we'll be
talking about today apply to anything
where there's a large catalogue of data
that can be viewed in many different
ways and where you're likely to only be
interested in a few pieces per user
but each user has their own favorite
piece that they really want to get to
and would be pissed off if they couldn't
get to it quickly absolutely it's
similarly with teams participating in
lots of differently used to playing
several games a week getting updates
from all of these apps when a game
starts or when your team scores is
really important but you've got to make
sure that this doesn't come at the price
of decreased battery life
so today's fixture includes three apps
wait you wrote this and then it says
stays fixture what is a fixture fixture
a fixture is a schedule in the context
of support really ok today learning it's
German every day on the app clinic right
so today's first down includes three
hackers thought mob gameplan and spory
we'll take a look at each then I'll
spend the last 10 or 15
it's diving deep into how these apps can
ensure that you get your updates quickly
but without draining your battery yeah
so let's get started with a look at
fought mob now fought mob recently
released a brand new update that
includes a bunch of beautiful new
redesign elements and that puts it a
long way along the path of becoming pure
Android their experience starts off
really well it's got a great Google Play
landing page that includes a fantastic
banner and a perfect silhouette logo
that could still be a little bit bigger
I think if we were gonna feature these
guys we'd need that logo to be two or
three times bigger than it is just so it
would show up and I can say this with
with some authority because I am about
10 feet away from a monitor that is
showing this logo at about 6 inches
across and I can't read it that's sure
and in fact you could you could pretty
happily take up the full sort of side
just behind Ian's head there right you
can actually see the whole thing but
it's you've got that sort of a shape
underneath the leg and you could take up
pretty much all of that space with with
the shield without it you know becoming
obstructive it's a small quibble but it
ends up being very important for us for
marketing example marketing is kind of a
big place so a lot of the things we're
going to talk about with fought mob are
along the lines of these more nitpicky
things it is a really nice app looks
very professional and they've gotten off
on the right foot straight away here in
a landing page this looks like something
that people have spent real money
building and that gives you that
impression that it's gonna be something
worth money downloading so let's see
who's gonna be talking it's gonna be me
right so once you get into the app that
feeling really continues the overall
layout is clean it's uncluttered and it
does a good job of following the design
guidelines it definitely has the depth
and breadth that we talked about and
does a really good job of laying that
all out in a fairly intuitive manner
defuse the viewpager throughout the app
really well to make the whole thing feel
engaging dynamic and fluid and they've
integrated well with the platform this
features like add to calendar for each
of the fixtures so that you can
basically use your existing notification
techniques rather than having this app
re-implement all the things which are
already built into the calendar app so I
really like that
biggest area for improvements there
relatively subtle and they're relatively
nitpicky so bear with me but I think
that if you know if you consider some of
these things and we're really going to
be able to consider this as a really
example of the way that these sorts of
apps can be made now first off they've
introduced a couple of custom controls
which aren't immediately obvious how
they should be used the first is this
toggle at the top of each activity we
could gin just about C which says all
it's kind of in the middle up there but
without clicking it there's no way to
determine what it actually does so if
you click it then it becomes clear that
you have a choice between all matches or
just the live matches and they used a
similar toggles throughout the app to do
things like having the alerts turned off
or or or on but until you click it you
don't actually know what it controls now
you generally want to avoid this
anti-pattern within your apps geeks like
asset we're gonna press everything on
the screen just to see what it does in
the hope that it does something cool but
most users treat their devices computers
a little differently in fact it's more
common to find people who are worried
that there's some magic button or key
press combination that's going to delete
all of their data and post new photos of
them on the internet you don't want to
confront folks like this with a mystery
button anywhere in your UI you know
there's a there's another issue with
that particular button type and that is
that when you yeah there we go what when
you have a button like this that that's
a toggle button and it has a label on it
there's a legitimate question as to
whether the label represents the state
that the button is currently in or the
state that you will enter when you press
that button yeah so I think the the
right thing to do is have a toggle where
you have both choices and you can go
back and forth between them exactly you
want to basically have it obvious what
it does and obvious what the current
state is so similarly there's a a ladder
button at the top right of each header
which seems like it should be well
doesn't like seem like it should be
doing anything and because it's really
it's too small and so it's the same sort
of thing that you'll see here with above
each game there's a little header that
tells you what league it's in and
there's a little button next to it which
will allow you to view the standings in
that leagues ladder the thing is is that
those touch targets are less than 40
dips square which means they're really
too small to hit with your finger which
if you're used to these sorts of apps
you're not expecting to be touch targets
because they're too small to be real
touch targets so you really want to make
sure that all these things are big
enough to be able to be touched easily
and to make it obvious when these things
are touchable now overall I found the
navigation pattern throughout the app a
little bit confusing in particular the
use of the uh performance it often
worked a lot more like a substitute back
button then it did an up direction
within a semantic hierarchy of the app
so it's a lot of words but what I'm
saying is for example if I navigate from
you know from this screen here within to
it within a match and then from within
the match go to look at a specific team
and then I press up what I'm expecting
to see then is something like a list of
teams what actually happens is it takes
me back to the previous match now that
doesn't really make semantic sense in
that hierarchy like team doesn't
correspond to a single match it
corresponds to a bunch of maps or to a
league so you really want to sit down
and spend a little bit of time just
basically mapping out all of your
activities and how they all correspond
to each other in that more hierarchical
fashion you know a lot of people get
back and up mixed mixed up and I think
that the fact that the UP button
actually points to the left doesn't help
things but it can be a little confusing
but it's it's impossible to to overstate
the significance of it when you get into
this type of app where there's a large
catalog of data because with a sort of
large catalog you want to be able to
pivot your data in multiple directions
you want to be able to jump around kind
of like you do you know on the World
Wide Web or something and just like on
the world wide web on a webpage you have
a single let's say golden hierarchy
that's how that's the way the the web
page was sort of meant to be browsed but
then you have cross links everywhere so
that you can get to what you're looking
for quickly the back button will take
you back through your cross links very
nicely and that's essential Android
behavior but if you if you want to get
up the hierarchy in some way that's what
the app affordance is for absolutely
final nitpick is if you have a look here
you can see that there draw
implementation is slightly off based
what the design guidelines say you
should be doing what it should be doing
is just sliding the content beneath the
action bar in and out the action bar
itself should always be consistent and
stationary along the entire top so the
only other thing I wanted to mention
navigating around the app the first time
resulted in a lot of loading screens as
I was swiping left and right those sorts
of things totally understandable it
might be worth trying to be a little
more aggressive in your prefetching and
I'm going to go into a bit more detail
on how you can do that without being a
battery drain a little bit later in
today's show our next step is gameplan
and they've got the the right idea for
their logo and banner but both can do
with a little bit of extra polish yeah I
think the the the sense that I get here
is that they spent a great deal of money
on an absolutely gorgeous picture and
then gave it to an intern with
PowerPoint to put their their logo on I
think that having something a little bit
more distinctive for their logo would
really help yeah exactly that's
generally the biggest challenge you're
gonna have when you take a nap that you
student start off building for yourself
because it does something that you want
and I think that's a fantastic reason to
start building apps because you want the
app and it's kind of what got me
interested in smartphone to development
to begin with it's like wow I can just
build an app to do anything the big
challenge when you want to take that
beyond yourself and your friends and
turning something which has a real broad
appeal and get will get you a lot of
downloads is that extra level of
professionals and that extra level of
polish and overall that's probably the
biggest advice that we've got for game
plan overall so as you can see the
initial view is really intimidating it
gives the impression of being either
designed for an expert or for one
individual as well as lacking a certain
amount of overall polish it's not
necessarily a problem but it will
discourage new or casual users from
getting involved and in this is an area
with the it's probably the area with the
most low-hanging fruit that you can
harvest in the form of getting new users
and so the further that feeling is also
using some non-standard UX mechanisms so
if you go to add a team you do that by
searching and it will sort of start
searching through the database and have
a little modal dialog that says hit back
if you want
stop searching which makes sense but is
weird and confusing and just doesn't
feel right well anytime you have to put
text on your screen that says hit this
button to do something you've done it
wrong yeah exactly you want everything
to be as intuitive as possible to just
feel normal feel like it's the right way
and to further that feeling is there's
also things like well no I mean that's
really it the risk here is that you're
going to be making giving people
unfamiliar things and they're going to
find that intimidating once you get some
data into the app you can see that that
depth and and breadth of coverage is
there which is a great start so I really
think that the next step for the
developers here is to sit down and
really think about a design that's
really going to draw users in something
clean something intuitive easy to use
and I think that's probably the next
step here before we go into too much
detail there so the last step we're
gonna look at today is spory it is
I love the banner I hate the icon it's a
rounded rectangle with a gradient feel
like I'm looking at your banner and I'm
seeing like real branding there it's
like strong colors strong images you
know just something very distinctive and
then I look at the logo and it's like
it's it's so sort of generic and boring
it's got the right color whatever is
yeah why haven't they used their their
football player silhouette in the iconic
yeah fit well it would look nice it
would get you out of that whole rounded
rectangle with a little shiny part yeah
exactly so I think that that would be in
a really easy way I think to
straightaway make this landing page even
more distinctive and more than that once
the app is installed the users have a
lot of apps installed right you need to
make your icon something which people
are going to remember and you can see
that they've stuck a little football in
here which is almost a hint that like
well we used to have just the the logo
and no one knew what the hell it was so
we added the football and so people have
it but now it looks like you're part of
the football Network or something yeah
exactly
looks like a match exactly right so
you're heading in the right direction
but keep going there I think is the the
big tip I mean it's this is nitpicky
stuff but from a lot of what we've been
hearing from developers is they want to
get more downloads they want
have more successful merchandising and
it's these little nitpicky things were
just as developers were like come on
just an icon who cares well and speaking
of merchandise and remember the way that
people bought your app was by looking at
this banner that's far and away the most
important first impression they're going
to get and then once they download it
there's nothing about that banner that
translates into the icon except for some
subtleties of the color scheme and it's
not a very unusual color scheme so I
don't think I'd be able to find it later
on zactly you want to make sure people
can find it after they've installed it
because a lot of people will do what we
do on the app clinic which is download
three or four apps which you all
supposedly do about the same thing and
then just go through each of them know
if they can't even find it then they
don't have that association with the
great experience that they started here
exactly so let's move on so the app
itself is great there's functionality
there's a lot it has a lot of
similarities with mob they've got a
great clean and dynamic design that's
clearly inspired by holo it does a great
job of following our guidelines so we're
super happy about that and we think they
did a good job of layout but in terms of
feedback it's not always obvious exactly
what is going to be clickable on this
screen and in fact initially what we did
was just sort of click nothing and we
just assumed that that we were looking
at a fairly shallow app that didn't have
a lot of depth if you found that they've
fall into the same tiny touch target
strap that foot mob had so I don't know
if they tested this on larger devices or
they just have unnaturally small hands
over in soccer watching countries it's
about well that's why we don't use our
hands when we play soccer yeah now I
understand oh that's the answers the
whole question for me so yeah we need to
make sure that the touch targets are a
little larger and there's also a lot of
features that almost feels like the
problem here is that the app didn't want
to add too many activities or too many
screens so they tried to cram everything
into one screen and then it became a
little bit impenetrable as to what was
active and what would do what there's
also a lot of features that are flood
hidden away in the overflow menu so it
might be nice to move some of the more
common features to the action bar and
maybe even hide some less commonly used
features onto a different page entirely
think about how people are going to use
your app in the most general use case
and try and program for that but the
biggest issue with the app is around
navigation and once you start digging in
it's so easy to lose your place it's
just like we were talking about before
when you have a gigantic catalogue of
data you need to be able to jump around
you need to be able to pivot but you
also need to find your way back to where
you came otherwise you're lost like oh
let's say Hansel and Gretel in the
forest where they were left by their
unkind stepmother that's why most apps
these days have or most websites these
days have something called breadcrumbs
and the up affordance is our version of
that we don't obviously have enough
space to put an entire breadcrumb bar
but you should think about the up
affordance that way it's gonna lead you
back to the home page as quickly as
possible now I do want to highlight the
great job they've done with updates and
notifications that you can use these
little plus icons that you see on the
screen to track any game or team or
player and spory is going to give you
the notifications whenever whoever
you're tracking starts playing or scores
anything important happens that's an
awesome feature and they implemented it
right it doesn't drain your battery
which is by far the most important thing
we can say about all of these apps is
that you know they need to be
implemented efficiently because they're
transferring tremendous amounts of data
that has real time implications and if
you can put the the tablet up on screen
Daniel will we'll have a look at lit
panels here so you can see that they've
got the fixtures all on the Left without
having too much white space and they
still got a nice view pager
implementation so you can scroll around
and see what games are coming up and
then clicking on either on any of these
fixtures is going to update the
right-hand panel we have all of your
game information and again they've got a
view pager no it's not a view pager
interesting
so what you can see here is they've
actually designed a great tablet version
of the app they've used the split panels
here so you can see that they've got the
fixtures all on the left without having
too much white space and they've still
got a nice view pager implementation so
you can scroll around and see what games
are coming up and then clicking on
either on any of these fixtures is going
to update the right-hand panel we have
all of your game information and again
they've got a view pager no it's not a
view pager interesting should be a view
pager so that should work the same way
it doesn't at the moment need to click
each of the headings you know that's
really unfortunate because one of the
things that I think it's absolutely
crucial with an app like this is to have
animations everywhere because you need
to understand which data you're leaving
and which data is coming in if it just
kind of blinks on and off it can be very
easily to mentally lose your place and
so I wanted to highlight this because
there's actually the only one of the
three apps that we're looking at today
which has a tablet implementation and
this is a really good example of a kind
of app which would do well to have such
an implementation because a lot of
people are going to be sitting on their
couch with their tablets in their hands
maybe watching sport on TV and browsing
through fixtures games matches players
standings those sorts of things on their
tablet so as a content consumption
device tablets are awesome and this is
exactly the sort of app that you want to
be able to have a more optimized design
version for your tablet owners so how
did they do it how did these developers
create apps which have all of this data
which gets updated really frequently
keep it all fresh keep it all low
latency without draining all the
batteries so I'm going to spend the last
few minutes of today's app clinic doing
a bit of a deep dive into low latency
updates which still effectively use the
battery so where do you start off so a
good app is like a good Butler right so
you are going to want to have all of
that data on screen as quickly as you
can I love the fact that you have this
later you've been using this slide for
years and and yet it resonates with me
not at all because I've never had a
butler
or otherwise closest I've ever come is
down Yardley marathon nice well that's
yeah that's my experience with a butler
as well but you know um see if you can
can squeeze that into a slightly smaller
look on screen there you go okay so what
we're saying here is really is that you
want to have your information you want
to have it when you want it you don't
want to wait for it at all and so what
that translates into is that you need to
figure out what that trade-off is
between latency and battery life so
basically you know the less latency you
have the shorter battery life you have
and the reality is that that trade-off
for most users it wants to be here right
you want to have maximum battery life
zero latency which is kind of a hard
trick to pull off but what that
translates into for us as developers is
you need to make a compromise you need
to make a decision about how are you
going to do those downloads when are you
going to do those downloads now it's
obvious to say that you should do
transfer as little info as you can as
infrequently as you can but for apps
like this that doesn't really work you
need the data it needs to come in
there's lots of it that's a big strength
of the app so you need to figure out how
can you do it efficiently now it turns
out that the way that the mobile radio
state works actually impacts how you
need to make that decision so the way it
actually works is it'll be on standby
mode drawing as little battery current
as possible then as soon as someone or
some app wants to download data it's
going to power up that radio that takes
a couple of seconds of latency then the
radio is going to be on full power
transmitting receiving doing everything
it needs to and then when the last
packet is sent it's going to stop it's
going to say well we don't want to you
know if someone's browsing the web and
they've just landed on a page we don't
want to have to cost him another two
seconds every time they click a link so
we're gonna wait somewhere around five
to 10 seconds before we go into like a
low battery mode and then we're going to
weigh probably another 30 seconds or so
before we go back into like the the
proper standby mode so what does that
tell us well it means that if you've got
fragmented network traffic like this
where you're doing little updates every
30 seconds and big data transfers
whenever you need to you're actually
going to result in a really inefficient
battery profile where suddenly you've
got the devices staying
active for a huge amount of time just
because every 30 seconds it's powering
it back up it's it's basically never
able to go back into full standby you
know one of one of the saddest things
about this particular behavior is that
something that you know if you were on a
desktop would make a huge amount of
sense is is horrible for a mobile
environment and that's going and
checking to see if there's anything you
need to download exactly it's just as
expensive in many cases to do an entire
download as it is to just check and see
if something is available precisely and
so all of the things which we're going
to be talking about now are ways in
which you can make sure that all of your
data transfers happen basically in one
go so you're already paying the price of
bringing up the battery the the radio
getting the battery drain associated
with that just do all of your transfers
as much as you can and so what that
comes down to is doing things like
prefetching so if you're going to be
downloading some data download a bunch
of data it's going to be more efficient
batch and bundle and preempt so anytime
you've got data which isn't or a
transfer which isn't particularly
time-sensitive just batch it just hold
on and then the next time you have
something which is time-sensitive send
it all in one go this is particularly
useful for things like ads for analytics
anything like that which isn't
time-sensitive you know this is actually
the hardest thing to for a beginner to
implement but once you get into the
habit of doing it this way it becomes a
beautiful way to implement your app that
all of the all the data that you're
planning to transfer is kept in some
sort of form on the disk of the device
ion on permanent storage so that
everything is always persisted and that
gives you not only better Network
behavior but also better behavior in
terms of being partially connected or
having interruptions in your app or
catastrophic failure recovery absolutely
so I like to think of this as the big
cookie model so very small number of
very big transfers and that some of the
ways that you can implement this pattern
this the first and the most simple the
most powerful is what Ian was alluding
to which is using Google Cloud messaging
so rather than having some sort of
polling of like oh we're going to check
every five minutes to see if there's
something new forget that
do little server-side have one server
multiple service checking all the
different sources of data and when
you've got something which a user has
said hey I'm interested in all the form
games they've marked that they've told
you that as soon as you see something
relevant you ping them you tell them
specifically hey you should you should
do an update now because there's been a
change this is much more efficient than
doing polling yourself you also want to
do in this we've sort of said this
already transfer as much as possible
minimize the number of sessions delay
time insensitive transfers batching
basically everything that you're doing
and prefetching which is part of this so
try and download only what you'll need
but try and download everything you
think you'll need so that's really a
balance where you're saying figure
people are going to use your app to the
next two to five minutes and make sure
that there's enough data there so that
you're not going to have to do another
poll another connection to your service
within that time frame which means that
if you're looking at one page on a
viewpager
you want to make sure you've got
basically everything else horizontally
along that strip and probably two swipes
worth a vertical data as well the cost
for downloading that text data is going
to be significantly smaller than the
cost of having to spin up the radio in
order to download that data later at the
very least I mean when you're talking
about spinning up the radio for a
certain number of seconds versus the
amount of text that you're going to
transfer over let's say at gzip
compressed HTTP connection you can
actually get a lot of data within a
fairly small number of packets you got
to keep in mind that by spinning up the
radio you're gonna keep it on for
somewhere between 10 10 seconds in a
minute so anything you can download in
that amount of time is actually going to
be more efficient than having to
potentially download data that you don't
need yeah you obviously don't want it to
download redundant data but only because
it's likely that the user will be
charged for it yeah
but you do want to download all of the
new data you can usually if you have
some sort of operational transform or
time stamping or just anything that
allows you to figure out what's new and
what isn't and apply that to your local
persistent storage that's the best way
to deal with an app like this absolutely
and while we're talking prefetching it's
worth noting that not all networks
transfer data equally so you can see
here in this snippet of code and all of
these slides are going to be available
so much more easily readable than off
the video
what we're doing here is simply saying
well let's have a look at how fast this
network is and download more data if we
have a faster connection and this is
especially true not just because of the
speed implications but also because the
faster networks tend to have a bigger
battery drain so it's even more
important that you minimize the number
of times that you're basically spinning
up the radio to do another data transfer
if you can't use cloud-to-device
messaging if you just need to do regular
polling for whatever reason try to
figure out a way that you don't need to
use regular polling but if if you've
done that and there really is no
alternative make sure that you use
inexact repeating alarms and this is a
way of being able to set a regular
polling alarm which is going to allow
you to synchronize all of those things
at the same time so that basically it so
it's a way of letting the system do some
batching for you
it's also worth trying to make sure that
you're not using wake alarms if at all
possible for this sort of thing so that
you're not draining the battery while
the user isn't even using their phone
similarly if you are doing that sort of
poll it's worth considering this sort of
inactivity back off where the user isn't
using your app they haven't opened it in
three days it's probably not as
important to have that low latency data
so do keep track of how often the app is
being used and consider modifying your
refresh frequency based on their
frequency of your app use all the
details for this are available in this
training class transferring data without
draining the battery so all of that in
all the information I've shared quickly
here is available in much more detail at
that class so our next step is to take a
closer look at today's apps and see how
close they are to being pure Android so
to do that we're going to pass them
through each of these checklists so if
you're the developer or footmarks pori
or game plan do get in touch and me and
Ian will try and provide you a little
bit more detailed feedback on what your
next steps should be if you want to you
know make it to that next level right
now we don't have a whole lot of time
but I do just want to point out for
those of you watching my home that rato
who wrote the script for for this show
did in fact capitalize the M in
thereby making this read sort of like
the King James Bible just wanted to
mention that let's move on so until then
you can find our existing pure Android
apps collection at bitly slash pure
Android and you can nominate your app
for consideration by adding it to our
Trello page a bitly slash app clinic
Trello so we'll be back next week
hopefully neither one of us has the
plague again yeah as crust
don't forget to join Roman Nick and Adam
on Android design in action next Tuesday
until next week I'm reto Meier and i'm
ian ni-lewis and this is being the app
clinic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
