will show you all the new exciting stuff
we have added to Google Play services
4.4 and as you know by now Google Play
services rocks
this also means that when you use Google
Play services morning coffee let's get
started right away
shall we here are the highlights for
version 4.4 new activity recognitions
have been added to the locations API
J and for Google Android Maps API we got
some extension to indoor maps and that's
right it's a blockbuster thing and we'll
save that bang for later we also got
some new stuff for the Play game
services and wallets and we'll round it
off by presenting in apps prom ads for
mobile ads but let's get right to it and
start off with activity recognitions in
the locations API as you hopefully
already know it has previously been
possible to detect if the device is on a
bicycle in a vehicle if it's still if
it's being tilted or on foot well that's
a lot to begin with well we decided to
add some more and we are now happy to
introduce two more activities walking
and running thank you that's right we
added walking and running to the
activity detectors but we thought now
why don't we go a little bananas here
and try those things out so what am i
doing now you are walking that's right
that's very very good
you are running that's right that's very
very good keep running it is good for
you so what am i doing now you were
riding a bike that's right that's very
no don't stop running you are very close
to Googleplex let me tell you that was
both exhausting and fun and that was
just a demo app imagine what your apps
can do with that now let's look at the
Google Maps Android API starting off
with indoor maps where you can select
the floor programmatically detective a
new building comes into focus and of
course also get the active building in
floor this is for example the second
floor of D gates at San Francisco
Airport alright moving on to and ladies
and gentlemen that's right
we got a big announcement to make let's
welcome street views to the Google Maps
Android API with a round of applause get
back to work
yes sir you can now embed Street View
imagery into an activity enabling your
users to explore the world through
panoramic 360 degrees views
programmatically control the zoom and
orientation of the Street view camera
and animate the camera movements wow
that's a major extension imagine all
that cool stuff and what it can do to
your apps over to play game services in
the 4.3 release we introduced game gifts
which allows you to request gifts or
wishes now we have extended the request
to with a new API so you can select
multiple game gift recipients for games
this means that more collaboration and
social engagement can happen between
your players which brings us to the
wallet API where we added wallet
fragments to the instant buy API wallet
fragments makes it extremely easy to
integrate the buy with Google button in
your app just configure these fragments
and add them and just for fun let's see
how shopping can now be done in ten
seconds the user logs onto an app using
Google+ sign-in selects a Google
adjustable bike too by using buying with
Google to complete the purchase and get
it shipped to your home address
voila a bike in ten seconds I'm wrapping
it up with the mobile ads where we have
added in
promo ads this is an API available for
publishers to display in a pro maps and
it enables users to purchase directly
advertised goods in the app with these
extensions users can conveniently
purchase products that interest them and
advertisers can reach consumers and your
app connects the dots a win-win-win
in other words that's it for this time
but stay tuned because we've got lots
more coming up now it's your turn to go
out there and create great apps and
don't forget to tell us all about it you
need to be more careful when you are
climbing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
