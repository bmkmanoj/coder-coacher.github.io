Android our as I the only person like to
refer to it as the Android keynotes I'm
Chet Haase from the Android UI toolkit
team and I'm emerging for the graphics
team and I'm Dan Sandler from the system
UI team and we don't have a lot of time
so let's get to it
are you ready what's new in Android
here's where we left off last time API
25 so we're just gonna grab that get sha
there pop it in to get div and then all
right off we go um you're gonna want to
write this down okay
next yeah that was a good one okay
I was a little man remember we almost
made that in enum it was hilarious you
got that huh you think is what people
came for I don't know why we didn't
think of this before so we've been doing
this talk we've been telling you what's
new for four years and you can see that
I'm forgot my blazer
actually now I had a lovely red blazer
but somebody borrowed it for the keynote
and you've got your it looks like you're
monitoring me and but this year it was a
little different right you had developer
previews well in advance so you've seen
a lot of these API is before you had the
Google keynote where we showed off a lot
of really exciting stuff we had a
developer keynote where you learned
about even more developer stuff so what
what are we doing here what is the point
of what's new in Android existential
crisis convicted so did you test this
clicker I did okay think of this talk I
think this talk like a wine tasting or a
whiskey flight or one of those soda
machines that you can push all the
buttons on this is an artisanal
hand-picked selection of things you may
have overlooked in the new release of
Android things you're going to need to
do no matter what to be part of Android
oh and well honestly just things we'd
like to talk about
we're on the stage so with that this is
really what's new in Android
specifically what you might admit in the
developer preview or the i/o keynote or
the other keynote and why you should
care one last thing that I want to make
sure we get to today is this everybody's
always excited about this we're going to
hold that for the end it's going to be
good all right let's get started by man
talk about UI in graphics yes let's
start so the first feature we want to
talk about is one that you saw this
morning in one of the kids said this
clicker does not work you didn't test it
you know I don't think I know I'm gonna
stand back here and I'm going to do the
slide for you all right
good for the next slide this is why they
didn't want to give us the choir so a
feature that works for me just go back
there don't it to you so the first
feature that you saw this morning in one
of the keynotes picturing pictures not
just what TV anymore it's also for your
phone so here we have an example with
rock party application Netflix running
on your phone picture and picture
give me that clicker let's move back
there we go and sweetie it's real easy
to implement in your application you
just have to modify your manifest and
stop playing the animation please you
just have to search the whole picture in
picture true you don't need in oder
resizable activity true attribute
anymore and you should also test
configuration changes and in your code
when you want to enter the different
Dijkstra mode you just have one line to
call you get your activity in you call
enter picture and picture
super simple and is going to make your
user super happy then a feature that the
way up to my heart it's column
management's so we're adding support for
white gamma displacing oh it's not going
to be on all devices on the devices that
support the feature will enable it for
the for your application we're adding
support for 16-bit PNG files you can
have wider colors more saturated colors
which both ICC profiles so color
profiles embedded in bitmaps in jpg PNG
and web piece it will ensure accurate
rendition
of colors across multiple screens we
also have a bunch of new AP is that
we're going to talk about that more at
the end of the week in a different talk
so because the picture is worth a
thousand words this is color management
and how it works
hope it's clear but really the core
management is about something you've
probably experienced with your own
application your colors look different
across devices so we have solutions for
you in Android Oh
so if you want to know more there's
going to be a talk that I'm going to
give on Friday at 11:30 and stay on
stage - it's called understanding color
next we're also adding support for
multiple displays if your application is
already the clicker is horrible if your
if your application supports multiple
windows already the multi window mode it
already supports multiple display in oh
when the phone is connected or an
Android device is connected to multiple
displays and you have an application
that's compatible the user can choose to
send your application on a different
display when this happens you're going
to get a resizing a resizing
configuration change you can also
control on white display your activity
shows up you can use the activity
options for that and you should really
test your app if you want to support
this feature to help you with testing we
have two new developer tools you can run
adb shell x this display it will list
all the current available displays on
the device and if you call adb shell
start with your activity intents you can
specify the display on which you want to
start the activity so very easy way for
you to test this there's a lot more to
this API so we encourage you to go to
the office hours on Friday and Thursday
the the office hours for Windows and
activities next media
so we have a lot of very useful classes
in the our media packet we have the
media player the media recorder the
extractor and the codec and we added and
you get matrix API on every one of those
classes it helps you query information
about the media that you're dealing with
so you can query the resolution the
codec the bitrate the duration this kind
of data it's super easy to use just
gonna get metrics on one of those
objects you get the persistable bundle
and you can look up the documentation on
developer.android.com
to know what kind of queries are
available let that is also much improved
you now have control over the buffering
in your application so you can specify a
low and a high watermark so the the
playback of the video will not start
until you reach the low watermark and
the system will do its best to keep
cache data between the slow and high
watermark and you can specify the
watermarks in duration or amount of data
in a in size we also improved seeking so
when you seek into a video you can now
choose the behavior do you want to seek
to the closest frame to the to the next
keyframe to the previous keyframe or to
the closest sync frame and finally we
made we made the RM play back with the
Widevine a lot easier to use in all of
your applications for recording until
now the media mixer only let lets you
only lets you had sorry add one video
track n or one audio track now you can
have as many audio and video tracks as
you want you can also create custom
tracks the nine type has to start with
application slash and it's basically a
side band where you can include any kind
of data you also canonical example is to
include gyroscope data if you want to be
able to replay a 360 video or something
like that web view comes with a really
useful new api's
we've added the the ability to save
browsing that you you know in love from
chrome that detects malware's and
unsecure web pages so if you add this
tag in your manifest this metadata tag
it's going to use the same back-end and
then the same API that chrome itself
uses to secure the debugging experience
for your users the web you use is now
multiple processes and in particular
there's a render process so we also have
new API to deal with this multi
processes so if the writer process
crashes you can use the termination
handle API to detect the crash and
decide what you do in your application
you can crash your application if you
want you can try to restart the webview
or you can just lock something and show
a message to the user it's much more
graceful than before you can also use
the render or important's API to better
deal with the low memory situations so
when the system is low on memory it's
going to try to reclaim no gram from
somewhere and you can tell the system
whether your webview is very important
or not that important to your
application so if the webview is
critical to your application you should
definitely take a look at this API so
you know it's the right button right yes
I know that so there were a couple of
long requested features for animators
specifically for animator set they were
deceptively tricky to implement so it
took a while but now in Android o we
have the capability an animator sets of
having ticking so now if you have an
animator that the collection of child
animators you can seek within those
child animators in the overall animator
set so yay
we also have the ability to reverse
search future try to implement this API
as well ago maybe uh-huh and who
implements the DJ's engine not me yeah
yeah
so new capability again an animator set
to reverse so you no longer have to you
know set up a separate animator set with
all that functionality and get a
listener and all that way you do all
that tedious work for you
so yeah autofill because it's really
tedious to get all that information
correct over and over we thought this in
the keynote earlier the ability to
you've got a form to fill in there's a
provider that can give you that
information so when you get those text
fields we can automatically enter that
information for you and there are a
couple of different aspects to this one
is you can certainly implement your own
service and provide that capability or
depend on service that we are providing
instead or more typically you will
implement a client of that the standard
views just work if you're using text
view if you're using edit text we know
how to receive this information to
interact with the service already so you
don't need to do anything for standard
views if you're using custom views or if
you want to provide more information
about standard views we have api's for
providing hints to us about what the
value types are as well as API is to
tell us more about your custom views and
how you want to interact with that also
if you have a custom view hierarchy
let's say you have a surface view where
you have views inside of there but all
we know is that there's a surface view
then there are api's for you to tell us
about the virtual hierarchy that you
want us to interact with there is going
to be more about this in a session on
Friday morning so go to that if you want
to learn more about autofill and now
let's talk a little bit about text
there's been a bunch of stuff going on
in the text arena at this time I think
we can rewrite this there we go
I only use that font because it hurts
Dan it just physically hurts them it's
awesome I think she broke him all right
so first of all you can use XML to
declare font information using sort of a
neat hack in it with data binding but
it's kind of tricky to do and why
shouldn't we actually provide that
capability for you so now we do so you
can now actually put a font file
directly in this new resource font
directory yeh and beed so put that in
the directory or you can tell us about
the font families you can provide
several fonts with information about the
styles of each and then you can just use
those directly as you could any other
resource and from code you just say give
me that resource and away you go
downloadable fonts now we have the
capability for you to declare a font
that you want to use that we will then
download and cache on the system for you
if it is not there yet or if it is on
the system then we'll use it from the
cache you can do this from code or from
XML and use it as a resource just like
you did in XML fonts on the previous
exciting slides and we also have a font
provider that we are providing in a not
yet released version of Google Play
services there is a beta version of that
available at the conference this week I
don't know the details on that but
there's a session where you can learn
the details or you should be able to go
to the Play services website to learn
more about that and this gives you
access to all of google fonts so if you
just want to use one of the standard
ones such as that beautiful font I use
to kick off this section maybe that's in
there then you can ask for that directly
from the service also there's the
ability to have auto-sizing textview so
typically if you resize a textview
you never know what's going to be like
the can write text text is cool
especially when it's in the right font
so what you get now is the behavior on
the left there where we're just resizing
the view itself there's no change to the
font but on the right if you opt into
the auto sizing text view behavior then
we're going to resize the font for you
and you can specify the behavior the
stepping ferments that you want to use
or the specific sizes that you want to
snap to as it resizes so there's api's
for that there's api's in both xml as
well as java programming language codes
so knock yourself out and for all of
these text features xml fonts
downloadable fonts and auto-sizing
textview they're talking about all of
these in the what's new in support
library session tomorrow morning and
you're wondering why are they talking
about it in the support library session
aren't these platform api's yes they are
and they are also in support library
you can use all of these capabilities
going back on earlier releases
accessibility service utilities if
you're writing an accessibility service
great thing to do we have new
capabilities you can take advantage of
language detection the ability to put a
button in the navigation bar along with
the other buttons there to make it
easier to access your stuff separate
volume control for accessibility volume
so you're not conflating that volume
whether the volumes on the devices and
also the ability to define custom
gestures custom fingerprint gestures if
you want to learn anything more about
these there's a session this afternoon
on accessibility that you should check
out and finally one of my favorite
really tiny changes I'm going to say
tiny because it's one line of code for
the API for the actual sales that went
in to fix all the code that was
dependent upon the former implication
was huge so I don't want to detract from
the work from it but API wise really
tiny tiny hidden kind of looks like the
same thing from the outside the way fine
view by ID used to be declared with
something like this public view find
view by ID and then you call that you
pass in your resource ID and get back
with you and then you immediately cast
it into what you want so text to you you
have to tell if the text view on both
the left and the right there's
parentheses and it's big bother people
use helper libraries just to get around
the fact that this looks so horrible so
now
I call this feature castaway I think I
am the only one that does so alright
blue path my first flight that's fine I
want to talk a little bit about some of
the UI system you want to stuff you're
going to look at if you have an app
you're going to need to know about it
adaptive icons I think there's got like
a barely a mention in one of step slides
earlier today essentially this is we're
trying to save you time and money there
are so many launchers out there and each
one of them has a different
recommendation for the shape of your
icon so adaptive icons is a new piece of
technology that we have brought to you
in that allows you to say here's my
background here's my foreground cut it
out to whatever shape you like so even
if the launcher has a circle or it's got
a round rectangle or it's got something
awful you have an icon that matches
exactly the local the local flavor
there's gonna be a ton more information
about adaptive icons at a o'clock on
Thursday
and definitely go to that one alright
let's talk about shortcuts and widgets
as launcher is also a part of system UI
previously to get shortcuts and widgets
on the user screen you easy there's a
broadcast for shortcuts that sort of
kind of works and for widgets you just
have to beg the user please please see
if you can find our widget inside the
launcher you know you can now actually
request one of these things to be pinned
to the users workspace unique manager
for shortcuts using app widget manager
for widgets and the users own gets the
opportunity to say no I don't want that
on my desktop or yes I do and in fact I
will go ahead and place it exactly where
I want it or they can just say sure find
a spot for it which was the previous
behavior so now you don't have to walk
the user through a long flow you just
send them right into this dialog it's
super convenient look at all the new
users is going to have on your budget
I can just say I'm pausing for applause
when I'm really fussing with the clicker
here this also we'll talk about on
Thursday at 4:30
all right notifications you knew it was
coming
they're super useful they're great for
engagement users love them they're maybe
a little out of control there's a lot
that is being used in the notification
stream right now and it's very hard for
you to get your message to the users
that want it it's very hard for a user
to manage the inflow of demands on their
attention if it's out of control now the
user should always be in control that's
been a principal of ours since beginning
we added the ability to block
notifications from a package in jelly
bean and nougat we referring to a little
bit knotted quietening but all through
all this our users the number one
request to get from users is okay but
can I just block some of an apps
notifications on the other hand the
number one request we get from
developers is the user just block some
of my notifications it's the same thing
everybody's been asking for the same
thing and this is where notification
channels come from the new API in a
channel is a name category of
notifications from one app that
full-share this same behavior
vibration sound light whether they pop
up on screen so that the user has
explicit and fine-grained control so as
an app you get to set up all your own
channels defining the default behavior
for oh and a private message should pop
up and oh a tag maybe the doesn't pop up
or it's got a lower priority and then
users when they long press a
notification or use the new slide
gesture to look at it they can see what
channel is on and make changes right
there in line once you target oh if you
take nothing else away from my two
minutes here take away this you have to
use channels for every notification or
they will be dropped so until you target
oh you can start like slowly evolving
your notification system over to channel
once you target oh they have to all be
channelized because we're trying to get
to a consistent experience where the
user knows that they're going to get and
we're going to talk about that a lot of
other great stuff including design
considerations all the code that I
didn't put up there whatever that little
blinky thing is over there on this talk
at 4:30 tomorrow there's a lot of other
great stuff coming to system UI
we have listed some of it here it ran
off the end again I like doing that with
slides and I encourage you very much to
check out the developer previews or
install the beta and play with all of it
we're really proud of it all right new
API is for you as developers we expanded
on the strict mode API that I'm sure you
are using in your debugging so now on
the thread policy you can get on when
you're not using unbuffered i/o so you
use an input or an output stream without
wrapping it into one of the buffered
stream you'll get a flash or whatever it
is the trigger warning you you've set on
the VM policy if you don't take your
sockets you can also get one tagging
socket is really useful to do traffic
debugging using Android studio and
finally if you open another intent if
you send an intent to outside of your
application and you need to go in
permission you can also be warned so
it's really easy to use it looks like
the the previous API as we add media
file access so one of the we introduce
the document providers a while ago in a
couple releases ago and they're
extremely useful except when you have
large documents if you have a large
document you needed to download the
entire data before you could pass it to
the colors the user of the document
provider so now you can create C cable
file descriptors it's extremely useful
for audio video or any large type of
content it's also extremely used easy to
use so you get the Storage Manager you
open the proxy file descriptor you give
you the callback and then we're going to
invoke your callback to request the size
of the document to request some amount
of data in the byte array and then we're
going to tell you when to close it
- data so this is a new idea that the
system give you to be a better citizen
so each app has a certain amount of data
it can use on the on the cache partition
and when the system runs out of space
out of storage space it's going to start
deleting some of your cached data so if
you stay below the quarter that you're
given you can avoid your data being
deleted for this you can use the Storage
Manager you can query the number of
bytes that are allocated to your app you
should query that from time to time
because the code can change depending on
how much of the quota you use or how
often the user uses the application then
when you want to allocate data you can
just use allocate bytes you could do it
yourself you could just create a file
you could just create an output stream
but it's much better to do it this way
because when you go through allocate
bytes if needed the system will delete
another apps cache data to make space
for your data so that means that get
cash quota by it might be bigger than
the free space that's left on the device
you can also use something called set
set casual behavior tombstone so this is
very useful to me - for your app to be
able to tell the difference between a
file that was never cashed and are now
in a file that was cash but deleted so
when you set that behavior and the
system deletes some of your files in
your cache it will truncate the file so
the file will still be there but the
size will be set to zero that tells you
that the cache was deleted by the system
and finally a usable space in the Attic
readable space are different there's a
lot going on
we only have a little bit of a pocket I
want to highlight improvements this are
new in Android ho if you've been using
android ID you need to know now that it
is going to be different for every app
for every user on the device so it can't
be used to track users between apps on
the same device anymore
similarly if you've been reflecting into
system properties to get net dot
hostname it is empty now and so if
you're saying well I really need
advertising IDs to be able to you know
send users the correct contextual
advertisements that is what the
advertising ID API and Google Play
services is for so go check it out in
Google Play but you cannot use Android
Android ID you can't trust it anymore in
the same way you might have done I had a
slide here about webview but then
romantic it one other thing I wanted to
mention about safe browsing and webview
is because webview is now pushed to the
Play Store every six months you will be
able to opt in to Safe Browsing features
as far back as lollipop which is
fantastic we also saw the unveiling
during the keynote something we're
calling Google Play protect which is
actually a lot of technologies that
we've had in place before but really
haven't given the visibility that they
truly deserve because we are watching
out for people all the time so any
device that Google Play has protected
enabled every app that gets uploaded to
play is pre-screened and continuously
rescreened for each new version that's
uploaded and every time you install an
app where you have played protect set up
that app is going to be screened as well
even if you got it from another store or
from you know a DB install and we're
really excited about this there is so
much more to talk about so much more to
talk about in Android security they give
me a whole like slide deck of stuff so I
said why don't you have your own talk I
actually didn't say that they had their
own talk anyway on Thursday at 2:30
you're going to go and find out what's
new in Android security from soup to
nuts everything from kernel hardening
all the way to more stuff about webview
language and runtime I think you already
know what I'm going to say so this
morning we announced official support
for cuddling
you saw that on stage and I see her
sitting right there in the hallway so if
you see her as I'll go say thanks so
Stefan the whole thing behind her like
the amazing work or the personal how
very much time to bring you this
so go thank our shall pass your things
along to the whole team so it's
available today in Android 3.0 there's a
lot of documentation already online I
could spend hours talking about Kathleen
and why it's good for you it's good for
us actually
should I hijack the dog actually it
really good he does okay but
unfortunately this session so instead I
invite you to come on Friday at 10:30
here on this stage there's going to be a
talk called an introduction to Kathleen
from Android breast labs detect length
the lead language designer at JetBrains
and Heidi vp of developer advocacy at
JetBrains
and then in the afternoon and then in
the afternoon on stage 4 will have life
is great and everything will be ok
Kathleen's here by Christina Lee from
Pinterest and Jack Watson from square so
and this is important to us because the
reason why we brought you cotton is
because you the community is using
Kathleen we listened we heard you we're
bringing you what you wanted so we
wanted to have you the community onstage
to talk about it better than we can also
if you have questions you can come to
the developer sandbox at the Android
core platform booth through there from
3:00 to 4:30 on Thursday from 2:00 to
4:00 and on Friday from noon to 2:00
p.m. and ray the language designer will
be there to answer all your questions so
please come if you want to know anything
about Kathleen just go there and go ask
your questions now like Steph mentioned
we're also doubling down on our other
languages so the java programming
language and also c and c++
so for the java programming language
we're adding new packages in android oh
we have java at a time that sunny makes
manipulating time and dates easy and it
makes sense makes a lot more sense than
the other aps we also
but time we're also bringing you Java
that and any other file it improves on
the good old Java that I of the file API
it lets you access the attributes of the
file
it lets you easily manipulate path and
read files we'll get an example and
sorry in Java the kind that invoke it's
a slight variation on reflection this is
a gross approximation but it's really
cool because lets you transform and wrap
method handles to in your application so
here's an example of the new files API
so you can use the past hood class to
get a pass and then you can just call
file that lines it will read the entire
content of the file you're going to get
a stream so in this example I'm using
lambdas and stream api's to remove all
the empty lines all the lines that start
with the pound sign and then I collect
everything back into a single string
again so it's a lot easier than it was
before all right some changes in the
runtime I heard about some of these this
morning and there's more about it this
week new concurrent copying collector
making everything basically faster and
better concurring copying means no pause
time except when there's a full GC so we
can do all the stuff that it needs to do
in the background while you're doing
other stuff in particular one of the
really cool things that it can do is
actually compact the heap in the
foreground so previously in art I
believe in the previous release it had
the ability to compact the heap which is
really good it candy fragment it can
make the heap smaller it can make
allocations to collections faster they
could only do this when activities were
in the background so it would go into an
idle state and then sort of do it when
it was in that idle state but it wasn't
it was in the foreground there was
nothing that it could do about the
expanding and fragmenting heap now it
can collect in the foreground defrag and
the foreground and everything gets
faster there's also a new faster
mechanism for allocations so we can just
do bump pointer allocations which is way
way faster collections are faster and
all of this essentially results in less
jank for you so faster to allocate stuff
faster to collect stuff means that just
dealing with garbage and memory in
general is much faster using art in the
OU release lots of various optimizations
loop unrolling inlining one of the
things to note is that dalvik was
created with a constraint of memory
memory type constraints right like
everything was about saving memory with
dalvik which means that it could only do
so much optimization to sort of reach
the end of its life as far as what they
could do to optimize things when art
came online they basically put in a
platform upon which we could build
future optimizations so we're starting
to reap those benefits now where with
every release including oh and future
releases we're going to be able to do
more and more and there's a bunch of
them in this release and you should
check out a session later in the week
for more information on that also
there's dex locality this in particular
improves launch time for activities
because we can collect all the memory in
the same space so it's easier and faster
to access as your application is
starting up so there's a session on
Friday morning performs and memory
improvements so check that out for more
particulars there so beyond the platform
we have support library we have other
mechanisms for delivering things that
aren't just about the oh release we
wanted to call out some of those there's
the v26 beta release that comes out with
Developer Preview to the stuff that we
already talked about in text fonts and
XML downloadable fonts as well as
auto-sizing text view those are all in
there you can check those out in
addition there's something that we call
emoji compat so one of the big issues
that we have with emojis is that if your
friends are sending you emojis that are
from some future standards than whatever
we shipped on the release that you're
running it's not possible for you to see
those emojis and you're going to see
tofu's instead which given some of the
emojis I've seen may be more attractive
but not very meaningful so wouldn't it
be nice if you could actually get
updated emojis on your device so now we
have two mechanisms that apps can use to
get updated emojis one is that apps can
actually bundle with updated emojis so
they can update the apps to the Play
Store and then to their users so that
the users get more more timely updates
of these emojis the other and probably
better certainly long-term solution is
to actually use a service that we can
provide throw downloadable fonts we
talked about earlier where they can
automatically get updated fonts through
downloadable fonts right so
they can the app can build in the
capability to use the downloadable fonts
capability to have updated emojis as we
provide them into the service so again
go to the what's new and support library
talk tomorrow morning to learn more
about all of those we also had more
stuff going on an animation besides the
small stuff an animator set I talked
about earlier we have the ability to now
have physics based animation stuff so if
we want to see that in animation form
the ability to have essentially
animations driven through velocity all
of the animation capabilities that we
have in the platform to date have been
driven around the idea of a duration you
tell it how want you how long you want
it to run for but many animations you
really want to drive it by the velocity
in particular animations that are driven
by user interactions you're dragging
something on the screen and you'd let go
wouldn't it be nice if it took off from
your finger at the same velocity that
you were dragging it when you let go so
fling scrolls all that stuff it really
require a velocity based animation
system instead you can do that with the
animators but it's really tedious it
requires math math is hard and so we've
baked in that capability to this new
physics animation system that is more
natural more interactive and more
interruptive because it was really
intended to work with that user
interactivity model
here's small demo of this so as we're
dragging the top thing around the other
two circles are essentially hinged to
the top one through Springs that you
define and so they follow it in space
they don't they're not lockstep
following it but they're basically on
Springs that are attached and they
immediately benefit from that
interactivity and that physics based
notion of these Springs so there's a
talk on this on Friday afternoon all
about the new physics based animation
stuff please come to that if you want to
know more about that architecture
components this was mentioned in the
keynotes we thought that maybe sometimes
Android development is a little bit
harder than it needs to be so we took a
step back and said okay what are some of
the major problems that we should take
another run at to try to simplify this
for app developers and a couple of those
that we've taken specific runs at right
now
around life-cycle it is apparently kind
of hard to deal with the fact that your
activities can die at any time when you
rotate the screen or it goes in the
background or whatever and find out
exactly what state you're in can be a
bit tedious it is an ongoing issue that
all app developers need to deal with so
we've taken another approach to that to
make that much easier and in addition to
that we've also taken a look at
persistence so you can issue raw sequel
now and that's about all you got on the
system so we have a new way of doing
that that builds on that capability and
makes it easier and more powerful and
we're going to talk about all of those
this week we're going to have an
introduction to architecture components
I would encourage you to go to this
afternoon that's actually immediately
after this session and then tomorrow
morning we're going to have one on the
lifecycle problem and how we've solved
that and we're also going to have one on
persistence and offline and all of these
are bits that you can actually try out
in an earlier release form already so
check those out hopefully it will make
your developer lives easier there are
some behavior changes some of which
you're going to care about more than
others there have been some changes to
the behavior of background applications
in particular location if you are
running as a background application
you're only going to get coarse-grained
location information all of these things
are being done not to make it harder but
to make the devices better right if all
applications have all capabilities at
all times and they can do whatever they
need to or want to at any time then
essentially you're going to run the
battery down because everybody's doing
too much work all the time so we're
trying to be judicious about which
applications actually need the services
at which times so that we can make the
experience for the user much better the
experience for your users much better as
well so one of those is in location
coarse-grained information when you're
in the background another one is
wakelocks we noticed that it was common
for an application to go into a
background state and then into a cache
state and it would have a wakelock at
the time and it would just keep that
wake block and it would hold it for a
very long time and that really runs the
battery down so now sometime after you
go into a cache state the white clock is
automatically released so that it
doesn't put the device into that
unseemly state and also there are limits
to execution when you're running in the
back
there have also been changes to alert
windows in particular there's this new
type of window called type application
overlay if you are targeting the o SDK
then this is the window type that you
must use if you want to have an alert
window capability if you're on earlier
releases obviously that didn't exist
you're not going to use this just know
that whatever window type you are using
is going to be layered under one of
these type application overlay windows
because we have a more clearly defined
layering policy now with that there is
more information about this this
afternoon at 5 o'clock background check
and other insights so please come to
that if you want to know all the details
about that and then finally we promise
to get back to this didn't we we do is
our one more thing right all right so we
were going to talk about this and I
think I mean we have to we have to have
a drumroll don't we how about a like a
Cyril do we have a Cyril all right
tonight unfortunately
I'm looking at the timer on stage and
I'm going to say that o stands for oh no
we're out of time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
