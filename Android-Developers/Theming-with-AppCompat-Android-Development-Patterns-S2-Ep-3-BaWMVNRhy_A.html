that theming without compat is what
takes your app from good to great so app
compat uses the pattern introduced in
lollipop where you can declare a set of
colors in your theme which automatically
change a number of elements in your UI
there's three main colors color primary
color primary dark and color accent
color primary is where you start it
serves as the main branding color
throughout your app if you're using a
standard app compat theme you'll find
the app bar uses color primary by
default if you're using a toolbar set
the color using the background attribute
with attribute color primary color
primary dark it's only applicable to
Android 5.0 and higher devices and
serves as the background color for the
status bar and should as the name
implies be a darker shade of your
primary color color accent is slightly
different and that affects a wide number
of elements throughout your app you'll
notice it in edit text focus underline
and cursor check check boxes as well as
the background color for the floating
action button very important that it
contrasts with both your primary color
and your background colors so it remains
legible it's a few other colors which
are less often used but can be really
useful color of control normal controls
the normal state of components such as
an unselected edit text color control
activated overrides color accent the
activated or check State for items such
as checkboxes and color control
highlight which controls the ripple
coloring so lots of customization is
possible without touching any individual
components but this powerful theming
isn't limited only to the entire
activity you can also apply a theme to
any view in your app using the Android
theme attribute which lets you change
only that view and it's children to make
this easy there's a concept of a theme
overlay theme overlays unlike a full
theme only seek to change the few
they need to this would be appropriate
for changing elements in a normally
light theme for display in a dark
background say an app bar with a dark
primary color when building a custom
theme overlay make sure your parent
theme is theme overlay app compat this
ensures that elements such as color
accent work properly on both lollipop
and pre lollipop devices so themes and
theme overlays could be a powerful way
to change the look of your app either at
the activity or view level one more tool
to help you build better apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
