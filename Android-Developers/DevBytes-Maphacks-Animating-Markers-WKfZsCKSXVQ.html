on the Android developer relations team
hi I'm Chris Broadfoot I work on the
Google Maps Android API team today we're
going to talk to you about the Maps API
for Android and we're going to cover a
few things but to start with us talk
about animation if you have a look at
the the sample code for the Maps API
you'll see that we use handlers to
animate markers and for other purposes
too so what we're going to talk about
today is how you can use handlers for
backward compatibility but use some of
the newer api's ie the property
animation framework to have an even
better experience so let's switch to the
tablet and let's just see a basic marker
animating all we're doing is where we
tap we just generate a polyline from the
source to destination just tell the
marketing move there yep so our here you
know we've accomplished what we wanted
to but as I said in Gingerbread what
we'd be a Gingerbread and older what we
would do is animate these markers the
markers position using a handler so
let's have a look at some code that
shows us how we do this okay so we'll be
showing you three ways of animating a
marker and each of these methods will
have the same parameters so the marker
itself the final destination lat/long so
that's the it's final point and a
lat/long interpolator which we'll talk
about a little bit later so from
Gingerbread and before we need to do a
little bit of setup to set up our
animation handler so first of all we get
the start position just by calling get
position on the marker and then just
again some of that set up so just the
start time and our animation duration so
here's the meet of the animation so this
runnable gets called every 16
milliseconds while the animation
animation is in progress the T variable
is the portion that we are through the
animation and we're also using an
interpolator
so these are available before Ice Cream
Sandwich and honeycomb as well so this
is great for like a accelerate
decelerate interpolate
or bouncing interpolation and then we
just go ahead and call that set position
on the marker with its new value you'll
see at the end of the handler what we do
is we re invoke the handler after 16
milliseconds and of course that magic
number is used so that we can get 60
frames per second now one of the
downsides to this is that we are doing
this asynchronously to the Android UI
rendering thread so what we can do is
use the property animation framework and
we're going to shift to the next one and
see in the value animator how we can
synchronize those okay so from honeycomb
onwards we can use value animator as
anchor said so here we still have to do
a little bit of setup we get the markers
starting position but the value animator
can give us the animated fraction so
this is the combination of how far the
animation is through and also the
interpolator so any accelerate
decelerate is applied to that as well
and so we just again call set position
on that
so the on animation update override it
gets invoked as the next frame is being
prepared so literally that's your
opportunity to do whatever changes you
want to make and then the frame will get
drawn unlike the handler which is just
going to happen every 16 milliseconds
regardless of you know when you're
drawing you your next frame this happens
synchronized with that that rendering
framework now the interesting thing is
or important thing is you want to make
sure you complete your execution within
16 milliseconds otherwise you're going
to miss that draw and you're going to
get jank or jitter the actual animation
of the value we're just we're not really
using that as you can see we say ignored
because we're animating from 0 to 1 but
it's we're not actually utilizing that
at all so let's talk about object
animator which is also available from
honeycomb upwards but Ice Cream Sandwich
adds some other nice options
I suppose so here we're using an object
animator and we can just create so if
you see down on this line we just create
an object animator of the marker and its
property position we pass it in a type
of valuator which basically tells the
animation framework how to animate
between custom object types so in this
case
it's a latitude/longitude object and we
just passed in the final position so
there's no need to call market position
at the start of the animation which is
quite nice so the type of valuator is
very simple in fact it's very similar to
our lat/long interpolator object which
we'll show you in the next section so
the I mean the other advantage that I
can see here is that we've actually got
significantly less code to do this now
then when we started so you can
obviously group properties you can group
different objects in here as well so you
can animate things you know in bundles
yeah this works well with the property's
value holder for example yeah all right
so that's animation now let's switch
back to our tablet Chris why don't you
walk us through the next problem
okay so our animation is very simple
we're just animating the latitude and
longitude values of the lat/long object
separately so this has some problems on
the surface of the earth where things
wrap around the dateline so the 180th
longitude is actually the same point as
minus 180 longitude so you'll notice if
we try to animate across the mark is
going to go all the way around the world
instead of taking the shortest path so
we can fix this very simply let's go
over to the code so here's our broken
interpolator it just takes the Latin
long and and takes a linear
interpolation of each value and our
fixed one just figures out whether we
should take a shorter path or not so it
just sees if the distance it needs to
travel is more than 180 degrees so let's
switch back to the tablet and just see
what happens there so this is the broken
one where we're traveling around the
world to get to that that shortest
distance if we just switch to our fixed
one you'll notice that we get that path
yeah so it's very simple so you may
notice that the marker doesn't exactly
follow this polyline that we've added to
the map so the polyline that we're using
has a geodesic property which means that
it's taking the shortest path on the
surface of the earth as opposed to a
straight line on the surface of the map
so we can if we want at our market to
follow the polyline we can use similar
spherical math mathematics to do this
interpolation instead switching back to
the laptop yep so this one's quite a bit
more complex you probably won't be
writing this function yourself instead
you should probably just copy and paste
it or include the Android Maps utility
library but basically it just does this
spherical math so if we switch back to
the tablet because here it is broken
just to show you that it's actually not
following that line yeah and let's
switch to a spherical yeah so let's
let's go near the poles for example
where this is more obvious so yeah so
you can see there's quite a quite a
large bow and the mark is following the
line exactly and if we go back to the
broken one you'll see that it literally
line goes straight across there so so
the spherical method is very useful if
you want this market to follow a line
like we are here or if your markers have
some sort of actual geographic
importance like perhaps a plane on the
map or something like that
just animating the latitude and
longitude separately is fine for short
distances or if you don't really care
about any geographic properties and it's
probably quite a bit faster than the
spherical methods there's a lot of maths
in there yeah so please do check out the
the code that we have here we'll put an
annotation in into the video gonna be on
anchors face and we we hope you found
this useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
