our very own Sona here bear with me for
this second last question of the day
which is about a kind of important topic
it's about the kind of holy grail of app
developers because it's about revenues
and if it's about revenues it's about
money that will make your business grow
so we do the good old hands up game one
more time just to keep you a bit moving
after the break
hands up if you optimize and measure
lifetime value already that's not just
like 20% maybe out of those who keep
your hands up out of those who measure
in optimized lifetime value already how
many of you would do you do it would say
you do it really well and you wouldn't
change a thing if you could well okay I
think we haven't had that in London or
Paris so that's zero percent of the
audience which in turn means to the
presentation is highly relevant so
that's good
lifetime value in the app's world it's
quite a heavy topic especially in the
late afternoon hours we're going to try
to get it to you with this structure
first of all a little bit like in
driving school we're going to go into
the theoretical foundations of lifetime
value modelling and of predictive
analysis and secondly we're going to go
into a bit more practical perspective
applying your theoretical knowledge and
going into best practices that you can
actually use in your own businesses now
let's start directly with the first part
predictive analysis is the underlying
theory that helps you answer any kind of
question you ask yourself about the
future of your business it helps you
answer any kind of or to prove any kind
of hypothesis right or wrong so
predictive analysis is really a theory
lifetime value is part of this theory
but by far not the only one now it
enables you to forecast users behavior
and as you can see on the slide here
this woman seems to have a retail shop
so she's asking herself what products
should I put in my shop like where
should I put the products in my shop
how many products would it put should I
put in my shop how frequent will users
or buyers come to my shop and purchase
goods what's the cost of acquiring
customers to my shop and what's the
lifetime value of my products in my of
my users in my shop now for predictive
analysis there are very simple models
that you can apply to answer those
business critical questions and they're
very complex ones simple models could
really be let's say you have a social
app and you're asking a specialist to
give you an analysis of how much revenue
is you could actually make using ad
monetization that's fairly simple and
helps you understand that question right
or to give the answer to that question
there are also extremely complex models
some of which are really higher maths so
I'm not going to go in depth into those
but be aware that some some structures
like Pareto net binomial value and so on
could be important here if you want to
read up on that please feel free to do
so to run predictive analysis who would
have thought so we need data right and
if we want data we need tools so if you
want to answer those if you want to
answer those business questions you have
to be able to put the right data in
right there are three things to remember
here first of all choose the right
metrics come comes kind of obvious
typical metrics would be engagement data
retention data like Nikko and Maxim
talked about before number of active
users you might be expecting frequency
of visits recency of the last purchase
or the last visit and so on and so forth
make sure that you put the variables
that answer the question
secondly the importance of those
variables that you're feeding into the
data models actually depends on several
on several questions first of all type
of the app if you're a social app you
care about the engagement whereas if
you're a real estate app you assume that
engagement is kind of cyclical so users
will only look for apartments or houses
in a very innovative like very few
months of a year or of a decade lastly
depending on the analytical model that
you're actually using importance vary as
well so if you're using a very complex
mathematical model you will need a lot
more data than
if you're using a simple one also the
treatment of data and the ability of
your tool to process it is highly
important so it has to be able to import
data quickly it has to be able to
cluster it according to the question of
the hypothesis you're feeding in and it
has to be able to treat the data quickly
and to give the output to you as soon as
you need that's data predictive analysis
however doesn't only depend on the data
you have from your analytical tools it
also depends on some contextual factors
one example being do you have a
contractual or a non contractual
relationship to your user a contractual
relationship could be your electricity
bill right or it could be a subscription
in a news app that's a contractual
relationship it gives you already the
lifetime of how long will you get your
fees where you're the money you charge
from the user whereas a non-contractual
the user can just bounce or turn
whenever he or she wants to stop playing
a game stop buying your retail app and
so on so this factor will obviously
influence the predictive analysis as
soon as you're talking about for
instance revenues also predictive
analysis will be influenced by the stage
in which you're in so if you're a
startup and you're very new to the
market you have to persuade a lot of
people that your startup is actually a
good idea
investors stakeholders your users and so
on so you might make more aggressive
assumptions that will reflect in your
predictive analysis model if you're a
mature business you've been around for a
couple of years you know your market you
know your users you will take more
conservative assumptions that also
influences now like I said in the
beginning predictive analysis that's
just a theory because it underlies
lifetime value it's the fear IAM which
is this built why are we talking about
lifetime value why are we giving 45
minutes of our time to lifetime value
and why is it the last session of the
day well because it's really important
so that's why you need to give me your
last bit of attention that you're having
lifetime value makes you understand the
value that users have for you it makes
you understand what revenue you will
generate in the future it makes you
understand which channels are the right
channels to invest in where should you
put your resources
and what's actually going to be the
outcome what's going to be the dividend
for yourself or for your investors it
can answer you a whole lot of questions
when asking those sorry when asking
those questions can give you a whole lot
of answers a popular example is many
newspaper apps ask me should we invest
in mobile web or should we invest in
apps well essentially you should think
about lifetime value it will help you
it's one of the metrics but it's a good
one to look at if you calculate lifetime
value there are some pitfalls and I want
to point them out before we actually go
into the maths itself first of all make
sure your growth strategy is not just
focused on maximizing lifetime value
like I said it's one metric but it
should be rather an effect than a cause
right the lifetime value if it increases
it should be the result of actions that
you take on your product when your
marketing strategy in your communication
strategy and so on and so forth lifetime
value should also not be your
competitive advantage so if you have
let's assume you have a lifetime value
of 50 as RF $100 and your competitor why
why ever you know that has $50 don't get
lazy on that because it's a temporary
snapshot so if you get lazy on the hire
lifetime value you get and you don't
continue to develop for your users you
this might have bad repercussions a
second point is a too optimistic
lifetime value would lead you to an
excess in investment and we all know
what it means that means you go into the
red numbers remember lifetime value is
based on assumptions so assumptions can
be wrong and so lifetime value shouldn't
be the only criteria and you should look
in two different scenarios on how to
calculate it conservative versus
aggressive let's make an example of cost
of acquiring customers in theory the
cost of acquiring customers could be as
equal to lifetime value right if it's
higher you're in the red numbers which
is a bad sign only very few investors
actually allow that if it's your growth
strategy a rule of thumb that was told
to us is 30 to 40 percent of your
lifetime value should be the maximum
that you spend on customer acquisition
costs now we get to the calculation
later and there are some other things
too
to look out for but that's the basic
assumption that's the rule of thumb
right Maps so the formula you see here
is the basis of every other lifetime
value formula you're going to find
around right lifetime value depends on
engagement retention monetization I
think it was Maxine who had that on his
slides as well so he took my message
away but it's true it depends on those
three variables lifetime value for a
certain period equals lifetime times
average revenues per user right sounds
fairly simple now let's look at the
intuitive different variables first the
lifetime value period so the lifetime
value you're going to going to get out
of your equations will heavily depend on
the time frame for which you calculated
a user that has a certain lifetime value
for 180 days LTV calculation we have a
very different value for 365 day life
time period calculation what factors
influence your life time period decision
so I'm going to say LTV because I'm
really truly easy to say lifetime value
every time so what factors influence
this first of all the business nature is
your app is your business nature long or
is it short circle is it
no loom peak games app which is relevant
for a couple of months or is it in a
software-as-a-service business which
users might be using for years and years
secondly business model advertising
non-contractual business model
subscriptions contractual business model
you'll choose a different life for s or
period and stage of company again will
influence that so startups tend to make
aggressive assumptions so they go for a
longer life lifecycle come mature
businesses would go for a shorter one la
mattina on this example has an average
lifetime of their subscriptions of 15
months so that's the lifetime variable
not the period however they decide to
calculate the period for one and for two
years why do they do that because they
want to see how the numbers change
between those two models right they
funnel it together they look at the
aggregate and they take decisions based
on it
isolated to each other that's for them
to understand how it actually defers
that's the nice example here lifetime
calculation now this curve the retention
the survival curve so for lifetime
retention is critical right because it
essentially tells you the opportunities
that you have to convert a user into a
paying user so lifetimes also highly
correlated to engagement because the
more engaged user is the more likely he
is to really to be retained the more
life time he will have again there are
very very different ways of calculating
life time some very simple ones and some
very complex ones we heard that before I
know first of a simple model for
instance you would define a moment of
churn when it's churn actually happening
for you let's say you say if a user is
two weeks inactive he's turned that's my
definition of it let's say you look at
your curves and you find out well on
average after six months that's when
users are getting inactive hence that's
my that's my turn and that's my active
that's my average lifetime now there are
also very complex ones which are based
on those survival curves we're going to
get to that later I promise
lastly our monetization metric where
prices come in average revenue per user
now that's typically not that difficult
to determine because it's usually total
monthly revenues / - the active users
giving you the average revenues per
month make sure that you're doing that
you're taking the right units so you
should have the same units then when you
do a lifetime calculation right that's
the basic that's the basic calculation
of it now you might ask sir I have to
drink in between because otherwise I
can't bear it um you have might ask
yourself what's cost what about cost
many developers in fact don't only look
at revenues they do look at costs as
well because in real life you want to
know how your net lifetime value
actually looks like so what you would do
is typical top-down method you take the
revenue you earned you deduct all
variable costs and you get into variable
contribution right so be aware that
variable contribution can
three four different user segments and
that's something also to look at
obviously the more user segments you
define and four the more user segments
you make this analysis the more tricky
it will be in the end to calculate your
lifetime value but it's worth it also
you might ask yourself well if I am a
very long cycle app how how should I do
it with future revenues that occur far
out in the in the future that's when the
discount rate comes in so like some of
you might have learned in investment
calculations you discount future cash
flows into net present value so that's
very important because if you think
about the example if you have ten euros
today those 10 euros won't buy you the
same amount of goods in five years right
inflation so that's something to take
into consideration here because your
investments today will be impacted by
those revenues tomorrow in the best case
scenario would be refinanced that's
something to take into account as well
right so that's it for the theory like I
said in the introduction we will take
the theory first and we will then apply
it into practice now as you see I'm a
passionate motor biker
you can see that here I'm a very
passionate motor biker and together with
some of my biker pals we came up with
the idea to develop an app specifically
for motor bikers
right we want to showcase the nicest
routes across Europe the nicest hotels
the best places to drink your
non-alcoholic beers with your bike
repels so we came up with this app idea
and we're bootstrapping this app hence
we want to know what's going to happen
with our investment and how can we
refinance it and where should we invest
it in order to determine which
monetization model we choose we talked
to some context we have across the
industry and we wanted to figure out how
they do it with their LTV calculations
first of all we found that it's
essentially for pure business models and
many hybrid business models prevailing
in the industry you have premium apps
you have subscriptions you have in-app
purchases or freemium if ads and you
have hybrid models in reality
hybrid models are the most common ones
in the industry let's start with premium
the good news is premium is the easiest
to calculate lifetime value because your
LTV essentially equals the price now
your user acquisition costs also tend to
be very accurately calculated because
you can just base it on the LTV you're
having our best-case scenario on the net
LTV you're saying now that being said
that is a pov it means usually you will
have hybrid models especially with
premium right we talked to some contacts
at Cameron gong and they're one of the
one of the most popular photography apps
in play so they're havin they're havin a
premium business model and they told us
that the price is the key for them and
the price has to be right you have to be
able to offer the user the exact price
point he or she is willing to buy
they're doing loads of testing around
these two pounds 99 using price
elasticity testing methods using indices
like the Big Mac index or certain
certain purchasing power indexes in
order to set the right price also for
comma Ringo when it comes to maximizing
lifetime value they're looking into two
main things store ratings and reviews
and store listing we heard a lot about
those topics already today but this
actually confirms it if the moment of
truth truth comes and the user is
supposed to buy in your app before he's
ever seen it or seen anything that may
be a promotional video or screenshots
you have to have good ratings even more
than in any other model and you have to
have reviews that give direct feedback
that's a bit blurry the best camera app
out there period
I've tried them all go ahead buy it
you'll like it so the neat dough is kind
of reviews because that's the word of
mouth that you need so what are they
doing to optimize it first of all they
are super proactive of customer service
goes without saying they're responding
to bad to bad reviews they're also
responding to good reviews but they're
actually they're actually actioning it
as so that means whenever they get
feedback it's real feedback so they
worked on it and whenever they get
praised they ask the guy to to
this engagement also they're trying to
maximize the ratings so what they are
doing is the typical user prompt but
they don't just prompt the user whenever
they look at loyal users that they
prompt first they look at prompting them
only when they have good network
coverage so that they can actually fill
it out they have a nice mechanism in the
in the message that the user if it
doesn't want to be bothered can just
click don't bother me again and they
will try everything not to annoy the
user because nothing is worse than being
prompted the entire time and in the end
you're like okay screw that I'm going to
give you this one star right so that's
very that's very important also their
store listing they would never use human
trance as I will never use pot
translators or Google Translate they
would always use humans because in the
end that has to be natural right store
listing experiments is key ingredient
furgus talk to it beforehand talked
about it beforehand according to come
Ringo actually the first time they
optimized this entire funnel or it is
part of the funnel it led to 25%
increase in downloads that's very
interesting
now we learned about premium the next
thing we wanted to the next business
model we wanted to look at what's of the
subscription business we want because we
wanted to take away this pay without
having seen it right and wanted to
increase maybe installs so we looked at
subscriptions now a good a good friend
of mine explained me the following in
subscriptions the ARPU is fairly
straightforward because it's fixed right
you having your monthly quarterly your
annual subscription and the rate is
fixed so you know that beforehand the
LTV in subscriptions is really driven by
lifetime which is equal to the average
subscription rate that again depends on
the renewal rates that you're having at
the end of the term and that again
depends on churn right is everybody I
hope everybody follow me
so churn rates and renewal rates are
crucial that's why life time here in
this example is 1 / turn ratio so this
changed right and it's very concrete you
have to have your rate at your turn
ratio which is the opposite of your
renewal rates now
our poo is fixed lifetime is 1/10 ratio
what about the lifetime value period
now usually lifetime value period should
be your average subscription length
right because you can't you can take
this assumption a priori because you
know what's the average length because
you have this kind of contractual
relationship now in practice many of the
subscription-based developers or
businesses would also calculate based on
180 days or 365 days just like we've
seen before in the example with la
mattina right there are certain caveats
to calculating lifetime value for
subscription-based apps first exclude
free trials right those are not revenues
to exclude them second exclude any form
of promotion or introductory pricing
that you might be doing or at least take
the revenue that you're actually going
to get form from it secondly segment by
cohorts it's worth it to compare the
different the different lifetimes that
you're actually having so the quarterly
subscription versity annual at least
right thirdly discount future cash flows
because you're having a contractual
business your life that might be much
longer hence you need to discount them
net present value fourth cross-platform
attribution now let's take the example
of a newspaper app your business is
across many platforms right so you have
to be able to attribute for lifetime
value across those platforms to compare
it so that means you should be measuring
in the best-case scenario of the same
formula on mobile web on apps on desktop
what's the lifetime value of the
monetization form that you're actually
using right take the formula with the
percentage in terms of usage and you get
an average to have that's like as a
basis so measurement in subscription app
LT V equals subscription fee times turn
which is subscription fee times 1
divided by turn right there is an
interesting paradox for subscription
apps and I'm not sure how many of you
met it and I'm not going to do a show of
hands again
it's the negative term paradox so let's
assume my motorbike app only has 2
paying subscribers one of them is Maxime
my colleague here who is a biker as well
and the other is my girlfriend now for
whatever reason Maxime decides after one
year that he's not going to prolong his
subscription because it's taking tired
of motorbiking so the only customer I
have left this my girlfriend now 50% of
my revenue in theory is gone and 50% of
my users in theory are gone right
however I managed to upsell the super
duper extraordinary VIP package to my
girlfriend for $10 more than the actual
subscription cost of Maxim was right at
50% use a turn but I have no but I have
110 percent of revenue so that's the
negative turn paradox you upsell to the
to the users that are merged most
engaged and renew their subscriptions
because you can offer them additional
content that's worth it for them to pay
for it and that's what most successful
software as a services or utilities apps
are actually trying to do upselling to
the users that are core read up on that
it's I think it's fairly it's a very
interesting framework we're not going to
go deeper here but read up on this
DramaFever I talked to a guy at
DramaFever Korean Korean TV series
streaming app right and they analyze the
in very different cohorts when it comes
to measuring their lifetime value there
you can looking at user life because for
them it's really obviously the longer
that it there is a certain moment like
after 1-2 months of having subscribed in
the app this user will stick around
forever so they built this loyalty
fairly quickly so they will look at this
point of time when they define their
cohorts right they will also look after
for instance churn by payment methods
Visa Debit Visa credit bank bank debit
this seems to have an impact on their on
their measurement think about it if it
might have for yours and the annual day
they analyze monthly and annual passes
separately because this year hole will
different lifetime value coming around
there some other interesting points for
dramafever churn rates up
is on the last three months so the
average of the last three months they
don't take a very short term metric like
one month just because of data
reliability and significance and they
don't take very long term rates because
they're changing the product
continuously the disk will change as
well
secondly they calculate net lifetime
value because they want to know about
cost they apply a discount rate going
the net present value because long cycle
did not they're trying not to spend more
than thirty to forty percent off their
LTV on customer acquisition costs so
this kind of confirms everything that I
was saying before but it's interesting
to see that being put in practice
tactics that maximize lifetime value now
I think we've heard a lot about tactics
to maximize engagement and retention
already they are essentially the same
tactics that you would apply for LTV
because it's depending on those
variables now for DramaFever
interestingly free trials had little to
no impact on the opposite it actually
sometimes had a negative impact because
the user would download an app following
a specific series now the season would
run out of that series before the user
actually ever had to pay for the app so
it backfired
very often DramaFever also tries to make
want to make their promotions really
impactful they're offering very few
promotions but they're making sure that
if they offer promotions they're very
good promotions and very appealing to
the user they offer multiple tiers I
think many subscription-based apps do
that giving different different levels
of access and features to the different
users and having different prices which
they test for any user segment that they
might observe as I mentioned before
they're segmenting quite a lot and two
very important points they're minimizing
passive churn and they're trying to
discourage active chernow passive churn
is turn that users encounter because of
some technical difficulty let's say your
credit card is expired so you can't
renew let's say you don't have
sufficient funds in your bank account so
you won't be renewing the debts passive
turned are trying to have really
proactive customer service realizing as
soon as there is a complication and
counteracting it they're also trying to
discourage active churn which is users
just choosing not to renew their
subscriptions how do they do that they
put special
let's put special special deals in front
of the user whose subscription will run
out in the next two weeks and try to get
him back into the service all right next
up freemium my pals and I were
discussing and we say all of the games
are kind of doing it maybe we should
look into in-app purchases and making
some of our content free and having to
user pay for others now freemium apps
LTV depends a lot of end user engagement
right and we see again the survival
curve here when you talk about lifetime
for freemium apps you're taking a
slightly different approach them with
subscriptions in the lifetime
calculation for freemium apps you're
picking reference dates on this survival
curve you're picking one day for
instance seven days and 28 days you're
then looking how does my historical data
for various user cohorts what data
points do I get on those dates on those
reference dates you will get out an
equation which looks like the one up
there where T is the is the day and ABC
are the coefficients now you will see
you will have lots of various equations
so that's the next step you're trying to
get out the so a cumulative deviation of
those equations in order to get to an
average and that average would be your
lifetime now I mean that sounds a little
complex but in the end it makes sense
right it's the accurate average of of
your lifetime here now your our pool
that will really be depending on the
units you sold during a certain time the
price of the units you sold so the
calculation is total average revenue in
a period divided by the active users you
have in those people in this period
again look at the time the same time
units please lastly the period usually
SP is a standard you're looking at 180
days or you're looking at 365 days so
it's fairly standard because in the end
you're not having any kind of we're
having very flexible churn dates most
presumably in your non-contractual
business model right so the formula as
we have it is the one that we actually
saw in a very beginning
LTV period
was lifetime times our pool okay OkCupid
is one of the biggest dating apps in
Google Play they're actually using two
business models so it's kind of a hybrid
app but we're going to focus on in app
purchases for them for the moment
OkCupid uses an in-house customized
formula so we're not really giving it on
that slide because it includes both of
those business models however there are
certain variables are certain let's say
factors that impact how they set the
variables in a crucial way first of all
they're looking at signals that show
engagement so if user is in an active
messaging thread if he's having
conversations with people in their app
that's a signal of engagement so they
would be looking at those to define
engagement retention and churn rates sir
secondly they're also looking at various
various cohorts right again OkCupid they
look for instance below 35 and above 30
35 of age because it shows that there is
major differences between those years
ago horse they're also looking into
genders and they're also looking at
geographies lastly they see that churn
levels typically are very high but
beyond the first usage retention gets a
lot higher so for them a major major
main job is to actually get users over
this first week because then that's
where they get the engagement that
retains them now when it comes to
maximizing LTV OkCupid told us that for
them optimizing conversions for in-app
purchases mainly depends on a couple of
factors first of all they're trying to
optimize creatives messaging calls to
action in their messages on those
prompts like you see here one of them
they're trying to customize that and do
a whole lot of testing for different
cohorts for different geographies
genders ages and so on in order to get
the best possible conversion rate
they're also trying to optimize when
they put the prompt based on the context
in which the user is in right now so if
you're in a conversation or if you're in
the kind of who visited my profile view
that's where you get the prompt because
that's the premium functionality that
they want to sell that so that's how
they put you up to the miracle who was
the person who actually viewed your
profile and again also like like
dramafever beforehand they're very
selective with the promotions so they
will only offer promotions again if
they're in high-impact they typically
give either limited time 48 hour maximum
give this kind of urgency to the user or
they do it they do it with a percentage
off in terms of 20% as a minimum usually
quite impactful promotions with this
kind of this kind of testing OkCupid
claim that they've increased 20% in
purchases for the for the eyepiece
alright I think I'm going to speed up a
little bit
ads ads everybody's doing it so we
figured we look into that arm now the
Guardian gave us some interesting
insights here typically they choose one
year as a period for lifetime alkylation
because they say it's a good way to find
out if an if an investment has actually
has an ROI on which projects they choose
at and which they should focus on
lifetime is different for ads
monetization because generally you're
interested in user impressions because
every impression on every screen gives
you an opportunity to monetize that user
as you know so retention is important
but this session like visits sessions
per visit screens per visit and so on
that is really that is really the key of
lifetime calculations The Guardian has a
custom a custom formula also in-house
for this where they essentially look at
those factors and they're trying to get
kind of a normal distribution across all
of those factors in order to determine
their lifetime they won't share that
formula but that's that's how they do it
our Pugh again that's different here
because with ads as you know the price
varies quite a lot it's based on the
sales channel direct sales indirect
sales the ads formats is it a native ad
is interstitial it depends on the
geographies it depends on the buyers
depends on the users you're having that
the audiences it depends on the context
of where the ads appear and so on and so
forth so loads of different factors be
aware bring it down to one price I mean
that goes without saying
have cost per day cost per mile cost per
whatever bring it down to most commonly
CPM and then get it in defeated into
your fitted into your your equation
lifetime value period maybe maybe 360
days one at ninety days equals lifetime
times average CPM times average number
of ads per month right
again that's the simple that's a basic
formula
The Guardian adapts this one segment
back Awards so the Guardian usually
takes four different cohorts for
different users or segments based on
loyalty of those users and the number of
impressions day they they cause also the
cohort they segment those cohorts into
the geographies and they're using the
same lifetime value calculation for
mobile web and for apps to compare right
last model of the day then we're done
that's also that's by the way the last
model is also where the bike gets much
more fancy
so hybrid models are arguably the most
complex models in lifetime value
calculation because you combine right
you combine different different formulas
now many of the app so most of the apps
do that because that's how you maximize
it right you try to have a certain
variety of monetization options that you
give to your user because you want to
actually let the user choose what fits
for him what works for him or her so
here you see for instance a matrix that
booga Sharapova's popular gaming
developer now you can see on the x-axis
progression of the player in the game
and on the y-axis the spending level now
if a new player comes in and he plays
for a very long time he ends up in that
quadrant that quadrant
muga will serve him interstitial video
interstitial abs because that's where
they get the best prices Nats
monetization because he never spent a
dime on their net purchases now on the
other hand if there is a new player
coming downloading and installing and
downloading downloading and installing
the app and he spends a lot of money in
very early stages he will be immediately
offered VIP packages because that's
where
games will try to upsell and include the
user further and further right
that's an interesting model and I think
it shows very well like which user you
would want to offer which kind of
monetization now I'm a big fan of
ultimate guitar tabs' we had a hangout
with them for them they combined two
business model one premium and one is
life is in app purchases premium
lifetime value equals price in-app
purchases they are tearing it down as
well it's interesting actually they told
us that they're having tears of $10
$9.99 $7.99 and $2.99 depending on how
long the user has been has been having
the app paid for downloaded but only
using the basic version so longer you
have it actually the cheaper it gets
it's interesting to remember if any of
you played a guitar they claimed that
40% of the users are actually upgrading
within within the app and 65% of their
revenues come from the in-app purchases
that's an interesting number they say
that 20 percent of their premium
upgrades occur in the onboarding safe so
two hours after downloading and
installing the app they then get VIP
branding in they give the user an
insight into which content he will be
able to consume after he paid for the
premium segment that increased them
they're there they're in a purchase
conversion by 53 percent they again also
adjust the prices per country using
those indices that I mentioned before
plus 8% in downloads and again store
listing it's like it's like a message
we're trying to hammer into your heads
but store listing experiments for them
as well critical localizing the entire
funnel makes makes them more successful
14% increase in downloads all right so
fury check practice check five business
models we did that I discussed right now
there's a lot of information right and
for me and my pals developing this app
now we first have to kind of get our
heads together and think a little bit
what we do with that information crunch
some numbers in order to be able to
choose which monetization we want to do
and where we want to invest our
in which segments we want to invest our
money but I think for us and for you as
well there are three main takeaways of
that presentation
first of all lifetime value is not an
end in itself it's not a strategy when
you calculate lifetime value be
realistic make sure that you take into
account the cost of your actually having
variable costs make sure you're
discounting if you have a long sales
cycle and make sure that your cost of
acquisition is at a fairly decent level
secondly the formula lifetime value
depends on your lifetime times your our
pool the basis of everything thirdly and
that's where I have to agree with Nikko
engagement is the new black because
engagement is the metric that is much
harder to optimize than our pools so if
you get to a high engagement and a low
retention as a high engagement and high
retention and a low churn rate that's
where you're going to be successful so
work on that and then you optimize for
monetization thank you very much
