users to shop the entire travel
marketplace for flights and hotels rough
edge and the CEO co-founder a Tweaker we
describe ourselves as a search through
an online travel marketplace we launched
Android app in early 2014 and since then
the growths been really rapid my name is
Graham Hills
I'm the chief product officer there's an
active community of developers out there
developing for the Android ecosystem so
it's really easy for our team to share
their experience and also learn from
other developers the move to material
design with a natural progression we
wanted to provide a more native
experience for our users and a UI that
they could simply just understand and
not learn specifically for using we go
zap 62% of our app users are using
Android and for every new mobile app
installed two out of three of those are
from Android
my name is so hip and I'm lead Android
engineer here we go last year when we
decided to redesign our whole app using
material design principles the first
thing we did was to migrate to Android
studio which took a bit of a getting
used to things went quite smoothly
afterwards with the help of new
libraries provided by Google I've heard
you CIU Android designer for we go we
moved to shredder material design using
strong color and both typography to
focus attention on content the floating
action buttons push like 40% more user
registration we optimized the apps quite
a lot which made the app experience
really good and really fast some honey
metal on the vice president of mobile
and we go within two months our app on
install rates started dropping by 25 to
30 percent our monthly users retention
improved by 300% the most important
thing that we're proud of is that our
app ratings were around three point
seven out of five which is pre average
in a space of less than a year we've
improved that to four point three to
grow your app ratings while scaling
while still getting millions of new
users in to be some of the best in the
industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
