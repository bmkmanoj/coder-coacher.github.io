years ago from the US one of the biggest
reasons why I decided to move home was
to spend more time with my mom that was
about the same time that I met my
co-founder Lily as well both of us were
at a stage of our lives where we were
spending more time with our egypt
parents and in-laws we want to build a
solution that provides quality home care
to enable the independent living at home
we felt that we could combine Lily's
backgrounds and healthcare my background
is in business and technology and create
this improved experience within the home
care space when our seniors are not well
they will not want to check and sound in
a hospital and lose control of their
lives all of them who want to be careful
at home kamesh AB creates the
accessibility to people who needs care
for themselves and for their loved ones
I was stunned at 9 o'clock and na 6:30
so my mom will be alone during my office
hours she told me that she cannot take
care of a cell like babying clothing and
simple cooking Haley was selected from
home age to be a Carol for my mom she's
very friendly and she really tell me no
worry I guess go to work I will take
care of her
Kelly also took some pictures so I know
what she has done for my mom it's very
convenient at anytime any way I can know
what is going on so the start on Android
program really made a huge difference in
our mobile app development they were
invested in our growth and the
experience we were providing our users
every single discussion was anchored
around how can we improve this
experience whether it's in material
design in UI UX they have been helping
us look at it from a user's perspective
one of the key outcomes of being part of
the start on Android program is that we
got featured on the Play Store recently
it's been so great to have the support
of not just having a great team but also
members within the tech community like
Google Play I would absolutely recommend
the start of Android program to other
startups a lot of the value isn't just
getting external feedback oftentimes you
can develop in a vacuum
and just having skilled experts tell you
these are the areas that you need to
improve on you can really fast-track the
way you deliver these improvements to
your users our aspiration is to build a
huge community of care givers who are
trained and happy to help anyone without
huge app help just be a click away all
these seniors can age in confidence
knowing that they always have around for
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
