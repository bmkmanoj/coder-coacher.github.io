insist on a flea market on your mobile
phone and every item visualized when the
mobile device
what about simulates a walk around your
neighborhood and you shall discover in
the Honda your neighborhood Sally really
provides input see buying behavior be
relevant to a community experience there
was a point of my life and I decided
it's time to start a new challenge so
very survival in Barcelona is a one we
were only two people and master one
month of development we achieved a
number one position which painting the
place or one of the key Wado has been
its simplicity people from 15 year olds
to 60 has been selling the stuff on the
wall above site and more than 70% of our
users come from the Android platform my
name is Martin I work on one above as a
growth hacking manager we started this
interesting experiment one year ago and
after testing we optimized the organic
downloads by 17% at the beginning we
started testing too much things at the
same time so the result was incongruent
so we decided to move this step by step
what we decided to test for it was a
short description and we optimized 6% of
organic downloads for the next step we
spoke with our business intelligence -
and they told us which were the top
central so we did four different payment
with the four highlights of growth of
students how attractive was for the
users what we found out while testing
this is that they were to type of users
to the decisive users and exploring
users so what we did is to work on a
cover that will be very recognizable for
these decisive users using the main
slogan of well above and the things that
they saw on the TV are we even stuck in
the screen to see what impact this will
have and we see very good results when
creating your Google Play Store play you
have to think about the first impression
because it might be the only chance you
have to convince a user to download your
app
we started by what we have grown a
really huge family disagreeable success
has been something that is gonna happen
once in a lifetime and I'm very grateful
to have been able just to lead all this
team has been the toughest and the
greatest experience of my life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
