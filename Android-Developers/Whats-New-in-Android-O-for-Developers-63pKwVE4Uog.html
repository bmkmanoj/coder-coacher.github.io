Developer Preview relief of next version
of Android you can test your app explore
new features and provide feedback to our
team hi my name is Nasir Khan and I'm a
developer advocate with Android Android
Oh has more control over the
applications in background can do as
part of an effort to improve interactive
performance by improving RAM usage
Android nougat prevented apps from
receiving three specific implicit
broadcast such as the new photo
broadcast from manifest Eclair receivers
after targeting o will no longer receive
implicit broadcast to most manifest
declare receivers there are a few
exception that will still be allowed
such as would complete locale change
spectra explicit broadcast that target
the application package that are
registered in the manifest will still be
received like action my package place
and you can still register to receive
implicit broadcast while your avid
active on apps are getting Android Oh
background services now only run for a
short time after the app no longer has
visible activity or a foreground service
start service or service pending intent
will throw an illegal state exception
when the app is not in the foreground
foreground services that require a
persistent notification work as usual
and there's a new API to start a
foreground service directly start
service in program finally even if your
app doesn't target oh there will be few
changes first when your app enters the
cache state that is with no active
Android component anyway o'clock it
holes will be automatically released
second location updates will change apps
that request background location updates
will only get limited updates few times
per hour foreground services aren't
impacted so apps that do navigation or
track fitness can continue to get fast
updates while they are performing the
location dependent tasks if another app
is using location in the foreground then
your background app can get location
updates at the same frequency as the
foreground app you're constantly working
to improve user privacy so even if you
don't target oh you will notice a change
with Android ID
settings are secure in oh it will return
a different identifier for different
apps in other words it is now scoped per
app per user this new value will persist
across a pre-installed but for simple
standard system to help monetize app use
user resettable addressing ID instead
provided by Google Play services also
considering privacy apps targeting o
won't be able to get access to user
accounts using get accounts permissions
alone instead apps must rely on the
account using activity account owners
can now choose whether the accounts will
be visible to other apps and the account
using activity will be updated
accordingly Android o adds notification
channels to give you those more
fine-grained control of notifications
and app developers more flexibility to
send different types of notifications
with less risk of being completely
blocked a notification channel is a
named category of notifications from a
single app users can lock a single
category or alter this behavior such as
changing buttons adding vibration and
lights and altering the lockscreen
privacy you can use channels to have
different category of notifications for
example a chat app may show two
different chat conversations and user
may be able to apply different settings
to them a long pressure notification
brings the channel settings all apps
targeting o must implement channels
otherwise the notification will not show
up it's super easy to do just to create
a channel and then call set channel
within the notification builder there is
much more in you notification like
ability to snooze set timeouts to cancel
background colors of notification
display make sure to check out the
details filling out forms is the
time-consuming and error-prone task the
new autofill framework makes it easy for
apps to help their users through this
Android o allows users to select an
auto-fill app similar to the way that
keyboard app is selected the autofill
app is responsible for storing and
securing user data such as addresses
credit card information user names and
even facades there's also a new view API
that you need to implement in
some views to ensure their metadata is
exposed to the autofill framework
picture-in-picture is now available for
all devices not just Android TV all an
app has to do is to call enter
picture-in-picture more method from the
resumed or pause state where the system
supports entering the temperature just
like multi-window the activity gets into
pause state when into children mode so
if you have a media app make sure that
the playback continues in pause state as
well set picture-in-picture args allow
activity to specify the picture in which
your aspect ratio along with custom
remote actions that allow the user to
interact with the picture and pictured
activity directly rather than having the
app explicitly use the presentation API
regular activities can now be launched
on second.we displays these displays
have per display based configuration and
resource management this means that some
part of the configuration such as screen
with DB screen high DPI layout density
DB will be set according Judit according
to the display on which the activity
currently resides fonts are now a fully
supported resource type in Android you
can use the get font method to get a
phone by its ID you can also define
entire font families in XML declaring
the font style and weight along with the
font resource there is much more in the
develop to preview than this please make
sure to check out the previous site and
learn more about show and the preview
program and check out the Android
developer channel for more videos like
these thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
