imagine a trio communion I'm from a very
modest background from a single one
family in baman da Weibring of I first
wanted to be a medical doctor but to
innovate in the medical space you need
like 30 years of experience but then I
realized that with mobile technology I
could innovate and generate change in
people's lives a lot faster I'm Conrad
and who as a doctor one of my biggest
fights to try to solve this problem of
maternal and infant mortality and trying
to use technologies we would attend this
liver would areas as one of the greatest
things for me the question on our minds
was how come we see helpful maternal
infant mortality being such a very big
problem after the research we noticed
that it was promote education we saw
mobile as a very good channel due to the
penetration and together with dr. Conrad
with Sally to start gifted mom different
mom is an application which contains
basic and simplified information
concerning pregnancy breastfeeding and
vaccinations for children the beginning
was really an adventure but when we
built the app and started testing the
most really exciting because the
reaction of those who are using it up
they were really excited it was a
technology some of them had never seen
something like that before and also
having everything on one up all of them
wanted Harvey it was very important for
us to build a gif demo application to
make it lightweight in such a way that I
can easily download it also we provided
content that can be accessible even
offline the network coverage of in
Cameroon is very good maybe it's on the
right areas where you don't find
electricity you can really have access
to the Internet
we've noticed that 70% of smartphone
users across Africa on Android and once
we leverage on these to half a million
users across the continent in the next
three years consider the fact that
maternal mortality infant mortality is a
worldwide problem one of our objectives
is not only to concentrate cameraman
spread this concept to other developing
countries spending a lot of resources on
beauty health facilities going to come
but in a very long time but with
smartphone penetration we can actually
provide people with life-saving
information you seen the gifted mom up
on the Play Store was very very exciting
for us because it was one of our first
products out there and we were just
amazing how we could sit in our rooms
create something without their and is
accessible to the whole world when we
were building the application somewhat
our medical professionals were like this
is going to work I showed what you're
aiming to build is going to be like
productive and when he came out all of
them were shocked and they were like
encouraged that they went through the
app and give us all our ideas to develop
it more it makes me really proud and
it's also like motivation to keep moving
forward yeah he has been very inspiring
just seen the app that we have done
actually serving a purpose in our
communities and each time a woman is
worried Rogers loads the application and
we see popping up gifted mom it's like
this justice joy man and you're like I'm
going to go do better
