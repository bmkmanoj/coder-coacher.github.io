advocate and we're here to talk about
the Android 7.1 preview a couple of
weeks ago we announced that a Developer
Preview of Android 7.1 nougat was on the
way and just in case you haven't noticed
it's available now there's a few
differences between this preview and
others in the program since seven point
one is already launched on pixel we're
delivering the initial Developer Preview
at beta quality for the Nexus lineup of
devices the goal is to tease out any
device specific issues this means we've
already finalized the new API zazz API
level 25 and we've opened up publishing
on Google Play for apps targeting the
new API level so you can update your
apps as soon as you're ready
so what's new first of all Android 7.1
features a few changes specific to the
launcher app shortcuts allow you to add
both static and dynamic links to key
actions within your app users simply
long press your apps launcher icon to
reveal the app shortcuts then tap on a
shortcut to jump to the Associated
action each shortcut reference is an
intent each of which launches a specific
action or task and you can create a
shortcut for any action that you can
express as an intent for example you can
create intents for sending a new text
message making a reservation
playing a video continued game loading a
map location and much more you can
create shortcuts for your app statically
by adding them to a resource file in the
apk or you can add them dynamically at
runtime
static shortcuts are ideal for common
actions and dynamic shortcuts lets you
highlight actions based on users
preferences behavior location and so on
you can offer up to five shortcuts in
each of your apps after your app adds
shortcuts
they're available on any launcher that
supports them such as the pixel launcher
the default launcher on pixel devices
the now launcher the default launcher on
Nexus devices and other launchers that
provide support any app can create
shortcuts and any launcher app can add
support for shortcuts Android 7.1
provides an API for apps to register
shortcuts and launchers to read the
registered shortcuts apps can now define
circular Launcher icons which are used
on devices that support them and much of
this happens automatically when to
launch your request an app icon the
framework returns
either Android : icon or Android : round
icon depending on the device build
configuration you can use image assets
to do two design round icons you can
test your circular icons on a google
pixel device or by running the Android
emulator with a Google API emulator
system image targeting API level 25
something that feels related to the
launcher is enhanced live wallpaper
metadata in addition to the existing
metadata attributes such as label
description and author there are new
attributes for a context URL and title
to link users to more information about
the wallpaper this allows for a better
richer user experience when choosing
live wallpapers another seven-point-one
feature makes stickers and other rich
content available through soft keyboards
otherwise known as input method editors
or imes
the 7.1 SDK includes the commit content
API which provides a universal way to
send images and other rich content from
an IME directly to a text editor in an
app the API is also available in the
revision 25 version of the V 13 support
library with this API you can build
messaging apps that accept rich content
from any keyboard as well as keyboards
that can send rich content to any app
there are two other cool things in 7.1
that you might want to consider taking
advantage of the first of them is the
Storage Manager intent apps can now fire
the action manage storage intent taking
the user to the system's free up space
screen if your app requires more space
and it's currently available it can use
this intent to let the user delete
unneeded apps and content to free up
sufficient space another thing you can
take advantage of in your app is
checking to see if the device is running
as the demo user using the new user
manager is demo user method this allows
your app to customize the starting
experience to a potential customer when
running as a demo user and app might
provide more assistance to the user or
explain its features in more detail
there are a bunch of other features in
7.1 such as support for additional
Android wear densities and some
important telephony features check the
