very new to Google and player I only
joined the business in January this year
and while what a year it's been play is
a very exciting business very humbled to
see some of those stories there and we
have a very busy packed agenda today
some some incredibly cool stuff that
you're going to hear more about today
and my role is is pretty easy really to
talk about web play and Android are
within the emir region so let's get
started and we'll start by talking about
our platform about android which is
grown exponentially over the last seven
years since it was launched and we
announced an amazing milestone last year
that with past 1 billion active devices
which is a just an incredible number but
what is also a powerful number is that
1.5 million activations we are seeing
every single day and that's reflection
of the success of obviously Android on
smartphones and tablets but also as
Android has continued to expand on to
other platforms such as Android TV
wearables and even into cars and as that
ecosystem has expanded so is the number
of OE ends we work with now up to over
200 OEMs who are developing for Android
which again is a huge number and then to
just a kick off they finished off the
ecosystem piece the operator
partnerships we're working with carriers
across the world over 330 carries
selling Android devices and also
enabling play customers to purchase and
then in terms of share it so it's an
equally powerful story we looked at the
Android share within the Emir region on
smartphones and the great news here is
that that share has increased since last
year this is working with a research
company called canales and that shares
come up from seventy two percent to
seventy-seven percent so the momentum is
really with us and the story is good on
tablets as well three out of five
tablets in a mere now run on Android so
tremendous momentum and the future is
bright
the forecasts are that smart phones
would double over the next five years to
over 1.25 devices in a mere by 2019 and
as you can see the lion's share of that
growth is going to come from Android as
the big green bit in the bar chart there
in case you missed it so very exciting
few years ahead as Android continues to
expand into new markets and one word
area that is particularly exciting of
these emerging markets last year we
talked about Android one our product
director Michael soleski introduced this
initiative that Google is leading to try
and drive Android share into emerging
markets even with all the growth I just
talked about and you won out for people
on this planet have a smartphone and
Google's ambition is to help that next
five billion also come online Android
one is an initiative we work with OEMs
chipset manufacturers to bring quality
hardware at a very low cost into these
emerging markets and the exciting thing
or the most interesting thing I guess
for you guys in terms of Android one is
it the devices had the latest version of
Android on it which we all know is
incredibly important we announced last
year that we were bringing Android one
to market and I'm delighted to say that
since then we've launched Android one in
India Pakistan Thailand Indonesia the
Philippines Nigeria and Turkey and
within a mere there's a significant gum
continued expansion as we bring Android
one into Egypt Ghana Kenya spain morocco
and indeed jipped which i'm i've just
mentioned twice but the growth is
fantastic and we're really excited to
see how Android one can bring a really
quality experience at low-cost to even
more users in emerging markets so this
scale this huge gal and I think it's
safe to say we're the biggest app
platform in the world over 1 million
apps now live on the store and they've
been downloaded a phenomenal 50 billion
times and Android users are able to
download
your apps in nearly 200 markets and
importantly to pay for those apps in 134
markets and payments we know is key over
the last 12 months 12 months we've added
61 new forms of payments in 32 markets
which has enabled over 400 million
Android users to now purchase on play
with a new form of payment and we've
expanded in a number of key areas to
enable people to to pay on play with
different forms of payment DCB is now in
37 markets up from 25 markets in 2014
just a couple of weeks ago we signed a
really big deal with a telco called MTS
in Russia that now gives us virtually
one hundred percent coverage for
operator billing in the Russian market
gift cards are now live in 28 markets
from 14 out from 18 in 2014 and finally
PayPal which only we only one switched
on early last year and is now live in 21
markets and in markets like Germany
that's been a phenomenal driver to help
our growth and it was it was really
pleasing to see in February this year
app Annie talked about Google Play being
bigger in Germany than apple's app store
so enabling payments helps to enable the
ecosystem in the good news is it's
paying off for our developers for you
guys we announced that in 2014 we paid
out seven billion dollars to our
developer partners up from five billion
dollars in 2013 and up from two billion
dollars in 2012 and and the momentum mr.
weathers with significant growth as well
so a very very bright picture indeed so
you can hear a lot today about how we're
continuing to listen to you and to build
a better platform for you to distribute
your apps find your users and monetize
and I'm going to touch on to the three
of the key themes today and enhance
discovery opportunities how we can help
you find those users within the app more
tools to help you publish with
confidence and that making it easier to
help find and retain users
so let's let's start with enhanced
discovery um play is about connecting
you with the Android users that share
the same interests and passions and
needs as the products your building and
taking to market and a key part of what
we do is to try and make our store
experience personalized and relevant so
you just keep coming in so they're
delighted that they're finding that the
right apps and games that really really
excite them and the first area is to
make that store by personalizes we've
started to really work Google's
expertise in machine learning to make
that a more personalized experience to
make those recommendations come up as
soon as an au zur comes into the store
and we're building more types of
collections and increasing more types of
personalized personalization services
because we know that doubles the number
of app installs by giving people
relevant recommendations we've also
added guided search and this enables a
play play visitor to just search for a
broad generic term in this case
photography and what we then do is
provide them with relevant clusters
bringing together the types of apps that
you would expect to see under a search
term light photography in this case
photo editing apps and college apps and
we know that will introduce users to a
broad a range of apps and therefore
increasing downloads in a particular
search term like that and then finally
an area that we're quite interested in
seeing how it develops a topic based
discovery a sense is that users relate
much better to topics rather than like
hits or more apps that I think
recommended to you now bringing together
clusters under under titles such as
popular for the weekend and games that
are going to make you laugh and we think
that we'll have a lot more engagement
with our users on the store as well
families is a big theme for Google you
would have seen a lot going on within
Google around making out products and
services more relevant to families and
and and family safety and that's and
that's absolutely the case with play as
well before I oh we started working with
many of you guys around I arc ratings
and submission to have your your apps
categorized within the fan within the
family experience and I we announced
that and you've now seen this navigation
appearing within the store allowing
parents to to search by different age
categories by um badges even by popular
characters to find the content is right
for them and right for their families
this is this is a really big step for us
and we've seen some really huge numbers
in terms of increased uplift in apps
that are within the family browsing
experience so if you have a family app
please make sure it is categorized and
with it and within this experience and
besides make it easier for you for our
users to find great apps and games and
we've continued to listen to you and
build better tools to enable you to
publish and acquire users and more
importantly learn how you can improve
your products to retain those users the
list of tools and features you can see
has got longer and longer year after
year and and you're going to hear a lot
a lot more about really cool features
and functionalities that we're bringing
to market to enable you to build better
and one of the one of the consistent
things I've heard in a few months I've
been in the business as I've spoken to
developers is the power of play to
iterate to put products into market
quickly to select you to select groups
of users and find out what's working and
what's not what's not what's not working
before you start to spend money driving
acquisition to learn the lessons around
retention before they come through and
there's just three examples before I get
kicked off the stage that I went to
highlight we got I had the pleasure of
going to see the weaker guys earlier on
in the year in there very cool offices
in Berlin and I know a couple of the
guys are here today I'm really pleasing
to hear how they're using beta testing
staged rollouts again to learn more
about how users are enjoying their app
and where people are falling out of
their app as well and it's great to hear
that they're iterating first on Android
an app that you would have seen in the
in the
the beginning today now a really
inspiring story about Olivia with Roger
voice to really revolutionize
telecommunications to allow people who
are hard of hearing to have
conversations he's used exactly the same
as Widger to iterate first on the
platform and actually he released first
on Android and then finally a great case
study from one of our developers in
Russia my comm with the great battle
game might and glory I'm super super to
see them launch first on on Android so
that's it from me I hope you've got
another sense of the scale and the
success and the excitement of play on
Android and the purposes today is to
obviously give you more information but
also to listen to you and to get more
feedback from how we can make play a
better platform so with that I look
forward to meeting as many of you as
possible today and thank you for
listening
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
