management for apps and games on google
play and along with Ellie powers I'd
like to talk to you a little bit about
building better about how to create
great quality user experiences in your
apps so look as you guys know quality is
the foundation of a successful mobile
app business users expect quality and
it's not enough in today's mobile app
world just to get people to install your
app right you've got to create features
create user experiences that get them
coming back again and again and again
you've got to get them to go tell their
friends about your app you've got to get
them to want to spend money in your app
and we know and we've seen consistently
over the years that the higher the
quality of user experience in your app
the more money users spend the better
your star rating on the Google Play
Store the more money you make so it's
really worth you guys investing your
precious time and energy and
understanding what users love about your
apps what issues they have in your apps
in going out and proactively managing
user feedback and if you do that that
investment will pay off for you guys in
the long term on your business bottom
line so there's a there's a lot of
different types of a quality right but
what we see is as we look at the apps
that are most successful in Google Play
there are four main aspects to what they
do in the quality of their user
experience first they solve real user
needs with features that users love
second they have not only a beautiful
design but their apps are easy to use
and our joy to use third they're
reliable they don't crash but they're
not data hogs and they're not battery
hogs either and forth they innovate they
stand out from the crowd by building on
top of the latest Android features so we
think about applying these across the
entire range of a nap lifecycle from
design
to development to distribution and to
tell you about how you guys can apply
those four aspects of app quality across
the lifecycle of your app I'm going to
invite up our product manager for
developers the one and only Ellie powers
thanks Michael hi everybody so as
Michael mentioned we're going to go
through each of these three different
phases and talk all about how to improve
quality so let's get started with design
does anyone remember last year's talk
about material design so this year if
you don't remember it or you weren't
here we're going to do a quick refresher
then we're going to see what developers
like you are already doing with material
design and we're going to share a couple
of updates about what's new in the
material design world so material design
is a design system that's about
governing how you I should move feel and
adapt to a user's touch if you want to
learn more check out
developer.android.com / design it's a
great first starting point a material
design has four principles so the first
one is tangible surfaces the whole idea
here is that the way an app works should
be basically the same as if that app was
made out of real physical objects in the
real world the second one is print like
design the content should be bold
graphic and very intentional you can use
the material design look and refine it
to refit and reflect your apps brand and
third meaningful motion you can use
motion in your app to focus the user to
set tension and to give continuity as a
user moves for one screen to another in
your app and forth adaptive design the
whole point here is that you can create
a layout that will feel familiar whether
a user acts as your app on a phone a
tablet a TV android wear or even an
Android auto car the user shouldn't have
to relearn the design of your app every
time they move to a new device category
so we're going to watch a little
animation now and see if you can spot
these four principles as we go through
it
so over the past year and a half we've
seen a huge amount of creativity from
Android developers just like you as they
start using material design to make
their apps more beautiful and also
easier to use and if you're interested
you can go to this URL here to check out
some of the best apps using material
design and get inspiration for your own
apps so let's talk about one app in
particular that's had some huge success
coming from material design so here's
Trello there an app that allows you to
keep track of your biggest projects and
they're super useful when you're working
with a big team and you found out that
long email threads and out-of-date
spreadsheets are not working for you so
Trello use material design as a big part
of an investment that they made in
revamping their Android app and their
mobile leads said that the focus on
simplicity was a big part of this
material design refresh the material
design doesn't just look good it also
brought big results for Trello you can
see here that there was a ten percent
increase in the number of sessions per
user per week forty-two percent more
boards created for each user session and
sixty-three percent more people added
boards in every session so we think this
happened because the material design
refresh help simplify tasks in the app
and also improve feature discoverability
and users said that the UI was a lot
more fun and engaging to use as well so
last year we heard from developers hey
material design looks really fun and
cool and great but you know what I'm
going to need a lot more resources to
make it easier for me to make my design
work belt and the material design and we
totally heard you we totally get that so
this year we've introduced some new
resources here on the Left which I'm
going to go through today and we've also
expanded the material design spec to
include a whole bunch of cool new
widgets layouts etc which are listed on
the right I highly recommend that you go
check them out online so if you haven't
been to design google com yet you should
definitely check it out this is Google's
first website that's completely
dedicated to every aspect of design at
Google and you can see everything that
I'm talking about today on that website
you can see what's new
a material design get detailed
guidelines and even find sample code we
wanted to make designers lives easier
and generating icons used to take a lot
of time but now we're offering a big new
library of material design optimized
icons and this is a great place to get
started for your app another benefit of
using icons from this new library is
that users may already recognize these
icons from other apps making
discoverability easier for you we also
heard from a lot of developers that they
wanted to get detailed design specs on
the wide range of Android devices that
are available so this new devices tool
gives you a lot of information that
you've been missing even including the
recommended material design guidelines
for each device now I think the biggest
request I heard last year was wouldn't
it be great if you could just provide a
lot of reusable libraries for these
material design components so that each
team building their app doesn't have to
build the same stuff again and again
from scratch and we totally agree we
don't want anyone here who have to build
the same stuff from scratch so we've
created these new support libraries the
easiest way to use them is the android
studio sdk manager which we'll talk
about a little bit later and if you want
to get a look at all of the old and new
patterns available in these support
libraries which are backwards compatible
with older devices you can go to
google.com / design / spec and this has
screenshots tips and a bunch more
information and if you're looking for a
whole overview and an easy way to get
started we have a new course on Udacity
it's called Android design for
developers and it will walk you through
everything you need to know about
material design so you're ready to go
and write code effectively and create
beautiful beautiful layouts and get the
most set of material design ok so that
was designed now we're going to move on
and talk about development so of course
the big news this year is Android
marshmallow it's cute it's huggable it's
sweet this latest Android release also
brings big changes to developers and I
want to highlight the two most important
changes today the first one is the new
runtime permissions model and also the
second one is some new features that
help save power on users devices so
let's talk about permissions
if you want to use any of the main
Android marshmallow ap is that is API 23
you'll need to transition your app to
use this new runtime permissions model
and runtime permissions are great
because they give users more control
over their private information we
actually heard some people of wanting
this last year at playtime abiye and
they're also great for developers
because they can help improve your apps
install and update rates too so does
everyone recommend recognize this flow
from the version of Android that we use
today so when you're installing an app
users have to accept all the permissions
what happens on screen number two can be
a little scary for some people it's like
a big roadblock right so this is what a
user on lollipop sees and you can see in
the second screen they have to agree to
everything and if there's even one piece
of information here that they aren't
comfortable sharing the only thing that
they can do about it is canceled the
install and go find a different app that
doesn't have that permission not ideal
so with marshmallow we made that scary
dialog box unnecessary so that the user
can just install the app straightaway
they won't have to agree to any
permissions when they install the app
and when they launch the app for the
first time they can access permissions
as needed and the app will just show
prompts to them which they can accept as
as they need so this is what it looks
like when a user runs the app for the
first time these are what the prompts
look like and then the user can as you
would expect click allow or deny and
here's an important detail the first
time the permission is requested the
user might click deny right it could
happen and that could be because the
user doesn't understand or maybe they're
just on the run and they didn't really
read the screen and the first time that
deny happens it's really not a big deal
for you you can just you know have the
app request the permission again later
and the second time that deny happens
that dialogue happens you'll get that do
not ask again option that you can see
there and have to be a little bit
careful because if the user checks this
checkbox they won't be prompted again
and instead they're going to need to go
to settings if they want to enable that
permission later so speaking of settings
this is really important here any user
on Android marshmallow can go to the
settings page to enable or disable
permissions
for any app on a marshmallow device and
that includes even apps that have not
been updated to that new runtime
permissions model so if they go to one
of those non updated apps and they
disable a certain permission they will
see a warning but then after that your
app may run in some unexpected ways and
this can be confusing to users so we
highly recommend that in order to make
sure that your app runs in a very
predictable and organized fashion on
marshmallow devices that you go and move
to the runtime permissions model as soon
as you can and here's another benefit it
used to be has anyone run into this you
add a new permission to your app and
then the update rate is just not moving
as smoothly as it used to well we've
definitely been aware of that too so
we've decided that in the new runtime
permissions model sense again the user
has to agree to each permission
individually at runtime those app
updates will keep flowing through
without any sort of block so now we're
going to talk about when you're moving
to the new permissions model how should
you think about the user experience you
know you're going to be seeing these
prompts for users but there's good ways
to do it and not so good ways to do it
users are definitely more likely to
agree to permissions when they
understand why those permissions are
being used so we're going to walk
through four different ways that you can
introduce permissions prompts into your
app so that users expectations are met
so the first one some apps have a
tutorial at the beginning and they'll
explain the major functions of the app
and this can be a great place to include
information about why important
permissions are going to be requested so
that then later in the tutorial when you
request those permissions the user won't
be surprised because they understand the
context of your app a bit better even
though they haven't used it before now
if your app is doing something so
obvious like a messaging app asking for
an SMS permission it might be ok just to
prompt immediately on the first run of
the app but this can be a dangerous game
because if you think it's obvious in the
user doesn't now you have a messaging
app that can't send smss and that's
probably not great so you have to be
very sure that it's very very clear to
users otherwise consider the tutorial so
that was about asking when the user
first launches the app but in many case
apps only need a certain permission when
they're using particular features so now
let's talk about that so the first time
that a user uses one of those features
that requires a permission like in this
case requesting the microphone
permission to record a voice note it
makes sense to prompt the user right
when they take that action and not
before and so users for example who are
not taking voice notes never need to see
this dialogue never need the microphone
permission but if they are going to do
that then you can just request it right
there and it's very clear to the user
what's happened now in other cases the
user will need to understand a little
bit more and get more education about
how a feature will work before you can
prompt them so in this case here we're
giving a little bit more education about
what the feature can do and then the
user can either say try it or no thanks
if they decide to try it they would then
get a permissions prompt after they get
some background on what the feature
would do so even if you think you've
done a great job of explaining why a
particular permission is needed and
putting it in context the user might
still click deny now as this is the case
you want to make it clear into your user
inside your app why certain parts of the
app may not be functioning correctly and
then provide a link to settings so that
they can enable the permission in this
case the app is using material design
snack bar to do this right at the bottom
and this is a nice metaphor so this can
be a good time also to reconsider
whether Android intents might be a
better way to go about doing it in many
cases you may be able to use an intent
instead of our permission and that can
be much more user-friendly so to
summarize here are all the benefits of
updating your app to use Android
marshmallows runtime permissions flow so
next we're going to talk about some of
my favorite marshmallow features they
help save users battery life which we
all know is really important and as a
developer you want to make sure that
your app works really well with these
new features so first let's talk about
doze mode let's say you've left your
phone or tablet sitting on the living
room it's not plugged in you go to sleep
you come back in the morning you want
your phone or tablet to still be alive
and not run out of battery and that will
happen in marshmallow because
marshmallow detects that that device is
basically gone idle and your device
basically takes a nap so when your app
is in doze mode these are the functions
that are
directed and other times it may actually
be that the whole device is still being
used but actually just just your one app
that's not in use and in that case each
app that's unused will go into standby
mode and that means that that app will
conserve battery life these are the
criteria that Android will use to decide
if that app is not being used and when
an app is in standby mode these are the
sorts of things that get affected so
basically the most important thing that
you can do here as a developer is to run
certain commands using adb to basically
simulate these conditions on devices and
to test and see if your app still works
as its intended if you really need to
deliver certain messages and get through
with high urgency we offer a special GCM
api that allows you to send high
priority messages so definitely give
this one a test next we're going to talk
about Android studio so is anyone here
using Android studio already yeah maybe
some people cool so we're going to take
a look at some recently launched
features ok there we go so we announced
android studio back in 2013 and so this
is basically google's official IDE and
if you're still on Eclipse please do
note that will be fully deprecated by
the end of the year so this is a good
time to think about moving over so
here's what's new most apps don't need
C++ code but certain apps that have high
requirements for CPU like game engines
signal processing and physics
simulations will need to use it and so
if your app does have one of these
special needs you'll be happy to know
that Android studio now allows you to
have C++ code and Java code live happily
ever after in one project and users love
apps that are fast that are responsive
and don't waste resources on their
device so Android studio provides three
types of tools that will help you get
ahead of the curve here first you can
visualize resource use in your app
second you can identify wasteful data
structures and then finally you can
understand the burden that your app puts
on users data plans and pinpoint where
to reduce usage so at the core of
Android strategy is our unified build
system we've made a lot of performance
improvements to it lately if you like
creating you I in a visual
we have some new tools allow you to drag
and drop components and manage your
assets more efficiently and then earlier
we mentioned how Android studio can
really help you with material design
this is the best place to use the design
support library and you can just
basically drag and drop cool material
design widgets into your app using
Android studio and they're backwards
compatible back to android 2.2 so in
addition to the Android design land
brewer we have a bunch of other
libraries that you can go learn more
about online they can be super helpful
to speed up development and then finally
Android studio also makes it easier to
bring your apps to new device types you
can create a new Android wear face
quickly or even simulate an Android auto
app so finally we're going to talk about
distributing your apps to users and
building your business so Google Play is
all about matching your app with the
right users who really want it and we
also provide some great tools to help
you improve quality but I want to start
out with some really good news so today
maximum apk size is 50 megs right so
this is you know 50 megs anyone have an
appt almost 50 megs may be flirting with
50 49 so when that happens if someone
tries to install a larger one you get
this warning right it's anyone seen that
warning and you get a little bit worried
and maybe you click back so Oren you
have to set up apk expansion files which
definitely take some time so we have
some good news to be announced later
today 100 megabytes
we're really excited too we've been
working on this for quite a while it
takes us a good bit of testing because
that we have to work with such a range
of devices and operators but we wanted
all of you to be the first to know we'll
have an announcement going out on our
blog later today we just want you to
know one thing even though we allow will
allow apks up to 100 users still really
do like the smaller apks so only go over
50 if you absolutely must so now we're
going to talk a little bit more about
how to use iteration on Google Play to
test new ideas so we offer a whole bunch
of special tools which Mark touched on
earlier to help you get early feedback
and we recommend these as best practices
to every single developer our best
developers most successful developers
use these tools and if you aren't
already you're definitely missing on a
big opportunity to have a high-quality
app so anyone you're using beta testing
fantastic I love seeing those hands this
is a really special feature on google
play and you can distribute your app to
a subset of users and you can get
feedback early rather than releasing it
to everyone and just crossing your
fingers saying please work so with beta
testing users opt in and they can't
leave reviews and it's pretty cool you
should definitely try it if you haven't
and developers have told us beta testing
is great but we want more ways to be
able to make it easy for users to join
so this year we announced two changes
the first one was open betas you can now
actually if you want to distribute a
link to your open beta and users can
just click it go to a page that looks
just like this and join and that's it
they can join with just one click and
developers have been able to grow pretty
big beta communities this way you still
obviously have the option to create a
private closed beta but you can also now
manage that with one option being email
addresses and we've introduced that
option earlier this year so let's see
why the Guardian tells us that they're
big fans of beta testing over the past
six months they've tried basically every
single feature through beta testing
first before rolling it out on
which they do three builds before each
production release and they've said that
this really helps them move a lot faster
it provides a safe place for them to try
out crazy new stuff without risking
their brand and it also helps them
gather a bit of data so that they can
take it to stakeholders to make tough
decisions it used to take them over a
month to launch new features now it's
less than a couple weeks so staged
rollouts this is another way of making
sure that your app doesn't release any
bugs to new users you basically just
push out your new version and rather
than going to every user you go to a
certain percentage and you can increase
that percentage over time and then this
year at Google i/o we announced the
cloud test lab and we're trialing this
with a small set of developers today and
if you're interested you can go to the
developer console to sign up and
hopefully we'll add you to that beta
test soon so in Google Play what's going
to happen with the cloud test lab is
that we're going to send all alpha and
beta apps to be tested on a set of real
physical devices and you'll get results
back pretty quickly so this is yet
another reason to use alpha and beta if
you aren't already doing that and helps
you detect any major obvious issues and
we've heard from some of the developers
who are trying this early version the
first thing they want to do after that
is they say well that was cool but i
want to write some really specific tests
and run it on this particular one device
that's been really hard for me to track
down and so we're actually going to have
a way to do that too you'll be able to
write customized testing and then run it
through Android studio on either virtual
or physical devices specifying the exact
set of devices that you want to use so
this is what we've been through today
first we want you to be able to build a
great app and a business on Google Play
and so in the design phase material
design can be easier than ever to use
thanks to a whole bunch of new resources
in the development phase Android
marshmallows brought some serious
changes for developers like permissions
and doze mode and so Android studio and
other resources can help you test that
out and make sure you have a built a
quiet quality app and then finally
distributing quality apps is easier than
ever and because play is offering
development center tools that help you
iterate and test your new apps thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
