performance has a lot to do with how
you're managing your memory and more
often than not issues here can come from
using collections that may not be frugal
when it comes to this resource my name
is Colt McAnlis and to help you write
more performant applications the Android
system provides a set of collections
built especially for mobile development
consider the commonly used hash map
object totally useful from a language
perspective but also a complete memory
hog see a typical hash map system works
a little something like this you take in
a key object and apply a hash to it
which gives you an index into a large
array at that index location you place
the value object which means the biggest
problem you have to design around is
collisions or rather when multiple keys
hash to the same location in that array
now small arrays mean that you're gonna
end up with a lot more hash collisions I
mean mapping 20,000 objects to ten
locations is by definition going to get
a little bit messy as such most hashmaps
end up allocating a large array in order
to reduce the potential for collisions
and then go about adding some other
crazy logic in case those things do
happen like chaining algorithms and
whatnot so obviously this whole large
array that's only sparsely populated
thing isn't really ideal from the
perspective of a memory minimal device
which is why the Android runtime
provides an alternate container class
which is more memory efficient array map
array map provides the identical
functionality as a hash map but avoids
all of its crazy overhead by using two
small arrays instead of one large one
the first array contains the hashes of
the given keys in sorted order the
second array stores the key and value
objects that have been inserted into the
collection interwoven together according
to the ordering of these sorted key
array when you want to fetch a value we
create a hash for the key and then
binary search the hash array to find its
index we can use that index directly
then to find the location in the key
value pair in the inter woven array now
if the key in the second array isn't
equal to the one that we submitted when
we were searching for things then we
assume that there has been a collision
to resolve this we then linearly walk
the keys in both directions trying to
find the correct match these two things
together mean that as the number of
objects grows in our container so does
the timer
prior to access a single object
basically you're trading off smaller
memory overhead for more expensive
runtime access now since these arrays
are contiguous in memory there's a few
things to keep in mind with respect to
their usage dominantly is understanding
how deleting and adding to the container
works deleting elements can fall into
two paths either you get lucky and only
need a compaction step which means
shifting the deleted items the end and
then all the other values forward or you
can end up in the slowest path which
actually requires a resize and copy of
the elements to eliminate the value in
question insertions work on the other
side of this coin now if the array has
been compacted then we can reuse those
allocated blocks and then just shift
around everything to keep our sorted
order
however the slow path here does require
complete resize of a contiguous array in
order to make space plus copying and
moving everything on top of that in
general this means that insertions and
deletions from array Maps are going to
cost a little bit more from a
performance perspective but if you keep
the number of objects in it's small like
in hundreds of items then this really
isn't anything to worry about see the
small contiguous arrays mean that when
the number of values is pretty low you
know a lot of savings versus the
standard hash map for empty maps there's
no allocations hanging around taking up
space and for small amounts of objects
it's pretty memory optimal oh and by the
way another great feature of these
containers is that you can iterate over
them using indexing I compare that to
the hashmap container which requires you
to use the iterator pattern which of
course is significantly slower and takes
up more memory to do but obviously it's
not wise to use these optimized
containers in every case but there are
some perfect situations that you should
consider number one situations where you
have a small number of items in the
hundreds or so with lots of accesses or
the insertions and deletions are
infrequent enough that the overhead of
doing so isn't really noticed number two
situations where we have containers of
maps like maps of maps where the sub
maps tend to have a low number of items
and you're often iterating over them a
lot of time if your use case doesn't
fall into either of those two buckets
then it might be best to stick with the
hash map class which actually highlights
a very interesting point optimizing
performance is a constant trade-off
between finding the right container for
the right usage pattern for the right
memory pattern and as someone said there
is no silver
which is why you need to check out the
rest of the Android performance patterns
content to get more information about
these types of trade-offs oh and don't
forget to join the Google+ community as
well to hear other war stories from
developers who may be facing similar
situations so keep calm profile your
code and always remember perf matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
