improved the visual layout editor
including built-in support for
constraint layout constraint layout is a
great new way to define complex layouts
without the need for nested view
hierarchies thanks to a flexible
constraint system it's available in the
support repository and works all the way
down to API level 9 to install it in
Android studio open the SDK manager and
select both the constraint layout for
Android and solver for constraint layout
from the SDK tools tab to use it in your
project add the dependency and build a
Gradle now create a new layout file with
a constraint layout as the root view
notice that in Android studio 2.2 the
layout editor gained a few new features
such as the blueprint mode which you can
use alongside the design view if you
wish on the right side of the screen you
can see the redesigned view inspector
here you can switch between the commonly
used view properties and the full list
the inspector also includes constraint
layout specific layout attribute editors
which I'll show you in a moment
first let's start by dragging an image
view from the palette onto the blueprint
you can see that every view in a
constraint layout has four handles on
the sides top right bottom and left
views that inherit from textview also
have a baseline handle the positions use
relative to each other you can click and
drag from one handle to another of the
same type
here I'm placing a textview in the
layout and aligning it to the right of
the image view by creating a constraint
from the left handle I'm also allowing
the views vertically by adding a top
constraint the views are still a bit too
close together so you can adjust the
margin by dragging the constraint view
in design preview or I can use the
properties window on the right that
looks better the only thing that remains
is positioning our views inside the
parent container by enabling the shell
constraint settings in the toolbar I can
see that there are currently no
constraints pointing to the outer edges
of the layout my two views would simply
get moved to position 0 at runtime by
connecting the top and left handles to
the parent edges
I can specify how I want to position the
views in the container what if I want to
Center review instead of gluing it to
the left or right side of the screen
I'll create a new text view and center
it horizontally within the layout by
connecting both sides to the parent you
can see the view now has constraints
pulling it both ways because constraint
layout can't satisfy both constraints at
the same time the view remains centered
if you now look at the properties window
you can see a slider called horizontal
bias by changing the percent value using
the slider I can influence the strength
or weight or future constraint which
results in moving the view slightly to
the left or right you can also change
the desired width and height of a view
by cycling through three modes wrap
content fixed size and match constraints
you shouldn't be using match parent in
constraint layouts and use match
constraints instead which basically
means that the view can grow up to the
available space while still satisfying
its constraints to remove a constraint
click on one of the sides of the box
shown in the properties window or click
on a handle in the design view you can
also delete all constraints on a single
view by clicking here or remove all
constraints in the layout using the
button in the toolbar we're continuously
improving both runtime performance as
well as editor capabilities so always
make sure that you update to the newest
version in the SDK manager and your
build files and check out our record lab
and article a medium for more advanced
constraint layout examples thanks for
