bugs you must defend on all fronts to
ensure they're caught early and often
compile time checks help there's also a
whole set of runtime checks we can also
use that's where strictmode comes in
offering a set of runtime checks you can
add to your debug builds to catch
potential issues before they hit your
users I mean like and I'll walk you
through two of my favorite strict mode
features that go beyond performance
checks and help you build better apps
so if lint checks are the
android-specific compile time problems
you can tell you about strict mode is
the runtime equivalent pointing out
issues that we can detect at runtime so
you can fix them early bunch of strict
mode is performance focused the other en
does a great job talking about those
features in his video as well as the
basics of strict mode but I'm not here
to rehash that instead let's talk about
the cool new stuff like vm policies
detect file URI exposure if you're
sharing content with other apps you do
not want to be using value or eyes they
require storage permissions and they
can't cross between users and well just
watch my dev byte on sharing content
this strictmode check just make sure
that those file your eyes don't make it
out to other apps like all strict mode
you can have it log the issue with
penalty log or kill your app completely
with penalty death build better apps or
death should be an easy choice right now
new to Android 6.0 marshmallow is detect
clear text network as you might expect
from the name this detects unencrypted
network traffic over ipv4 or ipv6
whether using TCP or UDP thing about
mobile devices out in the wild is that
you can't really guarantee that they'll
actually be connected to trustworthy
access points risking the security of
your users data or the communication to
your server it's the last privacy
nightmare you want to deal with on
launch day so detect it early and
encrypt your network traffic one thing
to keep in mind you may find false
positives when using start TLS protocols
or HTTP proxies something realist
strictmode starts killing it when you're
in fact doing it right now with your app
creating extra logging and be killed and
all that you probably want to keep in
mind that strict mode should only be
enabled for debug belts the easiest way
to do that is by wrapping your strict
mode calls in a build config debug check
which is automatically set to false on
release belts there's a lot more to
explore with strict mode but detecting
file your eyes and clear text network
traffic can be extremely useful in
finding issues before they're
experienced by your users giving you
that extra peace of mind you're building
better apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
