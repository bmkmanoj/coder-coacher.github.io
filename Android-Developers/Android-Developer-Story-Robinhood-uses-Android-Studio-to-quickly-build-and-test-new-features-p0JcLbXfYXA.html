engineering at Robin Hood Robin Hood is
the free stock trading app every other
doctor aiding service charges five to
ten dollars we do it for zero dollars
Robin Hood today has over a million
users and we've been able to grow with a
very small team Android users love Robin
Hood we more than doubled our user base
and with 4.6 stars Robin Hood is the
highest rated stock brokerage on the
Playstore and Dan Hill I'm an Android
developer Robin Hood were in Andrew team
of two we kind of pride ourselves on
staying agile and very fast and entered
studio to speed and stability it really
lets us stand is owned for longer and
not have to kind of worry about the
administration I mean it might be a good
tool is it's not visible it's not anyway
it's just there and it's something that
you can use one of my favorite things
about entered Studios all the shortcuts
that it offers there's one that's really
great if it shortcuts to look up
shortcuts and basically it will display
it in line with what the keyboard
shortcut it serves you can kind of use
it to learn all the different shortcuts
the new emulator is class but you get
hardware accelerated and easier mission
GPU to make it faster one of my favorite
things to show off is betrayed animation
it's really satisfying to kind of swipe
up and kind of see your trade
metaphorically go out very act a way to
interact with the duct having really
powerful tools enables our very small
team to have a large impact in Android
development we're always jamming our
files and brings different config files
and Java classes and Android studio has
always felt responsive it up to go of
the speed that you want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
