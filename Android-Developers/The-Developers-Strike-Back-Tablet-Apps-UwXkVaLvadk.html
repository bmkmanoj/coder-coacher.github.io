good morning everyone and welcome to a
special tablet week edition of Android
developers strike back tablet week is
like shark week except not nearly as
boring it's true it's very true in fact
we're gonna have a look at three tablet
apps today we've got the developers from
mint tiny company and these two paper
developers as well I think they actually
call themselves TinyCo tiny code TinyCo
all right tiny company kind of sounds
like one of their games actually thanks
to this very Church we will ask the
toniko guys about their naming a choice
for their brand when we speak to them so
we've got those three apps to go through
we're going to try and spend about ten
minutes on each find out a little bit
about their experience developing for
tablets but successes that have what
tips they've got four for other
developers are looking to develop for
tablet as well excellent so I think
we're gonna start with mid dog we are
absolutely let's see if I got the slides
right I video check that out very nice
um so welcome thank you for joining so
i'm going to introduce yourself tell us
a little bit about yourself and amit
sure so when a ms bryant an and i'm
actually the product owner for the
Android side for mint com so i'm just
happy to be here and happy to talk a
little bit about mint and kind of our
tablet experience outstanding so i'm
going to ask the same few questions to
to everyone i think we'll start off just
tell us a little bit about mint about
the app which you've designed for tablet
you know a little bit about the
experiences around you know what makes
this a tablet specific version of beer
sure so you know mipcom first off is a
way for you to take a look at your
finances on our tablet essentially we
aggregate all of your various accounts
you know credit accounts checking
accounts and things of that sort on the
tablet so that you can have one view of
your finances and basically stay on top
of it you know we have a website and
then we wanted to build a tablet app and
so what we did is we decided to take
kind of the best of what was on the web
and then bring it to the tablet but more
specifically you know we want to build
this thing from the ground up we want to
make it
native and then we said we want to make
it cool want to make it interesting when
finances for the most part people don't
really think of it as cool and
interesting right no it's not what I do
for fun yeah so you know I'm the on the
overview screen here that we've got you
know basically we've judged just try to
make it a very rich experience you know
we have a nice little graphic in the
upper left hand corner then keeping that
up actually sure just so that you can
quickly see kind of you know where your
finances are in terms of what you're
spending we've got nice little bar
graphs on the right and the nice little
icons that represent spending there by
the way I hope you don't mind that I
totally stole this UI for my custom
controls class I thought I know I didn't
actually see that but that's cool we
like we like to hear that well I
remember that you guys came in I to show
us this when I i think was actually pre
honeycomb yeah and we were having some
problems because you know of course that
was a new GPU for everybody right and
there were some there were some issues
we couldn't get it hardware accelerator
at the normal canvas and it wasn't
working quite fast enough and you know
we looked at it wasn't buttery smooth
and you guys really wanted to be really
super smooth and so we I think we ended
up recommending that you draw it on its
own hardware yeah no definitely I mean
that was this screen right here the
spending by category screen is kind of
that one thing that we want to get right
we wanted to make sure that interact
with your finances was kind of this very
immersive experience and that buttery
smooth you know rotation of the screen
clicking on there tapping on the slices
even slowing down the kind of you know
move between the slices we wanted to get
that one hundred percent right and that
was just something that we poured a lot
of effort a lot of time as you I really
nice it really gives that that feeling
that this is an app that it feels solid
right you know it's like there's no jank
eNOS there's no oh I can see what they
tried to do there it just kind of works
exactly if you'd hope it does yeah you
can see one one thing that may not come
out in a video but it's something that
really impressed us and really made it
run slower is that there's a really
light gradient all the way around here
and you know we talked a lot about
gradients I think is there there are
some design guides belonging to our
competitors that emphasize gradients in
a way that we find
scan droidy but this is a great use of
gradients it's a wonderfully it's you
wouldn't even know it's there if it
wasn't pointed out to you but it makes
the whole thing feel a little deeper a
little more life life and of course it
it slowed down rendering because the
gradients at that time we're done in in
software but once you render that all
out onto one layer then you can rotate
the layer without actually having to
redraw all the gradients every time yeah
I mean you know our designers are very
thankful that you noticed a gradient oh
I'm thankful of it I mean again I was
just one of those things that you know
in addition to the interaction piece and
getting that right you know the visual
aspect the colors the gradients and even
kind of the blend of the colors you know
we spent a lot of time on that and we're
very very proud of it it's one of those
big challenges I mean it seems funny
like it's it's such a deceptively simple
screen that we're looking at here it's a
simple pie well donut chart you know
with a simple sort of explanation of
what each thing represents but it's all
those little things like I've I think
anyone who's done any kind of
engineering for any amount of time has
built charting controls from scratch cuz
it's like databases it's a requirement
of every job you ever do to start from
the beginning and even simple things
like choosing what colors you're going
to have because you don't necessarily
know how many categories you're going to
have so it's a pseudo-random color
generator but you need to make sure that
each one is noticeable and they look
well together and I think that attention
to detail really works well it ain't
even making it a donut instead of a pie
i think absolutely and i don't know if
this is what you had in mind but it
feels like that gives me a clue that i'm
gonna interact with it instead of just
looking at it yeah well it looks like
one of those spinning wheels yeah like
oh yeah that's that's the one thing you
know when I did my version I had to add
in we see you know villages and they're
spending money on yeah faster and faster
yeah right very cool all right so I
guess the two questions I had so the
first one is so you already had a
a phone app and a website before you had
the tablet out what would you say is
sort of the the biggest change that
you've made in order to make something
which was really a great tablet
experience as opposed to the to the
phone version and and sort of you know
more than that what was the result so
you know what did you do and how has
that affected your install Reiter your
engagement or any of those sorts of
things right so you know when we first
developed the tablet app as you said we
had a phone app already and you know we
weren't one hundred percent sure kind of
where folks would fall in terms of how
they would use both apps so we said
let's release a basic version of the
tablet app and then let's kind of get
some data and let's iterate against that
and so one of the things that we started
to find with a tablet app is that people
are actually spending more time on the
tablet app basically are sitting there
they're looking back in their finances
and they're also looking forward into
their financer today so the analysis
exactly whereas on the phone it's kind
of like this decision maker you know
like you might be at the store and you
might decide should I really buy this TV
you pop open that stain you figure out
yes I can I choosing my consumer
electronics budget for this right
exactly and then so we started to move
down that route of empowering the user
on the tablet to do things like you know
editing budgets and doing split
transactions and just being able to do
more in terms of really kind of setting
their financial foundation and you know
looking back at their data and making
sure it's kind of jiving with what they
think so you know our analogy is our
phone app is basically a snacking app
like throughout the day your pop and
peanuts you're you know eating you know
candy bars and whatnot and then with the
tablet app it's basically like a full
meal you sit down and you'll kind of
digest the overview and then you'll you
know go deeper into budgets and you
start editing your budgets and things of
that sort I like that that's a nice
analogy so um if I understand that
correctly so you're actually are you
actually putting your spending into the
app as you're spending it so if you're
out at the shops you're actually putting
that's that budgetary information in by
the phone app yeah so basically on your
tablet app you can go and set your
budgets you can edit your budgets and
then when you have your phone app you
know that very same budget that you've
said you can clearly see how much money
you've got left to this particular month
and then you can dive deeper into the
various you know subcategories and
and then you know conversely when you're
on your phone you can enter transactions
on the Golan on the fly and then when
you get home you know you can see them
show up on your tablet and looking at
all and do a little bit more if you
wanted to nice you can find out what
punishment you've done to your budgets
yeah on your phone when you get back on
that's nice so so does that mean that
the the tablet app is that something
that's sort of a feature for feature
equivalent of what you can do on the
website you sort of see that in the
future of sort of becoming more and more
the way that maybe people are going to
be using the Apple definitely I mean you
know you can't hit the nail on the head
in terms of you know we've got a website
we've got a tablet we've got a phone you
know where the tablets sit in between
and it's looking more and more like you
know it may kind of replace the web it
may kind of you know will bring some of
those more web like features to the
tablet and then we'll keep the phone to
be very simple very decision oriented or
kind of inner information oriented and
then on the tablet you can do your
analysis so that's I think something
which we go on about quite a bit which
is the idea that on a on a phone you
really want to have almost a single
action so you open it up and there's
sort of one or two steps to do whatever
it is you want to do check to see
whether I can buy this thing or you know
basically enter the information that I
have bought this thing right whereas on
the tablet you are expecting people to
sit down and spend a bit more time so
you can have a little bit more of a
complex work for and have more complex
actions yeah and our data tells us
exactly that I mean you know to the
point about snacking and dining I mean
on the tablet app you know we see most
people hopping into the app at about
eight you know after 8pm favorite and
that's what our usage spikes between
eight and ten so you know maybe folks
put the kids down to bed and then they
pick up mint full you know then maybe
they're in bed talking with their wife
or husband or whatnot of you really need
this TV and look we can make it exactly
I can see it eyes that's cool and so did
you see them obviously we've got a lot
of analytics which is again something
which we tell people that they need to
do you need to understand what impact
the decisions you're making about your
app has on its usage so did you see as
you were sort of adding more of that
dining experience to tablet that your
usage was increasing yeah definitely I
mean we've seen you know a fair amount
of usage in terms of just you know
installs in the app and then just in
terms of you know overall time spent in
the app you
I believe the number was in the
magnitude of twenty-five percent more
time on the app you know versus on the
phone so you know again big big thing
for us you know to know that and to kind
of make that decision and go down that
path very cool that sounds like it
sounds like a lot of thought and if it
has gone into every aspect of this which
is really great to see and you can see
that from the polished affect the other
thing I want to point out as well
because we had mint I think was one of
the nominees for one of our up clinics a
while back but we didn't spend much time
on it because it was already great and B
we didn't have a demo account all right
but you know one thing I want to
highlight for people watching is that
this is an app that looks very much like
mint it doesn't it doesn't look a lot
like Hollow it's got more gradients than
we would usually expect to see things
like these reflections but it really
works oh yeah you know I think that's
something which we spend a lot of time
telling people like sometimes you can
watch our show and think we're basically
saying make every app look like it
should be a native app like you know
that it shipped with the the phone right
make everything flat exactly flat what
any other thing to be fair Roman Nurik
does say that but this is a really good
example of going the whole way so it's
like it doesn't have to be that this
still looks consistent with Android it
looks like it belongs on this device but
it does look different to some of the
native apps which ship with it and I
think it really just comes down to
having this holistic design that fits
everything in you know you've got this
action bar which looks like a legitimate
action bar and it is you've got it works
right everything everything is in the
right place that's right if I want to do
something and can refresh I know here
I've got you know the compose icon
meaning you know to add something in it
it's all intuitive it all works the way
hugs what expected and nothing now I
have I don't think I've seen every nook
and cranny of this app but just as I
played with it this is probably the
fourth or fifth time I've had a chance
to sit down and play with it I what's
really impressive is that nothing feels
stitched on there's there's never that
point that we get to with a lot of other
apps where we say oh this is where they
ran out of time and stop this is where
the design results
ran out in a development oh you know
what I could do right and you can see
that they've solved a lot of difficult
technical problems look this is it this
is a buttery smooth thing whatever if
you notice but there's a little fade out
great I did dog there which I actually
you know isn't in fact I i will say that
a couple of versions ago there were some
devices where we had to take that
gradient out because we couldn't make
our GPU code run fast enough this is a
really good example actually using the
inspiration of hollow and of the android
theming and apply it within your own app
because we you know we have something
similar to this when you get to the top
and bottom of the list view and this
clearly isn't a list view but it still
has that same hinting as to there is
more up here yeah so that's what it's
really nice yeah all right very cool
alright so I think we've probably spent
enough time on on min so thank you very
much for coming in and joining us and
talking a little bit about the product
and we should give some other guys a
chance so absolutely let's move on to a
tiny co indeed can you guys hear some
sort and there's chair for your oh cool
hey guys hi how are you hey hey Wyatt
we're just gonna shift around here cuz
ya gonna have any high-tech waited we
need like a little chair carousel we
leave like a trap door because we're on
the we're on the second floor at scary
cuz we're in the US so just lower people
out and all of them back in exactly as
long as when we get an 80 k project we
can expense it absolutely hahaha so
first question TinyCo yes not tiny
company yes tiny pearl excellent that's
probably a good choice so apologies for
mangling your company name desert you
introduce yourself so it tell us a
little bit about tinypic sure I'm I'm
Sean Mar I'm one of the mobile
developers here we make mobile games
most of them are freemium games with
in-app purchase and yeah we've been
moving everything that we can onto the
android store and trying to support as
many devices as possible including the
tablets outstanding so let's say so
we've installed tiny monsters i think on
the device you were one we've got it up
on screen you want to tell us
a little bit about the game perhaps it
looks great on tablet so maybe talk a
little bit about the the tablet aspects
and any differences that this may have
with the phone version sure yeah I mean
we pictured that people would be using
the the tablet version you know maybe at
their desks but probably on their couch
or in bed or something like that we
definitely knew that people wanted to
get a bigger and better view of their
Island for anyone who hasn't played the
game you you have your own Island that
you decorate and by habitats in and then
you hatch and raised different monsters
and then cross breed them but but we
wanted to make sure that people got as
big and as clear view of the island as
possible so we took advantage of the
full side of the size of the screen on
and we made sure that we had high
resolution assets for for all of the
buildings all of the monsters everything
that people would be seeing yes thats
look fantastic I think it's for the
first thing that I noticed like you've
got the full screen experience with the
sort of the chrome the game chrome is
big enough without being too big so it
doesn't look like it's been stretched
but it's all big enough to touch and the
assets just look gorgeous really crisp
yeah you guys have come such a long way
since I remember when we first got in
touch you guys were working on was it
tap resort or the little island game yes
yeah that would have been tap resort
yeah and and that was the first thing
that we noticed was you know the assets
didn't I didn't scale very well there's
you know a lot of things had come over
from phone and I remember we sat down
and talked to you about you know the
different you know form factors in
Android and took a while but it seems
like I you guys really took that to
heart I mean didn't you go back and
basically you wrote a cross-platform
engine which works really well we were
able to get great performance out of it
but most importantly you've got these
images that look was just fantastic even
that these really high zoom yes I'm 0 at
prestwick spent a stamp
yeah we we did we were originally with
the older game that you were talking
about we're reporting our apps and
essentially had two different code bases
running but always when we started to
take this very seriously we knew that we
needed a cross-platform engine which we
wrote and probably one of the biggest
challenges was how are we going to deal
with all these different aspect ratios
and because we knew that we were we were
now dealing with more than one screen
size and just stretching everything
wasn't going to to cut it you know one
thing i do remember too is that you know
that we we had a talking i think you
actually if i remember right had an
excellent blog post about just how you
were able to grow your revenue by
concentrating on treating antler android
like android instead of reporting from
some other platform that didn't have the
same benefits and challenges right yeah
it has been a whole different it's a
whole different ecosystem and and
different strategies have worked well
for us I'm a I'm a coder so I'm not I
probably can't speak too much to thee to
the financial side of things but we we
have treated each platform on the
engineering side it's all fairly unified
but the monetization strategies are very
different on each ecosystem yeah that's
interesting uh you know given that you
are on the engineering side I'd like to
dig a little bit deeper if possible to
find out you know what were some of the
techniques that you use to get past the
that challenge that you said of all the
different aspect ratios and screen sizes
is there something that you can share
with some of the developers watching too
probably facing a lot of those same
issues sure sure absolutely like a like
a lot of games we're using the NDK we're
writing the bulk of our game code in C++
and the like I said right out of the
gate we knew we needed to deal with this
not so much the screen size issue but
the aspect ratio issue some devices are
extremely wide screen others are taller
you know than the standard you know
the four by three phone aspect ratio lo
of games which have sort of the black
bars along the side to say it really is
for three trust me right yeah we we
don't we don't pretend that it's for
three we actually so since we're using
the the native development kit we're not
using a lot of the built-in Android
features for for scaling and whatnot we
look at the raw number of pixels on the
screen and based on that decide how much
we're going to have to scale the UI
elements and the game elements beyond
that we do have high resolution assets
that we use if we do decide we need to
scale a button to twice its original
size we use a double sized art asset for
that so it doesn't look blurry like it
would be if you just if you just scaled
it up without using a larger that's a
really interesting point do you make
that decision initially based on the
screen size which assets you'll load or
do you actually make it on an asset by
asset basis trying to determine how much
it's going to scale we don't do the the
second technique you're talking about
would be like level of detail based on
how big it is decide which asset to use
we don't do that we decide based on the
the wrong number of pixels in the
display we think we're going to need you
know single size assets or double size
assets so do you bucket them I'm really
curious your bucket on the same way we
do or do you have a different scheme I'm
not sure if you I know in the in the
standard Android SDK there's a number of
folders for medium resolution and high
resolution and things like that we have
what we call just the single resolution
the One X and the double resolution the
2x we're not using other intermediate
sizes gotcha opponent makes sense in
effect we've we've actually found that
for most cases that actually works
pretty well like it's not always
necessary even when you're using the SDK
to use each of those buckets and in fact
when you're just providing something
very high res which can then scale back
works pretty well until you get to the
point where you almost needed a
different style asset to work at the
reduced resolution yeah of course you're
also doing some some quite fancy scaling
work here the ice was so Tamara zooming
in on the on the world yeah we're
zooming in and out and is that just a
set of mipmap textures or or do you uh
um we're actually we're we're not using
maps we're just using this single a
single high resolution texture that's
why you can zoom in as far as you are so
that a single building fills up the
entire screen Wow because because we are
using those those high resolution
textures yeah yeah mit maps are really
nice for scaling but of course they use
a lot more memory and we are still
somewhat memory constrained that's
really interesting clue why would it be
well I would actually be very interested
to to know how that affects your
performance because typically you know
what C is mid maps will take up more
more room in memory obviously but
they'll also i render faster exactly
because they eat less GPU bandwidth on
the way in right so I'm actually really
surprised that you're able to get this
frame rate I with nothing but full
resolution samples right well we were we
just we've always been more constrained
by memory than we were by by cpu and
draw speed that may be because we don't
have millions of triangles on the on the
screen good island but for us for the
kind of games that we're making right
now it made more sense to use less
memory and and take the hit to the draw
speed gotcha yeah it certainly it just
looks really smooth so I think that's
probably a good choice I love the
graphics like all the graphics look
fantastic you know for all of that in
even just just this this style itself
and thought of the faces from the people
who pop up and congratulate oh yeah
absolutely it looks like a lot of fun
well I remember I was actually in the
pitch meeting when you guys came and
showed this to serve the first time and
we'd actually just reviewed a whole set
of very very similar games but this
really blew us away then you know kudos
to your artist well thank you yeah I
can't take credit for that we have some
amazing artists and some amazing you I
people very cool so I was going to ask
and you may not be you may not be the
right person on the team to speak to
this what i'll ask anyway just in case
having you know really built this
excellent experience on tablet do you
have you found any significant
difference in terms of user engagement
and i mean frankly you guys have an app
which you know is paid so if you found
that you're making comparatively more
money on on users who are using it on
tablet devices yeah I don't I I don't
have access to the monetization numbers
but I do know that the percentage of our
users who are playing on a tablet has
been definitely been going up over time
and it's we definitely take that into
consideration when planning new features
because we know that that's where a lot
of our users want to play on a tablet
yeah that makes a lot of sense you know
then it's particularly for games like
this which are sort of more than the
gist I've got five minutes while I'm
waiting for my bus it's more like okay
I've got an hour to spend gaming now
whether that's on a train or at home or
wherever else so I'm you know for that
experience I think tablet descent as
well and especially one when you want
that really beautiful immersive
graphical experience I mean this you
know you can see very similar graphics
on the phone but they just won't blow
you away like they do here I I know that
it publicly you guys have have said a
few things about how Android I was very
disappointing at first for for Thai Nico
but as we as we worked with you and as
as you started to see the Android
ecosystem as a separate thing especially
a you know being able to take advantage
of things like different aspect ratios
different sized devices in way that made
the users of each device happy I then
you know apparently and this is again
what you guys said in your blog post say
the monetization just steadily climbed
and got much much better and I don't
know where it's at now that was a think
a last year is
when you guys were saying that actually
before this game even came out but it's
great to say that it's a nude well you'd
like to think so at the very least I
think if we're seeing you know apps
games of this sort of quality and you
guys are still investing the resources
to create them for tablets that's
probably a good sign now holy crap you
get clouds and everything yeah I was
wondering what the things were clouds
it's cool all right well we've we've
spent a bunch of time of this we should
give a little bit of a chance to
instapaper dispersal thank you very much
for joining us and thank you for
creating an awesome looking game thank
you guys all right let's move on such a
nice little animation you got going
there in pressed it's almost like magic
either way it moves most like yeah it's
moving magically so the the last step
that we wanted to talk about today was
Instapaper so hopefully we've got the
insta type of guys on the line hi guys
new loot pretty good thank you for for
bearing with us and hanging around we're
hopefully saving the best to last no
offense to everyone has just gone before
hahaha they're supposed to get them out
of the room right Oscar winner so please
introduce yourselves tell us a little
bit about the company the app sure so
our company's molten lava lux my name is
Jeff rock im co-founder I'm here with
Jason camera crews army'd Android
developer so mobile x we make apps for
iOS the mac android pretty much anywhere
there's a screen a lot of our business
is building white label apps for other
other companies and startups so tumblr
we built their first and second
generation android client no I homes
android client for their alarm clock we
built other apps for random house and
it's some other guys out there on the
store you just you may not see our name
but you have a lot of people using our
house every day and very good wishes may
not have seen in the end may not have
seen the name you've probably used one
of your apps yeah we uh this arranged it
was a little different
good friends with Marco Arment and he
came to us and said look I just simply
don't have the resources to devote to
Android development and I know you guys
do this stuff and he was interested in
seeing if we would build it under our
name cuz he felt like Instapaper would
really shine on Android tablets so we we
took it over and we developed the
Android code base from scratch we
maintain it we work closely with Marco
on the features were going to implement
timeline but it is very much a mobile x
/ Instapaper production very cool very
cool so he came to you guys specifically
because you've got that experience with
Android and and sort of understand how
to build an app which is sort of a pure
Android experience is Aaron yeah I think
we're all in especial mobile x in
particular and Marco I know he feels
this way to really love that the kind of
write once run anywhere at frameworks we
don't in our experience we've never seen
any of those do it particularly well and
I've never heard of anyone that loved
them once they used yeah that's all I
rather thing for he's finicky about
being native for the platform I've done
delight suppose yeah I think that's what
it comes down to me and those write once
run anywhere type platforms are a great
idea and I'd be hugely supportive of
them if they produced awesome apps which
I couldn't tell were built on a
write-once you know run anywhere type
platform sad that doesn't seem to be the
case every time I've ever you know
encountered any sort of automatically
generated you I it's it's never good
yeah exactly so you know I think at the
moment it's definitely the way to go is
to really try and build something that
is you know native for each one it I
mean that's the thing as well people act
as though it's a huge amount of extra
why don't we losing you just a little
bit we said that's all right we're just
basically talking amongst ourselves but
I say you guys are frozen and a screen
as well so I will continue to talk
amongst ourselves until you unfreeze it
looks like that back no good i can see
Cedeno yeah I see them on that corner oh
great great yeah so was i I think people
forget actually the lessons of history
because if you think about even
you know the the first version of
microsoft office for mac for instance
and office for mac a lot of people don't
realize is actually very profitable and
well-respected product but the first
version was universally reviled it was
mostly because they took their windows
product and plopped it directly on the
mac yeah that's never going to fly it
right and and it doesn't fly to go back
the other way either i've had some some
things that we're obviously written for
mac on my Windows machine and they just
don't jibe right let's it's all the
little things it's like you hit a drop
down and the drop down in mac and
windows is different it's exactly the
same functionality but it looks
different and it's that cognitive
dissonance where you like wait how do i
select this oh okay that slight little
pause breaks you out of that mindset of
whatever it is that you were doing you
don't want to have to think about the
app you just want to be able to do
whatever the applets you do right so
respecting the platform and respect the
user chose to buy that slap forum it's
like it enough to worry about us you
know we can take it but it's about the
users which are trying to you know
leverage your app so let move we've got
two we've got Instapaper up on the
screen can you tell us a little bit
about the the way that you went about
designing a tablet specific version of
the app and sort of what are the the key
decisions that you made and how that has
affected usage at the app yeah
absolutely um so i think unlike a lot of
android development we started with
tablet primarily we actually designed
out the 7-inch and 10-inch layouts or
tablet before we even looked at the
phone based layouts really felt like
this was for for the people that read
you know there's a lot of competition in
this space now for read it later style
you know consumption but Instapaper is
really for reading and as soon as we
picked up a 7-inch tablet we really knew
that that was that was a great place to
be we we deploy on the kindle as well
with the same same way outs and nook
that was very important because we
wanted to get people that were we're
buying primarily reading devices as well
as certain people
in the the google play store that have
these tablets so it was a pretty easy
decision to make once we held those
tablets that the phone would be a
secondary place to run into the paper
and most likely you're going to want to
sit out on the couch or land that and
then read on a nice without just just
looking at it here I can see straight
away what it reminds me of is my Kindle
em you know just a great experience for
being optimized for being able to read
content so it's it's a very simple
display very sparse without being too
small which i think is important yeah we
are we really were we're focused on
simplicity instapaper is not a complex
interface I we have a lot of
opportunities to create little you I
mechanisms that are fun or or maybe a
little overly complex and needs those
you know wouldn t be for instant paper
this it really the simplicity of the
experiences is core I think to that
whole product oh I totally agree i think
you know it's like you start up the app
and it almost looks and I say this with
respect it almost looks a little boring
you know you open it up and it's like oh
it's just a bunch of things to read and
then you click them and there's articles
to read but that I think is kind of the
point right there's no distraction
there's no oh what does this app do how
do i use this what features that are
available is like yeah there aren't any
crazy pop-ups or gigantic menus it's
just a bunch of really that you've
chosen to read and provide it in a way
for you optimized for you to be able to
read it you know i love the fact that
you can change the fonts and the profile
and everything else you know the other
thing that I noticed about this design
that I think is really interesting as a
lot of people well almost everyone i
think that writes a tablet app will
start with a two column layout that's a
you know a master-detail type of yeah
like sort of navigation on your left
with the you know detail on the rise
right scenario I and you guys did not do
that you go with a two column view then
so it makes me think of a newspaper and
I think that's very effective is it's
really interesting layout it's so that
just
goes to the same tenant and we believe
that the content is king and then some
paper and we want to give you as much
content without without you know we're
not just space filling here we put two
columns up so that you could see the
most recent articles that you saved or
get a little bit more content on the
screen so you can quickly and get into
that reading experience yeah I think
it's a really good point but it a lot of
the way that this is presented is like
you say sort of inspired by newspapers I
would say you know in that you can fit
probably as many articles probably not
quite as many if you just had this
listed vertically with the same amount
of text but it would look kind of weird
because you'd have these really long
lines I wouldn't be nearly as readable
either no absolutely not and so here
you've kind of taken that approach which
we've learned from however many decades
of printing newspapers that people can
read columns much more easily than lots
of long flat strings and so I love to
see apps which take things which we've
learned from other industries and saying
well you know what it's actually not
that different what you're creating here
is an instant paper or a way for people
to be able to come to to quickly scan
browsing and read content yeah in fact I
have to say now when I when I click
through to one of the stories and it
takes up the entire width of the screen
I'm actually kind of disappointed that's
interesting I mean I think it's one of
the bigger challenges so I'd be
interested to know when you're sort of
looking at the the detail view for any
of the articles you know how much of
this is reformatted how much are you
displaying this just I say just are you
displaying this in a web view and just
pulling the raw content out are you
doing any kind of reformatting to it
yeah so the escape our API provides the
basically overall HTML content we pulled
that down and cash it locally on your SD
card or your local storage and then we
have a web view that that just opens up
that content and we apply a psych a
cascading style sheet to that and some
JavaScript as well and that allows you
to different things like change the font
size change the font change the line
spacing line height the margins like I'm
so very
OBM yeah yeah they've got this whole
exactly this we're just sort of clicking
on the on the font control dialogue here
and one of the things I guess I want to
point out is that again this is another
example of an app which doesn't strictly
conform to like standard expectations of
how an app should look but it does do
some of the it's pretty much the same so
you've got the the standard share icon
on what looks like an action bar which
has actions it's obvious the way that
it's working I'd kind of like to see an
upper for dance here but that's kind of
getting a little bit nitpicky I think
that as as the up affordance becomes
more and more common people are going to
start really missing it hmm that's yeah
some of this work you got to remember
that to target things like the nuk the
last right to the point oh we had to go
back to 21 and that that presented some
some interesting problems that action
bar is not actually you know the ice
cream sandwich action bar with that rice
that was built so as the code base kind
of modernizes an ED we can you know the
new kindles in the new nooks that
they've moved off the older code base
their up the ice cream sandwich now so
we're going to be able to kind of move
up to using more system frameworks which
would rather be using anyway quite
honestly one of those things were I
don't want to say their hats they're not
creative guys would like to see right
yeah now that's fair enough so I mean I
guess what you guys are saying is if
we'd given you a backwards compatible
action bar you would have used it but we
didn't say you had to do what you could
that's a that's a familiar story yeah
honestly I there's really only one thing
I after playing at the app for a while
that that bothered me and that's this
dis which for dark mode yeah that that
looks like it may have been lifted from
somewhere else yeah the the dock mode
switch the thing which bothers me more
so than the look is that it's it's not
hugely responsive yeah I found myself
wanting to swipe it right but your house
of jobless wipe it's a tap yeah and
having yeah something that looks like
bubble the that's
me poppable is actually really
frustrating well I'm sorry we lost you
for a minute there what element are you
talking about thank you there are trucks
link see what you did there the the dock
mode uh toggle yeah it looks like a
shouldn't you don't you're okay yeah
it's gonna change we know and again some
of those were uh just a quick thing yeah
time limitations and we really wanted to
get something out the market but we're
definitely constantly looking at this
interface and we're going to be adapting
in the very near future very cool i mean
i think that's the decatur this is is
its simplicity so for any of the
nitpicks that we have around navigation
it's it's actually not too big a deal
because it's it's really straightforward
you've only got two levels of now you
can never really get lost because
there's only so far you can go and
you're never sort of trying to figure
out where it where are you out how does
this all work it really is that that
epitome of something which is easy to
use and again one of the things that we
talk about a lot we talk about designing
for tablet is to make sure that you
don't have excessive white space and i
think one of the tricks that a lot of
people do is they just fill it up with
fragments or whatever to just have not
as long lines and so i think that's you
know i know we've talked about this a
lot but i think that's what you've done
really well here is thought beyond that
as too well how can we fill this in a
way that makes it a better experience
rather than just a less sucky experience
and not just better but more appropriate
to the activity at hand exact you know
we were at the very beginning of the
show we we looked at mint com which also
filled space really really well and they
did it by having sort of a multi pain
view that felt like a you know a little
bit like a spaceship control center
which i think was really appropriate to
this idea of controlling your money
whereas this feels a lot more like it
just opened up the the afternoon paper
i'm going to take a rib solutely and i
think that's a really good observation
is sort of that difference where mint
did have sort of the gradients and the
rounding to make it sort of a more rich
sort of 3d sort of experience and this
is exactly the opposite this is about as
flat as a napkin
II without disappearing into the
background entirely it's quite
monochromatic it doesn't have blends or
gradient or anything like that because
well books and newspapers don't all
right it's just black and white text
optimized for you to be able to read but
of course you know you can see where
where they wanted to they have you know
put in some nice design touches as it's
not that it's not designed it's not it's
designed this way yeah I think that's a
really important thing you know it's
it's tempting for us as engineers I
think sometimes to go look at the things
I can do yeah and then to do them but
that can sometimes detract from a much
more simple experience which can be a
easier for people to years well we'll be
really looking forward to your next
release I know there's a bunch of little
things I think we've given some feedback
already you know there was a button that
you the the wait icons are laid out on
the action bar doesn't quite fit the
brand new guidelines it just came out a
few months ago but I think you guys are
aware of all that and can't wait to see
what you guys come up with in your next
version definitely the last thing I did
want to ask you guys I think we're well
over the time we had initially trying
because we optimistically budgeted half
an hour for talking to three different
developers that were very interested in
talking to exactly it's we don't care if
anyone else is watching we've had a
really good time is quite room the one
thing I did want to ask so you started
with tablet have you built a phone
version as well now oh absolutely yeah
and I think it more falls into your
guidelines than the newer guidelines
actual medical then the tablet interface
does but yeah we absolutely run on on
phones at every density and screen
layout sides including the newer but the
Galaxy Note layout which is a confident
weird place but yeah we've got layouts
for for all phones very cool so I guess
the one question I had been is based on
that have you seen a difference in a
user engagement vuitton tablet versus
phone a people reading longer on the
tablet versions of those metrics that
you guys collect yeah we do know that
while people will use the phone or the
tablet really at three main times a day
right while they're eating breakfast
father eating lunch and once the
and they're around dinnertime yeah but
we we have noticed that later in the day
is more tablet heavy hmm so we're seeing
a lot more tablet use it I think kind of
like when people are sitting down I
guess all these commercials in the air
all right I meet with people are in debt
or cinema kinda watches maybe pull
out their tablet for me it's right when
my 4g LTE phone runs out of battery
that's when i switch to the top time for
the tablet very nice alright perfect so
we like i said we are well out of time
but thank you guys very much for coming
on and telling us about Instapaper and
your experiences there and thank you to
all of our guests for from mint Thai
Nico for joining us as well and thank
you everyone for watching and we will be
back tomorrow for the app clinic yes
indeed it's going to be a very special
episode of the app clinic by which I
mean it will be an episode that will run
excellent that is special that's very
specially we are looking at a video
player app switcher we were going to
look at last week but decided that we
needed to have a full extra week to
really understand what was going on in
those apps so yes so do tune in tomorrow
for that we are also taking nominations
for next week's category which is
shopping apps we are actually going to
choose the apps that we're going to look
at during tomorrow's show before
tomorrow show so I do make sure if
you've got a shopping app you'd like us
to take a look at that you do throw it
into the moderator queue thanks again
for watching my name is reto I'm Ian and
we'll catch you later here
