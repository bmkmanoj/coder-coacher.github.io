camera button and just crashed which app
doesn't matter what app it's completely
hypothetical about hypothetically my
apps don't crash built an app you hit
the camera button in it and it crashed
it's trying to be a better app but it
can't not without your help why aren't
you helping Joanna wait what do you mean
I'm not helping I am a super helpful
person you were super helpful we would
have already talked about adding runtime
checks to your implicit intents fun fact
implicit intents like opening the camera
write implicit intents may not work on
every device well-thought does it won't
work on every device so on some devices
the apps you need may not be there for
your plea of help right and that would
trigger an activity not found exception
which is certainly not good news or your
app that sounds super serious like chill
your app serious right it could cause
route to crash and that would generally
happen when the app is missing because
the user has uninstalled or disabled the
application what I installed disable but
my favorite applications mm-hmm or it
could be that the users will we call
your restricted profile and doesn't have
access to all of the features restricted
profiles a serious like do we need to
get someone look at that or or it could
be to the device administrator has
restricted which apps and features are
available to the users so a divisive
measure could take away my camera well I
mean yeah but keep in mind buy devices
for work environments or devices with
parental controls may not need a camera
functionality oh we can still take
selfies right oh it crashed right so to
prevent runtime exceptions and untimely
crash this is actually really easy if
you just called resolve activity before
launching your implicit intent resolve
activity
problem solved we're done yeah that it
really is actually as simple as that
because just checking to make sure you
have something to use before using it
will make your whole application more
stable wow that's great so I mean we can
take our selfie selfie
Wow right so use runtime check better
apps build better apps
