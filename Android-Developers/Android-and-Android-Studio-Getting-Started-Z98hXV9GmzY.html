exciting opportunity to change the world
I'm going to step you through the
process of getting started with Android
using Android studio while also sharing
some pro tips based on the experiences
of a real Android startup before we even
install Android studio you should start
thinking about the app you plan to build
start by looking at the challenges you
your friends or family face could you
build an app to solve one of those
problems let's take a look at our
startup and see where their idea came
from
well that was unexpected what the hell
was that what's going on
zombies obviously those we're zombies I
don't know how but I've got the bald guy
somehow to blame oh sure solve one
problem with the Android nomicon and
suddenly this is my fault
how are we gonna survive a zombie
apocalypse we don't have any training
sigh like we can go to google play
download an app like our startup team
you have a problem to solve so it's time
to start developing first check that you
have version 7 or later of the Java
development kit installed open a
terminal window or a command prompt and
type Java - version I'm doing this on a
Mac but it should look very similar on
Linux or Windows the Java version number
is shown after the one so here you can
see I've got JDK version 8 installed if
you see an error or the version is less
than 7 you'll need to download and
install the JDK from this download page
find the java platform standard edition
select download and then select the
right bundle for your operating system
I'm on a Mac so I'll accept the license
agreement and download the Mac OSX x64
installer for the java SE development
kit once that's downloaded locate the
file and double-click it to begin the
installation process once that's
completed go back to your terminal and
confirm that it's installed correctly
now you're ready to install Android
studio we'll start by navigating to the
Android studio homepage on
developer.android.com slash SDK there's
a big button at the top that says
download Android studio click that now
carefully read the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions
select the check box confirming that
you've read them and agree with them and
then press the download Android studio
button to begin the transfer it's a
pretty big file so while you're waiting
for that to complete you've got a great
opportunity to start thinking about the
API you'll be using to build an app that
solves your problem this early in the
product lifecycle it's worth exploring
some of the options made possible using
new versions or even early access beta
versions of the Android
platform here we're looking at the new
API is available from the marshmallow
release of Android let's take a look at
our startup team exploring possibilities
so they're up Ian what's our status how
are we doing well I'm sure glad we
grabbed this dual booted Chromebook on
the way out
Google's got api's for location-based
services and that thing oh well I've got
a Fitness API oh and we should make sure
it works with Android wear okay focus
zombies so like a zombie killing a
zombie protection API or something
though location apps are pretty hot
right now I'm not finding anything in
here
check the Android zip preview release
the what Android Zed the preview what
z-z like ZZ zebra uh-huh surely
Americans oh yeah here it is there's
even a method is user a zombie in the
framework now that would be nice to have
in spore library now that your download
is finished you're ready to install
Android studio if you're on a Mac like
me double-click the file to open it and
drag the Android icon into applications
now double click the icon to start under
a studio for the first time
if you're on Windows double-clicking the
download will launch an installation
with it similar to what I'm about to
show you here for the Mac will then
select a standard installation for
Android studio hit finish to complete
the installation that's going to start
downloading two to three gigs which
includes the Android SDK that's going to
take a while so it's the perfect
opportunity to take a break make a cup
of tea and think about things like how
to monetize your app what do you think
we should about monetization because I
feel like you're not billing would be
great for all the extra skills and
defenses but subscription would be so
consistent maybe we could try a be
testing both of them see which one turns
out to be more effective that's jazz a
good idea hey should we worry about
performance this early I mean if you're
being chased by a zombie it seems like
we'd want to be responsive right right
so clearly we can't use any anons in our
app I know though is that risking
premature optimization Hey now who's
listening you all right I'll load stun
okay the download is complete so hit
finish and your installation is done now
you're ready to start coding we'll start
by creating a new hello world project
that you can build from now keep in mind
that Android studio is constantly being
updated and improved as a result the
process for your particular version may
look a little different to what I'm
showing on screen don't be alarmed the
options presented in the general flow
should still be very similar start by
choosing to start a new Android studio
project give it a name and enter a
domain these two will be used together
to form your apps package name package
names must be unique so ideally you'll
own a domain and you can use it here
even if you don't try and select
something that's unlikely to collide
with another developer
I happen to own a domain so I'll enter
that here I'm happy to use the default
project location so let's hit next to
continue
now we can select the devices we plan to
target with our app eventually we'll
want to make our app available on all
possible form factors but for our first
ever application let's keep it simple
and target only phones and tablets next
we can choose the minimum SDK we plan to
support selecting immune SDK lets you
choose your apps level of backwards
compatibility a lower value will make
your app available to a larger number of
devices but in turn will require you to
do more work to ensure compatibility
with devices that may not support all
the features added in newer Android
releases you can check to see what
proportion of Android devices are
running on each platform release by
clicking this help me choose link when
we film this video in October of 2015
supporting back to Android 4.0 or Ice
Cream Sandwich let us reach around 90%
of devices now you're prompted to select
a new activity or user interface screen
type to add to your project to get
started we'll choose a blank activity
give it a name and a title the other
files layout and menu resources will be
automatically generated for you and you
can keep the default names then hit
finish read some tips and wait for your
new project to be created this may take
a little while the very first time you
run it
so here's one we prepared earlier your
hello world app is now ready to run you
can see it running on the emulator by
hitting the green Run button like this
and selecting the emulator
but it's much more fun to run it on a
real Android device
enable USB debugging by navigating to
settings and going down to about phone
then scroll down and press the build
number seven times this will enable
developer options navigate back select
developer options and enable us bugging
from within there if you're running
Windows you'll also need to download a
driver for your phone you can find
drivers and installation instructions
for them here on the Android developer
site at developer.android.com slash tool
slash extras / om - USB now plug your
phone into your computer and if prompted
choose to allow USB debugging hit the
Run button in Android studio but this
time select your real device
congratulations you're running your
first app on a real phone with that
you're ready to start building a real
app unlike this example you'll need to
spend a lot of time working on a
delightful responsive and intuitive user
experience speaking of which let's see
how I'll start-up is getting on so I've
got the app running but how do I know if
it's working it's not working have you
enabled real time location in the
settings wait is that the let the brain
icon of the celery stick celery stick
then you scroll to the bottom and hit
the version number seven times joiner
you get the needless hmm oh I'm sorry I
meant to tell you guys I decided to join
a different startup called meter which
will connect zombies with hosts humans
and like make sure that they're fresh
juicy brains on demand so it's gonna be
great but you read I should probably go
good luck you go
she could have left the film
unfortunately for our courageous startup
they were late to market and they had
some serious issues with their UX design
you can avoid their mistakes using our
resources to learn how to build and
design great Android apps good luck you
know cold we definitely use an enum to
get to running faster
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
