novice and expert programmer alike
threads I'm Joanna Smith and threading
can be one of the greatest parfum
provements you make but it will also
likely drive you crazy Tom Sawyer
illustrated threading perfectly a long
time ago when he needed to paint that
fence because when you've got a large
chunk of work to do and it's the same
work over and over again you call in
some friends to get it done quickly so
for computations that are taking a long
time consider calling and reinforcements
with threads by allowing multiple
threads of execution to operate on your
data set in parallel you reduce the
overall time required to complete the
task with Android threading becomes
especially important because the entire
app runs on the main thread which is
also called the UI thread because it
updates the UI and when the UI stops
responding users stop using your app so
when you want to perform some complex
action in response to a button being
pushed for example you'll want to move
that off the main thread until it is
finished so that the user can continue
to interact with your app because there
are a few things worse than the dreaded
application not responding dialogue
however integrating threads into your
system is not for the faint of heart
you're going to have to rethink your
entire approach to computational
complexity into your memory model in
order to properly integrate threads so
to avoid the rabbit-hole take advantage
of the android framework which has been
built to help you out careful thought
and planning about your apps structure
when flow will enable you to determine
whether a thread should affect the UI or
be entirely hidden API is like async
task and thread both help you manage the
work and keep you out from hanging
but async tasks will also allow you to
affect the UI like when you want to
display a progress dialog so take a walk
through your own app and see if there
are places where it stops responding or
gets exceptionally slow in response to a
user action and then move all of that
extra work off the main thread but you
know thoughtfully don't just change
things willy-nilly
because while threading may be
intimidating it shouldn't scare you what
is scary though is bad performance which
is why you should check out the rest of
our Android performance patterns content
and consider joining our G+ community
for tips tricks and help but most
importantly keep calm profile your code
and always remember perf matters
