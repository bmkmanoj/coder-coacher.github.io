generate big ideas that actually lead to
massive change a few years ago my
husband and co-founder Nishant was
living and backpacking around China for
a few months he faced a lot of trouble
trying to order food as a vegetarian so
knowing Mandarin was critical for him
the problem that the shant face actually
led us to imagine the kind of problems
that language learners around the globe
face so we thought why not create
something innovative which could be
heavily accessible affordable and
effective for people to be able to learn
languages
almost 80% of India is in the productive
age group they can get jobs but they
fail to do so because of English
becoming the barrier so it's extremely
important for them and it's
life-changing for them to know English
my name is Sydney I'm Emily I'm from
Mumbai when I retired from my job I
decided to do something useful that's
why I joined a long leash
I believe there there are so many kids
around us they want to learn English
joining our English gave me enough
confidence to go to my hometown and
teach the poor and needy that's my aim I
am here because he because of that I
improved my English a lot before that I
was afraid of speaking English in front
of others but now those worries are true
children for you what is your name hello
hello means namaste English is good for
higher education is a key for better
life this is good
very good
starting out we never dreamt that we
would reach the kind of scale that we
are at right now over 30 million users
are currently using the app we are
bigger than any University our school
that has existed for ages in India and
Google Play it gives us insights and
data into the behavior of these users so
we can reach out to an even larger set
of users while inspires us as a team and
what motivates us the most is when we
hire users talk about how learning
English with the app has impacted them
in such a positive way that inspires us
to keep going that inspires us to make a
bigger impact I believe what we give to
the world that you take with you when
you die</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
