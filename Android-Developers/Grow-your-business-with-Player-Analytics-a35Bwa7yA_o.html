person right there and we are extremely
excited to talk to you about all the
different awesome things that play
brings to the table to help grow your
games business on play and we kicked off
with something pretty exciting earlier
today it's about time we retire the 50
megabyte limit and now it's a hundred
megabytes the 50 might 50 megabyte limit
is dead long live a hundred megabytes so
this is like definitely the top request
for a very very long time so I figured
we could probably probably can't stress
this point enough yeah thanks Ben hi
everybody I'm John McGuire I'm on the
Google Play business development team
and you know I think that's really
exciting news as well so thanks for
bearing with us there while i was at 50
um so we're with a bunch of oh yeah i'm
going to need this we're with a bunch of
game developers in the room but i want
to take a quick audience poll to see how
many of you have made a mobile game so
put your hands in the air if you have
almost everybody keep your hands in the
air if you thought it was easy yeah ISM
ok one or two well making a mobile game
is not easy and I've done it myself as
well and I want to take you to the sort
of the five phases that you know we and
I went through making the game and then
how play can help you there so first you
have the ideation stage and this is
really the most fun stage it involves
probably a conference room some pizza a
lot of stickies and you're really coming
up with an idea like maybe the zombie
match-3 card battler pretty quickly you
then decide on an idea that you want to
then bring to a prototype and you want
to move as quickly as possible to get
your game on a device and the theme of
the prototyping phase is all about
iteration how quickly can you turn
around feedback in your game and make
the game better and then once you're
ready to sort of you know get some real
kpi's behind the game you might move
into soft
lunch and this is where you're picking a
territory or maybe several and your soft
launching it to get kpi's and see how
the markets reacting to your game and
finally if you decide to launch your
game you then that's a pretty big moment
and you want to build as much in
consumer anticipation as possible
there's a lot of champagne on a
celebration lot of champagne and that
was actually the easy part because then
you have to run your game as a live
service and that that's actually the
hardest part so we're here to talk to
you today about all the ways that play
can help you in these various phases now
we can't quite help you yet with the
ideas phase but we might get there one
day so alpha beta testing earlier they
le mentioned just talked about alpha
beta testing so this is a feature in the
developer console that allows you to
upload an apk and you can upload it to
either alpha or beta there's two
important characteristics of this the
first is that users always have to
opt-in to either alpha or beta and the
second is that they can't leave reviews
and so while your game is in the
prototyping phase this is actually a
really good way for you to iterate
quickly without being penalized for
something going wrong in a game or a bug
and secondly alpha or beta can be open
or closed and this is something we
launched several months ago he was two
months ago so enclosed testing this
might be a set of trusted testers where
you actually invite via email and so you
have to invite them and they opt in and
they can be a part of your your group
open beta or open alpha either one is
where you actually get a URL and then
you can distribute that URL and anybody
with the URL can can download and play a
game and I think back to when I made the
game in 2012 a long time ago we actually
didn't have this and this would have
been a really useful feature and how I
would have used it as I would have
started off in closed beta with like a
set of family and friends and maybe our
game team and then I would have moved to
open beta after that to collect greater
feedback from a broader set of people
one of the ways you can distribute the
game if you have like marketing channels
you can put the URL there
and you know I think it's a really great
feature and one that we're going to
continue to build on so you're ready to
take your game to soft launch we the
soft launch is a really important phase
because it's one of the first moments
where consumers actually see in your
game and we've built some features that
allow you to help optimize your game
during soft launch and this is called
store listing experiments so to give you
some context the store listing
experiments solutions that are in the
marketplace today are expensive they are
imperfect as well and you can see here a
quote from Rovio they spent fifty
thousand dollars testing over a
six-month period basically their icons
and descriptions in the game and that is
an imperfect solution and we wanted to
make it better so a few months ago we
launched store listing experiments so
this allows you to test your icon your
video your images and your short and
long description I mentioned earlier
that your that this is one of the first
times that a consumers actually see in
your game in a marketplace so while your
game is in soft launch you could imagine
testing things like your icon which is
actually the most visible thing to a
consumer and one of the things you might
have the most questions about during
your development here's an example from
a developer that we work with called
named congregate you can see here that
there's the the during their soft launch
they optimized or tested their game
games icon and they saw ninety-one
percent increase in the number of
installs they got per impression and you
think about like the effect of that
where you're effectively you having the
cost of your CPI just by making these
types of improvements when I look at
something like this I have literally no
idea in advance like which one of these
could possibly work is it is it mr.
eyepatch is that the best one is it the
girl with the gun is that the girl with
the red hair or is it the helicopter
nobody knows it's impossible to tell
exactly and that's and that's one of the
things we really recommend is the best
practice during soft launch is
optimizing these kind of unknown things
like what
nikon's going to resonate well with
players so you've made the decision to
launch your game that's a really big
moment and we want to help you build as
much consumer anticipation as possible
so a few months ago we built a product
called pre-registration so I'm a big
Arnold Schwarzenegger fan there was a
movie that came out to this summer that
was called Terminator Genisys and it had
the 1984 Arnold in it and the 2014
Arnold in it and so I went to the
developer glue created a game that was
in conjunction with the movie release
and so I go to this marketing page what
they've created and I click on the click
here to pre register button I'm then
taken into the store where I can then
see a big inviting green button that
says click me to pre-register I then get
a notification that says hey when we
launched we're actually going to send
you a push notification to let you know
that we've launched I really like that
so i click ok I got it I can then go
down the page and see a bunch of videos
of explosions some marketing material
and things of that nature I can also
share the game and see what other games
that the developer has made we're all
busy people sometimes we forget about
launches although I didn't forget about
this one but when the game launched I
gotta push notification that says hey
the game has launched come play it so I
click on the push notification I'm taken
to the store and I can start playing the
game we think this is a really important
feature that allow you to build a ton of
consumer anticipation for your game if
you're interested in this feature talk
to your business development manager
about it so that's all the stuff up
until and when you launch the game now
Ben's going to talk to you about the
stuff of running your game running your
game is a live service see if we can yay
it worked alright so as John mentioned
you now have launched your game you've
got it in the market and now it's time
to figure out how to go from just merely
launching a game to having like a
thriving successful business on play
play game services the area that I'm a
product manager for is built from the
ground up to support this transition to
being a successful franchise in a French
a very successful game and when I think
about what we're trying to do it's about
giving people and developers a way to
create new and exciting goals for
players new things for them to do inside
of the game that go beyond the core game
loop things like achievements
leaderboards player analytics quests
multiplayer all these different services
together make a cohesive product that
allows you to be more successful and
when I think about like what we're
trying to do our core mission as the
Play game services came I like to frame
it around the story of a guy named Eric
framling eric is the archetype of the
developer we want to help with Play game
services he's a one-man army that does
literally everything for his game he's
the artist he's the animator he's the
game designer he's also head of user
acquisition all of the things but for
Eric to be successful he needs to think
about his business as an ongoing service
he delivers to players and a big chunk
of what he has to do right it's to
compete with the largest possible
developers right have armies of quants
and armies of developers and armies of
artists so our mission is to help make
Eric competitive with big studio
capabilities and that's what we're
trying to do with Play game services and
it really starts off with this the idea
of giving people the insights they need
to run their business and so that's why
we launched player analytics earlier
this year and player analytics is a set
of reports in the developer console that
give you insight into what's going on in
your game and this is a great example so
we have something called the sources and
sinks report that we offer to developers
and in the build-up to GDC earlier in
the year we spent a lot of time with
Eric we built numerous prototypes of
different report
so that we could vet the ideas and when
we took a look at the data and we shared
these reports with with Eric we found
that there was a major imbalance in his
in-game economy it's a classic problem
you're giving away too much premium
currency but you don't have enough uses
of that premium currency in the game and
his case he has premium currency called
tickets and he was giving tickets away
at an outrageous rate and ultimately it
was making it virtually impossible for
people to have a moment in the game when
they needed to make it in app purchase
and so we gave him this report he was
able to quickly identify clearly that
there was something going on that he
needed to improve so he made a couple of
changes to his game and he could
immediately see the impact the line
switched the blue line the sinks
actually exceeded for the first time in
his game ever the rate at which he was
giving them away as a huge transition
for him and in three short weeks he saw
average revenue per daily active user
more than double an average revenue per
paying user grow by almost seventy
percent that's almost unheard of impact
to have in such a short period of time
and we're continuing to invest in more
reports that drive additional value for
you guys and in particular Eric so there
the quote here player analytics has
helped me home in on bomb squad
shortcomings right the ship and get to a
point where I can financially
financially justify making the games I
want to make and again we're pushing the
needle further with new stuff for you
guys so just recently we launched
something called the time series explore
the time series explore is a report that
helps you understand what's happening in
the most critical moments of your game
what happens when people first start
playing what happens just before they
leave the game and you have the ability
to compare different segments of players
so you can see what your big spenders
are doing versus your small spenders
versus people who have never spent it
all on your game and you can get a
credible level of detail here so for
example on line 3 here player number 3
he spent or she spent four dollars and
ninety-nine cents and then before that
you could see that they've earned a
number of different achievements and if
you hover your cursor over each one of
these shapes you get another level of
detail about what's going on so and just
to give you some background here what
what are you're seeing here each one of
these rows represents a different player
and all of the unique events that happen
during the game and every day we take
all of these time series and we take a
sample of those and we display them to
you so you can deepen your understanding
develop an intuition about what's going
on in your game what's working and not
working and we hopefully provide some
presets for this report so
configurations that answer a particular
type of question so for example you can
choose to ask the question what happens
at the start of game play where am I
losing my players is a tutorial wrong
you can ask the question what happens
before first spin which you can actually
see right here and what we do is we
align all of the first spend events with
each other and you can just scan to the
left see everything that happened before
they spent for the first time and scan
to the right to see everything that
happened afterwards and you can compare
different player segments like I
mentioned before so you can develop
again an intuition about what's working
really well what's getting your big
spenders to behave in that way versus
what's happening to those people who
spend very little and of course you need
to understand why people are leaving
your game so again we have another
pre-configured report here that allows
you to line up all of the churn events
for all the people that have left your
game in the last 28 days and you can
scan very easily to the left here to
understand what is driving this is it
because people are losing too often in
the tournament mode do I need to improve
matchmaking you can discover all of
these things and we offer a set of
custom events that you can add as well
so in addition to all the default things
that get put it here spend and
achievements and so forth in sessions
you can log your own custom event so any
piece of information you would like to
see visualized in this report you can
trivially do that by adding an event in
your game and you'll absolutely the next
day be able to see this data flow
through the
report and you can develop an
understanding about that specific type
of data that you're looking for and we
also launched something called the
events viewer this is a general purpose
like a vent visualizing tool and there's
give you some background here you know
going back to pre GDC or early in the
year when working with Eric the
prototyping phase of that we worked with
a commercial bi-product something that
you would have to purchase and we took
all the raw events data we dumped it in
this commercial bi tool and we generated
basically prototypes of all the reports
right but it was in that process that we
learned what are the key things what are
the types of reports what are the key
types of visualizations that were
important and we took all of the use
cases that we found during the
prototyping phase four player analytics
we took all those key use cases and we
put them into the product and so the
events viewer here captures all of the
powerful things in this very expensive
commercial bi product and we made them
available for free in the developer
console just for integrating Play game
services but insights are not enough
right we're all very happy with insights
give you the best insights in the world
but you actually have to be able to take
action in your game in order for the
core metrics in your KPIs to improve and
that is why we have launched a feature
called quest what quests are are
time-based objectives for your entire
community of players so like the
canonical example of a quest is from
this game here towermadness to from a
partner limbic and they have a weekend
quest and every weekend you can see in
the games app which is a sort of a
companion app to all these services that
there's an upcoming quest you can accept
the quest join the game complete the
quest inside the game earn the reward in
the form of wool I believe in this game
and it's a fabulous way of rhian gauging
your player after the launch of a game
without requiring your players to
actually update and get a new apk so
dynamic delivery of content that's a big
theme here and taking your insights and
moving into the action phase and so I'll
go through
a short case study on a partner of ours
concrete software so they've been around
for a while these guys are 1015 people
and mostly engineers and every single
minute that they're spending on server
infrastructure and live operations it's
taking away from what they would really
like to do is work on the game and so
with quests they see an opportunity to
get a big studio capability that would
have required lots of server
infrastructure and other types of
support and they get that for free and
frees up some time to work on their
passion making games and this is their
flagship title PBA bowling so John do
you bowler an awful bowler but doesn't
stop me from trying but everybody can be
a rock star bowler in PB a bowling the
quite fulfilling and they have an
amazing implementation of quests they
followed all of our best practices to a
tee and what was particularly exciting
about this use case is that they've made
it an integral part of the way they
deliver new content to players and
here's an example so this is the
calendar of promotions from January this
year and you can see multiple times a
week multiple times a week they deliver
new content to players like on january
seven they launched the hammer Black
Widow legend bowling ball an amazing
bowling ball honestly it's a little
scary how awesome it is and along with
the new bowling ball they had an
advertisement inside the game they push
notifications they sent out tweets and
so forth social media and along with
every single one of these pushes of new
content they also had a quest and the
reason why they make West such an
integral part of their live operation
strategy is because it had a measurable
material impact on user engagement so
what they found when they looked at the
data was that the on the day that a
quest is accepted sessions per user were
fifteen percent higher than their
benchmark and that that impact was
sticky after request was completed
sessions were four percent higher stone
so you can understand why they have made
that such
core component of the way they deliver
new content to players and we're
continuing to invest in this theme of
taking action to incite with the player
stats API so the player stats API is
something we just very recently launched
along with the latest version of the
Play services SDK and what it does is it
gives you away gives you a way of
finding out information about what
segments your players are in so I'll
give you an example so let's say someone
starts a session in your game they've
signed in you can call the player stats
API and find out there a 95th percentile
spender in your game you can find out
that they haven't been in your game for
about 10 days and you could show them a
glorious promotion saying welcome back
and here are some coins things you could
use in the game to buy something awesome
for yourself and so the key player stats
is being able to deliver tailored
experiences for every segment of your
player base and you can get things like
what session percentile they're in
session length we're going to continue
to just pile stats into this API and we
think that will deliver an enormous
amount of value another good example
here is let's say you want to monetize
your players through incentivize ads to
very common pattern now some of our
partners make up to fifty percent of
their revenue through incentivize ads
like this but maybe you don't want to
show the incentivize add option to
everybody maybe you want to reserve that
to people that are unlikely to ever
spend any money into your game so again
somebody logs in you call the API you
can find out that they're a lower
percentile spender who happens to be
highly engaged with the game that is
exactly the type of person you want to
deliver this particular option to and
with that so we talked about all of the
different ways that play can deliver
value throughout the lifecycle of a game
and it's still incredibly hard to make a
good game a successful game but with
services that John talked about an
integrating play game services those
types of things are the first step to
success and we can open the floor for
some Q&amp;amp;A questions I see a hand I think
and you mentioned being able to check a
turn Point for users is that a is that
defined by the developer or is that
preset by the google play analytics so
how we define churn yep okay so the
question was how do we define churn so
it is something that we set on the
behalf of everybody but the there is a
standard formula for this if someone
hasn't been around for seven days
they're classified retrospectively as
having turned on the the last day that
they played the last event we have and
if I want if you know say from my game I
want to flex that outside you know
define it as 10 days or 14 days could I
do that not today but this is why we're
having you guys here this is great
feedback so come grab me over some beers
during the happy hour and we can talk
all about the different ways you would
like to modify the classification of a
turn user thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
