boundaries to really change the rules
and change the game I grew up on the
farm it was a very cool childhood
because you're growing up next to your
dad working on the field one thing what
I really learned about was what does
work all day long actually mean I think
as an farmer you're kind of an
entrepreneur and this is where for me my
heart to become an entrepreneur somehow
status I decided to study mobile
computing where I met my co-founders I
was running more often and then we said
hey we have to do something in that area
we want to help people change their life
and I think being physically fit really
supports whatever you are doing so we
quit our jobs and we started around us
today
there's something about running that
connects you with somebody so when it's
your own daughter
it was on for me
I was 40 years old when I started
running and it all started with a
challenge I signed my daughter up for a
10k she was very upset with me so I told
her that I would run a 5k to show her my
support she said like you're gonna get
off the couch and run a 5k and I took
the challenge and I ran the whole 5k the
first marathon she ran was the one in
Nashville I used the runtastic how to
run a marathon in three hours and 30
minutes and it worked it was really fun
when I daughter was cheering me on about
every 30 minutes keeping up with her
thing where she's at how far till she's
done since I started running I've been
doing all kinds of races
I am currently training for my second
marathon what running has taught me is
that I can't achieve so much I feel very
proud to say that's my mom that's my mom
she's the reason I'm still running
otherwise I probably would have quit
Alexa started looking up half marathons
I'm like you pick any place you want to
go to and we'll go that'll be our thing
so we've got that
I don't have somebody else our business
has evolved so much over the past years
and now having more than 200 employees
and 220 million downloads but this is
not all now being part of the auditors
family together we want to get to the
next level
it's incredible what is possible through
technology Google Play has been the
perfect partner for us with their
technology they allow us to iterate in a
very innovative and quick way this is
exactly what we need for our users to
build a perfect product and it helps a
lot to really push boundaries just cool
to see that people really transform
themselves people are able to do things
they couldn't have done this before
and this is the game changer
