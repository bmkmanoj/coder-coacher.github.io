like writing a novel I studied
literature but I also studied history
you can play with history using cliche
if you want to be funny and to create a
gap between something that's old and
something that's modern I really think
that coding and writing are of the same
nature you have some way to name things
to structure your logic which is very
similar to writing a sentence
I developed rangs in my house me and my
computer I launched the first version
the week my son was born it was a great
deadline for me reigns was a nine month
project so it's like a pregnancy that
was a stressful time my life changed
because of my son really wanted to be
present in his life working as an indie
game developer is very good for that
it's very easy to work on your own but
it's not how you make games you can't
design every little point
you have to have the scale of being able
to go to people and show your stuff but
it brings a new perspective and new
ideas that's super important
once you able to try new things it gives
freedom so I'm able to work wherever I
want and I'm able to work with people
from everywhere in the world
I look back on the journey I've been on
in such a short time and still a little
overwhelming brains is a mix of tinder
and gamma fronds swipe your own
adventure we used a lot evocation with
just a few words and a few sentences you
should be able to imagine yourself in
the skin of the King I think the first
time was up here with the game was when
I saw someone playing and started to
laugh and that's the moment I knew we
had something different Google Play was
helpful to the success push the game and
that very crucial moment and paved the
way for 1.5 million downloads
a google play indie game contest we're
very good for that it's important for
your exposure to I go and try things you
have to make the most of every
opportunity you're given
the industry of flow by games is quite
new
we know our users are hungry for it they
want more stories more rains we're only
scratching the surface of what we can do
