founder and CEO of hello English it's an
app that helps millions of Indians learn
English in a fun and engaging way using
gamification so the idea of hello
English came about when I was actually
studying in China and trying to backpack
around surviving as a vegetarian without
speaking Mandarin it made me realise
that the problem was far worse for
Indians trying to learn English a
language which has become critical to
professional success today India is a
wonderfully diverse country with 22
languages recognized by the government
but English is the preferred business
language all large businesses prefer to
use English I'm Frank Cho Bhandari I'm
the co-founder of hello English app we
wanted to make English learning fun
convenient and affordable because it
could really empower millions of Indians
to be able to learn English right on
their smartphones hello English supports
over 15 Indian languages 12 of which
have native font support on Android a
key goal of the app is to help people
speak in English and Google's
text-to-speech engine makes it quite
easy for us ever since they introduced
the Indian English accent our weekly
retention rates grew by over 18 percent
our users face certain typical issues
quite early on poor internet
connectivity devices with low storage
capacity low processing power we decided
to focus our efforts entirely on
optimizing our app for these issues we
remember that Google has a bunch of
tools that can really help developers to
optimize their apps for emerging markets
like India we reduced the app size from
16 MB to 9 MB which immediately reduced
our uninstalled rate by 15% also the
majority of the features of the app can
actually work without any internet
today we have more than 13 million
people who are learning English on hello
English from not just India but around
the world we are also expanding
geographically into several other
emerging markets which face a similar
need to learn English more than anything
else we are encouraged by the stories
that we hear from our learners and how
our efforts are transforming their lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
