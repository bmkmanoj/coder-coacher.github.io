advocate here at Google this is Android
tool time and we're here with Android
studio 2.2 at Google i/o this year we
previewed Android studio 2.2 promising a
host of new features and improvements
after testing and integrating your
feedback during the preview and beta
phases we're happy to announce that
Android studio 2.2 is now available for
download in the stable Channel Android
studio 2.2 offers improvements for all
phases of app creation prototyping and
interface design code development and
iteration and testing and debugging let
me walk you through some of those
changes we revamped the layout editor
and added built-in support for
constraint layout an entirely new way to
build dynamic user interfaces on Android
in a visual way by specifying view
positions and constraints the layout
editor features a new blueprint mode and
an attribute panel for changing the
visual attributes of widgets so you
won't have to jump into text mode as
often and for when you need to debug
your UI we have a new layout inspector
that lets you capture a snapshot of the
view hierarchy and attributes as they
run on a device or emulator we're
continually improving the code editor
bringing you better code analysis with
new and updated lint checks you can now
also simply right click to search across
all our samples on github when you need
to consult Android sample code for the
proper usage of an API and we've
upgraded to IntelliJ 2016 point 1 with
all its enhancements such as
right-to-left language support and
method argument reordering thanks to the
firebase integration you can now easily
add firebase services like analytics
cloud messaging and crash reporting to
your apps including initial project
setup and adding dependencies we include
handy documentation links and code
snippets that you can add to your app to
get the firebase features up and running
quickly to better understand what
happens to your manifest during merging
you can now use the merged manifest
viewer this lets you preview the
manifest as it will look after the build
with contributions from other manifest
files in libraries highlighted in
different colors for developers who want
to examine the finished content of their
apk we've built a new apk analyzer in
Android studio by simply opening your
apps apk you will
be able to inspect how much space each
component of your app takes up along
with an estimated download size even
taking into account any compression
applied by the Play Store with a compare
feature it's easy to analyze apk size
regressions relative to previous
versions of your app you can also debug
Multi Dex issues by drilling down into
classes.dex as well as explore the
contents of resource files anyone
working with native code and libraries
will the Kapiti here that we've added
support for C and C++ projects using the
C make and NDK build systems
now you can seamlessly import your
native project in Android studio and
take advantage of the many improvements
we've made to editing and debugging C
and C++ code in the IDE for those
working with OpenGL ES directly we're
including a beta version of a new GPU
debugger which records GL commands at
runtime and lets you replay and fully
inspect the GL state in each frame and
after each instruction including the
contents of the buffers textures and
meshes we're still working on a few
features of the GPU debugger as well as
improvements to its speed and stability
which is why it's marked as beta please
give us feedback on this new tool
through the Android studio Google+
community in bug tracker with this
release of Android studio we're letting
developers try out our new tool for
creating UI tests for your apps the
espresso test recorder also in Veda
the test recorder works by recording
your interactions with the app within
the emulator and letting you add
assertions in a simple interface the
generated tests are just plain java code
using the espresso library so you can
customize them later if needed the
release of Android studio 2.2 coincides
with the 25.2 - updates to the SDK tools
and Android emulator the emulator now
lets you simulate several Android
sensors such as the accelerometer
magnetometer ambient temperature and
more within the emulator UI including a
3d representation of the device that you
can move about as always the newest
Android studio brings many other under
the hood improvements such as fixes to
instant run build time improvements
support for annotation processors in the
jak compiler new app packaging code and
better accessibility support in the IDE
to make sure you get the most of this
version of studio remember to update
your projects to use the - 2.0 version
of our Android Gradle plugin update your
build tools and emulator images using
the SDK manager and make sure to enable
in
run I think that you'll enjoy the many
new features and stability improvements
in Android studio 2.2 and as always
we're looking forward to your feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
