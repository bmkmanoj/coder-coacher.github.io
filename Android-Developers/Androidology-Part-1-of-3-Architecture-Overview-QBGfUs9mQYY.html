on the Android development team Android
is an open software platform for mobile
development it is intended to be a
complete stack that includes everything
from the operating system through
middleware and up through applications
in the next few minutes I'm going to be
introducing you to an overview of the
architecture of the Android platform and
I'm also going to talk about some of the
key principles that are underlying its
design if we're going to talk about
architecture we need to start with a
diagram covered with a lot of little
boxes and this is ours our architecture
we're going to start at the bottom work
up architecture is based on the Linux
2/6 kernel we use the Linux kernel as
our hardware abstraction layer so if you
are an OEM trying to bring up Android on
a new device the first thing you do is
bring up Linux and get all your drivers
in place the reason we're using Linux is
because it provides a proven driver
model and in a lot of cases existing
drivers it also provides memory
management process management security
model networking a lot of core operating
system infrastructures that are robust
and have been proven over time the next
level up is our native libraries
everything that you see here in green is
written in C and C++ it's at this level
where a lot of the core power of the
Android platform comes from I'm just
going to go through and describe what
some of these components are going to
start with the surface manager the
surface manager is responsible for
composing different drawing surfaces
onto the screen so it's the surface
manager that's responsible for taking
different windows that are owned by
different applications that are running
in different processes and all drawing
at different times and making sure the
pixels end up on the screen when they're
supposed to below that we have two boxes
OpenGL ES and s GL and these two make up
the core of our graphics libraries
OpenGL ES is a 3d library we have a
software implementation that is hardware
accelerated if the device has 3d chip on
it the STL graphics are for 2d graphics
and that is what most of our application
drawing is based on one interesting
thing about the Android graphics
platform is that you can combine 3d and
2d graphics and the same
location moving over we have the media
framework the media framework was
provided by packet video one of the
members of the Open Handset Alliance and
that contains all of the codecs that
make up the core of the media experience
so in there you'll find mpeg-4 h.264 mp3
AAC all the audio and video codecs you
need to build a rich media experience we
use free type to render our fonts we
have an implementation of sequel light
we use that as the core of most of our
data storage we have WebKit which is the
open source browser engine that's what
we're using is the core of our browser
it's the same browser that's powering
Safari from Apple and we've made some
we've worked with that engine to make it
render well on small screens and on
mobile devices next is the Android
runtime and the main component in the
Android runtime is the dalvik virtual
machine the Android runtime was designed
specifically for Android to meet the
needs of running in an embedded
environment where you have limited
battery limited memory limited CPU the
the dalvik virtual machine runs
something called Dex files de X and
these are byte codes that are the
results of converting at Build time dot
class and dot jar files so these files
when they are converted to dot Dex
become a much more efficient bytecode
that can run very well on small
processors they use memory very
efficiently they the data structures are
designed to be shared across processes
whenever possible and it uses a highly
CPU optimized bytecode interpreter the
end result of that is that it's possible
to have multiple instances of the dalvik
virtual machine running on the device at
the same time one in each of several
processes and we'll see why that's
important a little bit later on the next
level up from that is the core libraries
this is in blue meaning that it's
written in the Java programming language
and the core library contains all of the
collection classes utilities IO
all the utilities and tools that you've
come to expect to use
moving up again we now have the
application framework this is all
written in the Java programming language
and the application framework is the
toolkit that all applications use these
applications include the ones that come
with the phone like the home application
or the phone application it includes
applications written by Google and
includes applications that will be
written by you so all applications use
the same framework in the same api's
again I'm going to go through and talk
about what some of the main components
are in this layer and the application
framework the activity manager is what
manages the lifecycle of applications it
also maintains a common back stack so
that applications that are running in
different processes can have a smoothly
integrated navigation experience next
down from that is the package manager
the package manager is what keeps track
of which applications are installed on
your device so if you download new
applications over-the-air or otherwise
install applications it's the package
manager that's responsible for keeping
track of what you have and what the
capabilities of each of your
applications are the window manager
manages windows it's mostly a Java
programming language abstraction on top
of lower-level services that are
provided by the surface manager the
telephony manager contains the api's
that we use to build the phone
application that's central to the phone
experience content providers are a
unique piece of the Android platform
that's a framework that allows
applications to share their data with
other applications we use that in our
contacts application so that all of the
information in contacts
phone numbers addresses names is
available to any application that wants
to make use of them and other
applications can use that facility as
well to share data the resource manager
is what we use to store localized
strings bitmaps layout file descriptions
all of the external parts of an
application that aren't code I'm just
going to touch lightly on the remaining
four boxes view system location manager
notification manager and XMPP service
the view system contains things like
buttons and lists all the building
blocks of the UI it also
handles things like event dispatching
layout growing location manager
notification manager and XMPP service
are some AP is that I think will allow
developers to create really innovative
and exciting applications and the final
layer on top is applications this is
where all the applications get written
it includes the home application the
contacts application the browser your
applications and everything at this
layer is again using the same
application framework provided by the
layers below now if you're going to
write an application the first step is
to decompose it into the components that
are supported by the Android platform
here are the four major ones we have
activity intent receiver service and
content provider and activity is
essentially just a piece of UI typically
corresponding to one screen so if you
think of something like the mail
application that would be decomposed
into maybe three major activities
something that lists your mail something
that shows you when an individual mail
message and a compose screen to put
together an outgoing email an intent
receiver is something different an
intent receiver is a way for which your
application to register some code that
won't be running until it's triggered by
some external event and the set of
external events that triggers your code
is open and extensible so you can write
some code and through XML register it to
be woken up and run when something
happens when the network connectivity is
established or at a certain time or when
the phone rings or whatever trigger
makes sense for your application
the next major component is a service a
service is a task that doesn't have any
UI that's long-lived that's running in
the background a good example is a music
player you may start playing some music
from an activity from a piece of UI but
once the music is playing you'd want it
to keep playing even if you're
navigating to other parts of the user
experience
so the code that's actually running
through the playlist playing songs would
be a service that's running in the
background you can connect to it later
if you want to from an activity or some
other component by binding to the
service and sending it messages like
skip to the next song or rewind
the last component is a content provider
and again that's a component that allows
you to share some of your data with
other processes and other applications
now any application can store data in
whatever may way make sense for that
application they can store it in files
they can store it in our sequel light
database whatever makes sense but if
they want to make that data available as
part of the platform so that other
applications can make use of it then the
content provider is a solution for that
and we've used that for the contacts
database that comes with the Android
platform so that any application can
make use of the information in contacts
Android was designed at a fundamental
level to encourage reusing and replacing
components I have an example here that
shows how that works on the left there
are four applications that might want to
pick a photo for some reason so the home
application might want to pick it for
wallpaper contacts might want to pick a
person's face to associate with a
contact card Gmail or MMS you might want
to have a photo that you send to someone
in an outgoing message now an Android
for these applications to make use of
the service of taking a photo they first
need to make a request so the client
component makes a request for specific
action in this case I'm illustrating
that with a clock balloon and the Gmail
application is requesting that it picks
a photo so the talk balloon is actually
a representation of a formal class in
our system called an intent what the
system does when a request is made is it
looks at all of the installed components
and it finds the best available
component that knows how to do whatever
was asked for in this case let's say
that the system finds the built-in photo
gallery now what happens is the Gmail
application is now connected to the
photo gallery when the user in Gmail
wanted to pick a photo he will be taken
to the photo gallery the photo gallery
will fulfill whatever was asked for in
the intent what makes this interesting
is that the picking of the matching
component is late bound it's done very
late and so you can swap software
components at any time so let's say you
didn't like the built-in photo gallery
and you wanted to replace it with one
that went online to find a rich
or bigger set of photos you could
replace our built-in photo gallery with
one that say goes out to Picasa or
whatever your favorite online photo site
is once you've done that then any of the
applications on the Left will now use
the new and better component on the
right to fulfill the task of taking a
photo and at any time a new application
can come along and make use of existing
functionality so if you're writing a
blogger application you don't have to
worry about writing a photo picker
yourself you can just rely on whichever
one the user has configured to be their
preferred photo picking application this
becomes really important because in
Android it's not just about picking
photos virtually any task has an intent
in the middle if the user is going from
point A to point B there's an intent in
the middle and each of those intents is
an opportunity to reuse a component or
to replace a component so we have
intense for going home which means you
can replace a home application where we
have an intent for sending an email
which means you can replace the mail
application all of these are
opportunities for replacing and reusing
components if you're interested in
finding out more about Android I
encourage you to visit the developer
site and download the SDK in the SDK
you'll find a lot more documentation and
sample code and you will also be able to
try building applications of your own
there's also a developer group that you
can join to find out more information
and I also encourage you to check back
frequently because we'll be posting
updates to the SDK as the platform
matures thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
