newspaper to being one of the largest
english-language news sources on the
planet garden products work across the
entire globe but we're really keen on
taking this even further we're extremely
excited about the growth in space travel
space based tourism and our UX
engineering and design teams here and
our look at how we can take the
fantastics periences you find on earth
and get them to work even if you're not
on earth if you're in orbit if you're on
the moon or and trip to Mars whilst
testing our designs on earth we
developed a system called ashtray UI
we've brought this into all of our UX
clothes
they're gloves of the extravehicular
Mobility unit are much larger we needed
to design some new icons floating action
buttons specifically and we use the
updated material design guidelines for
this another challenge in space is
gravity or the lack of gravity using the
principles of motion we created a system
called fixed point view no matter which
way the phone is orientated to articles
the videos the images will automatically
align to the viewer there are regular
Android api's that are very helpful in
spaceflight
one in particular is the text-to-speech
API in space there are times when you
can't easily look at the screen so read
it to me is especially useful astronauts
can then have an article read in their
helmet when they're on the moon for exam
the testing is really important because
we need to understand what works and
what doesn't work in space in the Google
Play Developer console there's a new
feature called hangout with expert hi
Captain Mark Kelly hey do you guys hear
me this allows us to have face-to-face
access anytime with a space beta tester
either on the earth or in space being in
space is a bit like being underground
sometimes the data is really expensive
and sometimes it's not there at all our
apks are as lightweight as possible so
that they could be really easily
installed then when they are running we
cache as much content as possible
innovation sets the heart of what the
teams that the guy didn't do that it's
all for a purpose that purpose is
getting our journalism into reader's
hands and now those experiences extend
not just everywhere on earth but beyond
it as well Android and Google player
parts of us achieving them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
