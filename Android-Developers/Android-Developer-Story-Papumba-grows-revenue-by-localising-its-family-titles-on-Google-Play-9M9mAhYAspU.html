create something that creates an impact
on millions of people and with the use
of technology we see that possible we
can create great games that reach and
help kids be smarter and grow stronger
every day
we are a small team that have been
working in the gaming industry for just
10 years our vision was to be a global
company since we studied the idea of the
first half came about when my niece
asked me for animal Sansa and everything
out there in the market was full of ads
share with Athena let's try to build our
own animal Songza one with no
advertising and when we launched it we
started to have thousands of downloads
every day the first half we launched it
was only three languages by the end we
saw in Google Analytics that people from
all over the world was using the app we
said okay let's do it in as many
languages as we can we are teaming for
here in Argentina that is creating the
initial part of the project but we knew
from the beginning that we had to build
a very big and strong team we started to
hire people from all over the world to
collaborate with us in voiceover
language translators and leaders and in
about two months we released the app in
15 languages and we increased our
downloads by 300% in only 12 months
in order to go global you have to figure
out all the cultural aspects in our
product call animal sounds we have our
Pig and in some specific countries our
users were requesting us to remove the
animal from the game after removing the
animal for those specific countries our
average rating change from three point
nine to four point two stars and the
result for us was just amazing rankings
our review section it's a powerful tool
in order to learn from your community of
users we are answering to them in the
user native language with the help of
google translator as a result we have
seen a great improvement in terms of
user ratings in fact all of them are
four point four stars or even higher in
average
having our apps in the Google Play Store
is great for us
we can reach millions of people for
every month in different countries and
in different languages recently we have
been working in localizing also the
pricing is super important since we did
it we saw a 20% increase in our revenue
we understand that up Moomba is like a
bridge can connect kids parents and
teachers all of our products are
conceived with the idea of empowering
our little users and it is so exciting
to create an oil product that you know
will have an impact in so many families
and houses from all over the world in
order to prepare future adults in the
best way possible
