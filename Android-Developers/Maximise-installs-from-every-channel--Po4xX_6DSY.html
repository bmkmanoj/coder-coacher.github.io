the amira lead for an AdWords platform
my team and I work with actually white a
few of you already but we work with you
on user acquisition and engagement
campaigns through Adwords so this is all
the paid advertising so I'm sure you're
looking forward to and so to kick us off
this is a lightning session so I'm going
to be covering a few topics maximizing
your user engagement through our
different channels retention and
lifetime value as well as data insights
and and management so we did a brief
study of some of some users to ask him
what ads prompted them to download an
app and not too surprisingly fifty
percent of the users were prompted to
download an app from a search ad this is
followed by the middle to which is
basically running campaigns on our AdMob
or a mobile web channels so Display
Network and lastly video as through
channels such as YouTube we know the
video has been traditionally more of an
awareness type of campaign we expect us
to change going forward with a few new
releases coming out of Lee towards the
end of this year so let's kick it off
we're absolutely delighted with the
launch of search ads in play we have
seen fantastic results although it's
very early days with increased volume
Louis EP is and the user quality is
absolutely fantastic the campaigns are
really easy to set up as well all you
have to do is go into the AdWords
interface create a search campaign set
up with a few keywords I mean if you're
stuck for keywords as a keyword
suggestion tool and run conversion
optimizer conversion optimizer optimizes
towards the target CPI that you choose
your ads will then show across google
com and the Play Store at driving people
to actually enjoy your ads it's a very
simple campaign structure and the
performance once again has been
fantastic one of our bread and butter
channels is acquiring users through
AdMob and mobile web we know this has
been performing well it's two channels
that really drive a lot of volume and
reach once again the setup is easy
upload a few text ads and we would
encourage you to use video video
interstitials have a far higher
conversion rate a target run of network
and lower conversion optimizer to find
the best users for you at your target
CPI and finally YouTube as I mentioned a
few slides back YouTube has
traditionally been an awareness a type
of channel however what we've seen is
that you can get phenomenal results are
in highly engaged users and hopefully
with the launch of conversion optimizer
towards the end of this year we'll be
able to scale user acquisition at a
target CPI across YouTube qualifying the
users before they download your app so
if you had to run each of these channels
individually this is the standard
campaign structure and setup we would
recommend to be able to maximize each
one of these channels so we would
suggest firstly making sure your
measurement is all set up whether that
be with an AdWords SDK or third body
tracking and then starting off with our
two main networks and channels display
and search these two performed
considerably over the past a couple of
months and we're very confident that
they work very well so you assorted for
those two campaigns and you can optimize
your search campaigns in week 2 by
adding a few more keywords once you've
got performance and once those two are
up and running then you can experiment
by running youtube campaigns trying to
get a bit more incremental reach
starting with similar lists to make sure
that you're targeting is tight so we
understand that traditional performance
marketing has been focused on optimizing
each one of these channels individually
and for some companies that's the right
way to go and for a lot of others it's
incredibly time-consuming and very very
difficult to do so I'm absolutely
delighted as well with the launch of
universal app campaigns it's actually
fully rolls out today there will be a
press release later on this afternoon
and and what it enables you to do as
models point out is to target across all
the different networks through one
simple campaign flow the campaign pose
as easy as this there are three steps to
it firstly you have to upload a few
lines of text a few different variations
of text and and a video
and if you image ads you can input your
locations language budget and target
cost per install and then ultimately you
have to just enable the campaign and
we'll run across all of googles channels
targeting app installed inventory this
is what the interface will look like and
as you can see on the left hand side
there are four different variations of
text and allowing conversion optimizer
to to optimize and choose the best one
you can input a YouTube URL and I'll
pull your YouTube video indirectly and
on the right hand side you can see that
your app icon and images are
automatically pulled in through google
play so optimizing those is obviously
very important and once you enable those
campaigns it's really straightforward
your ads your bids your banner
distribution and you're targeting are
all optimized automatically we aim to
get you the maximum volume at your
target CPI the initial beta testing of
this has been fantastic and we're
delighted that it's rolling out today
it'll hopefully make your lives a lot
easier when it comes to user acquisition
underlying all of this as I said before
is daughter and insights you can use
some of Google's solutions such as
integrating the AdWords SDK to track
your conversions and measure them and
analytics for measuring in app activity
or alternatively as many of you do work
with the third party let us know as we
have close relationships from both most
of the third-party tracking companies
why do we measure of course this is paid
advertising so you've got to make sure
that your average LTV is greater greater
than your average CPI we know that one
out of six users don't make a purchase
within an app and we know that eighty
percent of users only use an app one
software installing it so Appy economics
works when you know the lifetime value
of your nap and then you work with the
channel to acquire users at a lower
value so when we talk about lifetime
value this is a very very simple example
but this is something that as an
advertising channel
need to understand from you is what
actual value is that your users bringing
to you so if we look at a very basic
case of a user over one year or a set of
users over a year we can see that a user
might have paid five dollars on average
and within your app to purchase items
perhaps you have an offline store and
they made an additional five dollars
purchase throughout the year in that
offline store and we know that those
users through reviews and ratings and
messaging apps spread your app to others
so there's an uplift from word of mouth
so if we estimate that on average the
your values are your users are worth $11
to you a year then we know that we have
to pay less than that to acquire them
for you to be roi positive so once we
have identified what we're willing to
pay for a user we have to figure out how
we can maximize that lifetime value and
drive engagement the clicker seems to be
very stubborn today so when we pull the
we surveyed another set of users to
understand why they like using apps and
what key commercial activities they use
apps for and you can see there that
across the funnel they're like using
apps for multiple different things
everything from reading reviews by
others all the way through to loyalty
programs at the end of the funnel so if
you know by speaking to your users and
by looking at your analytics what users
do within your app you're able to then
create engagement campaigns to try and
dry them into that part of the funnel
that they enjoy most the two ways in
which you can create engagement
campaigns at the moment the simplest and
easiest is auto created lists so all you
have to do here is link your google play
account to your AdWords account and
there are a number of water generated
let's say that you can remark it to with
specific message this is the best and
easiest way to try this out to see if
you can generate value if you get that
right then you can start looking at
customers where you can either import
lists from google analytics services
service server or third-party
integration so once you've created your
list you understand what your users like
the last piece is
tailoring messaging to them so three
examples or of messages that you could
tailor to them and if you're trying to
get users to engage with your app the
first thing to do is to deliver to all
of them content that can only be
accessed or engaged with in the app the
second messaging is for users who may
have lapsed and stop using your app and
you want to get them back in the best
way to do this is to let them know that
there are new features within your app
that they can take advantage if they
reengage and finally what we see often
is people stop purchasing items get to
the cart and then abandon the card you
can target those in users specifically
by offering them a discount there might
be only applicable on that day to get
them to complete that purchase so as you
can see we've got two main takeaways
today first search ads and play
fantastic results initially and as of
today will be the launch of universal
app campaigns but which will hopefully
streamline and make your user
acquisition and conveys far easier so if
you want to talk about this let me know
i'll be around and each other today
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
