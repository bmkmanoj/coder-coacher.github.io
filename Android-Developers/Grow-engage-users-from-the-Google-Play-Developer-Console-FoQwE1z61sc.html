team today I'm going to talk to you
about some new tools we've got to help
you grow and engage your user base in
Google Play Google Play gives you access
to a massive 1 billion potential users
your challenge as a developer is to
require the right users use their
feedback to improve your app and engage
in the long run I'm gonna run through
some of the tools Google Play provides
to make this easy first let's start with
a great way to promote your brand
developer pages we recommend creating a
unique page on Google Play to promote
all your apps with your developer page
you're able to upload graphics explain
what your company is and actually pick
one of your apps to feature this gives
you a single destination to promote all
your apps on Google Play one in four of
our top partners have already created a
developer page app IO we announce a new
report that'll give you a better
understanding of your acquisition
channels and where your users are coming
from if you've ever wondered how many
users are looking at your store listing
this report will give you an answer
you'll be able to track a cohort of
users who visited your store listing
page when what percentage of them went
on to install your app and eventually
went on to become in-app purchases in
addition to a funnel that shows how your
users progress through the store it'll
also give you a breakdown by acquisition
channel you'll now know what percent of
your traffic is coming organically
through the Play Store versus the other
channels whether that's AdWords Google
search or your UTM tag traffic or other
third parties with one click you can see
what search keywords people use on
Google search before installing your app
providing you the insight you need to
optimize your store listing page you'll
be also interested in the tracked
channels breakdown if you use UTM tags
on your Play Store links you'll be able
to segment your users coming from your
mobile website or other partners
now that you know your conversion rate
between store listing visit and an
install let's see how you can improve it
with store listing experiments store
listing experiments is another feature
we launched at Google i/o experiments
allow you use to use data and rather
than your intuition to optimize the text
and graphics on the store listing page
in Google Play the store listing page is
where your users make a decision whether
or not to install your app you can make
this page more effective and improve its
conversion rate it can also help you
iterate on which parts of your marketing
or product resonate most with your users
developers have been asking us what are
the best practices for running store
listing experiments so here are some key
points we think you should consider
first start with a hypothesis and test
that only test one thing at a time once
you get the results iterate on that
you'll need to make sure you run your
experiment for long enough to achieve
statistical significance and pay
attention to the banner at the top of
the page we'll show you the results and
remember small tweaks can be
inconclusive so be bold for your
experiments here's a great example of a
store listing experiments from Rovio for
Angry Birds transformers in the first
experiment they tried a few different
designs they found the third one
improved installs by 7% then they
decided to iterate so they tried taking
a different tilt on the icon they found
the first one provided additional 3
percent conversion rate improvement
finally they validated the experiment by
changing the background color in this
case they found the control one
performed the best so that's the icon
they went with and here's some great
feedback from Rovio Google play's a B
testings proved so crucial that we're
now playing a soft launch most of our
upcoming games on Google Play because we
want to optimize and perfect the product
page assets we hope you find this
feature useful too and I'll help you
soft launch your apps and games on
Google Play this way when you do your
full launch you'll be sure to get the
great results you're expecting
you've told us that user acquisition is
one of your top priorities to help you
with that we're bringing universal app
campaigns right to your fingertips in
Google Play Developer console this will
launch later this year universal app
campaigns simplify campaign creation
provide a one-stop shop for you to
target your app across all the Google
properties where users are searching on
Google search within the Play Store
other relevant apps or watching videos
on YouTube Bruce will tell you more
about universal app campaigns later in
his talk maximize installs from every
channel now that you've got all these
users you'll want to interact with them
with ratings and reviews it's one of the
most important parts of the Play Store
ratings are one of the top ways users
will market your app to other people
they also help you understand what users
love and hate about your app and how
their sentiment changes over time
replying to a user review is one of the
best ways create meaningful connections
with your users and show them that you
listen to their feedback to improve your
product if you're not replying for
reviews you should give it a try most
users will update the review after a
developer has responded to them we've
listened to your feedback and out of the
features you wanted most
the ratings chart is now available on
the reviews page making it easy to track
trends in individual star ratings over
time you can also search for a specific
review and also do free text searches
across all of your reviews I hope you'll
enjoy the tools I've discussed and today
and they will help you to promote your
brand when developer pages to understand
your acquisition channels to optimize
your store listing grow a user base and
interact with your users so you'll have
great success with the apps and games
you're building on Google Play your
feedback has helped me and the play team
to understand your challenges so that we
can create the features to make your
lives easier thank you for your feedback
and we look forward to hearing you for
even more thank you
