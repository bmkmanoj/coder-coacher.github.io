   (Applause).
   ).  Good afternoon, everyone,
 thanks for joining us here in 
the audience and on the Live 
Stream.  My name is Sarah.  I 
head up business development for
 Indy cames on Google Play knee 
Kobe, product manager for Google
 Play.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Milenia, Engineering 
Manager on Google Play.  We are 
here to talk to you about some 
cool tools we are launching in 
Google Play developer console to
 help you better release your 
apps and games.  We want to make
 sure you can launch with 
confidence and better target 
your apps and games to the right
 devices in a way that makes 
great experiences for all of 
your users.  We will start with 
a quick recap 
of everything that changed in 
this area in the past year 
followed by big improvements we 
have made to release management 
flows in Google the Play in the 
past year.  We will then go on 
to announce new futures, changes
 to App Signing, new device 
catalog and device targeting 
tools.  We have heard that some 
of the areas are where you would
 like to see feedback and 
insight from Google the most so 
we are excited to show you what 
we built. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  Before we get
 to knew features, let's start 
with a recap of what happened in
 this space in the last year.  
Exactly a year ago at Google IO 
we launched open beta.  A new 
way to discover your a pps 
running on Google Play and join 
them.  Users can find your apps,
 search them, join the beta 
directly from the page and leave
 you with private review which 
you can see in the play console.
  Open beta is a great way for 
you to test your new updates 
before you launch them live to 
your users. 
   So this I'm beta allows you 
to really scale beta programs on
 Play and in the last year alone
 we have seen more than 100 
million beta testers on Google 
Play.  There is another number 
which we are really excited 
about which is 4X growth in the 
number of apps running a large 
beta program 
on Play.  We have great feedback
 from developers like WhatsApp 
telling us how open beta allows 
them to get critical feedback 
from millions of beta test ares.
  It allows them to experiment 
with new features and it's one 
of the key ways they are able to
 deliver such an awesome 
messaging experience to so many 
users globally. 
   And we get this 
feedback from team Sem.  Smap 
was one of the early adopt ors 
of  beta testing on Google Play.
  They use it for more than four
 years.  Mr. Sen tells us how it
 allows them to key to innovate 
with new app 
experiences. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  Together 
with those changes we have 
launched a developer program 
called early access.  Has anyone
 given early access a try?  
Couple of hands.  If you haven't
 I highly recommend you check it
 out.  This is a program that 
will allow you to put your apps 
or games in front of early 
adopters while your game is 
still 
in development.  The audience 
will early testers will be able 
to provide you with valuable 
feedback.  We grow a user base 
of highly engaged users that are
 more than willing to give you 
the detailed grand you lar 
feedback around how your game or
 app is performing. 
   So currently, we have 25 
million users and counting that 
are actually leveraging that 
early  early access program 
since last year, 2016.  So one 
great example here is Omnidrone.
  This is developer of Titan 
Brawl, and they are from Spain, 
and they entered into early 
access, and they saw more than 
400,000 users enter into the 
game. 
   They started by focusing on 
engagement.  That was the first 
thing they decided to iterate  
on.  They then went on to 
iterate on retention and finally
 monetization.  So with early 
access they were able to improve
 their engagement rate by 50  
50%.  I mean, that's a meaty 
number and then later 
monetization went up by 20%.  
This is before they launched 
publicly. 
   So we are really elated to be
 able to see these Android only 
tools and services move the 
needle in a really meaningful 
way towards the success other 
games
 launch.  Omnidrone has told us 
that within early access they 
were able to get enough traffic 
into their game to really 
analyze and improve their 
retention as well as take on the
 marketing assets and test that 
in store experiments before 
going live.  They also told us 
that that private feedback was 
invaluable. 
   One of the great features 
about early access is that users
 cannot rate your game or app at
 that time.  So all of that 
great feedback you are getting 
from them does not actually 
impact your store ratings.  It's
 helped them to improve their 
game experience based on that 
user feedback, which is always a
 really great practice to 
follow. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  The 
launch of early access is one of
 the ways in which Android and 
Play are evolving.  In order to 
keep pace with this and give you
 guys the tools to use the 
functionality we build to its 
full potential.  We have 
overhauled the release 
management section in the Google
 Play console.  App releases 
replace previous APK page and 
introduce significant changes in
 the way how you prepare your 
next release and roll it out to 
 users.  Firstly, we introduce 
the concept of a release and the
 consistent terminology 
throughout the flow including 
things like rollout or artifact.
   Is anyone in the audience 
using multiAPK?  Quite  a few.  
So concept release is especially
 useful for you guys.  It gives 
you a wholistic way to look at 
all of the APK's that are active
 at the time in a w holistic way
 and see which one of them were 
added now and which one were 
carried over from previous 
releases.  One more important 
the ability to operate 
preparation from the rollout.  
You had to do this weird dance 
with you upload new APKs, you 
activate the old ones and you 
public the whole lot at once.  
Now you can create the dropped 
release and save it in various 
stages of completion. 
   You can then go for lunch 
come back, make other  changes 
in the console and roll it out 
when you are really ready and 
sure.  One of the primary  goals
 of the new flow was to enable 
you to release with confidence. 
 We got plenty of feedback from 
developers like yourselves that 
they are b eing scared to 
publish because they are not 
sure what are going to be 
consequences to their existing 
and new users.  We also got 
feedback that some of our error 
messages are not very clear.  So
 these were critical as we were 
designing new flows, we made 
sure that everything is much 
more explicit in the new flows. 
   We now provide confirmation 
options at various points in the
 flow, which reduces the risk of
 accidentally doing a bad or 
unintended push for your users. 
 For example, we now have a new 
page which allows you to review 
the release before you roll it 
out.  This page will  highlight 
and warn or block you depending 
on the issue severity.  As part 
of this process we changed some 
of the previously strict rules 
around how we decide to warn or 
block you.  This especially 
applies to things like upgrades 
and targeting across the Android
 device base.  At the same time,
 we added new rules to give you 
more visibility into various 
other things that could go wrong
 with your release.
   For example, we now warn you 
if you are introducing a new 
permission which will reduce 
your app's update rate, or when 
you are excluding some devices 
which you were previously 
targeting. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  Another 
change is making stage rollout 
front and c enter.  We love 
stage rollout.  It's a great way
 for you to c onfidently release
 updates to users.  You start 
with a seed.  If it performs 
correctly you update until you 
hit 100%.  In the new flow we 
made it front and center.  It's 
easy to set stage rollout.  We 
also show you how many devices 
you will target with each 
percent of the r ollout and one 
feature we got some positive 
developer feedback on is the new
 ability to set custom 
percentages like the 3% you see 
right here. 
   Since launching the new flow,
 we havestein  have seen a 
number we are excited about.  We
 have seen 50% increase in the 
number of developers that are 
using stage rollout.  We love 
seeing this.  Staged rollout is 
a recommended best practice and 
many of our top developers use 
it practically to release each 
one of their app updates.  There
 are other really cool features 
we launched as part of the new 
flow.  For example, you can see 
a log of your release so when 
you push to 5%, 10% or 100%, you
 can see a history of all of 
your historical releases, and 
one feature we think is really 
cool is your ability to download
 historical APK's from the  
console so if you are trying to 
reduce a bug from a previous 
release you go to the Play 
console and download that APK. 
   Moving forward, we are 
getting ready for the world 
beyond the APK.  Starting today,
 and you probably heard the 
announcement earlier in the 
developer keynote, we are 
opening, publishing Android 
instant apps from the Play 
console using a similar flow to 
the flow you are all familiar 
with when updating regular 
installed apps..  So it should 
be easy for you guys to come to 
the Play console and publish 
Android instant apps starting 
today. 
   If you want to hear more 
about that, come to the session 
intro to Android instant Intro 
to Android Instant Apps, 
tomorrow, 1:30 p.m. on stage 2. 
 Now, there are two features 
coming soon and we think you 
will be pretty excited about.  
If you are using or publishing 
APIs to programmatically push 
your app updates, soon we will 
Expose new end point for 
releases allowing you to push 
the change to the Play console, 
but then go to the Play console 
U I, look at the validation 
pages that Milenia mentioned 
before to understand the state 
of your release and only then 
make the publishing action from 
the Play console.  And then also
 with the best tradition of 
Google, launching and iterating,
 once we launch the new flow, we
 heard your feedback loud and 
clear, how we should further 
improve the process around 
release notes or as we call them
 What's new.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know today it's a bit 
of a time sync for you guys, 
therefore, I'm happy to let you 
know that very soon like you see
 here, we will offer you a new 
format allowing you to edit all 
of your release notes offline 
and then with a single copy and 
paste action move them to the 
Play console with a single push 
of a button.  We think it will 
be a big time saver and a real 
feature you would like. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  We have 
had a few developers using the 
flow and sharing experience, for
 example, Free Letics here, 
developer of health and fitness 
apps tell us that the must 
managed releases page gaves them
 a greatly improved status 
review of their releases.  And 
deliveroo is pleased with the 
ease of use and convenient 
overview that they get with 
stabled rollouts.  Now, they can
 see exactly how many installs 
that they are expected to get to
 that staged rollout while 
providing them with a whole news
 and exciting level of Carol.  
Now, -- Carol..  Now you guys 
can role out your app in game 
but you still want to understand
 how your release is actually 
performing. 
   Well, this why we are larking
 another great feature here, the
 release dashboard.  Here, you 
will be able to track your 
release health.  So, for 
example, you can see what your 
crash rate is doing, what's the 
ratings changes look like?  Or 
how is your uninstall rates 
fluctuating?  This is based on 
hourlily aggregated data, so it 
gives you a powerful way to keep
 track of your release as it's 
getting adopted.  You can 
compare the release performance 
to a previous release which we 
think you guys are going to 
really love.  What do you think?
  Does that sounds
 cool?
   (Applause). 
   So hopefully you know that if
 you are running a staged 
rollout you can halt it at any 
time if you are detecting any 
kind of issues.  So, for 
instance, if you are noticing 
your crash rate is going up or 
there is a big spike in 
uninstall rates you can react 
quickly.  If you halt a staged 
rollout and the users that 
didn't get the update, they 
won't get it, so rest assured.  
Then you can focus on 
investigating and fixing those 
bugs before releasing the new 
build.  So if you guys want a 
deeper dive into that awesome 
release dashboard I was 
referencing along with some 
other cool features that we are 
launching to help you improve 
your app health, go check out 
making data on Play work for you
 t omorrow, 1:30 p.m. over at 
stage
 1. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Let's 
move on.  As Android developers,
 your signing key insures 
integrity of your app.  That 
makes it very important.  Lost 
or compromised keys are a very 
serious issue.  I hope that this
 didn't happen to any of you, 
but in fact this is one of the 
most commonly reported issues to
 our operations team.  This is 
why we are very excited to be 
announcing another important 
feature, Google Play App 
Signing.  If you join this 
program, you will let Google 
Play manage your key and sign 
your app before delivering it to
 users. 
   For new apps, we can simply 
generate a key for you.  For 
existing apps, we provide you a 
flow through which you can 
securely hand over the keys to 
us.  After that, you don't have 
to worry about balancing 
security and convenience of 
access by, for example, storing 
your key in a version control 
system.  You can even delete it.
   Apps uploaded to Play will 
still be signed but with a 
separate upload key which we use
 as a secondary authentication. 
 This one can always be replaced
 if 
needed.  Is 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  This guy 
here is super excited about it. 
 I wanted to point that out.  
Thanks for the thumbs up.  We 
have had certain partners using 
Google Play App Signing for a 
while now and they love i t.  
Here Robin hood speaks to the 
layer of safety while at the 
same time it's eliminated the 
worry of having lost or stolen 
keys.  How cool is this?  Pretty
 cool! 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Now that
 Google Play is signing your 
app, you can probably guess what
 comes next.  We can start 
optimizing it on your behalf.  
The first optimization that we 
have started with a few partners
 is resource stripping 
optimizations.  If you opt into 
this, you can give us the 
universal or so-called APK  
based on which we will automate 
generic APKs for stripping 
redundant resources for native 
libraries and screen densities. 
 When delivering your app to a 
phone we will make sure we strip
 out is it the libraries.  Is 
this way the APK is smaller 
taking less bandwidth, less 
space on their disk without 
requiring you guys to use 
multiAPK.  This way we are 
seeing over 20% A PK site 
savings with some of the 
partners so make sure you opt in
 and try  this out when it 
becomes available.
   We are very excited about 
Google Play App Signing and all 
of the app  optimizations we can
 bring on top of it in the 
future.  This frame is optional,
 but we hope you decide to join.
  To learn more about App 
Signing with Google, its 
security benefits and the size 
gains you can get with the 
various optimizations, please 
come to the how to How to Secure
 and optimize your Optimize Your

m., stage 1.  Kg kg when 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  When I joined
 Google my friend who was an 
Android developer asked for one 
thing.  Can we do anything about
 this page you see here.  You 
are probably all familiar with 
this page.  I asked him, why, 
what's wrong with this page?  He
 is like, well, there are t 
housands of devices there. 
   There is very little info on 
each device.  Many devices have 
the same name again and again 
and managing devices in general 
is busy work.  N ow, the Android
 ecosystem has grown so 
significantly because it offers 
different devices with different
 capabilities at various price 
points.  At the same time, it's 
important that users don't get 
an app or a game that their 
device doesn't have the hardware
 to  support.  You know what 
happens.  The user gets annoyed 
because the app doesn't work on 
their device and you get annoyed
 because the user leaves a one 
store review blaming your app 
for something that isn't your 
fault. 
   It's important for us that 
you are able to deliver great 
experience to your users, and to
 be able to do that, we need to 
provide you visibility into the 
device space.  It's especially 
important for game developers 
because we are aware that you 
guys in many cases build your 
games according to a reference 
device spec. 
   Therefore, we are very 
excited to announce that today 
we are launching a new device 
catalog in the Play console.  
Woo hue!
   (Applause).

catalog, you request  can see 
the full hardware spec for 
thousands of devices certified 
by Google for the Google mobile 
suite of apps.  You see here 
what we call the card view, but 
we also provide you with the 
list view allowing you to run 
all kinds of quick operations on
 a set of devices.  Take a 
moment to compare the old UI 
versus the new UI.  Pretty 
awesome, right? 
   So what do you get in this 
new catalog?  First you get a 
full device spec.  You can 
information like Ra,  rf an, 
system on chick I.GPU, CPU, 
screen size and density and the 
supported OS versions for each 
one of the thousands of devices.
  You can search devices by any 
of these attributes, for 
example, you can run the search 
that you see right h ere, what 
we call the filter.  You can 
search for all devices, for 
example, with Android SDK24 plus
 and a specific GPU.  One of the
 features I like best every time
 you search for devices and we 
show you one or many of devices 
we also show your app 
performance on those devices so 
we show you how many installs, 
how much revenue and what's the 
average rating that those 
devices contribute to your app. 
   This is super important when 
you are making decisions like 
prioritizing bug fixes, or 
making device exclusion 
decisions.  When we gave the new
 catalog to Pixel bury studios, 
one of our testing partners, we 
helped them avoid making a big 
mistake on day one.  They were 
about to include a device but 
with the new cat log they 
suddenly found that it has 
meaningful installs, 4.6 rating 
and actually meaningful revenue 
too.  So they avoided excluding 
it and, therefore, avoided 
making a major mistake.  Pixel 
berry studios tells us this too 
many will be a game changer for 
the 
studio. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Another 
cool feature are device catalog 
groups.  It is cool to have a 
multiple devices with different 
chip configurations.  We have 
heard multiple times from 
developers that it's hard to 
figure out what's happening in 
those cases and especially to 
debug performance issues.  So in
 our new catalog, we group all 
of those devices for you while 
allowing you to drill down and 
see each individual device 
separately.  If you want to 
exclude a device, you can either
 exclude a specific skew or the 
entire set of devices for a 
single group. 
   Now, one big addition we are 
introducing our device exclusion
 rules.  This is the ability to 
exclude devices based on 
performance indicators.  For 
example, if you are developing a
 ridge graphics game you may 
struggle to get it to perform 
well on devices with less than 
a512 Meg or one GB of Ra.  In 
which case you may want to 
exclude the entire group of 
devices with less Ram than that 
or if you discover a bug you may
 excludes  devices with a system
 chip.  This enables you to stop
 deployment, and deploy the fix 
to the affected  users as soon 
as it's ready. 
   When you create an exclusion 
rule, similar to what Kobi was 
saying, we show you which 
devices you are about to 
exclude, how much installs you 
are making from the devices and 
how much revenue you are making 
which is pretty important 
information where you are making
 a decision like this.  To save 
more time, we allow you to copy 
a list of excluded devices from 
another one of your apps to make
 it 
quicker. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  We heard from
 a bunch of developers that they
 love this feature. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Really? 
 Cool.  So we know you want to 
exclude as few devices as 
possible.  Android is great 
because it 
has a vast reach and because 
users around the world are using
 a great and diverse device set.
  We do acknowledge that 
sometimes you need to exclude  
devices temporarily or 
permanently and we want to make 
sure you have the right feature 
set allowing you to make such 
important decisions, including 
validations to make sure you 
don't shoot yourself in the foot
 by over excluding.  You can 
see, for example, that EA are 
using new tools to launch more 
confidently and insure players 
get better experiences across al
l of their supported devices. 
   Similarly, SpaceApe games 
shared feedback with us where 
they found a great way of inin
quoarp rating, device targeting 
tools to reduce costs and 
improve KPI. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  I would 
like to build off of what 
Milenia was speaking about.  So 
big phish one of our testing 
partners has been terrific in 
sharing a ton of feedback and 
insight into the tool.  We 
collated their experience into a
 case study we will share with 
you today.  But first I wanted 
to take a little bit of a step 
back and let you know that we 
had some reservations as a 
platform as Google Play that we 
were concerned that developers 
might support less devices as a 
result of this. 
   But big fish illustrates that
 this is in fact going to 
facilitate the opposite.  It's 
going to allow you to support 
more devices.  So as we went 
down that rabbit hole with them 
with their first days of i 
nteracting with the catalog, two
 recurring themes pops up, 
precision and quality.  Let's 
start with precision.  So big 
fish's mantra is to publish 
games to the widest audience 
possible and using restrictions 
as a last resort.  My favorite 
quote is right here which is we 
can now take a scalpel into the 
operating room instead of a 
hatch heet. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  It sounds 
safer to me.. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  What a 
visual.  Developers have been 
going to the far reaches of the 
Internet scattered across to 
leverage several third party 
sources of information about 
Android devices and their specs 
for years.  The big fish team 
really loves the console dated 
Android device models and 
grouping where they can also see
 as Kobi was speaking about, the
 install revenue and ratings 
numbers for each device.  This 
allows you to make more informed
 decisions. 
   So one specific example that 
they gave us was that in the 
past they had this running list 
of low end device exclusions, 
probably sounds familiar, for a 
particular business unit.  They 
were forced to search and check 
against this running list for 
every new title.  And given that
 big fish is an extremely 
prolific game maker, this was a 
huge pain in the butt. 
   So they can now set that one 
time Ram based device exclusion 
rule and import 245 that into 
every new game they launch 
moving forwards.  That means no 
running internal  lists, no 
manual labor.  So this newly 
found precision is leading to 
serious efficiencies for them.  
And we are excited to provide 
you with a lot of oil to grease 
those wheels for your
 team. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  We asked big 
fish how they anticipated the 
new catalog would help them to 
include more devisions, so they 
gave us a real example.  In one 
very tricky device trick they 
had to use the hatchet approach 
that Sarah mentioned before and 
exclude 12% of the devices in 
that group.    With the new 
catalog, they estimate they can 
take down this 12% to 2% which 
means including many more 
devisions. 
   This is a huge win for both 
developers and 
users. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  Let's 
move onto quality now.  Since 
quality is near and dear to our 
hearts here at Google Play, we 
knew that giving you guys a 
significant and centralized 
device catalog would surely lead
 to improved quality.  In 
particular, the catalog can 
empower you, the developer, to 
create a consistent and elevated
 user experience for Google Play
 users across a broad array of 
devices.  The diversity of 
Android devices enables your 
games and apps to reach 
audiences that no other gaming 
platform can do. 
   We know that this also though
 presents some unique challenges
 related to that 
diversity. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Big fish
 said it best, we are able to be
 more proactive in our device 
support of new launches and more
 quickly able to respond to real
 world 
problems. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  The big 
fish cave me this pointed 
feedback of how the device 
catalog is enabling them to 
react and solve device specific 
issues in record time.  It's 
given them more confidence in 
their early game rollout process
 knowing that they can iterate 
quickly against device support 
as well.  So, for example, they 
have a game cooking craze that 
is currently in open beta right 
now..  They decided to launch it
 with actually known performance
 issues because they knew that 
while it was out in the wild, 
they could also look for 
unforeseen issues.  With 
launching earlier and that 
review feedback not counting 
towards their overall ratings I 
spoke of earlier, they could 
pluck out those iffy devices and
 disable support for those 
devices in the meantime. 
   That then allows them to 
iterate regarding device support
 more quickly.  Then they were 
able to insulate their game from
 negative reviews, and that 
would in turn not affect the 
discovery algorithms on Google 
Play.  So, you know, this is a 
really amazing way for them to 
set themselves up for the best 
possible global launch right out
 of the gate.  And we understand
 that you only get one chance at
 launch.  While you guys are 
increasingly focused on creating
 gaming experience with lasting 
power beyond, we understand that
 that launch window is still 
really crucial.  It's the 
foundation that sets your game 
up for success. 
   Since the early Saturdays of 
the device cat -- days of the 
device catalog we are excited to
 hear of other ways this service
 will positively impact your 
apps and games.  As we roll out 
more prodly, please share your 
stories with us.  We would love 
to understand how the device 
catalog is contributing to the 
success of your game and your 
business
 overall. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  It's great to
 see how open beta where we open
 the talked with connects to the
 device catalog.  Today we have 
seen, we have shown you a bunch 
of new launches, new tools for 
launching in the Play console.  
And we also showed you how 
developers use them to find 
success on Google Play.  We 
showed you the news release flow
 giving you for confidence and 
clarity as you make app updates.
  We showed the validation step 
which makes sure you avoid 
making major mistakes before you
 release app updates to users.  
We showed you how we made staged
 rollout front and center 
allowing you to see the number 
of targeted devices and set 
custom percentages. 
   We showed you how you can 
save your release as a draft and
 come back later to launch when 
ready.  We also showed you the 
new release dashboard allowing 
you to keep track of your 
release performance in real time
 making sure you react to issues
 as they show up.  And then we 
have also mentioned that 
starting today, you can publish 
your Android instant apps 
directly from the play 
console. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  We 
continue by talking about a new 
program where dwoog the play can
 take the burden of signing your
 app from you.  We talked about 
the security benefits and size 
gains you can get with app 
optimizations.  Last but not 
least, we talked about the new 
device catalog.  We showed you 
the device spec, how we group 
devices how we can efficiently 
search and filter the cat loge 
and how you can see the data 
about performance of your app on
 a resulting set.  We also 
talked about the new rules 
allowing you to filter your app 
on the store based on the 
performance indicators. 
   Here are some helpful links 
if you want to explore any of 
the things we talked about in 
more 
detail.  We are sure you will 
like the new f eatures and they 
will help you release with more 
confidence, better understand 
the Android device base and 
focus on doing what you guys do 
best, build amazing apps and 
games and deliver great 
experiences to millions of 
Android users all around the 
world.  Thank you. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  Thanks, 
everybody.
   (Applause).

   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  Does anybody 
have questions.  We will take a 
couple of questions. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  There are
 microphones if anyone has a 
question for 
us. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  Great 
question.  Not yet, but this 
area which we call go to market 
will be one of key areas that we
 will work on in the next year 
including stuff like rethinking 
how we do geo targeting across 
what we call different tracks, 
so stay stay tuned.
     Anymore questions, guys?  
Oh, cool! 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  Speaking off 
microphone)
. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  That's a good
 question.  We are making like, 
we are thinking a lot about 
narrowing down the device space 
at different stages of the 
rollout.  I would say for now we
 don't have a concrete answer 
here.  We can't commit that we 
will build this support, but now
 that we launched a new catalog,
 we are looking forward to get 
developer feedback on how you 
guys use the catalog and how you
 guys stack rank the most 
painful areas now that you have 
the data at your fingertips so 
feel free to share this feedback
 with us further.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
microphone)
. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  You mean the 
permissions in the play console?
  Okay.  Okay.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off  
microphone)
. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  For 
permissions in particular we 
made recent changes so I'm not 
sure when you checked this out 
the last.  We are also looking 
into this area very closely, so 
hopefully some of this will be 
coming soon. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  Right 
here.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
microphone)
. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  Are you 
staying here for the next talk? 
 I see some guys in the audience
 I can connect you to.  Just 
sitting like largely just behind
 you, so I'm just hinting.  So I
 will connect you with them. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Short 
answer is, yes, we want 
everything to be real time, and 
I think now they will kill me 
now that I said this, but they 
are behind you so they can give 
you a better 
answer. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  Over 
here.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
microphone)
. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  This is a 
good question, one thing we are 
a bit concerned about at least 
for now, you probably know 
multiAPK and you know how 
complex this multidimension 
could get if you start charting 
by screen density and ABI, et 
cetera, you can end up with a 
lot of APK's
 so we are a bit concerned about
 adding another dimension called
 country on top of that, but at 
the same time, we do a lot of 
thinking in how we enable you to
 provide different experiences 
to different users in
 different geos.  If you heard 
the keynote this morning, 
Android Go is a program that is 
targeting the next billion 
users, and Play will urn  unveil
 a bunch of functionalities like
 represent the way we recommend 
you guys to think about the 
problem space and how to build 
different experiences for 
different geographies.  So stay 
tuned.  This will come in the 
next few months.
next few months. 
   Lrve. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Key will
 be per app per developer, 
correct.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
microphone). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  
Currently it's a Play Console 
feature.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
microphone)
.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  I don't think
 we are currently allow 
targeting by l ocal, so not that
 I'm aware of. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Yes. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  This is 
similar to what I said about 
like countries, right.  The 
multimulti-APK space is very 
complex and adding another level
 of complexity, we are a bit 
concerned that we will kind of 
make things too complex.  We are
 working on a bunch of early 
ideas in how we simplify this 
area in general, and when those 
ideas come to life, we could 
probably introduce like another 
level of targeting once we strip
 the current complexity from the
system. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  This is 
very interesting.  If you don't 
mind s taying a little bit, I 
would like to ask you about the 
use case a little bit more to 
make sure I understand. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  We will take 
one last question because we are
 running out of time.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
microphone)
. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  When you say 
all of this --
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
microphone). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KOBI GLICK:  You mean the 
devices information?  We don't 
have an API yet.  We are 
considering our options around 
exporting this data, so we might
 be able to export this data.  
I'm not sure at least in the, in
 the near future, I'm not sure 
that we will expose an API for 
managing those things from an 
API, rather just dropping an 
export of the device catalog to 
you guys.  Cool. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MILENIA NIKOLIC:  Thank 
you very much. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH THOMPSON:  Thanks 
for coming, enjoy the rest of I/
O.

   NEW RELEASE &amp;amp; DEVICE 
TARGETING TOOLS OR: HOW I 
LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING &amp;amp; LOVE 
ANDROID DIVERSITY! 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt;






everyone!  Welcome to our talk 
on the fact that no one likes 
crashing or janky apps I'm 
Lydia, a technical program 
manager on Android.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  
Engineering Manager on Google 
Play. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Product 
manager for an droi vitals.  
Hands up who likes one star 
ratings?  We have one person in 
the wrong talk.  I'm sorry, but 
the people who don't like one 
star ratings are in the right 
place.  So we are here to tell 
you how you can Engineer your 
app for high performance with 
the new tools available on 
Android and other than Google 
Play.
   We are going to start off 
talking about why performance 
matters in general and then we 
will jump into the news 
initiative we have around 
Android vitals and how we have  
simplified it for you to take 
action easier by using concept 
of bad behaviors.  Then we will 
jump into how you can detect and
 fix issues most effectively to 
be able to have success.  Great.
  So for the people who want to 
avoid those one star ratings, 
the number one way you can do 
that is by focusing on stability
 of your applications.  We put 
Google's Machine Learning to 
work to be able to figure out 
what are people talking about in
 one star ratings.  50% of one 
star ratings are talking about 
stability and bugs. 
   Then once you fix those 
issues, how request  can you get
 to a five star app.  If you 
want to get to a five star app 
focusing on design, usability 
and speed because 60% of reviews
 are talking about those topics.
  Don't just take our word for 
it, or more likely Google 
Machine Learning's word for it, 
you can take developer's words. 
 The Busuu team found that 
focusing on performance and 
making that a part of their 
culture, they were able to 
increase their star rating as a
 result.  The Big Fish Games 
team have even seen increases in
 retention by focusing on 
performance.  At Google and 
specifically within Android, we 
are obsessed with our 
performance and device 
performance.  We have been 
obsessing over this for a number
 of years now. 
   Back in 2012 we launched 
project butter with jelly bean. 
 Since then, we have launched 
the dose mode, project vocal can
 and this year a bunch of new 
tools in Android O and the 
ability for you to get insights 
with Android vitals. 
   So what is an void vitals?  
You might have seen in in the 
keynote earlier today.  This is 
the new
  new initiative for you to gain
 new insights across Core 
performance metrics.  The three 
we are starting with are 
stability, battery, and render 
times.  You will see many more 
come over the course of the next
 few months and we will be able 
to give you those insights on 
Android and on the Play Console.

we are launching today.  First 
one is stability.  So everyone 
knows that you shouldn't have 
your app crash.  People have 
been focusing on this a number 
of years
 and crash has induced the 
experience of crash free user.  
Now you can see your crash free 
user rate and your crash rate.  
You can also see your ANR rate. 
 This is where your ANR is a 
concept on Android which is an 
application not responding.  
That's when your app appears  
frozen and does not respond for 
five seconds.

this is where we want you to 
avoid using people's devices and
 consuming their battery 
inefficiently.  This is where we
 want to avoid using the radios,
 or using the CPU when you 
shouldn't be and you don't need
 to.  The next area is 
rendering.  So this is where we 
want to be able to help you 
understand how you can provide 
silky smooth experience to your 
users so they feel like your app
 is smooth and fluid on their 
device.  We swr two metrics we 
will introduce you today to help
 you deeply understand that 
area. 
   So we are talking about three
 major performance areas here.  
And within each performance area
 we are going to be introducing 
two metrics.  It's a lot of data
 to be able to understand and 
consume.  So we have simplified 
it to this concept of bad we 
have yores.  We take your app, 
study performance data and 
figure out if you are in the 
bottom 25% of apps   according 
to that metric we flag it to you
 and we say hey you need to 
improve in this area.  Let's do 
a show of hands.  Let's say 5% 
of users are experiencing that 
50% of their frames are taking 
more than 16 frames, 16 
milliseconds to render on the 
screen.  Is that a problem?  
Hands up if you think it's a 
problem. 
   Okay.  Great.  So lots of 
people agree that's a problem, 
and lots of people don't agree 
that that's a problem.  Well, we
 will actually tell you in the 
Console when you have reached 
the boundary of when that's a 
problem and you are in the 
bottom 25%.  Right now that's at
 about 2% of users experiencing 
that rate will actually be 
flagged and that is putting you 
in the bottom 25% so we are 
trying to simplify is for you so
 you can be able to understand 
where you are positioned 
according to the benchmark. 
   So where do you see this 
data?  You see the data in a new
 top level navigation item in 
the Console called aandroid 
vitals.  It's live to all of you
 and if you have an update you 
will see the insights I will 
tell you about and Ricardo will 
tell you about now. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  So as 
Fergus said we just launched a 
new section called Android 
vitals, and it is available to 
all of you today and you can 
check it out now.  What is it 
does, it summarizes all of the 
findings that we have about your
 app performance across three 
domains that fearing Gus 
mentioned, stability, battery, 
and rendering.  It works out of 
the box without any integration 
needed.  No SDKs to add, nothing
 to add to your multi-APK size. 
 The data that you find there is
 collected from millions of 
users that have opted in to 
share diagnostic information 
with Google to help all of you 
understand and improve quality 
of apps. 
   Android vitals also 
highlights whenever at any given
 time there is a problem that 
affects a significant fraction 
of you're
 users.  You can see the related
 marks to indicate you should be
 looking at rendering and fsh if
 there is an issue there.  You 
can use this as the first port 
of call to understand your 
performance.  We will spend time
 to go into detail on stability,
 battery and rendering.  
Stability is about crashes and 
ANR reports, applications not  
responding. 
   Until today, the only way for
 an ANR or a crash to surface in
 the Play Console is was if your
 users explicitly acknowledge a 
dialogue an the phone for each 
ANR crash to be reported.  And 
this is obviously tedious and it
 leads to a low volume of crash 
and ANR reports. 
   The first thing we have done 
is we have greatly reduced user 
friction.  As I mentioned, the 
data that you find there comes 
from user that's have opted in 
to share diagnostic information.
  Opt in typically h appens only
 one when I person activates a 
new phone, and that is a very 
low friction. 
   So this means that in the 
Play Console, now you see over 
100 fold coverage in the number 
of reports with reports coming 
from users running versions of 
an destroyed as old as jelly 
bean.  And this reaches 98% of 
the devices that Play service is
 installed.  Let's start with 
the first domain, stability.  
What are the bad behaviors we 
want to flag out there?  
Crashes, and application not 
responding which is application 
freezes. 
   For sure you never really 
want any user of your app to 
experience one of them, and so 
we define these bad  behaviors 
in terms of percentage of users 
that are experiencing any of 
them in any given day.  You may 
be familiar with the equivalent 
metric that other crash 
reporting tools have introduces,
 crash for users and so for the 
next minutes I will focus on
 ANR specifically.  What is ANR.
  ANR means application not 
responding and this happens when
 your application freezes and 
stops responding to user input. 
 This could be because you have 
a deadlock in your code, because
 you have a UI thread which is 
low or you have background 
receivers that do not complete 
within a meaningful amount of 
time. 
   ANRs are super disruptive of 
the user experience and you 
should aim to never have any of 
them.  Because the application 
is frozen during an ANR it means
 you cannot typically use a 
crash reporting SDK to collect 
them.  On the other side, the 
Android platform tracks all of 
them automatically so they are 
all available in the Play 
Console without you having to do
 anything at 
all.  You just go to the Android
 vital section and in is there 
you will find a tab called ANR 
rate.  There you can see how 
many unique users experience an 
application not responding when 
the app was used on a given day 
across sub versions, device.  If
 the fraction is significant you
 get a red highlight to draw 
your attention to you can focus 
on the most prominent issues and
 dive into the d etails.  You 
can click there.  Related ANR 
section, and in there, you 
arrive in the ANR in crisis 
section of the Play Console. 
   Here in addition to reviewing
 your overall crash rate and ANR
 rate, you can dive into each 
crash and ANR that has been 
detected for your
 application.  Android collects 
ANRs and crashes almost 
immediately as they occur.  So 
here you find crashes and ANRs 
that are typically a few minutes
 old at most.  There are a bunch
 of features.  We highlight when
 a given ANR has been introduced
 for the first time in your most
 recent app version with those 
little orange highlights. 
   You can track the quality of 
your last release.  You also get
 to see the number of unique 
users that have been affected by
 that particular ANR so you can 
distinguish between high volume 
issues affecting only a handful 
of users versus ones that are 
affecting a significant fraction
 of your user base.  You can 
dive into the details and 
observe how the number of 
reports and the numbers of 
affected users trends over time,
 and how it breaks down across 
device versions, OS version, app
 version.. 
   And obviously you get the 
full thread dump that captures 
the application state at the 
time the ANR occurred and for 
crashes, obviously you get 
similar functionality where you 
get the rate that was observed 
when the crash occurred.  So I 
think this gives you information
 visibility into what is 
happening on your you'rer's 
phone.  The next step is to try 
to reproduce and debug them. 
   What I recommend is the new 
Android studio 3.2.  It has 
plenty of new profiling 
capabilities.  The Android 
profilers in
 studio 3.2 present real time 
data.  And I think this is a 
great next step to debug your 
ANRs because root causing them 
often lies in not taking into 
proper consideration CPU 
intensive operation or blocking 
operations like fetching data 
from the network. 
   The CPU profiler, for 
example, gives you real time CPU
 usage for your app process on a
 timeline.  You can dive through
 instrumented meta traces and 
understand which methods in your
 UI threads are using up most of
 the time and become blocking.  
Similarly, the network profiler 
displays net work activities on 
a timeline showing that it was 
sent, received and associated  
latencies. 
   You can use this to 
understand if a slow network 
goal is making thread blocks for
 a response or because of an ANR
 this way.  And showed in the 
keynote before, it's very easy 
to jump into the code that is 
responsible for the network 
code.  If you want to learn more
 about the profilers there is a 
great talk norm morning in 
amphitheater that I encourage 
you to attend. 
   Now, we discussed how to 
review how many ANRs you have, 
how to debug them, but the thing
 is how do you prevent them from
 happening in the first place?  
Textbook recommendation, do not 
do blocking operations in the UI
 thread and use, for example, a 
sync task instead.  You can use 
strict mode to catch accidental 
disk or network access on the 
application main thread as well 
glvment another common case is 
when you have a broadcast 
receiver that receives and does 
not finish processing within a 
window of time offer your 
broadcast receiver goes into 
sync but you forget to finish on
 the pending result you get 
back.  Android 101, very simple 
examples.  Most likely your code
 is much more complicated than 
this.  You may be using cues, 
asynchronous separation, 
libraries like RX Java. 
   The basics do not change.  
The same recommendations apply. 
 Be mindful of which threads, on
 which  threads the call back 
for your asynchronous process 
end up executing on, use 
semantics in coding processes to
 make sure that you don't end up
 executing accidentally on UI 
threads when you don't want, and
 so on. 
   Finally, be mindful of 
introducing deadlocks in your 
app.  The traces that you are 
collecting when the device is 
connected to your PC when 
debugging or by downloading the 
tracing you can easily spot if 
you have deadlocks by looking 
when a given thread lick the UI 
thread is locked waiting for 
background one and vice versa. 
   So this is all I have to 
cover about ANR.  The  
fundamental question remains, 
how much do they matter?  How 
much should you care?  The 
answer is you should really cash
 a lot.  We look at apps that 
have high and low crash rates in
 place.  High crash rate, more 
than 5% of users experiencing a 
crash or an NRPD.  What we find 
is that these apps have 30% more
 uninstallation in the first day
 than apps that have a low crash
 rate, less than 1%.  The 
message is simple, if user finds
 your app and they experience a 
crash, most likely they will 
leave as soon as they find it.  
I will now hand over to Lydia 
for battery and rendering. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYDIA FITZPATRICK:  Thanks
 Ricardo.  Android users care a 
lot about battery life.  In fact
 making it through the day 
without needing to charge their 
device is a top concern for 
Android use  users.  One of the 
number one ways we can conserve 
power and battery power is by 
putting the device into deep 
sleep when it's idle.  This 
means powering down the CPU, 
radio and other component that's
 would otherwise drain power. 
   However, you as application 
developers can prevent the 
device from going into a deep 
sleep and  conserving power.  
One of the ways you can do this 
is through wake locks.  Wake 
locks keep the device awake so 
that it can perform an activity 
on behalf of your application.  
There is a couple of different 
wake locks.  The first is a full
 wake lock.  This keeps the 
screen on and this is usually 
used by a video app or a gaming 
app. 
   Because the screen is on, the
 user is going to be aware that 
the wake lock is being held and 
in full control of powering down
 the app and saving their 
battry.  There is another kind 
of wake lock.  This is called a 
partial wake lock.  Partial wake
 lock doesn't keep the screen 
on.  Because of this, the user 
doesn't know that the wake lock 
is being held and so if a wake 
lock, a partial wake lock is 
held for too long it can become 
a silent and deadly killer of 
battery power.  Because of this 
we defined a bad behavior are 
stuck partial wake lock.  We 
defined a stuck partial wake 
lock is one held over a an hour 
by a significant percentage of 
your users. 
   The Android vitals dashboard 
will show you how you are using 
and possibly abusing wake locks.
  It will show you the 
distribution of how how long 
wake 
locks are being held by each 
version of your app.  In this 
example, you can see the 
majority of wake locks are being
 held for a might be it or less 
which is ideal from a power 
saving perspective.  However, 
there is a long tail of wake 
lochs being held over an hour 
which meet the definition of bad
 behavior or stuck wake locks so
 you can see we flagged this app
 for the bad behavior in the 
Android vitals dashboard.
   In the Android vitals 
dashboard, we will give you the 
information you need to debug 
your stuck wake lock.  Most 
importantly the name of the wake
 lock.  In order to prevent, to 
protect user privacy, we will 
only shows wake lock names if 
it's been used across many 
sessions.  This will prevent the
 leaking of any personally 
identifiable information.  
Because of this, I encourage you
 to use standard wake lock names
 for each distinct wake lock in 
your application in order for 
them to be debuggable in case 
they become stuck wake locks. 
   The reason that we are 
highlighting stuck wake locks in
 the vitals dashboard is because
 of just how dangerous they are.
  I mentioned in Android we care
 a lot about conserving power.  
So every day we collect reports 
from internal Google users who 
have experienced a bad battery 
day.  A bad battery day is one 
where your device, the battery 
doesn't last as long as it 
usually does or as long as you 
expect it to.  They will send us
 these reports. 
   We did analysis across a two 
month period of all reports last
 summer and we found that 30% of
 these bad battery days were 
caused by stuck wake locks.  I 
think this highlights how 
dangerous wake locks are.  They 
cause real problems for real 
users.  Because of this, I 
encourage you to avoid using 
wake locks
 entirely.  Wake locks were 
introduced in the early days of 
the Android platform and since 
then many of the use cases for 
which you needed a wake lock you
 no longer need a wake lock for.
   For example, if you are doing
 a long running download, you 
can use the download manager  
instead.  If you are 
synchronizing data with an 
external server, use the sync 
adapter instead.  If you need to
 run a background task, use the 
JobDispatcher and if you are 
holding a wake lock so you can 
process an intent before the 
device goes to sleep, use the 
job intent services which is 
being released in the support 
lib B26 coming out later this 
quarter.  Both JobDispatcher and
 the job intent service are 
compatible with the background 
restrictions we are going to be 
rolling out in O.  So it's a 
win/win.  You get a background 
restrictions compatible service,
 and you don't get any stuck 
wake l ocks. 
   So definitely check out job 
intents services in support lib 
B26.  If you are unable to use 
any of these alternatives and 
you need to use a wake lock in 
your application, I will rehash 
some of the fundamentals from 
CS101 because they are so 
dangerous, I will spend time 
rehashing.  First, keep the 
logic around your wake lock 
extremely simple because any 
errors in the logic could lead 
to them getting stuck.  Second, 
try to do as little as possible 
while holding the wake lock so 
it doesn't need to run for an 
hour or more to do whatever 
operation you are h olding it 
for.  And finally, use defensive
 air handling.  You can see in 
this example here, if I hadn't 
defended against my clean up 
task throwing an exception, the 
release method on my wake lock 
would never have gotten called 
and some poor user or perhaps 
millions of users would end up 
with dead phone batteries. 
   So if you follow all of my 
advice and are able to not use 
any wake l ocks in your 
application, I still want you to
 go check out the Android viet 
will  vitals dashboard for stuck
 wake locks because it's 
possible services you depend on 
are using wake locks under the 
cover.
   For example, the network 
location provider wake lock in 
this case that's used by 
millions f L of apps to find a 
user location.  If you are using
 it too aggressively, it could 
hold wake locks for an extended 
period of time that become stuck
 and you get flagged for that.  
So in this case, you would fix 
that stuck wake lock by 
throttling back the number of 
calls you make to the service.  
So check out the tab even if you
 are not using wake locks so you
 can tune how you use the 
services under the covers that 
might be using wake locks.  The 
second way you as an application
 developer can prevent the phone
 from going into deep sleep and 
saving power for users it 
through the use of wake ups.  
Wake ups are alarms that you can
 fire outside of the lifetime of
 your application to wake the 
device up to do some sort of 
task  on bemax of your 
application. 
   If you do this excessively, 
the device won't be able to rest
 and you will end up draining 
power.  We have identified a bad
 behavior of excessive wakeups. 
 We define if as percentage of 
users impacted by wakeups that 
occur more than ten times per 
hour.  Just like wake locks, you
 can get a full report on the 
wake ups that you are using or 
possibly abusing in the vitals 
dashboard.  And just like wake 
locks, you will see the 
distribution of the number of 
wakeups across sessions and you 
will be able to see the names of
 each wake up so you can debug 
any frequent wake up issues and 
just like wake locates will only
 show the wake up name if it's 
seen across a lot of sessions so
 we don't leak any personal 
identifying information.  So, 
again, be sure to use a standard
 name for all wake ups.

pattern of firing a wake up to 
get the descries awake and 
holding a wake lock to keep the 
device awake to you can perform 
some sort of task.  This is a 
double whammy of possible bad 
behavior because you might be 
waking the device too frequently
 and the wake lock might get 
stuck.  Let's get rid of both.  
A much better alternative is the
 Firebase JobDispatcher.  The 
Android platform itself does 
have a job scheduler but I 
encourage you to use the 
Firebase JobDispatcher because 
of its backward compatibility. 
   In the Firebase  
JobDispatcher you can set up a 
task to lune as a repeating 
task.  I can run this every 30 
minutes dialing back the 
frequency you are running the 
task is the first step to say 
power so 30 minutes is better 
than running it every five 
minutes.  However, you can corn 
strain the job to run only when 
on a charger, this is ultimately
 battery safer because it will 
never ruin while usedders is on 
battery. 
   Here at Google a lot of apps 
employ this method.  Play store 
will wait to auto update apps 
until you are on a charger.  We 
understand a user would rather 
have a device that lasts through
 the device than a latest update
 of some apps so I encourage you
 to use the same critical lens 
when you are considering 
scheduling jobs.  See if it can 
wait until the device is on a 
charger.

will talk about today is render 
times.  Render times  measures 
the amount of time a frame drawn
 by your application takes to 
get renlderred on the screen 
hardware.  Render time directly 
correlates with how users 
perceive the performance of your

app.  Android devices render at 
60 frames per second.  This is 
based on the refresh rate that's
 available in the screen 
hardware i tself. 
   If you do the Math, 60 frames
 per sect breaks down to having 
to render a frame every 16 
milliseconds.  As long as your 
app is rendering every 16 
milliseconds, users will feel 
that your app is very smooth, 
fluid and pleasant to browse.  
If your frames take longer than 
16 milliseconds, even just 17 
milliseconds, it will get 
dropped.  If you have a lot of 
dropped frames, your application
 will feel very stuttery, very 
jarring to users so you want to 
minimize the number of dropped 
frames that your application 
has.

row, and you get to the point 
that it's been 700 milliseconds 
before you draw the next frame 
in your application, this is the
 point at which users will think
 your app is unresponsive and 
they will begin to feel 
frustrated by it.  You should 
aim to have zero frames that 
take 700 milliseconds or more to
 render. 
   We have used both of these 
thresholds to identify bad 
behavior.  The first is slow 
rendering.  We define this bad 
behavior as the percentage of 
users who experience more than 
50% dropped frames.  The second 
bad rendering behavior are 
frozen frames.  We define this 
as the percentage of users who 
experience more than .1% of 
their frames being
 frozen.  The Android vitals 
dashboard reports on both of 
these  metrics and will flag you
 if you are excessively slow in 
rendering or too many frozen 
frames. 
   Just like wake locks and 
wakeups you can see the 
distribution of r endering times
 across
 sessions and the dashboard will
 also give you some other 
statistics to help you 
understand what might be causing
 your rendering issues.  For 
example, I can see a high 
percentage of slow UI thread act
  activity.  This indicates to 
me that I'm probably trying to 
do too much work on the UI 
thread so I should move things 
like disk I/O or network 
activity to background thread. 
   These statistics though are 
pretty high level and they will 
just hint at the root cause of 
your rendering issues.  To 
really understand what is 
causing the rendering issues you
 will need to dive deeper.  You 
can do this in three steps.  The
 first step is to instrument 
your app with the frame metrics 
aggregator API.  This API is 
built on the frame metrics API 
released in an droi  Android 
knew  newinget.  The 23R5EU78 
mets tricks ago gator API 
aggregates these statistics 
across a series of activities 
that you define and you define 
the start and the end point of 
that collection.  So you can 
collect  statistics about how 
long specific work flows in your
 application take to render. 
   Once you have done this step,
 step two is to  get the data 
off the device and upload to the
 Cloud off your servers where 
you will then analyze it.  You 
will analyze to find what flows 
are rendering slowly for the  
majority of your users.  From is
 there you can move onto step 3 
which is getting your device 
out, walking through the flows, 
all the meanwhile recording a 
trace.  Once you have reproduced
 that slow r endering behavior 
or those frozen frames, you can 
upload that trace into sis rase 
T trace which will tell you 
exactly what was going on in 
your application when the slow 
rendering occurred and not just 
your application but what was 
going on in the system as well 
glvment from there you can 
figure out what specific code 
passes you need to optimize 
rendering performance.  I have 
just skimmed the surface of the 
frame metrics ago gator API  as 
well as sis trace.  Luckily you 
have two more opportunities this
 evening, Tim Murray, an expert 
on Sys trace will give a talk on
 how you can use it to debug 
rendering issues.  Fipple as 
hand lied over a  thousand Sys 
traces and is an expert in the 
field. 
   On Friday you can learn from 
Chris and Chet about how you can
 use it to understand your 
application performance.  And 
with that, I will give it back 
to Fergus to close. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Thanks so 
much.  Thanks Lydia.  Great.  So
 today we introduced three 
performance areas.  We have many
 other performance areas we will
 be introducing over the course 
of the next couple of months, 
app start up time, memory and 
network use.  For each one of 
these performance areas we are 
going to introduce bad behaviors
 so ease easy to understand that
 metric and how you are doing in
 the  metric compared to other 
apps. 
   A lot of the tools we talked 
about especially on the Play 
developer Console sides for the 
Android vitals dashboard ago 
gate over your whole APK.  If 
you want to understand within 
your APK specific performance 
areas I would encourage you to 
use the Firebase performance 
more than forking tool.  It was 
launched earlier today at the 
developer keynote and able to 
instrument app out of the box 
comes network and start up time 
but you will also be ail to use 
counters to be able to track 
whatever you would like to track
 in your application. 
   There is a talk on this 
that's going to happen tomorrow 
and I would encourage you to 
attend that to learn more about 
how you can be able to use the 
Firebase pore performance 
monitoring  SDK in your 
application to be able to 
improve performance. 
   We covered why performance 
matters, we  covered Android 
vitals and the issues and 
concepts around bad behaviors.  
Again those bad behave yarrs are
 high ANR rate, high crash rate,
 excessive wakeups, stuck wake l
 ocks, slow rendering and frozen
 frames.  We introduced the 
Android vitals dashboard in the 
Play Console, we talked about 
the Android 3.0 profilers, and 
the Android APIs are available 
for you. 
   So if you are not motivated 
bay all of the things we talked 
about around performance today I
 encourage you to come to our 
talk tomorrow where we can give 
you a &quot;Buzz&quot; feed like talk on 
why you should care more about 
performance with the Play 
Console tools we have available.
  One of the things we will talk
 about in this talk is the 
rewards the play Store is going 
to offer you for being able to 
improve the performance of your 
application.  We will get more 
into the detail there's but we 
will start using this 
performance data in the p 
romotability within the store. 
   Another reason I should care 
about performance is we have 2 
billion users on Android.  It's 
a lot of users.  If you improve 
the battery life of your device 
and of the device itself by 
improving the battery life of 
your app, then the user device 
will be able to last longer.  
They will be able to make mor 
emergency calls and you are 
basically saving people's lives 
by focusing on performance.  
Maybe stretching a little there,
 but hopefully you get it.  
Thank you very much, everyone, I
 appreciate you joining 
today ... we will open it up for
 Q and A.  There are mics at the
 top of the rows and we will be 
in the Sandbox just outside of 
here afterward to answer 
questions people have.
     Yes, definitely there is no
 API available now, the way to 
access is through the Play 
Console but over time there is 
an API for that data and under 
will be an API available for 
this data as 
well.  We can't make promises on
 that right now.  We can just 
talk about what we have today, 
but we will be offeringna in the
 next couple of months.  
Yes.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  If you are
 using some of the Firebased 
tools and using the SDK, you 
have to be careful how you 
instrument it to make sure you 
don't have performance 
implications on the app.  The 
data we are collecting is for 
all users who have opted in and 
it's on the platform level.  It 
does not impact your application

itself.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
mic). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Broken 
down by APK version, broken down
 by dwe vis and Android 
ndroid
 OS.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
mic)
. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  At the 
moment we are starting with the 
six bad behaviors.  The intent 
is so to expand it on other 
performance aspects so size and 
device is wrub is that is 
crucial for the user experience 
of how users can use their 
device effectively, not there 
today, but we are definitely 
expanding to have a lot more of 
these topics about battery, 
stability, rendering and size 
and network over the rest of the
 year.  So keep checking and it 
will show up at one point. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Stay tuned
 for the Android vitals 
dashboard and we will be  
putting notifications in the 
Console to let you know when we 
add more
 metrics.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking off 
mic)) 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  So on disk
 storage, RAM usage, process 
stats, we are looking into other
 performance areas.  Yes, cool. 
 Next

question.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking Off 
Microphone). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  I don't 
quite get the question. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Are you 
talking about taking the ANRs 
from the Play Console and adding
 annotations in the play console
 so you can pull it into your 
own tracking system?
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking Off 
Microphone). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  A few 
things on that, as Ricardo 
mentioned earlier we do flag 
when it is a newly introduced 
ANR in this specific app version
 and we are working on more 
tools around you being able to 
manage the ANRs and crashes and 
with your work flow better as 
well.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  You are 
already mute them out for the 
ones you have fixed and then we 
will automatically reopen in the
 Play Console if they start 
recurring on a new version.  
What you want is basically an A 
PI to do that on your own 
premises which is not there yet 
but we are definitely looking 
into that.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  
(Speaking Off 
Microphone). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYDIA FITZPATRICK:  That 
is a great question.  I think 
one way to control for it would 
be to do the sys trace and run 
traces on lower end devices so 
you can see what is going on on 
the lower end devices.  That's 
my first answer to it.  We do 
have an expert from the Android 
platform here.  We have Diane, 
one of the  original authors of 
Android.  Maybe you could come 
up and we could chat more about 
this with
 Diane. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  We have 
time for one more question.  
There is a ton of you that have 
questions to we will be outside 
in the Android dome if you want.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking Off

Microphone). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  We 
collect across all versions, 
what I mentioned is we will 
highlight the one that pertains 
to the latest version because 
normally that's the one that you
 want to focus on, but you will 
see reports across all versions 
of your app that you have out 
there. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  The ANR 
and crashes section where you 
can see the clusters covers back
 as Ricardo mentioned earlier, 
98% of Android versions.  The 
ANR rate is based on ones where 
newer versions, but you can 
actually see that in the Android
 vitals section which devices 
and OSs are covered by that one 
as well.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking Off

Microphone).
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  At the 
moment we surface ANR as long as
 the user used the app in the 
program at some point because 
the intent again is to focus on 
the user to experience the 
program when using the app.  But
 in the ANR section, in the 
crash and ANR part you will see 
background and foreground. 
   Lrve. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYDIA FITZPATRICK:  The 
jobs intense service ask 
backwards 
compatible.  That's right. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Last 
question.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AUDIENCE:  (Speaking Off 
Microphone). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Yes. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FERGUS HURLEY:  Great 
question, so definitely we are 
working with the fabric team and
 the Firebase team to have a 
wholistic solution.  We don't 
have anything to announce today 
but we will be announcing what 
is the wholistic solution over 
the next couple of months.  
Final question.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYDIA FITZPATRICK:  We are
 out of time.  Why don't we take
 your question down here. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RICCARDO GOUONI:  Thank 
you,  everybody.
   (Applause).

   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RUSS KETCHUM:  Hi, 
everyone, I'm Russ Ketchum I'm a
 group product manager aand I 
leave mobile app Analytics.  I 
can hardly believe it's already 
been a year since we stove on a 
stage not too far from here and 
interest Tuesdayed Firebase 
Google's integrated app 
developer platform.  With it we 
launched Firebase Analytics our 
first apps first Analytics 
platform we built from the 
ground up to be completely free 
and completely unlimited.  Since
 last year, Analytics remains a 
key investment area not just for
 Firebase but for Google as a 
whole.  And at Google we take a 
unified approach to our 
measurement solutions and so to 
under score that for all of our 
users, we wanted to formally 
introduce you all to our new 
name, and that's Google 
Analytics for Firebase. 
   So Google the Analytics is 
the most used digital Analytics 
solution in the world.  And we 
think with our new name we will 
make it clear to all of our 
customers, Web, app, and 
otherwise that we are building 
towards a unified solution.  And
 now while our name is it 
changing our commitment to app 
developers and app Analytics 
remains unchanged.  And we fully
 appreciate that the challenges 
that the developer community 
faces, they are daunting.  And 
there are many ways are very 
unique.  Let's take a look at 
some of them. 
   So building a successful app 
and with it a successful 
business is really hard.  
Finding a way to make that 
process repeatable is even 
harder.  It's really, really 
hard, but as Google, we believe 
that good data is often the key 
to unlocking that type of 
success.  But for developers, 
you also know that even having 
access to good quality data is 
in itself really hard.  So the 
amount of time that people spend
 on mobile  devices, I don't 
need to tell you this, is 
staggering and of the time spent
 on mobile over 85% is spent 
engaging with apps and that u 
sage in turn throws off just a 
ton of data. 
   And very few tools are 
available to actually help 
developers capture that, 
particularly tools that are 
within reach of developing b 
usinesses.  But in you could 
assume for a -- if you could 
assume for a second that you had
 a tool that would help you 
collect that data, you then have
 to be able to find trends that 
are responsible for your 
successes and failtz yours.  
Even if you are able to spot 
those trends not not good enough
 to have simple understanding in
 a vacuum.  You need to use the 
data in the  places you care 
about and take action and drive 
your business forward.  These 
are the type of challenges we 
are building Google Analytics 
for Firebase to help you solve. 
   So today we are going to talk
 about Google Analytics for 
Firebase from three slightly 
different angles.  First, I'm 
going to step us through what we
 see as the core of our 
Analytics offering, then I will 
have Steve join us and he will 
talk about exciting enhancements
 we are  introducing today to 
our reporting capabilities and 
then finally Krista will come up
 and talk growth strategies and 
how you can use cross network 
attribute solutions to drive 
your business forward.  So 
turning to our core, when we 
approached Google Analytics for 
Firebase, we built a solution to
 be completely free and 
unlimited even for the largest 
of apps.  Now you have the 
opportunity to understand all 
data without compromise. 
   This includes all of your raw
 event data, all accessible and 
all for free.  But what's more 
though is Analytics works simply
 by adding Firebase to your app.
  Analytics is just set up 
automatically, and right out of 
the box, you get access to the 
most important signals and you 
have all of that information 
summarized for you at your 
fingertips.  So let's take a 
look at that.. 
   So this is our app dashboard.
  It provides summaries of all 
of your key data points and then
 has drill ins for deeper 
analysis throughout the product.
  I will step through and zoom 
in on some of the cards quickly.
  The first at the top is 
helping you understand key 
engagement metrics.  This is the
 active user's card.  It has 
daily, weekly, monthly active 
users like all of our line 
plots.  It has comparison to the
 previous period and it quickly 
summarizes user engagement. 
   Then when you look at a 
different definition of user 
engagement, you are able to see 
how much time your customers are
 spending actually engaged with 
your app.  And ideally, that 
engagement is turning into 
revenue.  And so here on the 
average revenue card we are 
summarizing average revenue 
peruser, also per paid user, 
again, broken out by the same 
daily, weekly, monthly 
summaries.  For many apps that 
monetize effectively they are 
using in app purchases, in app 
purchase is an event that's able
 to be captured automatically 
both on iOS and Android.  And 
the I/O P summary summarizes top
 transactions and as a drill in 
link for detailed reporting. 
   So drive successful 
businesses, particularly those 
built around IAP.  User 
acquisition strategy is key.  
That's where cross network  
attribution comes in and you are
 able to use the cross network 
attribution summary to 
understand the best term forming
 channels and how the channels 
are turning into lifetime value 
with a deep link to the full 
report. 
   What's the point of acquiring
 users if you can't keep them?  
That's what you are seeing here 
in the cohort summary.  Krista 
will come up and talk about 
techniques more in a few 
minutes. 
   Switching gears a little and 
moving down the dashboard, all 
find device and app info.  Here 
you are looking at the app 
versions card.  This is the 
device's card and it summarizes 
the model of the device along 
with OS information.  And then 
this last set of cards gives you
 more insight into use users.  
Here we are looking at location 
information and then by 
sprinkling in Google proprietary
 data you are seeing age and 
gender information and then 
lastly interest category 
information so all great data 
quickly summarized for users. 
   It's great that all of this 
works out of the box and is 
automatic, but you are not 
limited to the automatic events.
  We built Google Analytics for 
Firebase to be highly extensible
 so you can track up to 500 
distinct events each with 25 
different parameters and log the
 events on a complete unlimited 
basis. 
   If you don't know what to 
track, we go so far as to 
suggest different types of 
events to you based on the 
different types of apps that you
 might have.  It's a great way 
to jump start your 
implementation, but it also 
helps you understand even more 
deeply around these behavior you
 because many events feature 
first class reporting.  It's 
great to have it all brought 
together and summarized, all of 
your data, but what's the point 
of  having it in a silo.  You 
need to have it available to you
 in all of the places you care 
about.  So Google Analytics for 
Firebase is, of course, at home 
in the Firebase Console.  This 
is where many of you know and 
expect it to live.
   It is lz available in the 
Google Analytics UI.  So this 
way all of the users across your
 organization can have access to
 the same Analytics capabilities
 in whatever product they are 
most familiar with.  But that's 
not all.  Your Analytics data is
 also available for you in Cloud
 messaging both to understand 
what's happening and to use for 
targeting.  The same is true for
 remote config.  Your Analytics 
data works with crash reporting 
to help you understand 
engagement patterns that might 
be leading to crashes and can be
 used natively with Cloud 
functions.  Cross network 
attribution in Analytics works 
in a complimentary way with 
dynamic links, and for 
Enterprise customers, Analytics 
works across the Google 
Analytics 360  360 suite. 
   One of the ways that it works
 with the 360 suite is through 
Google tag manager.  Tag manager
 lets you remotely configure the
 event measurement from your app
 from a Web UI.  You can modify 
events you are already tracking.
  You can have one event fire in
 response to another event and 
send event data to other 
destinations not just at Google 
but with our tag template 
partners including tune and many
 others. 
   And then simply by linking 
Firebase to AdWords your 
Analytics data is available to 
use for conversion tracking and 
actually used as a signal to 
drive all of your app related 
campaigns.  And so while this 
equips you with the start of the
 right data in many of the 
places where you need it, like I
 said, it's really just the 
start of the right data.  So 
with that, I'm going to invite 
Steve up on stage and he is 
going to showcase our latest 
announcements related to 
reporting.  Steve?
   (Applause). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; STEVE GANEM:  Thank you.  
Thanks, Russ.  Good afternoon, 
Google I/O, my name is Steve 
Ganem and I'm a product manager 
on Analytics.  Before coming to 
Google I spent 20 years 
developing video games and I 
launched about 30 titles in that
 time frame.  Let me tell you 
there is nothing more exciting 
than launching a game.  Now, you
 work on this thing for months 
or perhaps years to get it ready
 and it starts to come together 
and become fun and then you 
finally get to the point where 
you are ready to put it out in 
front of real users and press 
and get the feedback you have 
been looking for.  And I know a 
lot of you can relate with 
launching your own products. 
   Last year right here at 
Google I/O we launched Firebase 
I got that same thrill, that 
same buzz.  And since then I 
have had the opportunity to 
speak with many of you at events
 like this on social media, good
 old stack overflow, and 
sometimes directly over email 
and I have gotten a chance to 
help some of you understand your
 reports, but also to get your 
feedback on what's working well 
in the product and what we can 
do to improve it for you. 
   If I could categorize your 
feedback, it would generally 
fall in these two themes.  First
 would be that you really want 
deeper reporting, and you want 
real time features.  And I'm 
excited to tell you that we have
 some pretty huge improvements 
in both of these areas that I 
will tell you about today.  
First, what do I mean by deeper 
reporting?  I mean that type of 
reporting that better, helps you
 better understand how users are
 behaving and performing in your
 apps and also the type of 
reporting that helps you 
understand how ruer app business
 is p erforming. 
   Sometimes this is a matter of
 Google connecting dots for you 
by a ugmenting data with other 
data that Google has and 
sometimes it's justs a matter of
 surfacing data you are already 
collecting in more insightful 
ways.  One feature that's the 
perfect plend and showcase for 
both of these things is our 
brand new integration with 
AdMob.  You may have heard the 
keynote preceding this but this 
integration allows data to flow 
between two platforms and goes a
 long way to enable deeper 
reporting for the 1.000000 apps 
using AdMob today.  Showing an 
ad in your app isn't as simple 
as a binary decision anymore.  
There is lots of decisions to 
make.  There is a decision of 
what primary network to use, 
what immediate yated networks to
 use, what formats, refresh 
rates how to render native ads 
and if you are using rewarded 
ads, how much reward to give to 
users. 
   Beyond that, showing an ad in
 your app isn't something you do
 in a vacuum.  This is a 
sacrifice of the real estate of 
your app, and you need to make 
sure that as you are earning 
revenue you are not sacrificing 
the user experience or else you 
might win the revenue battle and
 lose the overall user 
engagement and retention war.  
You need to pick the right 
winning strategy for your app.  
Analytics can help you measure 
that winning strategy, Burt 
first you need to get your AdMob
 data into Analytics.  That's 
exactly what we have done for 
you with this integration.  It's
 entirely automatic just by 
dropping in the supported 
versions of our SDKs in your 
app, we will automatically bring
 AdMob impressions and clicks 
into AdMob not just, or, iemgz, 
into Analytics.  Not just for 
AdMob but networks you mediate 
through AdMob as well.  And 
because we have the great 
integration with AdMob we can 
factor it into cease business 
performance indicators like 
average revenue peruser.  So now
 you have an overall revenue 
metric that take into account 
both purchase revenue and ads 
revenue. 
   You can go deeper with this. 
 In addition to showing you 
these metrics, you can break it 
down in a number of ways.  We 
let you break them down by ad 
unit, ad format, ad source and 
also by screen because we nose 
where these ads are being shown 
in your app, we can help you 
understand which screens are 
performing better in terms of 
your ad 
revenue.  Because all of is this
 is 457ing at the event level 
you can apply audience filters 
and property filters to 
understand how ad performance 
differs among different segments
 of your user base.  That's 
important when trying to build a
 winning strategy for your app 
for advertising because then you
 can AB test and understand how 
different strategies actually 
perform.  We have given some of 
you early access and some of the
 feedback has been incredibly
 encouraging.  President of B 
works games had this to say.  He
 said this integration has 
completely changed the way we 
think about game design and 
montization.  And we hope it can
 do the same for you as well.  
Help you fundamentally think 
about what your ad strategy 
should be since now you can 
measure it and understand not 
just the impact on revenue, but 
also on user engagement and 
retention. 
   So needless to say we are 
excited to get this in your 
hands.  If you are interested in
 trying this out, it's available
 today.  Just check out our help
 center article for more 
information.  And you can check 
out the reports as well in our 
demo project for Firebase which 
is available on the Firebase 
Console through the link explore
 demo p roject, and you can see 
this reporting in action for a 
real app.  We also have a 
session entirely dedicated to 
this on Friday that you 
definitely should check out.  
It's called AdMob and Firebase, 
better together. 
   Continuing with the theme of 
deeper reporting, I want to 
touch on something that you have
 been really focus about since 
launch of last year.  It 
resolves around event 
parameters.  Events are the data
 points of Analytics.  You log 
events to tell us what's 
happening in your app, what 
actions users are taking and you
 associate parameters with them 
to contextualize those events so
 it's not just that a purchase 
occurred but you can tell us 
what product was purchased.  As 
Russ mentioned our API is 
extensible and you can log 
custom events that correspond to
 specific features you have in 
your app and attach parameters 
to those as well, although you 
can use those events and 
parameters, those custom events 
and parameters in audience 
definitions, reporting around 
the values of those parameters 
has historically been related 
only to those suggested events 
that we pre corroborate for 
different business verse calls 
that Russ showed you. 
   You have been vocal about the
 need to see reporting on 
parameter values in Analytics so
 today I'm excited to tell you 
we made that available to you.  
We are launching parameter 
reporting in Analytics.  So 
tablas R.
   (Applause).
     And this is available now, 
you don't need a new SDK for it.
  If you go to your event detail
 report in Analytics, you will 
see the prompt to add event 
parameters you want to see 
reporting on.  You can register 
up to 50 event parameters.  Tip 
dli you will send us either a 
number or text parameter.  Here 
is what you will get out of 
that. 
   When you send us a number, we
 will produce a sum met Atlantic
 and average metric.  There is 
different use cases for both of 
those.  So would you pass, in 
this case, I'm showing a screen 
where for a product purchase I 
want to show some metric of the 
product value.  I have a high 
level view of how much money I'm
 making through these purchases 
compared to the last period.  
It's simple and easy to 
understand but it doesn't have 
to be revenue related.  You can 
do this to track any high level 
key performance indicators in 
your app.  In you have a music 
streaming app you want to 
measure the total amount of time
 users are spending listening to
 music or watching video or if 
you have a travel app and you 
want to see how far your users 
are traveling, you can measure 
that as well. 
   And we compare it against the
 previous period so you can 
filter this as well and see how 
it differs among the different 
segments of your user base.  
Additionally we also supply you 
with an average metric.  
Pictures here is an event for my
 game called level end where I 
log the total score.  Looking at
 the average here plotted 
against the previous period I 
can see what the average scores 
are for users who are playing my
 game. 
   And I find the average one to
 be actually especially 
insightful.  We will have to see
 what you come up with.  Some 
common thing you can use this 
for, useful questions you can 
answer are things like on 
average how many friends does a 
user have when they make the 
first post to my social network?
  On average how much time does 
a user spend in Ms. App before 
they make the first purchase?  
How far are users traveling in 
their morning jog?  And now it's
 a singe to  cinch to get 
answers in AdMob by registering 
parameters.  You are passing us 
text parameters.  Here is an 
example from my app.  It's a 
skateboarding game and users are
 u nlocking various achievements
 and now I can get a breakdown 
of the most popular achievements
 that they are unlocking and 
graph them against each other to
 see what the popularity and 
distributions are like. 
   You can use in this in your 
app to see what is the most 
popular content or search terms 
and also on what screens are 
certain actions taking place.  
And, again, as I mentioned with 
all Analytics reports, you can 
then filter these reports by 
your audience segments and user 
properties to see how behavior 
is different among the different
 segments of the user base 
because it will be and the 
better you understand that the 
more tailored you can make your 
app experience and your app 
updates so serve your audience. 
   I'm personally very excited 
about this one.  It's something 
I wanted in my own apps and so 
I'm sorry anxious to put it in 
your hands so you can give it a 
shot too.  This is available 
today.  You don't need a new SDK
 for it.  You may have noticed I
 mentioned screens a couple of 
times both in the context of the
 AdMob integration and also with
 regard to custom parameter 
reporting.  That's because now 
we have started tracking screens
 automatically for you. 
   So what we will do here is 
screen, as users transition from
 screen to screen, there are a 
couple of things we do for you. 
 The first is the signal of 
transition.  We log a new event 
called screen view for you.  It 
identifies the screen you are 
going to as well as the screen 
you came from.  Secondly, this 
is context.  Wherever we can as 
an Analytics product we want to 
augment your reporting by adding
 context to your events so, for 
example, we had demographics, 
locations and interest data.  So
 you know who is using your app.
  Now we have added screens into
 the mix so you have a sense of 
where certain actions are taking
 place in your app. 
   This enables us to produce 
actually a news report on the 
dashboard which breaks down user
 engagement in your app by 
screen.  Now, you can see where 
users are spending time in your 
app.  What are the most popular 
screens there.  You can segment 
this to get down to the lower 
grain trends. 
   You can't talk about dweeper 
reporting at least touching on 
Data S tudio.  Last year, late 
last year we launched beta 
reports of our report templates 
for Data Studio, and this Data 
Studio is an awesome product 
that showcases what is possible 
when you link your Firebase app 
to BigQuery because it 
visualizes your raw data and 
allows you to fully customize 
your own dashboard using the law
 data, produce the metrics you 
care about in the order you care
 about and share them with the 
rest of your organization.  I'm 
going to give you a walk through
 of this in a bit using my own 
app so you can see it in action.

use of context to better 
understand app actions and 
another, someplace, one place 
that's especially important to 
understand that context is in 
regard to a recent launch from 
our friends at Android.  That's 
Android instant 
Android Instant Apps.  The 
Android instant Android Instant 
App experience is seamless. 
   It combines the accessibility
 of a website with the rich user
 experience of a native app.  
And because it's so different, 
it stands to reason that users 
will actually behave differently
 in the instant app.  That's 
kind of the point.  But in terms
 of measurement of instant apps 
you need three things.  The 
first is you need a high level 
overview across your instant app
 and installed app of what the 
user perform ance and behavior 
is like so you can track KPI and
 understand from a business 
point of view how you are doing.

distinguish between instant app 
behavior and installed app 
behavior.  Since it's such a new
 technology, you need to 
understand how instant app 
behavior is different for users 
as well.  And thirdly, it's very
 common for users to graduate 
from an instant app to the 
installed app.  And when they 
do, you want to make sure you 
are measuring that person as a 
single user rather than two 
completely disjoint users.  In 
all three ways we have thought 
ahead of you and Analytics can 
support you in these use cases. 
   We have put together a 
developer guide to help you 
think about how you ought to 
measure instant apps, and you 
request check that out, and if 
you are thinking of building an 
instant app of your own 
business, Firebase has you 
covered there. 
   So that covers for the deeper
 reporting section.  Now, I want
 to move onto the real time 
reporting section.  Google 
Analytics launched real time 
reporting almost six years ago 
and it was ahead of its time and
 set the standard for real time 
reporting. 
   So when we set out to build 
our own real time reports in 
Google Analytics for Firebase, 
we already know how users love 
to view these reports.  Knowing 
what your end users are up to in
 your app is i nspiring, and 
it's insightful and it had also 
critical this real time nature 
of it for validation and for 
debugging your app.  So we 
wanted to set out to build 
reporting that satisfied all of 
these same use cases and so 
earlier this year when we 
launched a series of reports to 
do so, starting with stream 
view. 
   Stream view gives you a real 
time view of your Analytics data
 as we collect it.  It's not 
just fast.  It's rich.  It's 
dynamic.  And it's surprisingly 
deep.  You get event location 
detail down to the city level 
and event data down to the 
parameter level, and as you are 
exploring and try to understand 
how your users are behaving, you
 can actually apply these as 
filters to find out, for 
example, what are u sers in San 
Francisco buying or where are 
the top players in the world 
locate thed.  You can apply a 
filter to get at that. 
   To see the individual journey
 of a user, sueser snapshots can
 deliver you that.  User 
snapshot is like a virtual focus
 test.  We visualize the stream 
of events coming from a single 
device along a time line.  As 
you are following this, it's 
like your following a user's 
progression through the app.  
It's like a virtual focus test. 
 Anyone who has administered a 
focus test knows that invariably
 your users use product 
differently than you think they 
do and you will learn something.
   I mentioned before about how 
we log a screen view event 
automatically for you.  You will
 see the show appear and the 
sequence of screen view events 
identifies users path through 
the app.  You can see the logs 
and the crashes that are logged 
if you have integrated crash 
reporting.  You will also see ad
 impressions and clicks through 
our AdMob integration.  We 
realize the interface is ideal 
for debugging that's why we 
built debug view on top of it as
 well.  As an app developer m 
yself I know how critically 
important it is to instrument 
your app right the first time. 
   If you make mistakes in your 
tracking and you release that 
app version, it will be haunting
 you forever sending polluted 
data into your Analytics and 
there is no way to get rid of 
it.  We want to build a tool 
that helps you to validate and 
get it right and insure that 
your data is pristine after you 
launch your app.  Debug view 
logs events in real time through
 your development devices, it 
let's you examine every single 
event, very parameter you are 
sending and if there are any e 
rrors in your tracking we don't 
hide those.  We log an error 
event or parameter along with 
the necessary details and links 
to help center articles to help 
you address that and validate it
 before you launch.  The 
feedback on this real time 
reporting has been awesome so 
far.  As an Analytics PM you 
don't often get to build 
something that inspires emotion 
so when you do, you know you 
have done something special, and
 this one on the top middle I 
don't know if you can read it.  
It says Ms. Next child will be 
called debug view.  I love that 
because I named it, so I think 
it's a beautiful name and right 
now my daughter is relieved at 
home because she is not named 
debug view Ganem.  Feedback has 
been exceptional.  But some of 
you told us you need access to 
the underlying real time data 
from the real time reports.  So 
we have made that possible 
through integration with 
BigQuery. 
   Now, because the BigQuery 
question comes up all of the 
time and a lot of you have 
questions about how it works, I 
will walking you through the 
process of linking to BigQuery, 
using it and laying the data  
Data Studio on top of that.  So 
can we switch to the demo, 
please?.  So here I'm in 
Firebase Console, and I go to my
 project settings which is where
 I'm at now.  And this is for my
 own game project.  And you can 
choose here to link to BigQuery.
  Here is where you would have 
to enter your big information.  
Mine is already here. 
   So I choose to continue and 
now I can look at the links to 
my data s ets.  Going over to 
look at my data set here, you 
can see I have one data set for 
my Android App and one for my 
iOS app.  Each has daily tables 
full of data. 
   So I have 469  days worth of 
data in my Android data set but 
also this intraday data set.  
Intraday meaning these are 
events we received throughout 
today right up until right now. 
 So as users are logging events 
in my app right now,  they are 
being sent in real time from the
 back end over to this BigQuery 
data set.  And I can run queries
 on it.  This is a simple one to
 see the list of names of 
events. 
   You can get that.  It's a 
pretty simple one, but you can 
imagine that you can export this
 data, visualize it, combine it 
with your own, whatever you 
need.  I want to show you a 
better way for those of you who 
have ideas for how you want to 
visualize it but maybe not the 
availability or the technical 
chops in SQL.  That's why we 
built data center integration.  
We hand built three pages of 
reports here to help you go 
deeper with Analytics data. 
   And these were hand built by 
Analytics and Data  Data Studio 
PMs and you can apply multiple 
filters all at once to go deeper
 with this.  So, for example, I 
am going to apply a level end, 
filter event filter, and maybe 
if I want to know what levels my
 users are playing I can apply 
that.  I see the breakdown of 
the school and the roof tops l
evel.  I want to know what 
cities users are playing 
rooftops because that's my 
advanced level.  That's where my
 power users are.  I can see 
that saw Paul low is extremely 
popular which isn't surprising 
if you know about the 
skateboarding culture.  Here is 
how easy it is to customize.  I 
could say I don't want events, I
 want count of users, and I 
don't want city.  I want to look
 at app versions and tables are 
so boring, I want a pie chart 
and I want to change this to app
 version. 
   And just like that, I have 
customized it and I can share it
 with Russ, show him how hard I 
worked to produce this form.  
It's that easy and I lot of you 
have questions about how e
xpensive is this?  Because 
typically working with raw data 
is expensive.  Well, Data Studio
 is entirely free.  Unlimited 
number of reports, sharing, 
customization, and, of course, 
it queries BigQuery data but 
BigQuery has historically 
offered 1 terabyte.  For some 
apps it would be hard to use 
that up in a month, but today 
BigQuery has launched a 10 
gigabyte per month free storage 
tier making this cheap and 
affordable to work with raw 
data.
   All right.  Go back to the 
slides.  So that was a lot of 
stuff I know we covered but 
actually that's not all we are 
up to.  I want to invite Krista 
to the stage to tell you more.  
Krista.
   (
Applause). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KRISTA SEIDEN:  Thank you,
 Steve, my name is Krista Seiden
 and I'm also a product manager 
on Google Analytics or Firebase.
  We have just heard from Steve 
about a ton of new features just
 released in Google Analytics 
for Firebase.  I don't know 
about you but I'm excited by a 
lot of these.  Let's look at how
 you can use a lot of these new 
f eatures along with core 
product functionality to help 
you drive growth and attribution
 for your businesses. 
   Now, once you have built and 
launched your app, you want to 
pay close attention to your 
Analytics data to understand how
 your app is being used.  You 
will also want to understand the
 sources of traffic driving 
users to your app and determine 
your highest value networks and 
campaigns for conversion events 
such as first open, in app 
purchases and more. 
   An important way to determine
 who your best users are is by 
understanding their post install
 behavior with conversion 
events.  So consider what the 
drivers for your business are.  
Out of the box we mark first 
open and in app purchase as 
conversion events but every 
business is different, every 
business is unique, and you are 
going to have different events 
that might be meaningful for 
your business.  So I would 
encourage you to go ahead and 
mark those events as conversion 
events in the UI to unlock 
attribution reporting on those 
events.  For example, you might 
decide that something like an 
app update is a really good 
signal of user engagement with 
your app, so you might want to 
mark app updates as a conversion
 event to unlock attribution 
reporting on app updates. 
   By doing so, you will have 
further visibility into the 
various ad networks you are 
running campaigns on by seeing 
which campaigns are leading to 
more engaged higher value user  
users.  Simply put conversion 
events allow you to focus on the
 most valuable events and users 
and determine your high value 
campaigns driving engagement in 
your app.

basics on understanding how 
users are finding your app and 
what they are doing in there, I 
want to talk to you about 
attribution.  So we have built 
several integrations to help you
 grow with a single SDK. 
   First up, universal app 
campaigns.  So you cannot have a
 successful mobile app business 
without having a successful 
growth  strategy and you need to
 answer two questions to execute
 on that successful growth 
strategy.  First, who are the 
best customers for your app?  
And second, where do you find 
them?  Which media channels are 
most effective at finding these 
customers and getting them to 
install and use your app?  And 
that can be complex.  So we have
 built universal app campaigns 
or U AC to help you reach people
 across multiple billion user 
properties including Google 
Play, search, YouTube, Gmail, 
and  millions of apps and asites
 across the display network.  
All you have to do is tell us 
the app you would like to 
promote, the price you are 
willing to pay per install, and 
a few more bits of information 
like the ad text, the v ideos 
and assets, and UAC will then do
 the work by using Machine 
Learning to deliver the maximum 
number of installs at the price 
you have specified. 
   And UAC is now even better.  
AdWords has  launched the 
ability to launch for higher 
value installs.  This means you 
are not just optimizing for the 
number of installs, but also for
 the post install events such as
 in app purchase that you have 
specified as conversion events 
through Firebase.  Now, UAC is 
an encriedable  feature in 
AdWords that we know will help 
you bring high value users to 
your app.  Let's say you are a 
large marketer or large 
developer and you manage and buy
 ads programmatically using the 
double click zing tall marketing
 suite.  That's why I'm excited 
to announce that today we have a
 new integration with double 
click digital marketing.  This 
is in beta as of today. 
   Now, Firebase tracked install
 and post install events can 
easily be imported back into ZZM
 as conversions.  This means 
that large advertisers can 
seamlessly integrate Firebase to
 their overall programmatic 
buying, measurement and 
optimization needs using club 
click. double click. 
   We know you are not just 
advertising with AdWords and 
double click.  That's why we are
 continually investing in 
growing our third party 
advertising network.  Today I'm 
excited to announce that we have
 over 50 ad network partners and
 we are continuing to invest in 
this area.  We have invested in 
integrating with all of these 
different pieces to help you 
advertise across platforms, 
allowing data from all of thighs
 to come together in the same 
platform to help you make solid 
decisions on the data that you 
are collecting.  Simply put, we 
are creating a single source of 
cross network  attribution. 
   Now that we have covered 
attribution, let's focus on 
using your Analytics date  data 
to drive growth.  Let's look at 
a case study.  Who a call is an 
app that acts as a caller ID.  
The service model is more 
passive than most because they 
are relying on the frequency for
 which users are getting calls. 
 So instead of focusing on 
something like retention rate as
 their most important metric, 
uninstall rate has become the 
most critical metric for whose 
call.  To the who's call 
starting using the Google 
Analytics for Firebase to log 
removal of apps automatically 
and with BigQuery they were able
 to analyze the data in depth.  
They soon realized that they had
 a first day uninstall rate of 
almost 70 peevers.  7 0 % . 
   That is really bad.  So armed
 with this data the who's call 
tem started improving the 
process of on boarding bit 
running AV testsgy getting 
people to accept permissions and
 keep the app.  What they were 
able to do was reduce the 
uninstall rate by 14% and 
increase retention rate by 6%.  
To sum this up, they said that 
using Firebase we are able to 
consolidate and measure 
important metrics within a 
unified platform.  It relieves 
the burden of data analysis and 
allows us to take action where 
it really counts.  I think that 
this is a really great example 
of using your Analytics data to 
actually drive growth. 
   And that data will  help you 
to not only understand where 
your users are coming from but 
will give you insights into 
their behavior in your app.  
Now, you have been focused on 
growing your high value users, 
and now you want to retain them.
  Using Google Analytics for 
Firebase you can identify these 
high value audiences and send 
these audiences for 
re-engagement campaigns.  You 
can also use these  audiences 
across over areas of Firebase 
specifically to target them in 
Cloud messaging and remote 
config. 
   Recently we launched a couple
 of updates to these targeting 
options.  First, logical 
audience combinations such as 
includes one of.  For example, 
you could target audiences that 
contain at least one of 
purchasers, lifetime value 
greater than zero or high 
scoring users with an offer for 
a free character in the app to 
incentivize them to come back.  
Second, you can now target using
 user properties in Cloud m 
essaging and remote  config.  
For example, this screen shot 
shows high level users.  These 
are users at or above level 20 
in your app.  Now, you can use 
this to customize app experience
 of users by different skill 
users by leveraging remote 
config.  This allows you to get 
more con you lar and specific 
with targeting options to reach 
users you are interested in. 
   So I have talked about 
several ways to understand your 
user behavior, drive growth and 
attribution with new 
integrations and expanded 
functionality.  I hope that you 
will give some of it a try.  
With that, I will hand it back 
over to Russ.
   (Applause). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RUSS KETCHUM:  Thanks, 
Krista.  So we covered a lot of 
ground today.  We introduced you
 to our new name, Google 
Analytics for friesh we looked 
at the core of Analytics and the
 enhancements and Krista took us
 through how you can use 
attribution to drive growth 
strategies.  We hope that this 
session is the start of a 
conversation.  And to keep that 
conversation going, there is a 
number of other Firebase 
sessions  happening throughout 
the rest of the I/O.  I would 
particularly like to highlight 
the session Steve mentioned 
earlier, the AdMob and Firebase 
better together session that's 
happening Friday 
morningality at 8:30.  If you 
have questions, we will be at 
the Firebase Sandbox so you can 
find us there and we would love 
to hear your thoughts.  With 
that, on behalf of the Google 
Analytics for Firebase team.  
Thank you for coming out and 
enjoy the rest of I/O.  Take 
care.  (Concluded at 6:39 CT)

is Tim Murray and I work on the 
Android performance team.  We 
will talk about improving your 
application's performance on 
Android.  Now, one of the big 
things that the Android 
performance team has done in the
 past year was to optimize the 
performance of the Google Pixel.
  We looked at everything on the
 Pixel from application code 
down to the kernel, everything 
in between.  We tweaked things, 
we experimented with things, we 
replaced other components 
entirely.  What did we try to do
 here?  What did we do to, you 
know, what was your focus for 
performance? 
   Number one, we wanted to hit 
60 frames per second all of the 
time.  This means that you have 
to render a frame in 16.7 
milliseconds all of the time.  
If you run at 60 frames per 
second your app looks fluid.  It
 looks smooth and responsive.  
If you don't run at 60 frames 
per second people notice.  The 
phone doesn't feel fast.  The 
phone feels like it's 
struggling. 
   So consistency is parament.  
You want to hit 60 frames were 
second all of the time.  The 
second thing we focused on was 
to make applications start 
quickly.  A user will switch 
between applications a lot in 
the course of normal usage.  If 
I'm in Gmail and I click a link 
that opens in Chrome, I want 
that to go quickly.  If I click 
a link in Chrome that takes me 
to Twitter, I want that to go 
quickly too.  Any time I'm  
sitting there waiting for the 
system to switch applications 
feels like dead time.  It's a 
time I remember I'm using a 
computer as opposed to 
interacting with the stuff I 
want to get done. 
   So reducing the amount of 
time you spend switching apps 
make the system feel effortless.
  It's really 
important.  That's it.  That's 
what we focused on system wide 
for Pixel.  We just wanted to 
hit those two things 
consistently.  If you do these 
two things when your device is, 
you know, switching between 
applications very quickly and 
running at 60 frames per second 
it will feel fast, but more 
importantly, if your device runs
 at 60 frames per second and 
switches between apps 
consistently, it does it all of 
the time, the device stops 
feeling like anything.  It stops
 feeling like a device.  Instead
 it feels like you are 
interacting directly with the 
application. 
   And that's magical for a 
user.  That's really important. 
 But there is a problem with 
this scenario.  We run apps and 
apps can be slow.  And, of 
course, on the system side of 
things, we are constantly trying
 to make it easier to write fast
 applications and make it harder
 to write slow applications, but
 as an application developer it 
is apples going to be something 
you can do to make the system 
not run at 60  frames per second
 or make your apps start up 
really slowly. 
   The issue is that from the 
point of view of the user, they 
don't care that it's one app 
that happens to run slowly.  One
 Health app that doesn't run at 
60 fips or doesn't start up 
quickly ruins the whole magical 
feeling of the device, and it 
reminds them they are not i 
nteracting with an app, they are
 touching their phone and then 
they want to throw their phone 
against the wall.  So today we 
are going to talk about two 
tools that we used during Pixel 
really extensively to analyze 
performance and help you as app 
developers figure out what you 
can do to improve your  
application's performance. 
   The first tool we are going 
to talk about is called 
GFXinfo.  It's a shell command 
you can use on the device and 
all it does is it sells you 
about the rendering time for 
your application.  So here we 
can see that we rendered 223 
frames, we got the average 
frame time.  The 99th percentile
 frame time and it 
gives us some idea why it's 
actually slow.  We use this 
internally and you look at 
average frame time, 95th and 
99th percentile frame time.  
That's all this tool does.  It 
doesn't tell you why your app 
ran slow. 
   It doesn't tell you snig you 
should do to fix it so why am I 
up here talking about it?  
Because you can automate
 it.  If you take one thing away
 from this talk, if you decide 
to take a nap for the next half 
h our, just run GFXinfo at the 
very end of whatever automated 
test you are running and 
congratulations now you have a 
performance test.  Now you have 
a thing you can run regressions 
on, you can spot regressions in 
your application. 
   The first time you have a 
performance regression in your 
application that you want to 
track down, this will save you 
so much time and effort, it will
 pay for itself instantly.  This
 is how most of the internal 
Android yank tests work, this is
 how we track all rchg  jarchg 
across the system.  Please do 
it, it you will say yourself so 
much t ime.  But that's GFXinfo.
  That only tells you where your
 performance is today.  It 
doesn't tell you why your 
performance is that way or what 
you should do about it. 
   For that we turn to a 
different tool, my favorite 
tool, the only tool I ever use,
tion systrace.  So a lot of 
developers have tried systrace 
and they have told me they have 
no idea what's going on when 
they look at systrace, and 
that's fair.  I can stand up 
here and tell you that systrace 
is easy, it's not really easy.  
Systrace is not a CPU p rofiler.
  Systrace is instead a system 
wide tracing tool. 
   The first thing that means is
 systrace doesn't care about 
your app.  It doesn't do 
anything special to your 
application.  It's not going to 
go peek at your  application's 
call stacks and say you spent a 
really long time in this 
function.  It doesn't do that.  
It just tells you when your 
application was running and 
certain events that occur within
 your application.  It also 
tells you everything about the 
rest of the s ystem.  It will 
tell you things about the 
kernel.  It will tell you things
 about the graphics pipeline.  
It will tell you things  about 
the framework and activity 
manager and things like that.  
there is any information you 
want about afternoon Android 
device, we have probably 
surfaced it via systrace.  We 
use it for everything.  Just to 
be, just to reinforce how 
important systrace is, in the 
past year, I have looked at 
somewhere over 2,000 traces.  We
 use systrace a whole lot.  Now,
 systrace is not arch Android 
studio.  If you want to get 
systrace, there are two ways to 
get it.  First of all, it's in 
platform tools in the Android 
SDK.  You can get a version of 
systrace from there.  What I 
like to do though is I get 
systrace from the repository 
where it's developed.  It's part
 of a project called catapult, 
which is on GitHub, catapult it 
owned by members of the Google 
Chrome and Android teams. 
   So upstream catapult is 
always improving.  I usually get
 top of tree catapult.  Once you
 get that, you will have this 
Python executable that you can 
run and you can get a trace.  
Now, how does systrace actually 
work?  What does it actually 
tell you?  Systrace is three 
components.  At the bottom is 
this thing called F trace.  
Ftrace is a Linux kernel feature
 that allows the kernel and user
 space to write event 
information into a sent central 
buffer. 
   What this means basically is 
that you can get a journal of 
any event that happened on the 
system.  So the kernel will tell
 us things like, hey, this 
process started running on this 
CPU, or, hey, the clocks changed
 on this CPU.  That's great.  
It's really low level, but we 
can use it. 
   The next thing above Ftrace 
is a program called
 Atrace, Atrace is an Android 
program on the device installed 
automatically and the Android 
image.  It's on every device.  
All it does is configure Ftrace,
 but it also configures user 
space tracing.  So Atrace will 
go and turn on all of these 
different trace points inside of
 the Android user space. 
   So here we can get things 
like do you want to find out 
what window manager thought 
about your application.  Atrace 
will turn that on or activity 
manager or any other part of the
 Android framework.  All of that
 is controlled by Atrace.  The 
top most layer is systrace 
itself.  Systrace then lives on 
your host development machine 
and it gets the results from 
Atrace, and it wraps those 
results in a nice HTML file. 
   You get this giant to pen 
that willly 10s of Megs or even 
100s of Megs HTML file that 
contains a trace.  It's pretty 
convenient and it actually makes
 sharing traces incredibly easy.

should do when you decide to 
start tracing a device is you 
should look at the categories 
available on that device.  
Systrace events are separated 
into categories.  And those 
categories will vary from Os 
version to Os version and 
potentially device to device. 
   In general, the important 
stuff will always be there.  The
 Core stuff that you want as an 
app developer, we have tests for
 that to go beyond every device.
  Now, let's actually run a 
trace and see what that would 
look like.  So this is the 
demand I used for the trace you 
will see for the rest of this 
talk, and the way systrace works
 is you provide the list of 
event tags that you want in your
 trace and here
 we have Sched, we have Freq for
 CPU frequency information, idle
 will tell us when the CPU goes 
idle, AM and WM tell us about 
the Android activity manager and
 window manager.  GFX will tell 
us everything you wanted to nose
 about the Android graphics 
pipeline, view will tell you 
about the view hierarchy inside 
applications, Dalvik enables the
 trace point for the art VM, 
input will tell you when you are
 actually touching the screen 
and binder driver will tell you 
exactly when a process is making
 an IPC over binder to another 
process.  The last three 
arguments are s pecial -- key 
see we are going to run the 
trace for five seconds.  If you 
omit the dash key, systrace will
 prompt you to prescienter.  Dsh
 O, you will right to HTML.  Dsh
 B is a little odd.  So I 
mentioned Ftrace and the Ftrace 
buffer, the Ftrace buffer is a 
fixed size.  By default it's 
1.4-megabytes and what happens 
if you fill this buffer, if you 
have too many events for the 
buffer is you will get a trace 
and then at the end, things will
 stop happening.  You think you 
ran the trace for five seconds 
but maybe you only have 3.5 
seconds worth of events in 
there. 
   When I take a trace, I always
 increase the buffer size so 
here I have increased it to 
16-megabytes and for this kind 
of trace we probably don't have 
to increase the buffer size, but
 it's always better to increase 
the buffer size and not have to 
take a trace a second time than 
be overly conservative with the 
buffer size.  All right.  We run
 this, we now get a trace.  What
 does the trace actually look 
like?  There is a lot going on 
in this trace.  And if you are 
in the back, I'm sorry, it's 
probably hard to see. 
   The first thing to know about
 the trace is that it is a 
timeline view.  It moves left to
 right, and you can scroll it 
left to right and time moves 
from left to right.  So the left
 side is the beginning of the 
trace.  That's zero seconds 
being kicked off the trace and 
five seconds is when the trace 
ends.  You can move around the 
trace.  You can move, you can 
pan in time with AMD keys, and 
you can zoom in and out on 
whatever section of the trace 
you are looking at with WS.  So 
it's j ust, you know, like a 
first person shooter.  The trace
 also scrolls up and down.  So 
here you see there are a bunch 
of rows up here.  There is this 
kernel section and a calculator 
section. 
   There are way more rows on 
the screen because there is one 
row generally for every thread 
that is run during the trace.  
So you may have hundreds or 
thousands of rows in your trace.
  The next thing to look at when
 you start using systrace is 
there is this pallet of tools I 
have in the upper right-hand 
corner.  You can click on the 
tools you can access them with 
numbers 1-4.  Number one is the 
pointer.  That's the main tool 
we will use when we use sis 
straes.  That lets us click the 
individual events we see in the 
trace and get information about 
them. 
   When you click an event it 
will show up in the bottom half 
of the screen like that.  So 
here we could see calculator was
 running.  We see the process 
ID.  We see the thread ID.  The 
priority.  We can see when 
exactly it started in the trace.
  We see how long it ran for.  
We get a bunch of useful 
statistics.  You can use a 
pointer to select a lot of 
different things in the trace 
which gives you an aggregate 
view chai looks like that. 
   -- that looks like that.  So 
this will basically add up all 
of the threads, like if I select
 the, a region in the kernel 
section, this will add up all of
 the threads that occurred and 
tell us how much time did we 
spend on each thread.  What was 
the average time that each 
thread ran, things like that. 
   That's really useful.  We 
will come back to that later.  
Number two and three, on the  
pallet are for panning and 
zooming so they are equivalent 
to WASD.  You don't need to use 
them.  You can use them if you 
want.  I generally use WASD.  
The fourth tool is incredibly 
useful.  It is the highlighter 
tool. 
   So you could select a region 
of time in the trace, and that 
region will have a white 
background and everything you 
haven't selected will then have 
a gray background.  You can use 
this to keep track of the area 
you care about as you scroll 
vertically through a trace.  So 
if you find something in one 
process and you think something 
went wrong here what else was 
the system  doing, you can 
scroll up and down the trace and
 know exactly what part of the 
trace you should be looking at. 
 I use the highlighter 
constantly.  If you start using 
systrace, you probably will as 
well. 
   Now, let's scroll down and 
see what else is in the trace.  
More stuff.  So every row in a 
trace is either a counter or a 
thread.  And down here at the 
bottom is a thread.  These 
blocks right here are the Core 
thing that you will look at in 
systrace.  These are events.  So
 every systrace event has a 
beginning and an
 end.    Systrace events can 
then be nested so this is a 
stack that grows down.  You can 
see that here a choreographer 
event happened and a traversal 
event was contained entirely 
within that event and more 
things happened beneath.  This 
is some stuff that's part of 
calculator app start up.  And 
you will see a lot of these as 
you look through a trace.  Each 
event corresponds to explicit 
placed in the Android code base 
that somebody thought, hey, 
maybe somebody will need to 
figure out that this is 
happening sometime.  It's good 
to pay attention to these. 
   Now, let's zoom in at the 
beginning or at the end of 
activity start.  So in this 
trace we launched calculator and
 clicked a few buttons.  Here we
 are at the end of activity 
start.  And I do you meaned in 
really closely and it's still 
probably hard to see because 
systrace has a lot of very small
 UI elements.  But is there are 
these colored bars on top of the
 UI thread here.  These colored 
bars represent the state of that
 thread at any point in time.  
There are five different states 
that a thread can be in.  Now, 
if we click the green bar above 
the UI thread in the middle, we 
see that at this point the 
thread was running. 
   So at this point, the thread 
is actually running on a CPU.  
It's running on CPU one, and if 
we were to scroll back up to the
 kernel section, you will see 
it's scheduled on CPU one.  This
 is how you can know that our 
application is actually run at 
particular times on the C PU. 
   The next state that we care 
about is runnable.  Runnable 
means that your thread could 
start running at some point in 
time.  Nothing is preventing 
your thread from running.  It's 
just that the kernel has not 
scheduled it yet.  There are any
 number of reasons why this 
could happen.  Maybe there is 
more higher priority work.  
Maybe your thread has just run 
for a really long time and the 
scheduler is trying to be fair 
and give other threads an 
opportunity to run. 
   There are lots of reasons for
 this.  If you are seeing a lot 
of this in your application, 
it's probably due to thread 
priority.  The third thing that 
you can see on the right-hand 
side of the trace here is there 
is a red bar.  And the red bar 
is uninterruptible sleep which 
sounds a little scarier than it 
is.  Uninterruptible sleep is 
your thread is blocked on some 
lock inside of the kernel. 
   As an application developer, 
there is generally not too much 
you can do with this.  Sometimes
 it's hardware related, 
sometimes it has to do with 
memory.  Usually if you see a 
lot of ininterruptable sleep, 
it's my fault.  It's a system 
problem.  So we are  probably 
aware and trying to fix it, but 
sometimes you can see it's 
related to memory.  You can get 
more information about it. 
   The fourth type of state is a
 special kind of uninterruptible
 sleep that as an application 
developer you can actually do 
something about.  The orange 
state here is your thread is 
sleeping on block I/O.  This 
means that your thread is 
reading from disk and the disk 
hasn't got be the results back 
to your thread, so your thread 
can't make progress.  If you see
 a lot of this in your  trace, 
you are reading too much data.  
Try not to read so much data. 
   The fifth state, the last 
state is the state you will see 
most often and it's usually 
white or gray depending on the 
trace.  It means the thread is 
sleeping.  The thread has no 
work to do so it is asleep.  
It's not running.  The scheduler
 isn't trying to run it.  
Nothing is working on behalf of 
the thread directly in the 
kernel or anything like that.  
If you see this a lot and you 
think that's weird, it's 
probably due to some user space 
lock interaction because user 
space locks will show up as 
sleeping.

with these colored bars that is 
really great is you can select 
all of them in a region that you
 care about to get aggregate 
information.  Here you can see 
we spent so much time sleeping 
versus runnable versus running. 
 I do this constantly.  This 
gives me a coarse idea 6  of 
what the bottleneck is for a 
particular piece of code.  I can
 take a trace and see, hey, this
 thread is running.  It's on the
 C PU.  It should be making 
progress, but it's taking too 
long.  What's going on? 
   It means that it just has too
 much CPU work to do.  If it's 
getting CPU time and not running
 fast enough all you can do is 
reduce the amount of CPU work it
 has to do.  If I take a trace 
and see that a thread is always 
in block I/O.  I 
know it's reading too much data 
from disk.  So don't read so 
much data from disk. 
   If you are sleeping where you
 don't expect, it probably means
 that your application logic is 
a little weird somewhere.  You 
probably have some weird 
priority inversion something or 
lock intention that you didn't 
expect, something like that.  
Another useful tool on a trace 
is I mentioned the input tag 
earlier.  And up  here at the 
very top, there is this tiny 
little box for input response, 
and this shows where I actually 
touched the screen in the trace.
  So here I touched the screen 
and I guess my finger was down 
for 28.8 milliseconds. 
   You can use that in the trace
 similar to the highlighter.  
You can use that to orient 
yourself in the trace.  You know
 what's going on if you remember
 what you were doing while 
creating the  trace, you can 
figure out where exactly you are
 logically inside that trace. 
   Well, what if you need more 
information?  What if you have a
 lot of information about what 
your app is doing logically that
 you want to get in a trace?  
Good news.  That's  pretty easy.
  There is a class, A ndroid.OS.
trace that has two methods, 
beginning section and end 
session.  You can put a string 
in begin section and that will 
show up as an event in the 
trace.  It shows up the same as 
anything else. 
   The only special thing you 
need to keep in mind here is you
 need to call trace.end section 
from the same thread every time 
you have a begin section.  If 
you don't have a one to one 
mapping between begin section 
and end section your trace will 
look word.  You will wet very 
weird rendering in your trace 
and it's just because you forgot
 end section or you had too many
 end sections. 
   If we take a trace and we 
want to see the app events we 
have to do a little bit more 
than we did initially.  First, 
we need to specify this app tag 
as part of the arguments to the 
trace, and then we have to pass 
dash A and the package name that
 you care about.  Then you just 
take a normal trace like that, 
and you open it up, and you see 
this trace event, which is just 
whatever you put in your string.
  If you have logical groupings 
of work or a logical task that 
the user is doing, a dding a 
straes event for that is really 
useful. 
   When I look at large complex 
applications within Google, I 
find that the applications I can
 debug easily, and understand 
the performance of easily are 
the ones that implement their 
own application trace events.  I
 definitely recommend doing it. 
 It's not that difficult and it 
will be worth it as you start 
looking at systrace.  It will 
make systrace a lot more 
comprehensible. 
   And for reading a trace, 
that's about it.  There is not 
really that much going on in a 
trace.  It's just sort of what 
the system is doing at any point
 in time.  And everything that 
the system is doing at any point
 in time ends up looking like 
this.  So now what?  I don't 
think most of you probably feel 
that comfortable using systrace 
yet so why would we want to use 
systrace?  What does systrace 
tell us that makes it says 
useful. 
   Let's go back to the two 
goals we had for people  Pixel, 
number one 60 frames pr second, 
number two makes app start 
quickly.    Systrace could tell 
us about this directly, but 
there is an underlying principle
 we should call out. 
   Don't look slow.  That's it. 
 That's really the only 
performance rule there is.  The 
reason why we use systrace is it
 can tell us where we look slow 
and note that I said don't look 
slow.  I didn't say don't be 
slow.  This may sound weird 
coming from a person who works 
on performance, but for any 
moderately complex application, 
at some point in time, you are 
going to have to do something 
that is slow. 
   Maybe you are going to do 
some giant matrix multiply for 
some reason, maybe you are going
 to read from disk, you have to 
read a large image, maybe you 
have to talk to the network 
which could take who knows how 
long.  At that point, you want 
to understand why did the system
 end up looking slow when I was 
doing this?  And then what can I
 do to washing around this? 
   You know you have to do the 
slow thing, what can you do in 
your application to identify 
where exactly that slow point 
happened and then work around it
 to make the system still look 
fast because that's all the user
 cares about.  They don't care 
if the system is slow soar is 
fast.  They just want the system
 to feel fast.  If you do that, 
it will 
be great. 
   Now, let's apply that to the 
two goals that we
 have.  App start up, the basic 
thing with systrace and app 
start up you can use systrace to
 figure out exactly where your 
time is going during app start 
up and then you can decide what 
to do about it.  There is no one
 size fits all advice here.  You
 have to understand what your 
particular application is doing,
 what is needs of your 
application are, and then you 
can come up with a 
solution.  The first thing we 
use systrace for to analyze app 
start up is inflation. 
   Here we have this inflate 
section in a trace.  This is 
from the very beginning of 
calculator from activity start 
in calculator.  And we have this
 really long inflate section, 
but more importantly we can see 
the exact cost of inflating 
every view for calculator.  This
 is really u seful to help you 
figure out the cost of a view 
hierarchy or  changing a view 
hierarchy.  You can say is it 
actually worth 50 milliseconds 
to inflate these views right 
now?  Could I do this later?  
Could I do something else 
instead?  You have to come up 
with whatever solution is right 
for your application but 
systrace can help you figure out
 what is happening today in your
 application. 
   So you can come up with those
 improvements and ideas for 
future changes to your 
app.  Another thing that 
systrace tells you is you can 
tell exactly when 
applications start up ended from
 the user point of view.  There 
is more than bind application 
activity start and application 
start up.  Here you can see the 
UI thread and render thread of 
the application which are the 
two most important threads in 
making your application run at 
60 frames per second, and we 
know that once those threads 
have finished for the first 
time, here you can see the UI 
thread running and finishing 
this choreographer frame along 
with the render thread running 
at the same time.  Once that's 
done the app is loaded and ready
 for user input.  At that point 
from the user's point of view, 
app startup is done.

systrace is the resource tag, 
res.  So you can look at exactly
 what resources you are loading 
in your application at any point
 in time.  Usually loading 
resources is
 not a huge deal.  Occasionally 
we have seen areas where 
resource loading can be e 
xpensive.  It's worth checking 
in your application.  It will 
tell you just as the name of an 
event exactly what resource you 
are loading and how long it  
takes.  And, again, you can 
figure out is it worth loading 
this resource right now?
   All right.  Let's move to 
jank because that's the fun one.
  Fixing jank with systrace is a
 two accept process.  You need 
to figure out where the jank 
actually happens because maybe 
you can spot every time the 
system doesn't run at 60 per 
second, but I have been doing 
this full time for a while now, 
I can't even do that.  So 
systrace can help make it really
 obvious where exactly you 
dropped a frame.  The second 
step that you use systrace for 
is working your way backwards 
from the dropped frame to what 
actually went wrong, and then 
you can figure out what to do 
about it.  So here we have a UI 
thread and render thread again 
in an application, and we are 
running the thread or the 
application normally, it's not a
 janky frame it's just normal 60
 frame per second rendering. 
   The UI thread is the main 
application thread.  That's what
 actually g ets, you know, input
 events from system server.  
Render thread actually gets 
information from the UI thread 
and sends that to the GPU.  This
 means that in order to display 
a frame on time, the UI thread 
and the render thread have to 
complete within 16.7 
milliseconds every time.  This 
gives sis rase a nice kind of 
rhythm.  You can get used to 
this rhythm when you open a 
systrace and say, oh, yes, I 
dropped a frame there because 
you can tell it didn't quite 
line up.  It makes it easy to 
spot where the UI pipeline 
didn't run at a full 60 frames 
per second once you get used to 
this. 
   Now, if that's not 
enough, you can look at surface,
 we don't have time to go 
through the full pipeline but 
the high level overview is your 
Apple run a frame and it will 
send the frame to surface 
slinger.  Surface slinger will 
take whatever app is rendering 
on the screen and it will 
combine that with the navigation
 bar and the status bar and 
actually send the resulting full
 complete the composited frame 
to the display to show up on the
 screen. 
   What this means is that 
surface slinger is the central 
source of truth.  If surface 
slinger thinks you hit your 
frame  deadline, you are running
 at 60 frames were second.  If 
surface slinger says you didn't 
deliver a frame you know you 
didn't hit 60 frames per second 
and here the way we can do that 
is we have a counter here.  
There is one counter here per 
application in a trace.  This 
counter here is alternating 
between zero and one for how 
many frames the surface slinger 
have from this application that 
are ready to be displayed. 
   So you know that if the 
counter goes to zero for more 
than 16 milliseconds, you have 
definitely missed a frame.  This
 is the ultimate way to know 
whether you had jank in your 
application or not. 
   This gets us, this helps us 
spot where the problem is.  It 
helps us know where you actually
 dropped the frame.  So what do 
you do when you know where the 
problem is and you are going to 
work your way backwards?  So we 
are going to look at surface 
slinger to work your way 
backwards.  We are looking at 
surface slinger as an example of
 a relatively simple chain here 
because application chains can 
be more complicated.  We don't 
quite have time. 
   But usually you want to know 
why something woke up.  So we 
have a running state in the 
application, and we want to know
 what made it r unnable because 
that will tell us why the thread
 woke up in the first place.  So
 here I click the running state 
on top of surface slinger and I 
can look at the left arrow and 
see the runnable state. 
   Now, I have the runnable 
state selected and I want to go 
ahead and highlight that.  You 
can highlight anything you 
currently have selected with the
 M key. 
   Now, we have a nice little 
bar showing what we are looking 
at on the trace.  In this 
runnable section, we have an 
additional argument at the 
bottom here.  It says wake up 
from TID529.  This means that 
the surface slinger thread was 
triggered by thread 529.  Now, I
 don't know what thread 529 is, 
but I do know that thread 529 
must be running at this point 
because if thread 529 wasn't 
running it couldn't have woken 
up surface slinger.  So I can 
scroll back up to the top of the
 trace to see what is actually 
running on the CPU.  And I see 
this thing event thread. 
   So I will click event thread.
  And event thread is part of 
surface slinger.  It's another 
thread inside of the surface 
slinger process.  And now I want
 to know what woke up that event
 thread because I'm w orking my 
way backwards from, to figure 
out why surface slinger woke up 
at all here.  So I will scroll 
back down and find event thread 
inside of surface slinger and 
there is the actual thread state
 for the event thread.  We just 
had that little colored bar to 
show it's running because it 
doesn't have any events during 
that time.  We can click the 
runnable section of the event 
thread and see that it woke up 
from thread 4568.  Now, I 
cheated.  I know I what thread 
4568 is.  It's the display sync 
thread that is also in surface 
slinger.  Let's go to that one 
and see what woke up the display
 sync thread.  That's right down
 there. 
   We click it.  We see wake up 
from TID zero.  TID zero is a 
special thing in a trace and is 
it, all it means is that 
whatever thread you are looking 
at was woken up by an interrupt 
of some sort.  It was woken up 
by an interrupt handler.  
Usually this means a timer 
expired.  This makes sense for 
surface slinger.  Surface 
slinger will run every 16 
milliseconds so a timer expired.
  Woke up this display 
synchronization thread which in 
turn woke up the event thread 
which woke up surface slinger. 
   If you see this in your trace
 it usually means that some 
timer expired and woke up your 
thread and that's why you are 
running.  And that's it.  That's
 the basics of what you need to 
know to actually get somewhere 
with systrace.  Take some traces
 of your application and just 
try to see what's going on.  
Look at the system.  Look at how
 frames are being drawn, and 
sent to the display and how you 
are getting touch input from the
 server. 
   This kind of tracing 
backwards via the runnable state
 is most of what we do to 
understand how the system fits 
together.  And you can use it to
 improve your applications as 
well. 
   Now, if you want a lot more 
advice on what you should do as 
opposed to how to understand 
what's going on today, I 
recommend you go to the, there 
is an additional Android 
performance talk on the UI 
pipeline that Chet Haas and 
Chris crake are giving Friday at
 1:30.  So go to that.  Know 
they will talk about recycler 
view and optimizations there 
which is always a popular topic.
   So that's it.  Thank you.
   (Applause).

welcome to the AMP keynote in 
Google I/O 2017.  If you have 
gob all the way you have made it
 to the fourth keynote so while 
we can't guarantee you this will
 be the most exciting one we can
 guarantee it will be the 
fastest because we are the AMP 
team.  We are, Chen Shay, Elena 
Legeros and I'm Malte Ubl.  So 
thanks for coming.  So what is 
AMP?  In a nutshell, open source
 project for creating super fast
 Web pages.  Behave been around 
for a while and wanted to give 
you a quick year view of how 
things started.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So AMP was release the as 
a developer preview in October 
2015 and then in February 2016 
for the first time it was 
released to consumers as the AMP
 top stories carousel on Google 
Search.  You might have seen 
this before.  There is this 
contrary row sell and you type 
it, apps instantly, you can 
swipe through the stuff.  So 
this was the first time AMP came
 to users.  Later that year in 
the summer of 2016 we announced 
a project alled AMP adds that we
 are going to talk about later 
today.  Then in September of 
that year, 
AMP became eligible for all 
Google Search results in 2017 we
 had the first ever AMP 
conference, if you haven't been 
there, you should come to the 
next one.  It was really nice 
and today I'm excited to 
announce that the top service 
carousel that used to be only 
available in some countries is 
available worldwide in every 
single country where Google 
Search is serving Web traffic.
   (Applause).

we want to talk about today is 
AMP across publishing and 
platforms.  The topic we are 
most excited about now, AMP and 
eCommerce.  Since progressive 
Web  Web Apps are a thing at I/O
 we want to talk about how they 
relate to AMP.  We will be open 
with the challenges the project 
is facing and how we are 
addressing them and finally we 
will talk about AMP adds.  Let's
  take a little bit of time to 
talk about why AMP is a thing.  
What we found is that Web pages 
sometimes load slowly on 3G we 
are seeing an average of 19 
ekdz. 
   Every second of load time 
conversion rates drop by 7%.  
Similarly bandwidth is a problem
 with mobile.  There are some 
countries where a megabyte of 
data might cost up to 5% of a 
person's monthly wage.  On the 
other hand, we see for aim AMPs 
using almost a megabyte of data 
and that cannot work as an 
economic model.  It doesn't fit 
together.  So this can be 
summarized as the Web not 
meeting user expectations. 
   That's really where AMP comes
 in.  We want to get in line 
with those user expectations.  
So what is AMP doing to fix it? 
 A year ago I was on stage here 
and I announced this metric 
which was nice.  What we are 
seeing is that loaded from 
Google Search, AMP pages were 
loading at the Median in under 
one second and that's a good 
number.  It's nice to see that 
this is actually remained 
consistent as the corpus of AMP 
pages has been growing 
tremendously, but I'm very 
excited to announce that as of 
this week we are launching an 
advancement that will make all 
AMP pages across this large 
corpus get twice as fast.  The 
metric we are
 optimizing --
   (Applause). 
   Is the first
 contentful.  So that's the 
first time the browser draws 
something that's interesting.  
For a news article, for example,
 that would be the text.  We 
have done other things to 
optimize performance.  Many Web 
pages use the typical average 
Web page 60% of the bytes for 
images.  We have managed to 
reduce byte usage across this 
entire corpus by 50%.  So this 
is done using compression, but 
at a level where it doesn't have
 visual impact and, for example,
 for P and Gs, there is no 
visual difference.  It's just 
metadata removed.  So across 
this wide corpus we are getting 
50% less bytes so thinking back 
for, you know, that data might 
be expensive, I think this is 
really, really good for users.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Similarly, you mise have 
heard about a thing called broad
 leaf.  It's swies bread and the
 name of a new compression 
standard Google securic which is
 better than the nominal 
standard that probably all of 
you are hopefully using.  We 
have activated this for the 
Google M cache for all 
documents.  What we are seeing 
now is a 10 fears reduction in 
bytes for documents.  And we 
think we can do a little bit 
better over the next weeks or, 
so but I think it's a great 
first step.  So this is what we 
were doing in terms of 
performance.  I want to ask 
Elena Legeros on stage to talk 
about AMP traction across 
content publishers. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ELENA LEGEROS:  Thanks so 
much Malte Ubl.  Wow!  This is 
my very first I/O and I am super
 excited to be here.  Over the 
past year and a half, I have had
 the opportunity to work with a 
lot of publishers and talk to 
them about their experiences on 
AMP.  And I have heard their u 
ps and their downs, and talked 
to them about both their 
successes and their challenges. 
   Overall, I have gotten the 
message that AMP is really 
working for publishers.  So just
 for some context, since launch,
 publishers have created over 2 
billion AMP documents across 
more than 900,000 domains.  Up 
to 35 million AMP documents are 
created across more than 200 
countries and in more than 100 
languages every week.  Every 
second 58 AMP pages are released
 into the wild.  That's 
significant. 
   And while we continue to see 
a lot of new news publishers 
adopting AMP or creating AMP 
pages for their websites, we are
 really enthusiastic about the 
traction among other areas like 
eCommerce and travel and food 
and other diverse categories of 
websites from around the world. 
   When 
we first or when AMP first 
launched, publishers wanted to 
know why they should devote 
their resources to building AMP 
pages for their websites.  They 
understood that AMP was fast.  
That was  really plain to see. 
   But they wanted to know what 
they were going to get out of 
it.  So I want to take a few 
minutes to show a few examples 
of what a few publishers have 
gotten out of AMP, just a few 
successes.  First, The Weather 
Channel has seen a 4X increase 
in click through rates on AMP 
articles into their main site up
 from 21% to 90% since launching
 at the beginning of the year.  
Having instant access to 
information like where to expect
 golf-ball sized hail like the 
hail seen in this screen shot, 
is really valuable to people.  
And The Weather Channel gets 
that.  And AMP is clearly paying
 off for them.

resource for -- Terra offered 
information to people across 
Spain, and the U.S.  After 
ilding AMP pages for their 
websites they saw people 
spending twice as much time on 
air AMP pages compared to their 
regular mobile pages.  They also
 so you a 33% increase on click 
through rates on ads. 
   That's
 huge.  And the Singapore-based 
Wigo.com is the largest travel 
marketplace in the Middle East 
and Asia Pacific helping people 
compare travel costs from 
hundreds of global and local 
partners.  She created AMP 
versions of landing pages that 
were designed to support popular
 search queries like cheap 
flights from Singapore to 
Bangkok. 
   And what they found was that 
conversion rates to partner 
sites went up 95%.  And search 
to conversion rates improved by 
49% which completely validated 
their effort.  So we have been 
really impressed by the success 
publishers have seen on AMP, and
 we keep hearing more and more 
stories like these. 
   So far we have talked about 
the amazing growth of publishers
 and the performance they have 
seen on AMP.  Another critical 
component of AMP is that it is 
open to all platforms on the 
Internet.  And already a lot of 
platforms are supporting AMP.  
We have seen  adoption from 
search engines to mobile apps 
and there they are an essential 
part of the AMP community, bing,
  Pinterest and linked in or 
linking to aim pages and 
pointing users to a great, 
consistently fast experience. 
   And recently a few new 
platforms joined the AMP family 
which we are excited about.  
Yahoo! Japan as well as China's 
largest search engines, Sogo and
 Baidu are all connecting to AMP
 pages from their search r 
esults bringing over a billion 
people across Asia a faster Web 
experience.

AMP has gone social in China.  
10-cents Q zone as well as 
Weibo, the top two social 
networking platforms in China 
are bringing the benefits of the
 AMP experience to their 
hundreds of millions of monthly 
active users.  Q zone and Weabu 
together with baidu and Sogo 
will enable almost all of the 
mobile Internet users in China 
to experience the speed of  AMP.

social platform a little closer 
to home, we are thrilled to 
share that in the coming weeks, 
Tumblr is rolling out support 
for AMP on more than 340 million
 of their blog
 pages.  But those aren't all of
 our announcements.  Nothing is 
more important to Twitter than 
getting users to the content 
that they are looking to reach 
quickly.  They were an early 
supporter of the AMP project l 
aunching in their moments 
product in 2016.  And we are 
thrilled to announce that 
Twitter is rolling out support 
to the full feed on mobile Web 
and on their Android and iOS 
native apps bringing the 
benefit, all of the benefits of 
AMP to the world of social 
discovery. 
   It's so encouraging to see 
platforms from around the world 
embracing AMP like this because,
 again, AMP is all about a 
community coming together and 
working together to improve the 
mobile Web for everyone.  And 
with that, I will pass it to 
Chen Shay.
   (Applause). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; CHEN SHAY:  Hey, everyone!
  We are happy to announce that 
AMP is open for business.  Now, 
when AMP first started, we 
targeted news publishers, but 
over the last year, we have seen
 a wide adoption of AMP across a
 variety of different verticals 
from recipes to health to 
dictionaries, and as we were 
looking at all of these AMP 
documents, we realizes that 
while AMP is great for reading 
the news, AMP is even better for
 shopping on the Internet 
because AMP is focused on speed 
and performance and shoppers are
 won and lost in the span of a 
second. 
   You see, it wasn't that long 
ago when I was a new mom, and I 
was really struggling to figure 
out my new life and to put 
things nicely, I really didn't 
have it together.  I spent the 
first few weeks in my house in 
my pajamas, did not know how to 
make things work. 
   But I was lucky to be able to
 make all of my purchases online
 on my mobile phone, everything 
from ordering diapers to booking
 plane tickets to see family to 
buying food on line.  But the 
thing is it had to be done very 
quickly because if my baby woke 
up and started crying, I put my 
phone away, right?  And then I 
would probably get back to the 
purchase, but maybe another day,
 maybe another week.  And more 
and more people are finding 
themselves in situations like 
mine making quick mobile, making
 quick purchases on their mobile
 phones whether it's in between 
meetings or while computing on a
 train or maybe while sitting 
here at Google I/O at the AMP 
keynote. 
   In fact, Forbes reported that
 this year half of all of 
eCommerce revenue will come from
 mobile.  And when we are doing 
things on our mobile phones, we 
have constant interruptions.  We
 have babies, we have 
colleagues, we have a horrible 
Internet connection.  And we 
don't have time to wait for 
things to load. 
   That's why speed and 
performance is so important.  
Now, alley express agrees.  They
 reported that when they reduce 
their load time by 36%, they 
were able to increase their 
orders by 10.5% and able to 
increase their conversion rates 
by 27.5%.  People just want 
their lives made easier.  And 
that's why it's important for us
 to focus on speed and 
performance so that we can help 
make people's lives easier.  And
 this is where AMP comes in. 
   So last year AMP was not 
ready for eDmers, but things are
 now changing and a few months 
ago, we introduced AMP form 
where you can use to search for 
items or add items to a shopping
 cart.  And today we invite you 
to try out AMP bind, the key 
ingredient for eCommerce and 
AMP.  Amp-Bind allows you to add
 custom interactivity 
to your website.  So you can do 
things like refine an image 
gallery by color.  You can 
choose a green apple or red 
delicious.  You can update your 
product prices based on the size
 of the products.  And you can 
tap on a button to show more 
items like we do here. 
   And the cool things that 
happening is that to show these 
more items, we are bringing them
 via a server call without 
reloading the page.  And you can
 use the same exact mechanic to 
show search results or filter or
 path  paginate or short a page.
   What this means is that it's 
possible for eCommerce sites to 
use AMP and to get to parity 
with their conical pages.  And 
we have new e Commerce features 
coming out every single week 
from dynamic form validation to 
payments and currently we are 
working on auto complete and 
getting it out the door.  So if 
you want to see code samples for
 eCommerce with AMP go AMP by 
example.com sls eCommerce and to
 start playing with Amp-Bind go 
to bitly/amp-Bind.  We have eBay
 and Alibaba, and they are all 
building super fast shopping 
experiences for their users with
 AMP.  Alle express reported 
that they saw a 4% uplift in
 conversion via AMP.  And 
Zalando which is one of the top 
fashion e Commerce retailers in 
Europe, they have been rolling 
out AMP for their product detail
 pages.  And finally, eBay, eBay
 believed early on that AMP 
clearly aligns with their Core 
strategy, and they were one of 
the first eCommerce sites to bet
 on AMP in a big way.  Last 
summer they launched all of 
their product listing pages with
 AMP.  And today we are happy to
 announce that eBay is launching
 all of their product pages 
worldwide on AMP. 
   And they will go live this 
summer.  This is going to enable
 users to search for a product 
on Google and buy it on eBay in 
mere mily  milliseconds.  So if 
you want to learn more about 
eCommerce and AMP we have a 
dedicated session to just this 
topic and you are welcome to 
join us Friday at 3:30 on stage 
6.  Now, I would like to welcome
 Malte Ubl back to the stage to 
talk to you about progressive 
Web Apps.
   (Applause). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MALTE UBL:  Yes, let's 
talk about PWA in AMP.  Who has 
heard about PWA already?  Almost
 everyone.  So but let's still 
take a quick look like what 
progressive Web Apps are.  They 
are bringing a bunch of new 
features to the Web platform 
that used to be a thing you only
 find on native things like push
 notifications, offline support,
 ability to add your Web App to 
the home stream just like a 
native app and access to easy 
payments.  There is more stuff 
but those are the most important
 ones.  What they are bringing 
is the long-term engagement that
 you would  otherwise only find 
in native apps together with the
 d iscoverability of Web apps.  
I work for Google, we built the 
search engine and enables people
 to come to websites.  It works 
well.  And people have found 
that it's not as easy to get 
someone to install an app.  PW 
As bring this together and make 
a good business case. 
   Now, this is kind of where 
AMP comes in, because PWAs rely 
on the technology call service 
workers.  They are 
transferringly installed when 
you first go to PWA.  There is 
the first time the user 
experience may not be as fast 
yet because you don't have the 
service worker installed.  Now, 
last year here at Google I/O, 
Alex Russell who is the inventor
 the PWA in general coined the 
term start fast stay fast.  
That's what AMP is doing.  So if
 you build AMP pages and have 
the AMP pages install the 
service worker you have this 
continuous awesome user 
experience where the first 
contact with the brand is 
through the AMP page and it 
loads in an instant and from 
there you go on and have the 
awesome engagement features of 
PWAs.
   That was last year.  We have 
consistently improved this 
experience.  By the way, it's 
kind of an an no gram..  Awesome
 contribution from the Internet.
  So what we have done is we 
have built infrastructure that 
makes it really easy to build 
your PWA based on your AMP 
pages.  It turns out it works 
well.  It's great for users to 
get the first AMP load time 
experience and then your amazing
 PWA for subsequent visits, but 
it's also great for business 
because it turns out that with 
this approach you can invest in 
AMP today and then make that 
count for your investment in 
your PWA in the future.  So 
basically our message is i t's.
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; bad to go AMP in today 
because you want to have a PWA 
but it's a longer term boat but 
those are paying into the same 
destination.  So this is kind of
 how the user flow works.  User 
discovers content, so they might
 search for it on Google or as 
we referred earlier today from 
Elena Legeros, Twitter will 
start linking to AMP  content 
across the apps.  They click, it
 loads super fast because it's 
an AMP page.  The AMP page 
installs the service worker in 
the background silently and 
every next click is getting the 
user into your PWA experience. 
   There is a few companies out 
there who have already done 
this.  Shirt example, Zing, 
German business social network, 
they launched a PWA amp combo, 
so you might search for a job on
 Google which we have learned 
today is now more of a thing 
even, and you come to their 
landing page.  That's an AMP 
page.  It loads in an instant, 
installs the service w orker and
 any click that gets you more 
into the funnel to get the job 
is driven by the PWA service 
worker and is super fast. 
   Rock den which is a Japanese 
site launched this for the 
recipe site and they were seeing
 great metrics.  The time spent 
for users going through the AMP 
funnel up by 50% and the CTR 
from the landing page down into 
the other recipes which is 
really I think the thing they 
are driving went up by 3.6%.  
Now, I only scratched the 
surface.  There is way more to 
this, so there is a talk 
tomorrow going into detail on 
stage 6 at 9:30 that talks about
 how PWA and AMP work together. 
 Next up is Elena talking about 
the challenges of AMP. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ELENA LEGEROS:  Thanks.  
So as an open source initiative,
 we feel like it's really 
important to be transparent in 
acknowledging that not 
everything about AMP is perfect.
  And when the community shares 
feedback, AMP gets better.  And 
the community has shared a lot 
of feedback.  We really 
appreciate it.  And so we 
thought we would take some time 
to share some of the feedback 
that we have heard and how we 
are working to address some of 
those challenges.

have heard is that all AMP pages
 look the same.  This can be 
true to an extent.  We admit 
that we need to make it easier 
for publishers to build unique 
AMP pages that represent their 
own brand identities.  We have 
also heard feedback from 
publishers having a hard time 
accurately measuring the success
 of their AMP pages.  And to be 
honest, we  messed up a little 
bit here.  It's currently 
challenging to get metrics 
right.  Another category of 
feedback we have heard is around
 AMP URLs displayed in Google 
Search and I will talk a little 
bit more about this.  And 
another thing that we have heard
 is that AMP pages do not 
monetize well through ads.  It's
 true that there are a number of
 restrictions on bad ad 
behavior.  However, even with 
these limitations we are 
surprised to get this 
montization feedback. 
   So I will go through each of 
the points of feedback and talk 
about how we are addressing 
them.  So starting with the 
first one that all AMP pages 
look the same.  First of all, 
like all Web pages, AMP pages 
are styled in CSS and are fully 
customizable.  Anyone can build 
and contribute to the library of
 custom AMP components that 
allow for creative faith design 
and  flexibility.  And that 
library of components is 
constantly growing with feedback
 from the community. 
   And one new component that 
gives designers more
 flexibility is paralax.  The 
paralom extension allows for an 
element on a page to move as if 
it is nearer or farther relative
 to the foreground on a page 
when the user scrolls producing 
a 3D-like effect.  But we 
realize that not everyone is a 
designer or has designer 
resources, and we really needed 
to take that into consideration.
   And so this past spring we 
announced AMP start.  And AMP 
start is a set of templates that
 can get anyone started quickly 
with AMP documents.  And it 
eliminates a lot of the heavy 
lifting in terms of the design 
work.  And we are working on 
building out this set of 
templates that people
 can choose from and modify to 
build their own unique AMP 
pages.  And if you want to learn
 more about building beautiful
 interchactive AMP pages, be 
sure to check out the talk 
that's entirely devoted to this 
topic on Friday afternoon the 
3:30. 
   So another point of feedback 
is that it's currently 
challenging to get AMP metrics 
right.  And the first thing I 
want to say is that AMP is still
 relatively new.  And it really 
pushes the boundaries in terms 
of the kinds of user experiences
 that you can create.  And in 
insuring that content is as fast
 as it possibly can be, it takes
 advantage of things like 
platform caching and pre  
pre-rendering.  And some of 
these things make it a little 
bit challenging to measure AMP. 
   And in the last few months we
 have launched a few features 
like link and form  
substitutions to better sa sift 
publishers in attributing page 
visits back to AMP. 
   And we have also published 
documentation to illustrate 
techniques that people can use 
when collecting their own 
Analytics directly.  And we are 
also really committed to working
 with vendor partners to insure 
that they are incorporating 
updates and building features to
 support more reliable and 
accurate AMP metrics. 
   Yesterday actually Google 
Analytics announced the rollout 
of an enhancement that unifies 
users across AMP and non-AMP 
pages served from a website's 
domain.  This is really going to
 improve user analysis across 
the two formats.  This change is
 going to take effect over the 
yap coming weeks -- upcoming 
weeks and is the first in a few 
plan changes that will enhance 
AMP traffic understanding for 
Google Analytics clients.

 that not everyone likes AMP 
URLs d isplayed in Google 
Search.  More specifically we 
have heard user and publisher 
feedback that it isn't easy to 
copy and paste links to articles
 on AMP.  And it's frustrating 
to not be able to access the 
original article  URL and to 
that we would say that we agree 
and actually the AMP project 
adopted the guidance that 
platforms that  are linking to 
AMP content should share 
original article ucials when 
this is technically possible.  
Google Search has just rolled 
out a button across mobile Web 
in the AMP viewer header where 
users can tap to display the 
puck lisher link and tap on the 
link itself to navigate to the 
conical, and long press to copy 
paste.  And on native apps where
 we have more control over 
sharing functionality, we always
 chair the publisher URL. 
   And the last thing I want to 
address is the feedback that AMP
 pages do not monetize well with
 apps.  The Google ad exchange 
actually ran tests comparing 
monetization for the same 
publisher across their AMP and n
 on-AMP pages.  And what they 
found was that over 90% of 
publishers experienced higher 
click through rates and over 70%
 of publishers experienced 
higher viewability on their AMP 
pages. 
   And what we realized was that
 the publishers who had been 
under p erforming on their AMP 
pages were actually just putting
 fewer ads on their AMP pages. 
   But when comparing apples to 
apples in terms of ad placement,
 monetization results on AMP 
pages exceed non-AMP pages.  
They do b etter.  So that's a 
great segue to Chen Shay who is 
going to talk about AMP ads.
   (Applause).

Elana.  So if you remember I was
 just talking about being a new 
mom and what I wanted to tell 
you is that I am the perfect 
demographic for advertisers.  
Advertisers love people like me 
because I'm about to buy a bunch
 of baby things.  I have no 
previous knowledge about the 
things I'm about to buy, and I 
have zero brand loyalty.  I 
don't know who makes what.  I'm 
going to learn all of that soon.
  Advertisers love my 
demographic.  But remember, I'm 
also sleep deprived so I'm tired
 because I didn't get to sleep 
at night and I'm hungry because 
I didn't have time to eat and I 
have a crying baby. 
   So do you think that when I 
open a page I'm going to sit 
there and wait for a slow ad to 
load?  No way.  Nobody waits for
 slow ads to load.  Least of all
 me, and I'm the perfect 
demographic that they want to 
advertise to. 
   If an ad wants to be seen, it
 better load quickly.  So AMP 
made pages lightning fast, but 
ads are slow and we wanted to 
fix this.  We wanted to make 
sure that ads can load at the 
same speed as our AMP pages as 
the content on the AMP pages.  
And when we looked at ads we 
realized that ads have the same 
problem as regular Web pages.  
They are slow.  They are 
disruptive.  They have unwanted 
JavaScript with no perm 
performance guarantees and they 
are potentially unsafe.  This is
 something we really care about.
  We want to make sure our users
 have a safe online experience. 
   So what we did was we applied
 the same performance principles
 of AMP to   ads and we called 
it AMP ads.  AMP ads are ads 
that are created in AMP format. 
 And they are fast because they 
have no third party JavaScript, 
and all of the code is 
guaranteed to be performance 
optimized.  And they are light 
because they have reasonable 
components like AMP Analytics 
and AMP Pixel which collect all 
of the information one time and 
then they give it to authorized 
vendors, and what this does by 
collecting information only one 
time, it relieves the burden on 
the browser.  And they are safe 
because we sign all of our AMP 
ads to insure that they are 
valid so they shouldn't contain 
any m aladvertising. 
   So I will show you a 
difference between an AMP ad and
 a regular ad, and what happens 
was triple lift they ran a bunch
 of AMP ads and regular a ds 
side by side and they ran them 
on AMP pages and let's see what 
the difference looks like.  So 
on the right we have a regular 
ad.  It's taking forever to 
load.  There is no way I'm going
 to wait for that ad to load, 
not in a million years but on 
the left side we is an AMP ad 
and it loads instantaneously.  
I'm definitely going to have a 
chance to see that one.  And on 
top of that, triplelift reported
 that AMP ads when compared to 
regular ads are three times 
lighter, six times faster and 
they generate more revenue for 
publishers. 
   So AMP ads are wonderful, but
 how do you build them?  Well, 
you can build them yourself just
 like an AMP page.  Or you can 
use various t ools that are 
available to you such as 
Celtra's ad creator tool.  Let's
 take a look.  This is an editor
 and the cool thing about this 
is that you can create AMP ads 
using this editor without having
 any technical knowledge.  I 
highly recommend you try it out.

pioneers that implement support 
for AMP ads and there are a lot 
more in the process.  We have 
publishers delivering AMP ads to
 their Web pains.  We have -- 
pages, you can sign your AMP a 
ds with Google or CloudFlare.  
There are various creative tools
 you are welcome to use to 
create AMP ads and there are 
more and more ad servers 
beginning to support AMP.  So we
 have the entire ecosystem.  And
 overall, our vision is to make 
AMP  *78 AMP ads the defact to 
standard for ads on the Web.  If
 you want to learn more about 
AMP ads we have an entire 
session dedicated to talking 
just about that tomorrow morning
 at 8:30 on stage 5.  And I know
 it's really early, but what's 
more important than talking 
about ads at 8:30 in the 
morning?  So h opefully we will 
see you all there.  To wrap 
things up I would like to 
welcome back Malte Ubl.
   (
Applause). 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MALTE UBL:  I want to talk
 about contributing to AMP, to 
AMP is an open source project.  
I manage the team at Google that
 works full time on this 
project, but we, you know, we 
really want to, want this to be 
an open project and we want to 
have your, we would like to have
 your contribution to it.  We as
 a project we live on GitHub and
 it has been a bit top lar.  We 
crossed through 10,000 stars 
which I don't really know what 
that means but I'm excited about
 T. but way more important over 
400 of you have been 
contributing with actual pull 
requests with our own code for 
the AMP project, and I think 
this kind of proves it's truly 
distributed, meaningful open 
source project.  We don't want 
to stand still at this stage so 
we did a few things over the 
last months to make the project 
more transferrant and increase 
the level of engagement for the 
community to be a part of AMP. 
   One thing we have done is we 
have launched this weekly design
 reviews on hangouts.  So here 
is a picture of my team but 
there are people on the hangout 
that allows everyone to go to 
our GitHub issue we create every
 week and say we would like to 
discuss this topic.  You are on 
the agenda and you can discuss 
whatever you want to change 
about AMP with the AMP Core team
 and can become a member of the 
AMP Core team and when I saw, 
that includes us.  Every single 
change we make, we create a 
design Doc and we put it on the 
agenda of this meeting and 
discuss it with the community 
and you get to be a part of 
that. 
   I'm most excited to announce 
that later this year we will 
have the first ever AMP  
contributor seminar.  We will 
invice  contributors to 
mountainview to discuss things 
in person.  How do you 
contribute to A MP?  Not 
everyone is a seasoned open 
source developer and knows all 
of these things.  So what we 
created was a set of great first
 issues.  These are essentially 
tutorials that teach you step by
 step what you need to do to 
create your first AMP commit.  
Go to bit.LY/AMP for details on 
this.  We would like you to get.
  You don't have to know what 
GitHub is.  It should be really 
good.  Now, as I said, we are 
living on GitHub.  So that's the
 main URL.  You will find all of
 the detail there's but you can 
create issue there's so you 
don't have to write code.  You 
will find the URL for the Slack 
on GitHub and you can contribute
 and talk to us in person.  You 
can join the weekly hangout.  
You can ping us on Twitter.  We 
are really active.  You can come
 to stack overflow or write our 
mailing list if that's your 
thing.  The mailing list address
 is on the GitHub URL. 
   Final thing is just to point 
you to all of the other AMP 
talks we have, tomorrow morning 
if you are really early you can 
catch the AMP ads t alk.  Eight 
roof that really exciting talk 
about AMP and PWAs and then 
finally Friday stage 6, 3:30 
talk of building beautiful AMP 
pages for eCommerce and beyond. 
   Just recapping things we have
 talked about AMP having really 
great momentum in both 
publishing and platforms.  We 
call it open for business so if 
you are in eCommerce, please 
start building AMP pages.  If 
you are looking at building a 
PWA, AMP might be a first great 
step towards PWA and we are 
hoping for AMP ads to fix 
advertising on the W eb.  Thank 
you very much.  We are going to 
hang out in the app  AMP S 
andbox.  Hope to see you there. 
 Thank you very much.
   (Applause).
