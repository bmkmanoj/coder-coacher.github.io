code you need to put something of you
make it personal and I think that it
gives you the same power of an inventor
I am in a tiny percentage of people in
the world that can literally work from
anywhere and I experienced an amazing
new freedom our dream was to be amazing
an inspiring game company party was the
first game that we created all in-house
to five people just making the game for
us this experience was very important I
kind of realized if I was gonna make
mobile games the only way I was gonna do
it was start my own studio and that's a
founder you only have yourself to blame
which I find pretty liberating
I saw a couple of friends during their
companies and I'm super competitive so I
decided to leave my career as a
scientist and become an entrepreneur and
I decided to go for the biggest hobby
sportfishing
Fishman is a social network so anglers
globally can log their catches they can
share the catches sort of brag about
their catches it feels great to be back
and stalk him again because you can
actually develop something here that is
HUGE globally growing up I always wanted
to be a medical doctor but when I got to
high school I noticed that to innovate
in a medical space you need like 30
years of experience but with mobile
technology I can innovate and actually
generate change in people's lives a lot
faster give their mom is a social
enterprise to improve maternal infant
health maternal mortality infant
mortality is a worldwide problem one of
our objectives is like not only to
concentrate the camera at spread this
concept to other developing countries
we've noticed that 70% of smartphone
user across Africa are on Android and
once we leave which on these two have a
huge number of users the beginning was
really an adventure but when we built up
and started testing it was really
exciting because the reaction of those
who are using it up one of them were
shocked it makes me really proud and
it's also like motivation to keep moving
forward yeah each time a woman in this
rural area just loads the application
and we see popping up gift and mom it's
like this justice joy man and you're
like I'm going to go do better
I grew up in a small town called dirt
Chile and then I understood that
education is the way to grow so I
started learning English lingual EO is a
next level for interactive language
learning worldwide the first time I saw
somebody using the app it was in the
Moscow tube and it was real excitement
because when you start understanding
that there are like millions of people
who got their English better because of
the app then you understand that it's
actually changed the world to be
when I was a child I was really inspired
by the combination of gaming and
building things I'm a lawyer and worked
together with my brother who was a
dentist when we were kids both of us
were really attached to gaming my
brother was a little bit better that I
could beat him because I was the one who
was able to hack the top lists and so on
so I was kind of cheating a little bit
that was kind of the beginning of my
gaming Hurriyet we follow together a
company and when we started the company
it was a big step we grew out of the
garage of her parents house and really
professionalized the company getting all
the best people gathered in one place
and trying to make a better and a better
game the vision for us is becoming one
of the world's leading gaming companies
I go grab breath over 80% hearing last I
hadn't bought me from doing so many
things in my life Bingham entrepreneur
allows me to have this sense of freedom
and doing what I want and I knew that I
could do something about accessibility
in telecommunication to deaf people
watch of us is an app that allows deaf
people to make phone calls those people
in Canada trying to help out those
people and Kuwait there's somebody in
Japan these people have never met but
they're reaching out to me and they're
like I need this app and they go onto
the Google page tour the download and
the try that then the email me on the
right this is amazing
you walk in a new place that's three
times the size of the office room now
but you can't imagine filling it a year
and a half ago I remember walking into
this office here and Soho Square and
feeling the same way it's both an
exhilarating feeling to realize that
we've made it so far and also it was so
fun to go the Winston Churchill quote I
guess would be it for a free or at the
end of the beginning
when we started working at 200 installs
a day today we have over 200 thousands
of installs a date it's been an
incredible journey for us growing from
five people to 30 people some small
offices to bigger improving the team and
bringing more amazing people this is
something really exciting and we can't
wait to bring more amazing games to our
community into the world
around over we have a mantra we like to
say go big and go home we don't think
you should be sacrificing your family
in order to make some wealth or create
value or change the world
what good is it to have all of those
things if you don't have a family then
sharing that success with I think a
smart line choice actually the products
of man Fredonia more exported in the
world success for me is doing what you
want with your life for me is living in
my city with my parents where my
girlfriend can be happy and I can do it
by being a developer
