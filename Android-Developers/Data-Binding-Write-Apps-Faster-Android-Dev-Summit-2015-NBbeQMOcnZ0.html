toolkit team and I'm here to talk to you
about Android data binding before we
started this I thought some random
Android developer out there for some
help in this talk and I'd like to
introduce you to I'm sorry what was your
name around no one two three random want
you three wise you come up here I I
stole I don't really don't mind I had
some friends in the essay I you know
looked at your laptop and put it up here
on the screen you guys don't tell anyone
Michael all right ah so I love Android I
love that little green robot but as I do
over some parts real is terrible like
I'm writing so much called Church it's
like why is this like this why all this
like old stupid code here yeah I don't
need that I can do my view body on error
like this product image set that set
this set is like why did I study
computer science for this I don't think
so yeah that's what I think
we gotta have something better better
than that right we have something in the
box I do let's talk about Android
databinding okay bling did you see yet
all right all right let's look at your
code in a little bit detail I see this
set product you are using calling from
oncreate right that's just okay let's
get rid of it we don't want that instead
let's look at this on create let's
instead just bind your layout to this
binding code and then set the product on
there and let the binding take care of
all the work hmm sound good a little
better let's see how about that I'm
Scott alright let's look at your layout
wow you have a lot of lip sees nearly up
man what's up with that
alright so to make sure that we
understand that it's a data binding
layout first we add this layout tag to
the outside and then we get this
variable the the prod variable that we
set in the
in the uncreate right and then we can
use that proverb 'el anywhere in our
layout so instead of this ID we can now
access that pod lay a pod variable so
for example in the source it's a it's an
image drawable so we can access it
directly the prod name the product name
it's a string and same with the
description there is a bug door oh there
you go you set a price price Oh dancer
Krish ah shoot all right well our price
is well if you look at the code there it
was a it's a resource right and our
resource is coming as a string and it's
doing a format we should do better in
our expression right I expect I think so
all right so one good thing is that now
we can access our layout our expression
stuff directly in our layout so we can
have this access to the string resource
right there and pass a parameter we're
passing the product price as a parameter
in our resource no layout pretty cool
huh okay so but in my application things
are not always static George I'm cool
with your demo but I have this
application where sometimes I hear a
different layout right like yes there
you go it might be all say like how do I
do this I need to write more code to do
this well my wine wine wine you want
everything that you well
we allow you to inside your layout to
have some little dynamism in there you
can have an expression that says if
you're on sale then show this on sale
side and if you're on sale you might
also have a different color for your
your yeah your example is not very
realistic because my price changes
they're dynamic websites so I do dynamic
pricing how long you handle that well
you have to at least tell us when it
changes so let's look at your product
your product has a you know a price name
and an image you just extend the base
observable class and then we mark the
things that you can change that are
going to change as bindable and then you
have to tell us when it changes so we
have this notified property change and
the findable part but like my closest
extended base because I can't extend
your class
there's nothing come on alright alright
alright fine
we can use an observable interface
instead is that it better maybe this
yeah I think the weight will give you a
little bit of help here well give you
this uh
property change registry so you can just
tell us when that happens okay alright
little better yeah that's good
alright that's so and that easier yeah
this is a little easier huh but it'd be
nice if we could just have properties
that are themselves observable in it
wouldn't be yeah okay here you can
access them as if it was just the same
with the same expression you know you
just say your prod damage and even
though it - not a drawable itself we
pretend that it's a drawable it's an
observable field and it's in servable
double double for price how to use a
double the price no you shouldn't be
using double for your prices alright or
if you have more blobby data like let's
imagine you're coming from JSON and
you're still doing development
everything's up in the air you don't
know what you're what's gonna be like
you can use a map and that's pretty nice
for prototyping no seems interesting
about multiple layouts multiple layouts
well yeah I guess you have you have two
different you have different varieties
into empty snow yeah I hope not boy that
would be a pain wouldn't it I have
multiple like in one you're setting
apart the other one you're setting apart
listed and it's really a pain you don't
want to have to do if it's on the let on
landscape do this and if you're in
portrait beside so instead what we do is
we merge all of your variables and we
produce one that has the summation of
all the variables that you need and the
binding will just say oh I only need
these what variables and I'll use those
in my layout the rest of them I'll just
not use it all you just set it and
forget it it's great just like Ronco
right yeah that seems good seems good
talk talk about the ball sights boy is
more
all right you don't need to do any more
fine view by ID right because now you
all your expressions are right there in
your layout file yeah well I'd run
animations and they also put them into
Data whining Oh seems weird yeah well
okay you can still get you still need to
find you already buddy
if you have a layout with a tag of you
with the tag and ID in it then what we
do is we automatically extract that view
and stick it as a public static the
public final field in your binding so
you can access it directly from the
binding this sounds good you really
don't need five you by D I don't drive
both good yeah that stuff is a pain
isn't it also we have these automatic
properties for example here is this
drawer layout right and there's this
really nice setter sets cream color
wouldn't it be nice to be able to just
just tag it so you can just set it right
there in your layout file but there's no
attribute
there's no accent for that well we could
just kind of sneak in and say Oh set
scrim color that looks a lot like scrim
color right just a set right in front of
it so we just look at it so we let scrim
color and we just say oh I don't I think
we just say okay if you have this thing
with a data binding expression in it
then we will look for the set center
with it well that takes the same type of
parameter so in this case the color
scrim is an inch so we say oh set scrim
color we know exactly what it is it's
just automatic for you you don't have to
create this new attribute for yourself
and everyone's favorite on click right
pretty awesome yeah sure but you frames
so we have this as well we can do on
click with expressions very nice but um
how does work we also have well I think
we'll talk about that a little bit we
also this uh if you we have all the
other event handlers too like on long
click or on item select whatever all
those things on text changed on text
change is a real interesting one right
because it's a text watcher and there
are three
handlers on there you can just set one
of them two of them three of them
whatever you want it's pretty nice
how much would you pay how much what's
important for miss you would pay for
this twenty percent of course not okay
ten percent Oh baby
yeah all right how about nothing whoa no
way
no no what what you like silence hey it
might not be nothing depending on how
optimal your code is but it's pretty
good it's pretty good uh so I want to
bring up my co-conspirator in this uh
let me introduce you to eat boy are Hey
everyday I meet from the UI toolkit team
work on data mining with Church and I'm
going to go into some details on how it
actually works so as your show before
the layouts are little different now you
have a layout take in the route this
tells us this is a data binding layout
and we put pass it into the layout
grinder which processes your layouts and
then expose a new layer that the older
Android versions can understand which
doesn't have the layout take anymore we
move the namespaces to your first child
and it also has some sub products from
the processing it creates a class it
creates all these like public final
fields for your wheels with IDs and it
creates the setters for your variables
so you can to detail this is what
actually is happening we move that
namespace to your first child get it off
the layout tag and this is done while
their application is compiled by Gradle
and then we remove your expressions add
some text there so we can find those
weaves afterwards and if you had an ID
we would keep it there and also create
the wheel as you can see there directly
matching this public file you don't need
to cast anymore because we know what
type it is at compile time which so we
just create a variable with that type
okay so how do how do we do this so one
important aspect of data binding is that
almost everything is done at
compile-time so when we see an
expression like this we while your Java
code is being compiled we go check ok
this product we know what type it is
because you told us now I say ok product
ID image product is a image field or an
image Gator we will look for these
things fight that and then ok here we
found this there's a drawable returning
get image method then we check ok I have
a drawable there's a source attribute
can I set this trouble to this source
attribute and a we call set sorcerer the
cool part is we don't need any
reflection to any do any of these things
because we do it at compile time so at
run time is equal to the code that you
would write yourself hey wait a second I
thought all data binding frameworks
needed reflection don't they not the new
one not this one
oh these are nice so for example but
this is not that true right that example
was simple so you can say oh my variable
set it as text correct us
straightforward
it says the user that image the source
icon set source which has said before
which does not exist this is a problem
because the imagery doesn't have a set
source method it has a source attribute
but it's a set image drawable method
where you can pass a drawable
how does data winding know about this
it's done by annotation so we have this
binding method annotation which where
you can say ok this a binding annotation
for a type class image view they tree
with the source and the method is called
set image trouble so that we know that
attribute source Maps the set of
miserable if the pass parameters match
we can use that method to run the
binding again this is done in the
compile time what we generate is the
same code that you will do it set in
which drawable a hotty metalder so these
are little three chemicals
unfortunately Java this Java 7 didn't
have any function parameters you can do
them so the way this works is again we
know that there is a binding method that
says on click matches set
onclicklistener
and we look at ok what does the set
onclicklistener expects or expects a
weave that onclicklistener this
interfacer great and an interface a
Swampert mom method that will look for
that that handler that clicked matches
that one method the Gandhian details we
saw this and then we saw this okay nice
that the handler click method receives a
view and this matches so we create the
interface for you so the Java is happy
and then we are going to like tunnel
those calls to our handlers you can see
everything is matching it just works
oops to fill my Thunder here alright
binding it up let's talk about binding
adapter spiny adapters are probably the
coolest part about data binding so let's
talk about something a little bit more
complicated than set text right we
accept text with a nice automatic
variable you can just set text it takes
in a string or actually test takes in a
char sequence but it's pretty close
let's talk about something more
interesting we have to say an image view
but we have a large URL like a large
data large image data coming down and if
we do this what's going to happen right
we don't want this on the UI thread it's
going to load everything on the UI
thread that that's pretty lousy I don't
like that why not
so instead I'm going to use a tool how
about Picasso right or glide what's your
favorite alright in this example the
whoever was about this expression try to
use Picasso but my goodness
Casso with contest London that that's a
heck of an expression and to what you
know that's sad and that that's that's
why you're like special language right I
don't like this is just to that we don't
want to see that in our expressions
anyway so let's do something a little
simpler instead what we're going to do
is create a binding adapter and we're
going to use the the Android source
we're gonna override what the default
behavior is with our binding adapter and
instead of doing the normal stuff we're
gonna try to do some special so what
we're going to do is set this binding
adapter of course this is an attribute
an annotation on our static method here
and it could be any static method
anywhere and we're just going to look
for that static method but the the
attribute the annotation and here we're
going to look for something that is an
image view and it takes in a string as a
parameter
okay and now what we can do is do
anything we want in that class so we
have this nice Picasso we can view the
context from the view we can load it
load the image in there and it can be
done all off the UI thread and it's all
kind of magic now I can do image source
is equal to some value it's great but
what if you want to do something more
interesting let's imagine you want to do
have a placeholder for your annotation
now you have to do this with Picasso in
the same call right you can't just say
you know in one call call the load and
the other one you do so what we're going
to do is we're going to merge it all
together into one binding adapter this
one takes two kind of attributes and
they can work together and it just you
just take the parameters in the order
that you've assigned them in the
annotation and now you can do whatever
you want in the method and this case
we're going to load the URL off thread
and in the meantime we'll load this
placeholder image now sometimes you want
to have some kind of instance
information in your adapter and before
we were using static methods right but
what happens if you want to use an
instance all right there's a static
method it's easy we know what to do we
can call it directly just my class dot
static method call very simple to do and
you're the generated binding class that
we don't have how do you get the
instance so yeah I mean we strap take
out the static what happens where is the
instance come from we have to do some
kind of instance so what we're going to
do is the binding framework is going to
look and see oh this is an instance
binding adapter we need to generate this
method on this class this data binding
component class and this method is going
to be called get whatever the name of
your your adapter method adapter classes
and now it's your job your job to
implement this method implement this
class so you move to this class and then
you call set default component on it now
there's also ones if you want to load a
specific implementation for a specific
binding if you want but most of the time
you probably want just a default
component that you're going to load and
then you can then we know exactly what
instance we're going to load for your
for your binding adapter very nice now
you can also do this with components now
when you're doing with the component if
you have some kind of state you want to
get imagine this is a cache for your
images right so you want to you know
load the image from your cache first and
then possibly load it off thread in this
case you know we need to go what that
instance is where we're going to pass it
as a static method use of stack method
but we want to have some kind of
instance that we're going to share
around to all the different binding
adapters so in this case we need to know
what that static that state is so in
this case you implement your data
binding component but you add your own
method to it okay so when you have your
own method to it we don't know anything
about this method this is something that
you know about but we're going to pass
it to you as the first parameter if
you'd like now you can do whatever you
want so we have our own cache here that
we can load our our data from I still
have talked a little about best
practices okay yeah look let's go
through some existing practice makes
perfect practice practice well internals
xrx that's it's a great song example so
why so data winding allows you to write
some expressions in the example that
means I can just send the web service
call from my exam aright why not there's
a click listener there's an API why
should not I do this you should not do
this if you do this like your
application will break this is not based
on what data bindings or later I need is
to put data into your UI from your model
so instead of doing that have a callback
like every presenter whether whatever
model you prefer and just all the call
to that so the Java where you do the
real thing don't try to do like business
logic through your exam is not going to
work but another example a good way is
that
I'll change this drawable based on the
user's hr1 just reacted in that case is
fine like it's just what the eye sees is
a super simple expression based okay
because he's an advantage when you put
this when I look at this you guys okay I
know that if the age is dis this UI
shows this trouble otherwise the other
one is very clear it makes my example
better my code cleaner so that's okay so
you decide it for yourself well if you
did something like this whether they
just small I do something otherwise I
redacted like I don't understand what
this code is doing when I look at it
then there's a problem like it doesn't
make sense
instead of doing it there's something
more simpler like if the age is is to
display name otherwise related and the
display name comes from your model if if
your object doesn't really have that
field which doesn't in this case you
create a V model that provides that
information or you can make the variable
for your binding layouts I think he took
that from my code I'm sorry it's not
very good yeah he got they don't groan
hey you can also do like so if your real
model can dispatch you and swim in this
example we make this display name by
Nobel where in return data winding is
going to generate this BR class
similar to the art class but for
bindable things and when the users last
names said you can displace that it has
change and data winding will keep the UI
up to date
this is very like if your so if you
value objects and you're directly
showing them in your UI that's okay to
set them as variables in your layout and
then said to me your generated binding
class but if that's not the case if you
need more information consider using a V
model while you put this information
there and you can just use these
observable convenience fields we provide
in your view models you just set them
and data mining makes sure of that they
are visible on the UI by the observables
are not like those convenience also root
causes we provide they're nice if they
are very few if you try to make your
value objects with those things you're
just using out of memory for no reason
don't do that
they're they're nice if you remodel or
you can have them in your activity if
there is something you have to easily
control so there's an another example
where you write a mere model extending
the base observable cost because you
don't want to use those coin it causes
the same example here when you'd mend
the data changes you notify and then
data writing takes care of this or you
can implement the observable interface
now we provide this program to change
registry class which allows you to
dispatch events all you have to do is
just not I property change through that
cost and let me add then remove
callbacks to just send those calls to
this class and it will take care of it
the other part is like did this is a
video for example I know many people is
been asking for this font attribute in
taxi that we never did there's some
reasons for that you can ask the rate
and someone Lisa I don't know she's here
she's created this thing where I can set
my fonts in example I wanna do that is
much cleaner and this became very
popular I like this example because like
the good thing about this example is it
makes your example very clean you look
at it you understand what's trying to
the and there's no edit performance cost
all of these things so you write a
binding adapter they says I know how to
set a font on a textview
it's all well defined and in this code
you get the font load the top face as
set it on the textview if this was a
real application you would probably cash
it so that you don't keep reloading the
font beautiful okay a good example is
the image adapters I'm using another
image loader here glides and where I
could say this adapter knows how to set
a photo URL and might have a default but
they are not required so that if there's
only a photo URL set on that wheel we
will still color adapter the other value
will see a default value which is if it
is an object will be null so integer
will be 0 and like all the default
values you can imagine this way I can
write just one adapter that can
handle multiple attribute groups and if
design instance methods you can just
create the sub component that in plus
the data whining component and just
returns your image adapter this is very
nice for testing so that while the test
is running you can basically set the
default or do nothing because norm was
the core network during a test unless
you are testing network so I have this
mock version here that I inject during
my test and it just does nothing uses
the default Rolo and that does nothing
so this works along with the dependency
injection very well actually you can
just say inject image adapter create
this app component and for example if
you're using beggar too this will take
care after as you don't need to do
anything else and this is a dagger to
implementation where we always say I
mean we create the model for the stuff
and we say we implement this and then
they go generates the rest of the codes
assuming that your providers and thank
you okay
we were super fast so we have time for
lots of questions there are two
microphones left all right
please use them test questions
hi so my question is about so when you
use data mining it's not always obvious
what's happening in the UX editor if you
understand what I mean so we would be
nice to have to be able to provide like
a default product or something to mock
so I can see what a UX looks like in in
the editor as well yeah that was one of
the first things that we talked about
when we were talking to the Android
studio team and they were really excited
about data binding but you know they're
working on as you saw in the last talk
they were working on some pretty
exciting things right now and so they're
going to get to it but they're not there
yet I can tell the cold collation is
coming it's very close so that's the
good news for data mining and this one
of the things you should do thank you
thank you
is it possible to inflate view stop
according to that data binding
he said inflate new stuff we have you
stop this tab oh yes yeah so views tab
there's a special implementation for
viewstub because you stub is a as you
saw we have final classes the final
fields so we have a views Doug proxy
final field for that because viewstub
actually replaces itself with a view so
we can't do a replacement for a final
field right so we have a few sub proxy
and you can get either the view stub or
the or the replaced view with it
depending on its status okay and it's it
is possible to pass data model to like
underlying clay out yeah yes you so when
you create it you use the same
expression as if you are passing an
attribute and if there's a binding for
that cause we know to create the binding
for that class and pass that variable as
the variable changes cool thank you
hello
current design tab inside Android studio
sometimes doesn't render layout
correctly yes sometime there is just
black screen or something like this I'm
going to improve this and will it work
with data bound binding also so we are
we're constantly improving the
Android studio layout editor so that's
going to get better and better over time
absolutely okay thank you I I was
wondering you showed the image loading
examples yes how would you go about
canceling the loads when you're you are
torn down somewhere you you have the
bindings so you can mullet so for
example you create the binding like how
what what are you trying to Castle is
the let's say you were trying to load
user image URL and then they which are
I'll disappear tor now I mean like in
Picasa you can pass attack and then
cancel every loads on those tags for
example when your fragment goes away or
something like that you could be I mean
one option will be passing that tag as
well to the binding adapter now you can
castle through Picasa or if there is
some variable in your model that can
control that then again the binding
adapter can handle the castling okay
that's no really a callback for tearing
down you compress a callback variable if
you want for for the real staring down
no there is no I mean you know when the
view is going away through the Android
view life cycle and there are callback
methods that you can assign to this
binding class you can even say hey like
stop don't rewind I know the data and
the data changes generated binding class
calls your Kovach I'm about to rewrite
and then you can say no don't stop
boundary bind and you say that you are
responsible to tell it to remind
whenever you want which is very useful
for if you are using in this side the
recycler view it's like it gets really
upset if you update the views themselves
directly so if you're writing a cycle
view adapter you say not don't change
and then transit through the recycler
views like item change for okay I think
that else is my questions on hey hey God
decide yeah hey what's the best way to
debug the expressions that are in the
view markup because it's it's logic
effectively so if there's a bug how do
you do bug it how do you step through it
well they well you can't step through
the code this code the source code that
we generate is actually visible to you
it's it's generated and you can step
through it if you need to oh it's a
little it's a little bit on the uglier
side because it's generated code but you
can't step through it okay but you
should try to limit like how what your
expressions look like now we have some
things that are make it a lot easier for
you so that you'll have fewer bugs for
example we have an old coalescent
operator which i don't know if you guys
those of you use other languages or know
what this is but essentially it says if
the first part is null then do this use
the second part and we also
automatically do null checks eye on your
expressions so if any part of it is null
then the resultant value is the default
value so if you call set text on user
dot name then if user is null then the
whole expression is known so it's not it
you'll see fewer bugs from that and you
know you should like like in the best
practices you should limit your
expressions so they're not too
complicated yeah I would agree yeah
hello so what are you doing data using
data binding with recycle views actually
the documentation says that we should
after getting the view passing the view
to the view holder and get the banking
clause we should use as the Kunik
execute pending bendings
I want to know exactly what is it like
because I try to use on ListView and
didn't it didn't call that matter and
work fine it will work fine but it will
so data mining as the variables change
we don't instantly go and update the
wheels what data binding does is we we
just keep track of them and wait until
the next animation frame happens this
helps us to run less expressions becomes
more efficient plus you can change your
data on any thread you don't need to be
on the main thread while changing your
data and data mining will take care of
moving it to the main thread
now the way this works is you wait until
the next animation frame from a recycler
lease perspective or for delivery what
it does is it calls your own mine method
and it expects the wheel to be updated
when that method returns so if there is
any textview that you should have set
the text one that happens otherwise the
view won't be measured properly the
first layout will be wrong the next
animation frame recycle they
the whining will update that view that's
going to cause another layout which will
correct itself so it will look like it
worked fine but you actually did two
layers for no reason sorry by calling
execute pending bindings you
synchronously like sync all the wheels
with your model so that data winding is
not going to look at the layout and the
list you will recycle view we run the
proper layout calculations so the last
one when you're importing variables such
as Android the view class the base view
class use an expression at least I want
to know if on the new Android studio we
actually have error fix because if you
try to do that expression of setting
visibility they actually show you an
error even after compiling so I want to
know if that fixed so I understood you
said for compiling I shouldn't show you
errors for it I thought sure no others
so so a very detailed problem but we
while passing your expressions you use
outlet we say like Grammer parcel is
very popular and but that that model
doesn't work on IntelliJ so IntelliJ
suggests using another parcel called
flex J flex so sometimes these grammars
don't match properly so if you have a
bug just report the time we will try to
fix it we are working on some other
solution that wants to use out there
person inside IntelliJ but it's like
fundamental different models so it's not
very trivial but we are working on
making it more reliable cool all right
