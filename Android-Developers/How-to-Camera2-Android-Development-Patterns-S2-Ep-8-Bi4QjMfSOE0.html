are we actually supposed to capture all
this great content without amazing
camera support in your apps I'm David
East and the camera to API is for
building the best in the business
camera apps let's take a step back and
look at the history of the camera API
options on Android the simplest option
for taking photos or video has always
been the camera intent basically you
kick off this intent and the user gets
to use their preferred camera apps take
a picture while it's easy to use isn't
that really for heavyweight camera apps
the camera intent is for apps where the
camera is more of an accessory rather
than the main feature and that doesn't
help us show fluffy eating flapjacks so
we need a better API the camera API
provided a lot more control than the
camera intent with a camera API you
could build a camera view however you
wanted in the camera API was great but
as photos progressed there were
definitely some things that was missing
like no support for capturing
uncompressed images and performance on
newer Hardware where the preview rate
was capped at like 1 to 3 frames a
second clearly our cats deserve a better
API and that API is camera to the camera
a camera to API is the newest biggest
and baddest camera API on the block it
provides you with an awesome full manual
control over your device's cameras and
it fixes all the problems we had with
our old API you can take images at
faster intervals show previews from
multiple cameras and even apply effects
and filters to it directly however
before you get hacking on your new
camera app there are a few things that
you should know just because the camera
to API is overflowing with awesome
features it doesn't mean that all of
your users devices will support them as
such you need to know what each device
is capable of doing and you can do that
by getting a list of the camera
characteristics specific to that device
these characteristics can be simple
things like which way the lens is facing
or something even more complex like the
available face detection modes and if
your app can't function without those
features you can require that the user
must have it in order to download your
app just set the uses feature in your
manifest file it's also important to
know that the camera to API was
introduced in Android L in order to
support older apps you're going to have
to fall back to the
API and there's no support for the
camera to API in the Android support
library just yet but if you bug this guy
enough it might make it there just a bit
faster the camera to API gives you a lot
of responsibility over your devices
cameras but with great responsibility
comes great power I think that's how it
goes to learn about the camera to API
check out the API reference and if you
want to see it in action there's a
sample app on github that captures RAW
images if your app uses the camera get
the best camera experience using camera
2 and just keep building better apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
