inspiring game company parking was the
first game that we created all in-house
five people just making the game for us
this experience was very important
Myanmar met when we were in seventh
grade and since then we were best
friends both loved playing games the
starter journey when we were 21 when the
other founders it was really exciting to
touch people through our games Pirate
King is a very simple game and very fun
you spin the wheel and then you can
attack your friends and other friends
from other islands you can also steal
money from them when this was
effectively engagement we wanted to
bring the single-player and the
multiplayer experience and to bond them
together to create this mingle player
experience it's a unique experience that
we haven't seen from you on mobile
pirating started when we had 200
installs a day it was very small
we saw the growth starting in Israel and
then it started to grow in US and Europe
and then Asia today we have over 200
thousands of installs a day
we have over 18 millions of users play
Pirate King over 60% of our Android
Android revenue represents 50% of our
total revenue which is amazing for us it
would be super natural to go into new
markets and build our strategy on the
Android growth and platform our
experience with developing parkings for
Android is a very positive with
iterations the time to upload the the
production is run with the shortest of
one or all of the platforms that we
support debugging is really great in
general we just love the platform one of
the main tools that we used to collect
and analyze data is a Google bigquery we
actually receive around 3 billion events
per month one of the times that we found
out in really important information from
analytics but was that we found out 40%
drop in users on a specific step but
once we actually looked at the dot part
in the code we found out that we had a
bug and we fix it and raise it back to
90% it's a must you have to have
analytics my main tip to people who want
to develop cross-platform game or
application is to develop to Android
first because of the quick iterations
because of how easy it is to build how
fast you can deploy to production and
all that combined it is just the best to
the platform that we had the experience
to deploy to production in such large
scale
it's been an incredible journey for us
from small offices to bigger growing
from five people to 30 people this is
something really exciting and we can't
wait to bring more amazing games for
community into the world
