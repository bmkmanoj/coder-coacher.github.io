and welcome to the Friday games review
i'm your host dan galpin and myth with
me once again is Ian knee Lewis filling
in for Coke am that's right KO's got
very important work to do so she's
leaving us to drink beer and play games
without her and speaking of games there
are five on today's list our crashtastic
physics puzzler spider feeder that's
right I'd have to click the button oh
yeah deceptively simple Domino x4
subliminally races sorting game metro
rush unfortunately named match 3 game
boutique west and space ball and
speaking of beer I think it's definitely
time to open some up absolutely wow that
was great so we're we're experimenting
with having a scripted opening which um
for most of our shows has worked really
really well but this time two issues
first I finished writing the script at
302 yeah and second dan sitting here
like a jerk holding the button where I
can't see it and eyes aren't even going
what's going on exactly back up because
I have things to say speaking a beard ah
ok so today's beer is uh green flash
brewing companies double stout black ale
excellent excellent yeah by the way I
can't go back to that slide because one
of the one of the one of the really cool
things if you have to slide auto go
forward you can't ever go back to it
ever again with the clicker you have to
you know when yeah it totally prevents
you from doing it it sucks yeah exactly
alright so yeah I definitely need us
right definitely need this beer today ed
we were going to spend thousands of
dollars on teleprompter equipment yeah
but then we were like why don't just use
keynote we've got a mac
keno keno DS a little bit of work by its
one beta tester I still think nice right
dan fam we were going to blame beer on
him but he says he didn't buy it all
right actually don't know who did all
right stealing someone's beer absolutely
wearing green flash shirt but not bring
that beer in although I will vouch for
it is a great double stout yeah well i
definitely liked their IPA which I think
was called palate wrecker the grill
neighbor an IPA so you'll notice we're
broadcasting today in space yes exactly
um let us know what you think about this
because they're been haters yeah I'll
tell you we we put this black background
up because we thought it looked you know
kind of boss yeah well look it looks
really really good when you guys have
the lab coats actually I like it is
that's right that and by the way and the
reason I'm wearing this hoodie is
partially just so I can contrast a
little bit more against the black
background you know we put up a massive
massive hair light just to catch the
highlight justic do yeah the highlights
off my skull that's always good we have
a common already obi-wan droid obi-wan
droid nice all right well alright so
when I have producer day but engineer
Dan's gonna be watching the comment
stream because we're too lazy to make
him do very much work in fact today is
the end of the quarter for us we've been
working on performance reviews which for
me means putting it off and Dan Galpin
means once again writing a great review
for me the attempt in the attempt yet
again mm-hmm to get me promoted as I am
the Susan Lucci Android development you
know the it was it was mostly that that
we have all of our reviews are due at
exactly 11 59 and 59 seconds last night
and I was there until 11 59 59 seconds
still making comments so and then I was
filing bugs after that so it's been it's
been a long night and so it was a great
time to go we were very excited about
getting to this crop of games because I
really needed some distraction from all
of this and I'm hungover
hi let's go ahead take a look at our
first game oh wait we can't know the
first game is booty quest we can I know
I Hadron yeah these are the orders
that's right yeah in the script I just
put him in the order that their names
were funniest yeah that's go ahead and
take a look at I can't believe you put
boutique West first all right well you
know it it was talk like a pirate week
last week so and booty class size to
change guys can't hear the audio because
the audio for booty quest we can we can
bring this up now the audio for for
booty quest is actually kind of epic it
really does have lots of great pirate
stuff in it and the and I and I love
their listing page this is actually a
really really good way of doing a
listing page you know they have the
texts of great size it's very very
readable you know immediately this is
gonna be a match for jewel game it's got
its got some great characters in it my
only my only you know looking at at the
at the actual listing my only thing I
would want them to change be the icon
because I see no reason to have a giant
rounded corner thing when you've got
this really cool bird character that you
could totally have pop and in fact out
of the only game the only icon i really
liked out of all the games with
spaceball we can continue to go on this
though alright so let's get to the
actual booty quest why is it's a metro
rush wait will stay in booty quest ah
better okay are you on the next oh I
screwed this up totally alright and we
to one other problem we have to actually
plug the tablet in so let's let's look
yes we do because the tablets not what
I've been that's why it's too I know I
know there's two inputs but we're not
actually making taking advantage of that
so seriously why did I spend all the
money on that I know I know hey I just
see the screen awards saw we do we
totally do all right let's let's plug
this in and let's actually get in come
on let's actually get into booty quest
if it's like all right we're tuning out
right now these guys are jokesters man
actually knowing our audience this is
probably when everybody's gonna tune
absolutely they were like they were like
oh this is so cool these guys alright so
I'm a couple things to note here on
booty Questers fault there's some really
nice effects the game has got actually a
really great graphics and when we are
playing it in hdmi mode we've got this
giant green line on the
right hand side of the screen which is
really kind of sad are you serious
that's not us that's no no that's
actually that's actually the game itself
nice so you know everyone really on
Android you have to always make sure
that that your game really does need to
do something reasonable when you're at
1.33 aspect ratio all the way up to 1.77
yeah you know it's like and also you
can't just look at the size that's
coming back from the display because you
actually have to look at the size of the
screen you're given and sometimes this
may actually be that problem that's a
really common thing to go on with games
is people say hey let's put pull the
size of the display let's ignore the
view that I'm actually given assume that
i'm working for full screen and i'm just
going to get the whole thing you just
can't off you with all week you can't do
that you're not always going to get the
full screen especially on these tablets
although we did actually make a change
the original honeycomb tablets would
actually give you the full screen size
and that screwed everybody up wait wait
so and so in order to make things
slightly easier we do only give you the
window now that you're going to render
in but you know if you're plugged in
HDMI you're still not going to get all
of that all right so now let's go renew
a engineer Daniel who's waving his arms
frantic Oh is he cuz I know we could
hear your dad um where audio is
completely cutting off I'm actually just
interested in trying some of that beer
uh hahaha it is it is really good is it
boy did I need it directly I know by the
way we're gonna do a short show today um
because to these games crash and four of
them suck so that's not sure I wouldn't
I wouldn't go that far actually only one
of them crashes on both devices one of
them actually only runs on the phone we
are gonna switch the phone just to be
nice and show that when you see why Dan
gets promoted and I don't wait does it
say things like your game sighs um I
love you Dan mostly I love you a great
reviews that's good um yeah and I'm
sorry it says metal rush this really
isn't metro rush this really is called
the game is fun I mean honestly I like
match for games there are better match 3
game the Magister sorry match three
games we called it under why I refer to
it a match for game it's it's it's a
jewel matching game it's got it's really
really well done the animations and
transitions are smooth there's some
special things going on there's
explosive gems you know the thing is
this category
so full are so many Joel matching games
on Android the usually great example of
a jewel matching it is yeah there are a
lot of them well know what let's take it
on its own terms absolutely i like the
the animation is great i love that it's
got a little bit of reactive physics mom
when things get removed you know feels
like they're kind of blowing up and you
know when they fall down there getting
you know there's there's definitely some
math going on here i love that yeah
it'll so professional absolutely the
game is just really really fluid and it
is really actually fun to blow things up
with the gems you know it so you know
definitely my hats off in terms of game
i always say the only thing is in terms
of depth there are some super super deep
matching games out there with all sorts
of different scenarios that are really
complicated and you know there's even
like like one of the ones we actually
looked here which was rise Atlantis
actually takes you through this epic
quest as you go through the you know
with all sorts of different side things
going on so you know this is a really
really full category but you know this
game is very good I mean I see no reason
why why it wouldn't be a candidate for
being featured it does it does
reasonable things in terms of the
handling of the back key one of the
things that um but not everywhere like
for example not here but one of the does
not actually do is it does not correctly
target up multiple display so we still
have the compatibility zoom button
available it's not targeting a new SDK
version so we still have the menu
showing up and we're still having we're
still having like jni compatibility
stuff thrown in so there's a lot of
there's a couple things I liked in the
change I'd also like to make sure that
they're actually correctly targeting the
screen yep great stuff so let's go ahead
and talk about metro rush so yeah mr.
rush I found it interesting you know at
first I couldn't actually figure it out
yeah and then when I did figure it out i
found it a little bit disturbing yeah
the fact that you're sorting different
colored people in two different colored
cars yeah yeah it's kind of yours
regular mode that's good i don't know
south will rise again mode I don't so we
get this get this train yeah and you'll
notice the train has a very small little
green things
now yeah we got to sort all of the green
Oh reen into the car yeah um and you
know I think it's supposed to represent
the route that they're going on but it
just so happens it as you're playing at
all the green people look a lot alike
now we're an hour or any orange people
yeah and they all have a different race
um I don't know why that's the a bead
you know this is oh there we are we do
we have to be to have to be was where
I'm sure yeah yeah but it is sort of
interesting it puzzled it the orange
guys are like Irish I think I'm see you
know I think you're right uh yeah
exactly so you know a lot of it mean one
thing about this couple things about
this game one is it yeah definitely need
sort of an intro to be like what am I
doing here it is kind of weird if you
missed the train they just kind of stand
on top of the train which I kind of
liked yeah but it's a little buggy yeah
and let's face it this uh this mechanic
has done been done before it's been done
better witness I call up the my favorite
thing is this at the bottom like that
like like the five guys that are all
like I like standing a half each other
the bottom of screen but yes it is a
little buggy the other you remember that
bathroom game where you know they had
the person men women there was like dogs
and there's Android yes that was a good
sorting game this game you know I mean
maybe if you're 3 mm well the other and
I'll say some other things to note I'm
you can see that there's a real real
problem with this particular screen size
and resolution you can see the richest
retry button and the quit button really
squashed and this actually goes to be
happy we have you brought to be fair
this isn't an easy resolution it's not a
common resolution in common aspect ratio
yeah it's it's it's just the resolution
used by every single android tablet out
there oh no no this isn't yeah yeah this
would this one hdmi excuse me yeah but
even outside of HD my motors still squat
well what I yeah so what I'm saying
though is that yeah in um you know the
particular aspect ratio that we're
looking at is extremely squashed because
we're an HDMI mode but it's a little bit
weird but let me point one thing out
here okay sorry go on so this is this is
actually their listing and the listing
also has a completely squashed in
different aspect ratio from the actual
my
really is that you know as I mean phones
are getting longer yeah Oh aspect ratios
change you know there is no device on
the market that I'm aware of that that
will guarantee always being the same
forever yes with Android the nice thing
is that at least we've you know thought
about that and gone through the pain so
that you can okay we have a new rule
right at no static slides for more than
five seconds so let's go back but I did
wanted to show that because it was sort
of it was sort of in right yeah and I
didn't want to actually mention that
that that this is also not a
particularly good listing page like you
know it doesn't know it's not although
but it is representative of the game at
least which is good there's a lot of
listings that aren't but anyway to be
fair what I guess what I was trying to
say is we you know android gives you the
tools to deal with these aspect ratio
changes especially when you're doing
vector graphics there really shouldn't
be any reason to to make these mistakes
yeah yeah I think it now I've said my
piece yeah no that's good and dan I'm
gonna shut up now I have a really
important question from someone in the
YouTube oh yes oh yes yes important the
question is how can you play with beer
how can we not play with beer yeah I
didn't got that too hard or that sets up
a you tried this game haha don't do it
in a dry county that's all I'm saying
alright well I think that pretty much
says it all yeah there's I mean there's
there's some good ideas here it
definitely needs to feel more fluid you
know my basic feeling my Masek complaint
with this game is it is actually and I
think part of it is the aspect ratio
like I think it is having trouble
dealing with touches and with handling
the characters on this particular screen
um you know it also just you know when
you're doing a sorting game like this
yeah now and I'll tell you what the main
problem is with the mechanics please
let's talk about the things they did
right right okay I did vector graphics
of vector graphics look really what
really good so those turned out well
yeah they did their higher I think
they're high res illustrator graphics
that have been rendered neither knock I
don't think they're actually vector here
I think they've just been rendered
two-bit mouse but yes you know the the
basic game idea there's nothing wrong
with it I would say that the interaction
is a little difficult a sorting game
like this you probably want to have a
little bit of momentum physics whoo-hoo
so that it doesn't turn into you a
laborious dragging game well enter your
fighting the interface more than your
and and that was going to say it's on a
phone it's also bad because you don't to
drag as far but when you soon as you get
to a tablet if you don't actually have
the physics built into it then you
really are just be like oh I'm dragging
this thing across the screen well yes
how many times dan made this same
mistake do you leave let go just a
fraction of a second too early mmm and
instead of getting in and giving you
points dude just you know you hit a bug
basically closely I just like yeah sits
on top of the Train looking weird um
it's really great media leaks often runs
them all over by the way which it does
do but you know there's no there's no
like running over yeah I guess yeah yeah
okay kind of fun yeah anyway I this is
some great programming no question about
it is this it's not finished yes not a
finished game yeah it needs more work
all right let's move on alright so our
next title in all of this and ones go
back toward this this is this is this
was this was the fun one for us this is
a game that we actually were unable to
get to run in any way I see how much I
wanted to play this game yeah we were
excited were like well actually looking
at the listing we weren't particularly
excited no I'm really Stewart away their
video look good okay okay I looking at
the listing I wasn't sure you can see
that that if you had this on a device
you would never be able to read the text
it's just it's just it's and I can't
read it from here which is well I can
read the title barely you know the and
part of the problem to you is that they
haven't differentiated the title on the
tagline like if you look at let's say a
movie poster the title is big the
tagline is small it's a good tagline
yeah as taglines go by der is hungry you
have to feel you have to feed hey uh but
instead there it's like spider feeder
the spider hungry you have to feed it it
doesn't look like a listing it looks
like a meme yeah yeah so this game
failed to load because it couldn't
actually get a class that it needed
which caused
main class 22 not load so you know all
we're gonna have is it green scan i want
to show i will show you what happened
well i will launch it here and you'll
get unfortunately spider feeder is
stopped josh is very sad class was it
unfortunately it's the you know when you
have a class that is from the main
activity class it prevents the main
activity class from loading but you
can't see what it is because it because
because you just say oh the main
activity class failed to load because
one of the things that's depending on
wasn't there so you should be able to
see um in the there's there's like the
really long listing and you get down to
the bottom it should you it depends on
it depends on where it's trying where it
crashes unfortunately i miss trace it
yeah i did not ask trace it so this this
was just I just used lying prone on it
yeah you probably wouldn't gotten much
out of it with s Teresa unfortunately
it's might say yeah this is all this is
all deck stuff so that's trace would
just let me know it was trying to load a
file asterix is really cool though if
you're trying to debug native stuff it's
actually really really useful to know
where which call your app made that
cause seems to crash so you know
definitely thumbs up a nest race we
actually made a nice update to it to
that tool in the last in the last six
months so you haven't used it recently
thought oh oh yeah yeah we're we're very
close to being able to install jelly
bean on our little transformer prime
here which is very exciting and I'm
hoping to work because that'll be fun
but you want to do it right before the
show just in case something went wrong
by how could that have yeah I exactly
are you really surprised the ad be
shocking um so the next appt we're gonna
actually look at its domino x4 and this
is actually this game is a really
beautiful i right is this a deceptively
simple game it is actually i just seemed
like i didn't i hadn't even played the
game and just you know i was ready to
script from like dominoes I bet it's
deceptively simple yeah this is actually
it's actually really fun um it's it's a
puzzle game at the time based game
here's what the listing looks like which
is actually pretty good it's pretty
representative of the game you see we
actually get some nice because it's got
green on it we're getting them some
green screen showing through with our
with our little presentation ears yeah
you can see us behind there and I would
still like the text to be slightly
larger and you know what I just that fun
I've never liked you know for this kind
of thing but you know it's fun
yeah but now it's you know that's it's
everyone's taste however we actually get
to the game itself and I'll launch it
here on the tablet and you'll see why
this game we're actually going to switch
to the phone first of all menu looks
fine I mean not exciting the text you
can see is kind of small that's because
we're any wedding up and the so is the
Domino and that's because we're on an
mdpi device and and on you know these
things just look huge on an mdpi device
when you're actually looking at at how
do I make my appt scale for the tablet
sometimes it makes sense to actually
select a different resource type and you
can actually do that so that's what's
one thought here and we actually go to
new game and you can see wow it is
deceptively simple ok it's this is um
it's just not playable no this is
awesome oh my god best game or best game
ever um how do I play it what do we what
do we do to rotate the dominoes um and
as you can see God unfortunately it's
like a Nyquist game unfortunately the oh
yeah this Domino doesn't just affect
itself it affects dots in other Domino's
as well so unfortunately we're seeing
here is that the the matrix that's being
used to scale the bitmap is just not
correct for this screen size and
resolution and so we're just we're
seeing the dots they're actually all
over overlapping each other and in a
game is not cool it's not playable but
because we are trying to make sure that
you guys can actually see that how the
game is played we're now going to switch
from the tablet view you will see us
lose this momentarily to our trusty
Galaxy Nexus all right yes as well we
have this great like on-screen animation
everything looks really smooth yeah
that's a result of you picking up a
court off the floor yeah I'm plugging it
in and antenna tech high tech I know I
Daniels hard work so here is here is
Domino week and here's what it looks
like now there is there are some
rendering problems even a Galaxy Nexus
you can see that it's cut off i'm not
sure why this is actually the case
because it doesn't actually happen but
it happened at this point I don't even
what I'm looking at yeah so what's
actually going on here is you're seeing
a couple of rendering problems it's
worse with the hdmi in because you're
getting a slightly different screen size
there as well if you actually get it
full screen it's less cut off but as you
can see at least we can see the game to
play it so we can rotate the Dominos so
that though that's so that they line up
and the goal is to get blocks of bricks
of dominoes that line up together this
is actually really hard to play with
hdmi because I can't see that how many
dominoes are omni how many dots are
actually on each Domino um I'm not sure
honestly I I have to look at that their
layout um you know if I had a little
more time I would have actually tried to
pull apart their layout and see why it's
wrong I don't lean against that God how
many times I have to tell you so soft
though we've got a soft velvet
background this thing looks black but
it's actually black and squishy soon as
i got my glow-in-the-dark paint oh this
baby eyes yeah actually I'd like you to
backlight that'd be kind of cool to do
black light how do you rockin yeah we
should totally do that do like Halloween
episode yeah since we're about to be
swamped with zombie games that it's true
what made zombies a thing why are
zombies such a big deal I you know I
think it was the zombie head that that
that popcap created for plants vs
zombies I really didn't like that I
guess they spend like 3 grand making
this zombie head it becomes this viral
video I mean it that it's like that in
Ganjam style you know like that's like
what we're gonna see it Halloween so
it's safe to assume that neither of you
guys have a zombie kit prepared at home
right I do actually I was on be kidding
okay take just in case a zombie invasion
I'm Ron totally sad but it's a bit of a
shotgun goodies make it for zombie so no
matter for communist no an earthquake's
actually but I it's earthquake / zombie
invasion now mmm my parents had a
communist kid that's not an impatient
came the commie invasion all right so
let's let's switch back to the tablet I
just wanted to show that actually when
it without hdmi it was much much more
playable so I'm kind of sad you guys
can't see the game because it's actually
really really fun you're actually
matching different tetra Manos together
with the dominoes and so it's actually
it's actually a very very clever game so
yeah when you ask the lovely
respond yeah it's totally the lemmings
fun oh I heard the name it I think it's
Cooper not scooper Cooper's though is
the other plate at some it'll come to me
I usually have a plan it's not copper
plate nobody's it's Cooper black that's
right it's not compromise its ghost
Cooper black that's what it is yes ha
doesn't that might sound like a whiskey
it totally should be a could be like
what you'd be great to make a cooper
black whiskey if it actually had the
font on the on the front all right so
we're going to go to our final game
which faces spaceball unlike the rest of
these we had no idea how to make a joke
out of this name we're playing with
balls man oh come on all right this one
actually is our only landscape game yeah
mr. pham all right high five to our
engineer man that says he's been kicking
some serious booty going to we've got
some real problems here we've got like a
much more professional setup and yet
we're not professional at all what
happened to the producer Kim yeah
where's the pretty sure can did you put
over there I actually we ought to plug
to him I disconnected it so we could
have a both tablet and phone available
yeah we don't we do that we actually so
we have all these cameras but we don't
have a power strip that we actually have
the extras a lot of that action is a
socket for it so we could plug both into
the same time I think I don't think the
fire marshal would be too happy with our
electronics setup see that there's a
power strip on the floor of this and
nothing plugged into it or that it's
actually true there's there several in
this room okay it's completely safe
Anton has a power strip over there that
could probably handle like any Gloria
that thing is amazing as like that is
seriously kicked but it's meant to it's
meant to power soldering irons and heat
guns and we have it here for powering
laptops and phones right all right so
spaceball first of all I want to say
well it's not spaceballs it's baseball
it's space ball right licensed property
yes just in case you're curious this is
even though it looks exactly the font
seems like and actually it feels very
cartoony very much like the movie this
has nothing to do with the movie unless
you told
can you thinking about Spaceballs I
think you think about mba AGM so so
there's a serious problem here though I
mean look at this it's a you're not
going to be I'm now this actually are
our new studio setup is really useful
for this because we are actually about
10 to 12 feet away from a very very
small monitor showing this and in terms
of like art radians it's about the same
size as what it would be on a phone yeah
I was like I cannot make heads or tails
out of this it looks like booj moon next
to the character and and the thing is
that the really it would be fine at that
size if there was more contrast but
right now with the amount of contrast
there is between it's baseball logo in
the back it's actually very very
difficult to read remember the weirder
your font the lower your contrast the
bigger it needs to be in order to be
legible yeah and it's such a great logo
I would really like to see that you know
i'd like to see just a little bit more
contrast between the the text and the
background other than that great this
icon by the way wins the icon award of
the week as i said hell yeah this is
what an Android icon should look like
other game developers take note right
seriously oh yeah move on so we can see
your yeah other game developers take
note there we are yeah otherwise he's
gonna mess you up look at him yeah in a
hood that's why he's got a hoodie
absolutely with with with the antenna
haunted can we both do yeah yeah
actually kind of fits for this game um
so uh you know this game skill oh yeah
I'm that dude from Assassin's Creed now
oh you totally are man you're from the
future um let me call take a year and
this isn't even your Assassin's Creed
hoodie you act no it's not i do have an
assassin's creed IV is not nearly as
good for playing assassins creed ii yeah
exactly okay spaceball so um so
spaceball is a shooting game and it's
actually kind of a shooting gallery
basketball game which is really cool you
sound so disappointed it's a shooting
it's a shoe it's a basketball shooting
game like but you know it's well done
it's actually it's actually really
different i like the little animations
it's not a lot of not a lot of friends
animation but they're there your goat
you at your goal
to line up the shot into the bath got to
be kidding me oh my god and you get
points for getting like runs you don't
want to get them into those things as
you lose your ball you in now I'm
screwed because I lost my ball and of
highly advanced cultures responsible for
this I totally screwed that up so then
you have to drop the ball and now I've
dropped it far away from him so I'm
screwed as far as i know i can't get it
bad yeah I can't get it back what dude
can't like walk over and just get it I
don't thinks maybe you can't I never
figured out how lazy are you little
purple dude I know why I was trying to
follow did you to tilt oh you tell him
okay there we are actually again totally
flummoxed by an accelerometer yeah I
know I know not to mention have we lost
we lost hdmi by the way where we have
the i've decided i hate micro HDMI with
a passion I hope we never put in
products but you realize that consumer
connectors are not meant for this stuff
I know I know I know okay that makes the
game way more fun I was like trying to
figure out I'm sitting you're playing
with us on the desk being like this game
seems really not very dynamic um so
that's something that I'm not gonna say
that that your typical but still no I
know it's always nice to add a little
bit of discoverability ah died I
stickball that was cool this stuck ball
gave me a basket so anyways I actually
became is really fun I would like to the
accelerometer mechanic to be a little
bit easier found and I actually don't
think this game needs an accelerometer a
solid games that have accelerometer
where they don't really need one drive
me nuts it's a general rule now that
maybe there is a way to change the
controls maybe I can go back and if
there's a way to say i mean i think you
can make the argument that you know you
need one hand for shooting and you're
gonna be there but the problem is too is
if you actually know this is i'm gonna
rant for a second here's a problem when
you're doing accelerometer stuff mhm
that takes a hand he takes at least one
hand and it feels better with two hands
yeah now at the same time let's say that
you need to touch the screen in a in its
specific place yes impossible you know
why because you're tilting the device
all over the place do you see how hard
I'm trying well it def it definitely
makes it way we're emitting on a tablet
this game cuz it's one
thing cuz could be that it's one thing
when you have a mechanic where there's a
couple buttons on the side of the screen
that you can get with your thumb while
you're you know twisting it around
mm-hmm but if you have to move your
device and do any kind of precision
touching that's going to be frustrating
for most of your users later what kind
of device they have yeah and the other
thing is in general accelerometer games
on tablets you know have to be really
really carefully thought through so that
would be my only my only comment is if
you're gonna do one you know first of
all it's better have it it's better have
multiple control options anyways we've
already shown that you know that if you
give people the options to have
different controllers they'll love you
if you don't oh man I totally want to
get that tree or even work simplify your
control I mean do you really have to
control the way this guy runs if any
obvious where he's gonna run to maybe
you should think about making this yeah
make a little make making a mode where
he just goes and grabs it although it is
a nice to TNT tonight yeah lavo mm-hmm
that was bad um case the but I love the
different game modes in the game I
actually really like that the game is is
totally cool in the way it plays I
actually would like to see it not use an
accelerometer because it is a change the
control screaming the graphics are nice
the animations nice it's got you know a
fun mechanic it's not super deep but
it's interesting yeah I want to see
higher res graphics admittedly like this
is kind of game I can imagine you know
taking the bar I just like make some
bets over just kind of happy and you
know trash talking with my friends man i
bet you can't make this many baskets or
whatever and yeah no it's totally quiet
till i want it i would love to see kind
of a social there is social stuff built
into the game but you know there i'm
sure it can be taken further actually I
don't need a social stuff built into the
game mm-hmm because I have friends we
just have I'm lying it oh that's a hey
come on and we're two yeah I mean uh it
does have gree built into it I don't
actually know if it enables any social
modes because I didn't cuz it cuz when I
see these things i'm like i don't like
fun so so anyways yeah but spaceball i
would like to i definitely like to see
some higher risk graphics it does look
really blocky
tablet and on a phone it's okay but
otherwise the game does really well and
actually it actually for the most part
you know yields to our guidelines except
except here we're hitting back you use
your guideline yeah yeah that's way of
hurting it submits to our guidelines it
becomes our something i Ken it does I
media meeting meeting that you know as
an Android user you're mostly not going
to be an order that now this is totally
annoying come on gree make the back he
actually do something useful in your app
seriously like look at this the only
time I've seen the game crash right
inside agrees stuff what is up with that
you know that's a perennial problem and
let's just remind everyone that although
middleware gets things wrong all the
time it's your problem if you put
middleware in your game and it screws
something up and you don't get featured
because of that don't write to us and
say oh but it's my middleware can't I
get a free pass no you can't yeah my
know where is the one that's grabbing
everyone's phone numbers and saving them
in an evil database so that overlords
can contact you by SMS no man it's your
middle it's still your fault you know
that's like I'm sorry exactly I and the
truth is our hands are kind of tied
right we can't take your middleware out
that's your decisions to take it out or
put a minute put it in yeah sorry I
respects it with a kind of style I but a
long week off you if you choose to put
in middleware that doesn't work or that
does something wrong that's just as bad
as putting a you know programming a bug
into your game alright so let's go ahead
and take a look at our live stream
engineer dan what are the people saying
out there um we've got a bunch of
different comments but we do have a
question from Owen okay um so Owens
asking can you guys try to explain how
to scale some of the art using matrices
for different screen resolutions so
there's a couple ways of doing it i mean
you if you if you're a view based game
you can actually use in canvas no no
diff your view based game like if you if
you are one in which you're actually
using custom views you can use image
view you can use a matrix associated
with that you can actually we actually
it's kind of
nice we would give you a matrix that
actually had that has multiple different
kinds of transformations and we actually
give you a bunch of functions to allow
you to create the matrix without
understanding the matrix map right kind
of three by three matrix and if you
don't understand the matrix math you'll
never meet be able to debug it yes
that's true uh and functions don't
always work the way you think they
should and the moralists story is learn
math yeah and actually if you go to ian
has a really really great code sample
that he did which is part of Android you
which is his custom view code sample
which actually goes through using matrix
math to do a bunch of transformations
including you know including rotation
scaling right that is yeah that's
somewhat true um yeah shut it down a lot
because people said oh um you know maybe
it's a little too hard yeah maybe you
shouldn't expect people to know math I
think that was I think I think that yeah
that might um yeah yeah it had a much
better example too much more so much
more mad yeah but the important thing
remember that a 3 by 3 matrix
encapsulate I pretty much the ne ne
mapping between the two by two spaces
right so for an XY coordinate system you
know 3 by 3 matrix you can do
translation rotation scaling skewing
perspective etc mm-hmm and building that
matrix is something that our functions
will do for you mm-hmm but concatenated
multiple matrices together also
something that will do but you need to
understand how the math works in order
to make sure that you're doing it in the
right order matrix multiplication unlike
most other types of multiplication is
non-commutative which can really trip
people up I witness the incorrect math
that was actually in our open GL GL
sample yes exactly which was a tricky
one because there was not only bad math
but there was a memory overwrite that we
didn't catch we made it look like it was
good math yes certain conditions yeah it
actually it actually looked like it was
doing something reasonable which is
always dangerous low question ever yeah
tow and i have to say by the way
Joe and I both wrote responses and his
was like oh yeah it's wrong I'll fix it
and mine is like well here's how it's
wrong here's the fix blah blah blah blah
but he mentioned that he was the guy
that wrote the sample so his got
accepted no way about that Matt is that
my stack overflow reputation isn't
exactly the best in the world you could
always go exactly an easy he's the man
come on look at you both he fixed the
math the main thing is that yeah you're
applying a scale matrix to to your bit
mats in order to fit them into a
specific place but it seemed like you
know either the scaling was wrong or it
was being applied in the wrong order
because as you're rotating things they
were being scaled way out beyond the
bounds of where we thought they should
be so the e I know if that helps answer
your question yeah I mean I not then
sign on to office hours on Wednesday you
can ask us live my general my end yet
one more thing I like to add is it is it
it's really important since the matrix
can do all those transformations use the
matrix for all of them don't try to say
well I'm going to put this thing in a
surfaceview and I'm going to try to set
a scale factor somewhere else oh yeah
yeah since they'll I rely on the matrix
to do everything one it's really fast
and an end to it actually will make your
code a lot simpler well you got to
remember to what's going on here right i
mean the software line the matrix I feel
like I'm in a movie or something like
that yeah I know so the thing is I
remember that you know obviously for
software rendering this doesn't matter
but for Hardware rendering anything
that's done using the matrix will be
done by the GPU I'm sure there are some
exceptions that but that's a general
rule whereas if you do something without
using the matrix it's a bit of a
crapshoot you don't know if you're going
to get it or not now there are some
things you need to be careful of for
instance let's say that you draw a path
and then scale it using the matrix and
will be very fast the quality will be
low because we draw GPUs aren't very
good at drawing past so we draw the path
in software and then
scale it up or scale it down which means
one of my favorite things to do in the
old system which was to always draw
paths in a one by one box and then scale
it to whatever did no bad that would be
a sad thing yeah but for things that are
already running a bit maps text
especially things that can be scaled and
rotated by the hardware you know make
sure that you do that of course it's a
little bit more complicated than just
using the canvas matrices you also have
to make sure that you're in a layer and
my my class on doing custom controls in
so Android developer android com /
training anything yeah that was right
anyway i have a class on on doing custom
controls and it explains how to draw
something to a layer so that you can
very quickly rotate it and get buttery
smooth graphics even though the
operation that you're doing is kind of
bad and the other guys who should look
at his class actually are the guys who
did the metro rush game because his game
while his his gait is a custom control
actually talks about physics and he
actually has some very very nice
flinging physics in that and i think
that would help the game out immensely
and you can actually use the built-in
physics model you get with our gesture
detector to to do a lot of that so and
the other people who should look at my
class is everybody haha come on it's
generally new Tesla Model S sorry me way
to get him promote it it's very
important uh-uh all right anything else
on the live stream other than so I mean
fans like hey there's some comments oh
and here's something I'm actually gonna
retail yeah here's what we can actually
read read on the air right I'm not
exactly sure if you guys answered owns
question yet
he posted it a little bit of a reaction
poorly yes yes so let's say I play I
blame the stout so specifically he says
uh yeah we don't know exactly what they
did wrong in the Domino games bro come
on even he's saying I say you design
your vector art in 480 x 800 res now you
want to have support for a large screen
HTTP I phone say like 1200 x 600
resolution mm-hmm he's looking for that
technical d fit details on how to scale
that i'm not sure if you guys aggressive
that in years okay so kind of two
different things I'm you know if your
vector art you're importing it as a bit
nap okay we imported yeah that's one
really important thing are you are you
doing it as vector or you know you think
easy said bitmap so that's who's going
to author that yeah so in general is AG
yeah so in general if you can't actually
display vector art in your game then
what we generally recommend is exporting
a relatively high quality version of it
and putting it in a higher density to
start with that helps the phones like
the Galaxy Nexus that are xhdpi because
you'll end up with getting getting high
resolution artwork on there now the
bigger questions had why how do i do the
same thing on a tablet there's a couple
of different ways of doing that one way
you can do things and this is this is
fairly straightforward is you can
actually you can actually throw the
artwork into a node and into an ODP I
folder and you can just try to select
you can just try to select a scale
factor that makes sense don't rely on
the system to scale it at all you can
also for lower you right into one other
problem on the very low-end devices with
with memory because you're going to be
loading in potentially a lot much larger
set of bitmaps and it's designed to take
which is parched part of the reason why
we do all the DPI based loading that we
do we haven't you want to try and load
whatever is close enough to your dpi as
closest to your dpi as possible and
that's the system's can take care of
that then what so here's let me try and
break down yeah well we're talking about
matrices right has dan says matrix at
any time he wants to sound smart so
here's what we're going to do all you're
going to do is scale this stuff but the
important thing is
there's really two ways to scale a
bitmap in android you can use a draw
bitmap and give it a destination rekt
that's different from your source
wrecked and that will do scaling or you
can draw it to a canvas at its original
rectangle and apply a scale matrix to
the entire canvas and the problem comes
when you mix them okay so when you mix
the two techniques now well no because
of applying the scale matrix to the
canvas is applying at each drawing
operator yes it's not apples here so
what we were suggesting is that you pick
the canvas size that you feel is native
so whatever your you had in mind now
remember this isn't going to take care
of aspect ratio alright it's going to
take care of size and for aspect ratio
you need to make some other you need to
make some other decisions um you may
want to do a little bit of letter bother
you move some some of your your UI
elements out further something like that
and the other thing it's a little tricky
is on a tablet so to normally what
android does if you haven't you know and
let's say an xhdpi resource right you
try to load it onto a tablet which is an
mdpi device you know androids
automatically to go put and it's going
to squish that down and it's going to
make an mdpi size because its goal is
it's trying to root to retain the
physical size of that bitmap which for a
lot of actual non-game UI is very nice
because what you really want on a tablet
often is just to display more
information however there's a balance so
what you can do is a couple of things
one is you can actually say you know
what I'm on an extra large device let's
not use the DPI that it's built into it
you can actually say I'm on al extra
large screen device i'm going to take
use i'm going to make use of higher
resolution assets and you can actually
set that until the resource loader
actually go load me the next level up
the other thing you can do is if you're
if you're going to do that a lot you can
simply store your resources in an ODP I
folder and then do some calculations
yourself to determine how to scale
because actually if you look at what's
going on inside of the resource loader
all of its doing is it's telling the
bitmap factory to scale now one thing
that's kind of nice you can also do if
you want to do it a little bit more
optimally is that there's actually
new ways in which unloading you can
scale bitmaps right well but the thing
is i think when we were talking about
the dominoes and this is this is why i
was going yeah I a matrix direction
where they mean I think I feel like
we're sort of diverging into 200 stories
he was right the problem was not that I
know when I'm sure he was loading the
wrong resource but it felt like the real
problem was he was drawing the dominoes
with with one set of scale factors
anyway yes draw dots with the others
that's right exactly and the other thing
is that the dot the dominoes over Brian
there we've got that we've got the DPI
saying we got the matrix thing let's
separate those and finish one of those
okay talk about the DB I think so yeah
so for so for DPI you know you've got
kind of two problems that are fighting
each other you want to make sure that
you make video memory still work on
devices that have limited video memory
so you do kind of so where it makes
sense to do what is going on with the
standard transformations it does make
sense to use them or to simply apply
similar ones yourself the second thing
is that you really want to make sure
that on a tablet if you want to display
things bigger that you do select larger
size larger resolution assets and and
you know the easiest thing to do is
simply to enumerate the kind of assets
you have and select the right one that's
what a lot of a lot of game developers
do try to reliably the API thing too if
you're in the deep AI folders you can
basically work in dibs right you don't
have to work in actual pics that's
correct you can you can do all of your
layouts and dips the only problem with
that is that obviously this thing has a
much larger amount of dips and so and so
you're going to actually want have
different resources people don't want to
have like hdpi / extra large resources
that's actually the correct way of
having different scaled resources is to
actually have separate bitmaps that are
for tablets for hdpi and for phones for
hdpi and you know that that just gets
kind of messy so so you know there you
know in this case became a keep the
image really small in order to keep
things relatively simple you'll probably
want to do a little bit of math just to
make sure you get the right size images
with the highest quality available for
these MDB I tablets right so let's move
on to that then yes the way you could do
it if you're especially if you're
thinking in dips right so the tips are
sort of supposed to be related to
physical units yes um so they are
actually right well yes they're related
um yes they're not I know you're not
excited
so the trick here is that a four-inch
phone and a 10-inch tablet may actually
have the same number of pixels but a
different number of dips so I think what
we're suggesting is that you might want
to go ahead and decide on a sort of
native set native dimensions and dips
and then either expand or contract by
setting a scale factor now how do you
set that scale factor well you do it in
the matrix of your canvas and you make
sure that in for all of the elements
that are supposed to be occupying the
same physical space in your game board
that matrix needs to be the same and the
domino game is probably using one matrix
for drawing the triangles yeah and using
another matrix for drawing the dots and
that's where they're running into
problems I think so I think that's
exactly what's going I think actually
it's probably drawing the triangles as
based just purely on what's coming on
the screen it's probably loading it's
probably loading the bitmap images and
making assumptions about the size of
them and then trying to scale about
scale those that's my that's my guess we
see even saw in galaxy nexus with that
device with that game that even going to
hdmi and plugging that in made the game
unplayable so there's probably some
calculations going on that are based on
the display size rather than on the
viewport size that's given as well so
it's probably probably a number of
different issues you have to really make
sure that when the system tells you no
rescale your viewport you really have to
go and redo those calculations yeah
that's very important as well so you
have to remember that you're going to be
on a multitude of different devices and
this is actually where 3d games have a
real advantage because 3d games are sort
of used to having to do viewport
mappings are you napping from your 3d
World into I what we call clip space but
2d games a lot of times haven't had to
deal with that unless you're coming from
a background of games that were actually
written to be resized on let's say a
desktop PC yeah and there's no reason
why a game like dominoes shouldn't be
you know resizable and scalable and
there's a lot of ways to to attack that
so I think I think that's maybe that
helps a little bit on you know again the
only doesn't if not you know drop
something on stack overflow
and you know get to energy plus and yeah
well tightly do the work you need it
need some more reps so you know yeah
hill-hill hill-hill be there and so do I
actually but anything else on the end of
your down yeah so this is the last
question one of our users wants to know
if we have any guidelines on dealing
with performance variety between devices
because the filtering only handles GPU
and screen size that is a billion dollar
so so so yeah there's there actually is
it doesn't really handle GPU it handles
OpenGL ES version and at hand and and it
doesn't really more about it handles
texture from it is a sort of proxy for
GPU but not a very good one so today
there's kind of two things there's two
low-hanging fruit that you can use one
is of course you can say whether or not
you're actually using OpenGL ES to check
that the second thing you can make sure
that you're actually you know filtering
and OpenGL es2 the second thing you can
do is to make sure is is if it's kind of
this is sort of a bad option for a lot
of games but if you're only using dalvik
but the vast majority of performance
bound games are actually using ndk so
make sure to only build an arm v7 a
binary and or mips and tell bionaire
like don't don't target arm v5 you'll
eliminate a lot of low-end devices that
way all right so now you're but now
you're in the issue of I've got this
super super super high-performance title
that I know can only target the top 10%
of devices galaxy s3's galaxy s 2 s yeah
and if you're in that position there is
nothing you can do other than to go
through and eliminate those devices
based upon archive how'd it go let's
talk a little bit about why why this is
an issue okay remember that I Android
isn't isn't unique in this I mean like
you know in the desktop space is
actually pretty normal mm-hmm but
android does have actually a couple more
GPU vendors than what you'd find in the
general desktops basically and we often
get the question like well why don't we
just publish some statistics like you
know what's the fill rate now there's
some problems their first everybody lies
hi and those who aren't lying are only
not lying because there
it's something else okay so you can talk
about Phil right and you can talk about
polygon throughput you can talk about
raw vertex shader you can talk about
memory bandwidth but the truth is on a
GPU all of these things add up into
something that's even only partially the
picture because you also have not only
do you have different bandwidths and
different fill rates and different GM
you know arithmetic unit designs you
also have completely different
architectures so the main ones being
either tiled or well immediate mode and
there and there's actually two things
there's tiled deferred mode and there's
a medium which is sort of a yeah and so
so so basically the question the
question you have to ask yourself is you
know one how many devices it's so passed
up an opportunity well the question you
have to ask yourself is do you feel
lucky punk exactly do you so how many
devices do you really want to hit you
know you know to today you know I think
I think you're going to want to hit a
pretty large cross-section of devices
but you might be limited because of
memory you might be limited because of
just raw GPU power today on google play
if you're really limited by those things
and I you know might and my advice to
everyone just try to target as broad as
possible you know you're going to if
you're running a 3d game you're going to
you're going to have a mitt map with
different versions of a texture for
things that are in the distance
typically um take advantage of that use
different mipmap levels I'm gonna use my
tip biased you know that um you know if
I was I don't think there's anybody
that's too that's terrible at vertex
performance yeah so you can think in
terms of you know you you want to have a
certain number of vertices and you can
cut off you know like this year's or
last year's devices I don't actually
think there's even been that much
progress in this but yeah fill rate wise
mm-hm um you know what's the right thing
to do well Dan's got a good idea if
you're if you're bound by input um you
know doing doing a MIT bias would
definitely reduce the amount of memory
the GPU is consumed in it that too that
doesn't reduce the amount the GP
producing that's correct where you would
introduce your frame buffer so so the
second thing you can do you know if
you're really targeting and we know a
lot of developers don't do this and I
think it's partially cuz I don't know
it's kind of hidden but one thing that
you as a developer can do if you're
using OpenGL is you can actually set the
size of your viewport in our windowing
system so not even in OpenGL we actually
offer this sort of hidden API which is
inside of surface holder called set
fixed size and if you do that it'll
actually automatically scale your
viewport up to the size of your window
so it's actually very very useful
literally and that's done inside of
surface flinger and it may even be done
with a hardware composer so it may so
for a lot of reasons we definitely
recommend doing that especially you know
if your choices are rendering to a pixel
buffer or actually rendering to using
this you should definitely use this
you're going to get more performance a
lot of times when things are really just
heavily fill limited that's what you
should do obviously there's shader
effects there's other things you can do
but my you know my general advice on
Android is try to make the scalable try
not to cut off you know users if you
absolutely can avoid it you want as many
users as possible to see your game give
yourself some knobs so that you can make
adjustments don't necessarily expose us
to the users but you know well one of my
favorite games that does this is dead
trigger you know I mean like dead
trigger has a slider and a lot of with a
lot of a lot of GPUs it'll detect and
it'll say you're guaranteed to work at
the lowest quality only but you can
slide it over and you can save and turn
on effects and you can see what happens
and sometimes it may just crash the game
you know when you when you actually try
to run the game with everything turned
on but at least the user knows I turned
on those effects it's crashing that's
not good for every developer some
developers like I'd ever want users to
ever see my child will crash I much
prefer being given the option of saying
let's try turning it up and seeing what
happens and they do and they do a whole
bunch of techniques they actually don't
even use resolution in that in that
slider there they're simply turning off
effects they're there they're changing
to almost all turning off exactly well
remember the things that are and texture
texture idea changing right have texture
fetches are going to be
be a big deal on many GPS especially
many many Tyler's state changes are
going to be a big deal on forward
renderers a tegra is the best example of
this your geometry sorting is going to
be a big deal want to take advantage of
Z early Z rejection on Tegra it's
absolutely critical the number of gains
we look at that that the draw in the
reverse order and end up getting really
slow performance venue you know you let
people like wow this game is amazing a
nexus 7 they look at the next game they
say well this isn't very good and the
reason why often is the developer hasn't
taken the time to design there's kind of
two things design art work and also make
sure that they're doing draw order that
allows for Earl easy to really take best
advantage of the hardware now remember
that all of the GPU manufacturers want
games to look great on their particular
chipset and they all have armies of
people that want to help games look
better on that tip sets so if you're
having specific problems contact invidia
contact Qualcomm contact imagination
technologies I get some help detect arm
yeah yeah contact arm not any of these
and and you know get some help because a
lot of times it's just a matter of you
know rewriting a shader or changing your
draw order around and don't forget that
all of them have really great tools yeah
for investigating what your draw calls
are doing I mean / 5 the adrenal
profiler the PVR trace all these guy all
these tools are really really helpful
and the best part for me the exciting
part is that a lot of them now work on
non rooted devices so you can even you
know your consumer devices you can plug
them right in perf ID works that way
drenal profiler works that way PVR tune
is slowly getting there I mean the thing
with with PVR is it you'll run into
weird goofy performance bugs with PVR
like you know things that you just don't
expect because it's because it does all
of these crazy optimizations for you and
you do one thing that trips it up and
says oh crap i have to react to render
everything now and all the time you
wouldn't limit that to pee
no no everyone does that but but p but
PVR because it does so many
optimizations you may be shocked that
one little operation you dot you do
causes things to suddenly slowed down by
orders of magnitude right right is it
well you know remember wind-up knight
and they fell over the performance cliff
on exactly on our Molly because that was
a driver bug in that particular case
where know what's gonna happen where on
these are different absolutely we're
larval BB OS which normally held
performance actually hurt them so yeah
absolutely so there are some general
best practices but if you really really
want to push the envelope then you need
to actually purchase some of these units
talk to the manufacturers and tuned for
each type of GPU but remember there's
not that many there's the Tegra series
the Adreno the arm Mali and the PVR yeah
and enter a couple others but we don't
you know there's not yeah those those
are the ones that have volume I mean you
certainly even also in term of gaming in
terms of gaming but I mean certainly you
can go and grab you know broadcom
devices the galaxy y uses that you can
grab a Raspberry Pi if you want to play
with with the broadcom device and and
then there's also some devices that are
now using the Marvel which is evolved
the Levante accelerator the new co-star
from Vizio uses that so there are you
know there are a few but again the vast
majority of your phones and tablets are
out there we love all of our devices
here at Android but there are a few that
are made for gaming and some that aren't
so yeah the top four you really need to
look at the others you know it depends
on how broad you want your audience to
be yeah absolutely and you know again if
we're talking about bleeding edge
performance ultimately you might end up
being a being in a position where you're
actually going to have to target the
game individually to different different
devices we really like to avoid that you
know my general my general guideline is
do as much as you can to try to make
sure the game is playable in some form
so all right well we are coming up on an
hour now yeah and I think we are just
about done and engineer dan wants to get
back to his life yeah and we're out of
beer you so oh crap gonna call it a day
mm-hmm yes it was great having you with
us thanks very much for tuning
in we will be back next week we are
playing with the form out of this show
because we started out as a review show
we want to introduce some games we
hadn't seen before and now we kind of
feel like maybe we'd rather do a little
bit more engineering it's always been a
developer focus show and we're thinking
maybe we'd like to do a deep dive on
some games I have performance problems
or design problems so let us know what
you'd like to think of course you can
always contact us on the Android
developers Google+ page or if you want
to send us a personal message on G+ to
we may actually see that ya never know
absolutely it happens and I with that
let's say let's go ahead and have little
android play a set yeah and definitely
continue to nominate application
students saying you know you and you can
even say look this application would be
just awesome if you're performed better
that's great we'll take a look at it
we'll try to figure out why it doesn't
perform faster so you know again you
know let us know what you want to do
well you want to see this is your show
no it is it's kind of your show now yeah
it's it is there's a but there's a
moderator page continue to nominate
things you want to see on the show and
have a great weekend everyone it's right
