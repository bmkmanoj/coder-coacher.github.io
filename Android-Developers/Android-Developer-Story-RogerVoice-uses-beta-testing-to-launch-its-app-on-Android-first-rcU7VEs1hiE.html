hasn't flattened me from doing so many
things in my life being an entrepreneur
and how he needs to have this bunch of
food them and doing what I want and I
knew that I could do something about
accessibility in telecommunication to
deaf people watch of us is an app that
allows deaf people to make phone calls
the notion is quite simple your time to
use both definition to capture the other
person and voice but that I can read
what you're saying it's not like I was
looking for solutions I was just looking
for something to help me memorize or
something much more yeah I knew right
away that I had to make this happen to a
lot of other people my goal is to make
it a success possible to everybody I
knew that Android had the riders to
reach out there
over 1 billion users today which is
massive and the fact that end world had
like no constraints I didn't have to act
myself if this was possible from that
possible I could just do it so that was
a deciding factor I had no skills to
start with
I couldn't code I couldn't design have
fun people and skills just at that point
where you realize you can do a lot of
things but near that all these
connections around you to make it happen
when Olivia came to me the first thing
we did was rethinking the navigation and
here we are building an app that based
on accessibility I wanted to make
something really clear and easy to use
and material design really helped me
because all these guidelines are really
clear the versions of the application
right were iterated easily and the
development of the Olaf took about three
months when I made happen with a great
moment I would she's like wow this is so
cool I can call my mom now and the next
24 hours come on everybody in the world
all my friends before launching the part
of Google+ often better program allowed
me to invite people specifically to
touch that and so those people in Canada
trying the app those people and Kuwait
for somebody in Japan
it's not like a game where if you have a
Bart you just fix it it's supposed to be
a life changing experience for a person
with hearing disabilities if it doesn't
work well it will be really disappointed
so we thanks to the beta testing program
we were able to get it right from the
first public version what I enjoyed the
most developing total voice application
on droid is that I create something that
really matters to being users I feel
like when you relay something either
it's like under toy then you can think
about it other ways can be like okay
I've gotten this far but now the thumbs
more to do I see that probably the
biggest evolution don't follow it but
accessibility as a major component of
development and design I'm proud to be
part of that turned
