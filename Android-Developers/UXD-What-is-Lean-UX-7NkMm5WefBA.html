we're going to learn more about lean UX
and why it's important in creating
products that people love
I'm your host Nazmul Idris I have a very
special guest with me today Laura Klein
author of UX for lean startups welcome
to the show hello internets before we
start talking about lean UX we should
perhaps address lean startup first so
Laura what is lean startup so lean
startup is a methodology that was
created by Eric Ries and it's based on
lean manufacturing which actually came
out of Toyota Lean Startup is about
learning as quickly as possible and
reducing the cycle time through what's
called the build measure learn loop the
idea is that instead of just you know
assuming that you know exactly what you
should build you form a hypothesis that
something might work and then you've out
then you find the fastest way to
validate or invalidate that hypothesis
that makes sense the goal of course is
to you know create things that people
want to use and that they will actually
buy and we do that by learning and
validating our ideas at every step of
the way that makes sense so Laura word
on the street is that I can make some
products very quickly and on the cheap
without spending any money on design
using this Lean Startup thing is that
true no not I know it's terrible that it
isn't but it's absolutely not true cuz
link startup really it's not about being
cheap and it's not about being free or
cutting corners and just because you're
bootstrapping your startup doesn't make
you lean I mean ok so it turns out that
lean startups can end up spending less
money and time than other startups but
that's because they're constantly
evaluating whether they're building the
right thing and that minimizes waste
just saving money or going fast does not
make you lean that makes sense so what
is lean UX and how is it different than
Lean Startup lean UX is really just a
way to apply those iterative methods to
the user experience design practice
doing lean UX means that you're always
validating with users that you're
designing something that people are
going to use it's about designing
products that are both usable and useful
that make sense so you're in a book
about this right so what type of an
audience would find this book useful so
right the book is called UX for lean
startups but it's not actually just for
UX designers
and it's not even really just for
startups so I don't know maybe I could
have named it better but the book is
really for anybody who's building a
product because design is everybody's
job it gives you a lot of tips and tools
for learning from your users and turning
that understanding into great products
that people will actually buy that makes
sense
design is everyone's responsibility we
should say that a lot on the show so
Laura if I want a lean UX organization
my company how do I go about and make
that happen
well if you're in a big company with a
lot of siloed organizations you know UX
and one silo engineering in another
marketing in another it can be a really
big change but even if you're a start-up
with you know one designer and three
people in a room there are still some
fundamental things that you need to get
right the ones that I think are most
important are thinking in terms of
hypotheses and assumptions and learning
to validate those before you commit to
building creating cross-functional teams
that include engineering design research
product management and you know whoever
else needs to be involved in these
product decisions you need an
environment where you can measure and
test all of your design and product
decisions and a team that's open to
understanding the real impact that
they're having on end users you also
need a really different approach to
design deliverables where you're only
creating artifacts that are necessary
for communication you know you're not
making little pixel perfect mock-ups for
every single change and finally you need
support from the top of your
organization because you're going to
have to change the your whole way of
thinking about products you need product
managers and designers to be held
accountable for the impact that their
decisions have on the end user that
makes sense I mean you no longer get
evaluated on whether future ships or not
you get evaluated based on whether the
changes you make
positively impact user behavior that's a
big change that needs to happen at the
very top of the organization that is so
true so Laura can you talk more about
validating assumptions and hypotheses
that sounds really important but it also
sounds complicated what does it mean
exactly so it's a really big part of
lean UX and it's a big change in the way
we work we have to stop assuming that we
know exactly what we're building instead
we've need a frame everything as a
hypothesis that is going to be validated
before we commit those coding resources
so can you explain that with an example
I can so here's something that I think a
lot of us can probably identify with I
want you to imagine that you've got a
product your product manager comes in
and says our product needs more social
make it more social let's add comments
isn't everything better with social
everything is better with social but see
what happens is that the product manager
you know comes up with a brilliant brand
new idea for for comments and then the
designers immediately dive in and they
start thinking okay how do I make the
ideal comments experience and then the
engineers go okay great how do I write
this code so that it's you know really
fast stable comments experience but
instead what we should be asking is how
do we know whether this is even the
right thing to build in the first place
that makes sense see the whole comments
feature has a lot of assumptions packed
into it for example there's this
assumption that by making the product
more social our key metrics are going to
improve do we really know that do we
know that adding a comments feature is
going to improve our business do we even
know that people are going to leave
comments in other words do comments
fulfill either a user need or a business
need or even better both we can't just
you know assume that those things are
true because the product manager had an
idea instead of assuming that those are
facts we're gonna treat them as
hypotheses and we're going to test them
as quickly as possible and ideally we're
going to test them without building the
entire comments feature and then
launching it and just seeing how it does
that makes sense so so these are
hypotheses how do we validate them so
this is where we run into a really
common Lean Startup buzzword MVP I've
heard a bit yeah we need to build an MVP
and an MVP is a Minimum Viable Product
it's the smallest possible thing that we
can build that will help us to learn
whether or not our hypothesis is true
that makes sense I've heard of these
MVPs so aren't they just really crappy
versions of products they are not ah so
this is a common misconception but an
MVP has never you know a crappy version
of a product because it turns out that
the only thing that we learned from
crappy products is that people don't
like crappy products that's a well
validated hypothesis well you know
people hate crabby things the word
viable is actually there for a reason
it's got to be something that we can
learn from well that makes sense so what
is the MVP version of this comments
feature that's a good question there are
actually a few different versions of the
MVP and you could start with any of them
sort of depending on what you want to
validate first so for example if you
wanted to validate whether anybody would
leave a comment at all you might create
what we call a fake door or a feature
step what is a fake door so if you're
one of ala date whether anybody's going
to use something you build the very
first interaction with that feature and
then you record whether anybody
interacts with it so in this case you
might put a box on the page that's a
little comment box and it's got a little
button that says add a comment and you
let people add a comment but instead of
adding the comment to the page
immediately you might just give the
answer a nice thank-you message saying
you're reviewing the comment and then
you'd send the comment in an email to
you that way you'd know whether anybody
tried to leave one it's a lot faster
than building the whole system you know
with flagging and blocking and
moderation and everything and then you
know realizing that nobody has anything
to say that makes sense so so that's a
quick way to validate now what if people
actually start leaving comments like
they actually engage with this feature
yeah so once you validated the people or
the people are interested in starting
this process and leaving comments the
next minimum viable product like me to
see whether adding some of those
products to the page actually makes a
difference in your metrics oh so
remember you've got some comments that
people have emailed to you and so you
can add those to the page by hand and
then do an a/b test to see if the
comments you've added make a difference
for example show the same page with
comments and without and see if more
people buy on the page that has comments
that make sense so what you're saying is
that the idea if an MVP is to learn
weather feature product is likely to
succeed before you actually put in the
resource to completely build it yeah
that's exactly right that's a hundred
percent true and that's really what this
whole thing is about that makes sense so
now after the MVP how do you know when
your hypotheses and assumptions have
been validated that's an excellent
question and it's also a huge question
with a lot of answers to it the basic
idea is that you have to be able to
measure your results in some way and if
you can't tell what effect your changes
are having on real user behavior
can't actually ever know whether your
design decisions were any good that
makes sense
so can you illustrate that with an
example sure so let's say you end up
shipping that comments feature that
we've been talking about you know in
most places you just ship the future and
then move on to the next one
but what up for some reason that you
don't necessarily understand when this
feature is out in the wild comments
really end up hurting your product oh
yeah I know so I mean maybe sounds weird
but maybe people are so busy commenting
on things that they don't buy anything
or you know maybe comments make the page
load really slow and you end up driving
people away there could be any number of
reasons that a feature might fail but
the point is that you don't know it
fails unless you're measuring that make
sense so is this where you might use a
be testing a be testing is really the
best way to test the real impact that
your changes have on your product but
there are other ways both qualitative
and quantitative to validate your
changes ah that sounds like something we
should talk about in future episodes I
think you're right cool well thank you
so much for being on the show if you
want to learn more about lean UX before
we make more episodes on it don't forget
to read Laura's book UX for lean
startups where she will teach you all
about making products that people love
thanks everybody go and build something
amazing and thank you Laura again for
being here and thank you for watching
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
