I've been jumping in Android is about
all of the features that you can really
take advantage of and one of those is
stateful drawables now I've come from a
swing background in Java and so I'm used
to okay let's say I have a button on the
screen and when the user clicks on that
button or maybe they mouse over it I
want that icon to change to maybe an
inverted icon I so the way I'd write
that in swing is you'd write an
onclicklistener or a non mouse over a
mouse move listener to watch for those
actions and then swap out the image but
with Android you don't have to write
those with stateful drawables you can
have a single image that changes the
image that changes what it is based on
the state so I don't have to write that
code as the user moves over something or
when they touch something or as they
check an item that I that image
automatically changes for me a second
thing I've really found valuable is the
hierarchy viewer I found myself a lot of
times as I'm trying to lay out a view
and really see how things work on the
screen that it doesn't look the way I
want it to something's not working out
and so many times instead of just
tweaking little changes one at a time to
see you know how can i fix this how can
I make this layout work the way I want
it to I can use the higher key viewer to
really drill down and see how things are
being laid out on the device where the
boundaries of the objects are so that I
can clearly see where things are being
laid out and how I could reorganize to
solve the problem and fix the view to
make it the way I want it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
