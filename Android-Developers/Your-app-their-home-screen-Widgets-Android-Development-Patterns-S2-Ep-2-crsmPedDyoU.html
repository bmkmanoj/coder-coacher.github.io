great so let's call it a day because
you're ready to rest right wrong I'm
David East and I'm here to convince you
that you aren't done yet
because you need to build a widget but
first what exactly is a widget well
would you just consist of a single view
that has passed to other apps such as
the home screen app in this view gets
displayed as a portion of their layout
and that single view has now become a
window to your app from the home screen
or even the lock screen and this is
where the magic comes in because you can
use that widget to display information
that your users will care about and to
trigger actions that will bring them
back into your app this means that you
have an opportunity to become the core
part of your users mobile experience and
how cool was that consider a simple non
interactive widget like for a weather
app it can display the current
temperature overlaid on a sunny sky to
show the weather outside in a single
glance on the home screen now you just
gained a grateful user because they
don't actually have to open up the app
just to check the weather but widgets
are about doing things not just showing
off so give that informative view a job
to do a click on the view should trigger
a deep link into your app but don't just
open up your main activity instead
consider is there a better point of
entry such as the view for this week's
forecast another use for a widget could
be a control toggle perhaps you want to
show how strong the Wi-Fi signal is
right now that's your view and a click
on that view could toggle the Wi-Fi on
and off without ever directing the user
into the Settings app which is super
useful but these are still only scraping
the surface of what widgets can do for
you and for users think about a calendar
widget if you can adjust the fill
whatever size the user gives it listing
out all the events for today clicking on
an event can open up its detail view and
scrolling through the list can show you
everything that doesn't fit in the view
and just because you're showing a list
doesn't mean you can't provide space for
a quick add action to easily create a
new event in a single click widgets are
great because they empower you to make
your app useful to users even when they
haven't specifically opened it and then
you can easily get users back into your
app because you're enticing them with
completing an action so check out the
documentation on widgets to learn how
you can get started and what widgets can
do for you
but most importantly just continue to
build better apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
