ideas in well-designed apps they were
enjoyable intuitive and help me find

early adopter
please welcome Samir cemaat VP product
management Google Play
I'm I'm I'm only realizing now that many
of you did not get the memo on the
appropriate dress code for this
evening's attire and you're forgiven
however but I wanted to look my best in
honor of some of the greatest developers
in the world and one of my one of the
favorite parts of my job is watching
developers take a new design or a
nascent technology and create
experiences that are truly changing
people's lives the apps and the games
that they create offer a service piece
of functionality or an entirely new
experience that is truly inspiring and
amazing being an early adopter is really
hard it means challenging the status quo
it means pushing your team in different
directions
these are all things that we at Google
truly admire in this year's nominees
let's take a look
early adopter nominees are Glide
mechanic's escape
minecraft story mode
world around me
semper early-adopter
and the winner this year in the early
adopter category is world around me
go global given how popular Android
devices are around the world we often
get asked by developers how do I make an
successful entrance into a new market
and many people think that localizing an
app just means taking the app from one
language to another but it's so much
more than that for an app to feel truly
successful in a different country users
there need to believe that it was built
for them this is all about colors and
character choices and contextual
relevance as well as language it's
really hard to do and so this year we
wanted to honor a set of developers that
exemplify what great localization looks
like and the nominees are let's take our
dragon ball z dokkan battle
poletik spotty wait
memorize
musiXmatch Pokemon shuffle mobile go
global and the winner this year in the
go global category Pokemon shuffle
mobile
