LYLA FUJIWARA: The architecture
components lifecycle library
is designed to help you solve
common Android lifecycle
headaches and to make your apps
more maintainable and testable.
This here is an introduction
to the LiveData and lifecycle
classes.
LiveData is a data holder class
that is also lifecycle-aware.
It keeps a value and allows
that value to be observed.
Now, a primary use case of
LiveData is to update the UI.
You'll have a model object,
such as this user object, which
is wrapped by LiveData.
Then you'll have a UI
component, like an activity,
that will observe a LiveData.
When details of the
user LiveData change,
the activity is notified
and it updates its UI.
LiveData makes it easy to keep
what's shown on screen in sync
with the data.
So let's take a
look at the code.
LiveData objects will usually
be kept in the ViewModel class.
If you're not sure
would a ViewModel is,
you should check out this video.
You will always defy the type of
object the LiveData holds here,
and it could be any object type.
Next, in the [INAUDIBLE]
create of the activity,
you make an observer object.
The unchanged
method defines what
happens when the LiveData
object actually changes.
In this example,
the method updates
a text via the activity.
Then all that's left is to
have the observer subscribe
to the LiveData to
receive updates.
If you observe a LiveData object
that already contains a value,
your observer immediately
gets notified with that value.
Once observation starts,
when the LiveData's updated,
the UI will
automatically update.
What makes LiveData different
from other observables
is that it's also
lifecycle- aware.
Now, to understand
what this means,
though, you first need to know
about the Lifecycle class.
A lifecycle is an object that
defines an Android Lifecycle.
Relatedly, LifecycleOwner
is an interface
for objects that
have a Lifecycle.
And a LifecycleObserver
is an interface
for observing LifecycleOwners.
As of Support
Library version 26.1,
both activity and fragment
implement LifecycleOwner.
These classes
provide ways for you
to both query the
state of a Lifecycle
and to receive callbacks
for Lifecycle events.
LiveData leverages this.
When a LiveData
observer is created,
it is associated with
a LifecycleOwner.
Observer objects are that
only notified of their updates
if their associated Lifecycle
is in the started or resumed
state.
Observers also
automatically remove
themselves when their
LifecycleOwner is destroyed.
LiveData is therefore protected
against accidentally updating
a UI component that's
in the background
or destroyed without you
having to do anything extra.
So how is LiveData
actually updated?
SetValue and postValue are two
methods for updating LiveData.
Use setValue if you're
running on the UI thread.
And use postValue if you're
running on a background thread.
Additionally, Room and
LiveData go together
like peanut butter and jelly.
Room can return LiveData
objects which are automatically
notified when the
database changes
and have their data loaded in
a background thread for you.
This makes it very easy
to have the UI update
when your database updates.
You can learn more about Room
the introduction to Room video.
While we're on the topic
of updating LiveData,
let's talk about a cancellation.
You'll usually work with
LiveData and MutableLiveData.
Now, as the name implies,
MutableLiveData is mutable.
It exposes the setValue
and postValue methods.
LiveData, on the other
hand, is read- only.
In general, your view models
should be the only class
directly updating LiveData.
This means that, within
the view model class,
you can use
MutableLiveData, and then,
from the outside
of the view model,
you can expose played
LiveData objects.
As your LiveData
expertise increases,
you might find that you need
to manipulate your LiveData.
You can use built-in
transformations
or you can make your own.
The built- in map
transformation lets
you apply a function to
the output of one LiveData
and then propagate the results
downstream to another LiveData.
In this example, whenever
the user LiveData changes,
username is notified,
runs the map function
and then emits the
resulting full name.
The switchMap transformation
is a lot like map,
but instead of the mapping
function emitting a value,
it emits an entirely
new LiveData.
An example use case is if
you have a bunch of users,
perhaps stored in
a Room database,
you could use the
switchMap to change which
user you're actually observing.
You'd input the ID here.
Then you'd need to provide a
function that returns a user
LiveData, given that ID.
That function could then
emit a totally new LiveData
but you wouldn't need
to update the observers.
Here's the code, with
a LiveData for updating
the ID, a function that
takes that ID and outputs
the related user LiveData
and the switchMap function.
If you want to make your own
custom data transformations,
you should take a look
at MediatorLiveData.
MediatorLiveData includes
methods to add and remove
source LiveData objects.
You can then combine
and propagate
events from all the
sources down stream.
One use case is if you want to
display a LiveData object that
could be updated, either
from the local database
or the network.
You can take two sources and add
them to the MediatorLiveData.
The first source would be a
local database LiveData object,
and the second source would
be a network LiveData object.
Then your activity
would only need
to observe the single
MediatorLiveData object,
but it would receive
unchanged updates
for both of these sources.
Getting started with
LiveData is simple,
but there's a lot of room
for potential experimentation
with this Lifecycle
aware observable.
Hopefully this has inspired
you to build something.
And as always, the
documentation is linked.
