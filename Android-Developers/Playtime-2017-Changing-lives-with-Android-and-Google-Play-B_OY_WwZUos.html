childhood because you're growing up next
to your dad working on the fields one
thing what I really learned was what
does work all day long they actually
mean this is where for me my heart to
become an entrepreneur somehow started
just a few years ago me and my
co-founder started almost with nothing
now having more than 200 employees more
than 220 million downloads and being
part of arenas this is incredible
I was 40 years old when I started
running and it all started with a
challenge I signed up Alexis my daughter
for a 10k and I decided to sign up for a
5k to show her that I support her and
that she's not gonna be the only one
running Alexis didn't think that I can
do it she said like you're gonna get off
the couch and run a 5k she told me to
use runtastic and I took the challenge
and I ran the whole 5k since I started
running I've been doing all kinds of
races I am currently training for my
second marathon what running has taught
me is that I can achieve so much
I was diagnosed with a bunch of learning
disabilities and I spent years
struggling in school I had this teacher
named Miss Whitefield
who totally changed my life the whole
ethos of her mind was built around the
thought that if we could help give the
Miss Whitefield's of the world
superpowers and make them more efficient
it can have an enormous impact on the
education system so I would spend my
time speaking to hundreds of teachers
across the country while my brother who
was locked in a room learning how to
code today remind has over 23 million
active teacher students and parents in
over 90% of u.s. k12 school districts we
would have never been able to reach
those customers of Google Play did not
exist one of my students Jason he
struggled especially with turning things
in on time one day he came to me then I
was like I bet you that if I do all my
work and pass the test if those a party
I kept receiving messages from Miss
Lemire and my other classmates to help
me and motivate me as a result I lost
they got to have an ice-cream party it
was probably some of the best work that
I've ever seen him produce
over 30 million users are currently
using the app be bigger than any
University our school that has existed
for ages in India what inspires us as a
team and what motivates us the most is
when we here users talk about how
learning English with the app has
impacted them in such a positive way
that truly empowers us to keep going and
to make a bigger impact when I retired
from my job I decided to do something
useful that's why I joined a low leash I
believe that there are so many kids
around us they want to learn English
joining our English gave me enough
confidence to go to my hometown and
teach the poor and needy
any good
about
English is good for higher education
psyche for better life
hundred tested me about five years ago I
thought I was doing computer revision
and gesture technology and I got on TV
to demonstrate a game I developed that
was controlled using head gestures and I
got a phone call the next day and the
guy said hi I can't move my hands or
legs and you're making it smart when I
could really put a new perspective on
whether tickety can accomplish and how
we can change lives and the Android
operating systems open nature it allows
me to innovate beyond what I could
imagine in person and we want to the
woman that wasn't enough sugar for to us
before them a lot for myself to the
whole system this
every successful user is not just a
number it's a whole life it's a whole
story and we take those with us and
those propel us forward to keep doing
what we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
