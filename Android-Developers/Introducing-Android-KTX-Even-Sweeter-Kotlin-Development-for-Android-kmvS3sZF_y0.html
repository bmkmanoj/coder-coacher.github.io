more clear pleasant and idiomatic when
working with android framework classes
we created android cousin extensions a
set of extensions to the framework that
covers some of the most commonly used
classes like view shared preferences
canvas any mirror and others for now
android KTX is in preview and the api is
likely to change before reaching the
stable version but here's how to
integrate it in your projects to check
it out some examples of usage and how
you can contribute in the build of
Gradle file of our apps at the Google
repository if it's not there already and
then add the Android KTX library to your
dependencies let's start with a simple
example let's say that we want to create
a uri from a string normally you would
call uri dot parse on the string but
with android KTX we can just call to uri
on the string when we want to save a
value in share preferences our code will
look like this really the Preferences
put the value and then call apply with
the extension we just need to call edit
and pass a lambda block with the action
under the hood it actually does the same
thing as the previous code working with
classes from the graphics package we've
added extension functions for some of
the most important classes their canvas
speed map path color and others so let's
say that we want to draw the difference
between two paths offset downwards by
100 pixels first we get the difference
of the paths then we translate the
chemist and afterwards we draw the new
path all of this code can now be
simplified like this okay let's take
another example this time with a view
and say that we want to execute an
action before the view is drawn the
default implementation requires us to
add an own pre-draw listener make sure
it's removed before the action is
triggered and then trigger the action
with entered KTX
we can just call do on pre draw on our
view and trigger the action these are
just a few of the extensions available
so far check out the docs to find out
what else we have there if you want to
suggest more ideas for extension
functions and you'd like to contribute
check out the Android KTX github project
we're still in preview the API is not
stable yet so your feedback is valuable
and can
shape the library this is just the
beginning of Android KTX we're working
on extensions for support library and
architecture components Colleen on
Android is here to stay and we have big
plans for it
