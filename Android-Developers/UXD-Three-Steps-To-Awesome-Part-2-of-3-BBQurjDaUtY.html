will highlight one of the three common
missed opportunities for apps to deliver
delight to their users this is the
second episode in the three steps to
awesome series
I'm your host Nazmul Idris a developer
advocate passionate about design and
mobile and I have with me a very special
guest on the show today
hey thanks nas well i'm patrick larvae
i'm a researcher here at google been
focusing on user experience and mobile
for a long time awesome
so apps that widely that are widely
diverging from platform guidelines are
usually not a good idea you should try
and make people feel at home in your
application by following platform
guidelines wherever you can and be
consistent so that the users
expectations from that platform are
meant to inside of your application so
for example an Android user expects that
the Android version of your application
feels at home on Android and similarly
an iOS user has the expectation that the
iOS version of your application should
feel at home on iOS keep in mind it's
their phone like users identified very
deeply with a particular phone and they
think about it as their phone they don't
say that this is my Android or iOS they
think of it this is my phone and so your
application has to make sure that it
fits inside of whatever idea they have
off their particular phone and not get
hung up on these technical details
around which platform the application is
running on because again the user
doesn't care that's right nose man so
there are reasons for deviating from
these guidelines but but you must have a
good reason to deviate for them
deviating without a particularly good
reason is generally not a good idea
that's exactly right when people talk
about their phones they don't talk about
my Apple 5 point whatever they say this
is my phone exactly so and I think the
idea of making people people feel at
home begins with the kind of
nomenclature we use when were you when
we develop apps so for example what's
the opposite of short tall not at
Starbucks what at Starbucks the opposite
of short is treinta another example for
Android is making sure that buttons do
what people expect them to do a back
button should take you
not necessarily some I've seen back
buttons do all kinds of funny unexpected
things can you add the app can take you
back to the to the homescreen do all
kinds of things that people don't
necessarily expect so it's it's
important to remember that design
guidelines are not there just because
people like guidelines they're there
because we want users to feel at home on
their phones
with no matter what app they're using
you can deviate with purpose and there's
some really good examples of this for it
for instance in the latest version of
the YouTube app you can you'll notice
that the YouTube app has gone to a
card-based design so you can scroll
through all kinds of content and when
you find something you like you can
click on it and the content can actually
pop out you can watch the video in this
much smaller square that you can move
around your screen why do they do this
this is actually quite unusual too it's
a very purposeful deviation the reason
they did this is so that you can
continue to watch that video as you
scroll through the content and find
something else to watch there are lots
of there are lots of instances where
people say things like I really want my
app to reflect the quirkiness or the
specificity of my brand this is
generally a bad idea the way to express
your brand is by having an awesome
design that fits the guidelines of the
platform and makes your user feel
completely in charge here as an example
I hope that everyone watching goes and
checks out the Airbnb app it's amazing
it will replace the desktop entirely for
you and you will be awed and inspired by
how they've taken they've designed
within the guidelines to come up with an
app that's very very unique to Airbnb
and is in my opinion one of them one of
the best apps I've seen a long time
exactly I think the key here is
respecting a user's choice whether it's
a choice of the device they've made or
the platform even in the social network
that they're they're using for example
for social sign-in I think the most
important thing is that when you're as a
developer when you're building an
application that's going to live in a
particular platform make sure that your
application does not feel like a
second-class citizen because the user
will be able to know because users are
savvy there they're there they have
really really high expectation
and so it's really really important to
make sure that you respect their choice
and also make sure that your
applications are giving them the
first-class experience for their
particular platform on their particular
device for example Naz mph I invite you
over to my house and safe
um hey I've got this great bottle of
wine we'd like to share with me and you
say to me hey that's awesome
where's the straw give me a straw I want
that's terrible
why is that terrible because the entire
point of inviting him over to share this
bottle of wine is that we're going to
drink it together this is the point of
playing well with others
think of a mobile phone in exactly the
same way your app is playing on the head
phone with lots of others at the same
time you need to remember that exactly
no and and the key is that just like the
bottle of wine the their resources on
your phone that are very limited like
CPU network and memory and each
application instead of essentially
sticking a straw and consuming all of
CPU network and memory they should
really be in a more sharing state of
mind and and so a good way to do this is
to keep efficiency in mind so one of the
biggest things you could do as a
developer is make sure that your
applications are aware of battery
consumption network consumption and
display constraints we talked about the
Caturday app in part one of this of this
series and it was a Caturday app that
allows you to get documentaries on cats
it's on your mobile device so one of the
things you can do is that if the
application detects that you're getting
your going low on battery maybe instead
of allowing you to play a particular
video it should allow you to queue it
similarly if you're not low on battery
but it senses that you're on a device
that has a very very small screen or a
really low resolution display instead of
giving you the HD quality video that
would consume a lot more battery and
network instead it should give you a
lower resolution video that you can't
even tell the difference when you're
using this application so similarly
another thing to keep in mind and this
is really the data transfers is to try
and use a big cookie model for
transferring data big cookie model just
means that instead of doing really small
data transfers intermittently you batch
them together and do one big one and
there's a reason for this the the
cellular radio on your phone it actually
drains
battery at a rapid rate when you power
the radio from idle to high power mode
and so if you can limit how often you do
this that will actually end up giving
your your user savings on their battery
and in line with that you should also
think before you sink which means which
is kind of tied to the same concept
where instead of kicking off your own
syncing operations using your own timer
you should try and batch this with
system sinks what will happen is that
the system will wake up the radio take
the hit for going from idle to high
power mode and then while it's powered
up all the applications that need data
synced can it can do all of that at the
same time again giving you more savings
on battery and finally when you're
testing and building these applications
make sure to use an old device that is
resource constrained because if you're
testing on the latest and greatest nexus
with you know multiple cores and many
many gigabytes of RAM you might get away
with things that you won't on an older
device and that's a really good practice
to get into you know this this also
applies to your choice of technologies
so as your users going along and using
your app and let's say let's go back to
the cat the cat video app you it's time
to watch a cat video and suddenly you
find that the technology requirements
for watching that cat video are
inconsistent with your platform so how
many times flat and I'm thinking I'm
thinking is very serious very
specifically about Flash think about
those iOS users out there that you know
this is a planned incompatibility and
nas Mo's point was that you should plan
for delight that's absolutely true
you should also bear in mind that not
everyone shares the same technology
stack there there are ways of there are
other ways of thinking that so if you
can use html5 for example that might be
a better choice that way know exactly in
this particular case let's say you do
have a valid reason to use flash for a
device where it's not going to run that
you should consider failing very
gracefully instead of just giving like a
404 message or a plug and not found or
something that a user can't really
understand
so one of the things to keep in mind is
when you're choosing a technology stack
instead of using your familiarity as a
developer with that stack keep the user
in mind when deciding which stack to use
because again you're building the
application to live
on your on your users device which is
their device so another related to this
selection of technology stack is is
determining which version of a platform
to use like what API is to use so for
example on Android you might you might
think that you know based on market
share statistics and so on that if you
want to deliver an application that
reaches the largest number of users then
you're gonna target a lower version API
so while that's that's not entirely the
truth because market stats don't show
you everything while that might be true
if you if you provide a lowest common
denominator experience then arguably the
users of your application won't be that
delighted so what we're saying is that
you can deliver to light while taking
these constraints into account so for
example if you take KitKat features into
account that is build that into your
application so that KitKat users of your
application experience all the kidnaped
it katniss but at the same time
gingerbread users can can can also
experience sort of the baseline
capability for application that way your
delighting folks that have higher
versions off android on their phone for
example while not really taking anything
away from let's say the folks that are
on Gingerbread the signature of a really
really awesome app is it the fact that
problems never occur it's the fact that
app handles those problems very very
elegantly so before you release that out
imagine that no matter how awesome it is
and I'm sure it's awesome you are going
to have all kinds of problems
you're going to have error messages
you're gonna have networks that go out
you're gonna have batteries that run out
you're going to have people like me with
big fat fingers that don't aren't very
accurate on touch screens you're going
to have bad lighting that you know
there's awesome graphics that you have
people may not see them in a whole
lighting conditions plan for these
things again the signature of an awesome
app isn't that problems don't occur is
that antastic app will handle these
problems very elegantly exactly I think
on mobile one of the most important
things to keep in mind is
that Network coverage is spotty and
bandwidth is varies quite greatly and so
one of the key things to nail in a good
mobile experience is to get offline mode
right because if you don't take that
into account a lot of times you might
have a UX fail where somebody goes to
use your application and you know it was
working great with perfect network
coverage but they're in a particular
part of town with where your carrier
doesn't have that great of a coverage
and there's no Wi-Fi and guess what your
application just stops working and that
just leaves a bad taste in their mouth
so Gmail is a really good example of
offline mode where you know Gmail just
hides the fact that you have or don't
have network connectivity allows you to
compose emails it allows you to manager
inbox and so on and then as soon as you
get connectivity it just goes ahead and
syncs everything with your with your
Gmail so one last thing is when you're
creating meaningful error messages I
think it's really important to also give
the user a path to resolution so they
can recover from this error rather than
just you know know that just notify them
that something bad has happened so I
hope you enjoyed our episode stay tuned
for the final episode in this three-part
series which is coming soon just
remember by following these three steps
you too can avoid common pitfalls and
make applications awesome and also if
