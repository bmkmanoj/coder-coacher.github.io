headed to your place now the TV's
joining us for lunch later and we want
to show you this cool new feature I
think you'll love it lady
I started sesame around five years ago I
didn't know I was headed that way
and I got on TV to demonstrate a game I
developed that was controlled using head
gestures your head around and chased
this character the day after I get a
phone call and the guy on the line says
hi I can with my hands or legs
it really put a new perspective on
whether technology can accomplish and
how we can change lives and the Android
operating systems open nature really
allowed me to innovate beyond what I
could imagine at first so you say Open
Sesame
that's how the phone opens on from that
point on allows for operation of any app
are using only head movements
long time being asked for a selfie
feature it will be fun it's not a
standard company you have days when
you're crying from happiness because you
really really touched the person's life
with the app now being on Google Play
anyone can download it around the world
and we're seeing that one of our
greatest users is Alex Friedman I met
him on social circles and at the time he
was just starting a campaign to raise
awareness around disabilities in Israel
and he uses sesame remarkably m134 the
photo jump around to the photos with
this holding a lot boomer step to the
photos to mess with miles from Utah hi
Google Play console gives us a lot of
tools to care for our users better we
see what's working right and what's not
through the ratings and reviews we can
actually be in touch with users and take
benefits from all the great stuff that
Play Store offers I think the biggest
takeaway from sesame is the lives you
touch every successful user is not just
a number it's a whole life it's a whole
story and we take those with us and
those propel us forward to keep doing
what we do
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
