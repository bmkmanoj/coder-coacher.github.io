in Berlin and what I what I do in a day
to day interactions is talk to app
developers could you just have reset the
notes please talk to app developers
about their engagement strategies in
across the sort of whole device
ecosystem that is emerging and certainly
it's true that at the moment the hub of
your interactions with your customers
and is the smartphone but what we're
seeing is a whole ecosystem of smart and
connected devices that are sort of
coming to the coming to the force and
coming to the force like smart TVs
matches smart watches smart cars and
they're creating new avenues for user
interactions the sort of growth that
we're seeing in beacon deployments it's
still in the early stages but it's going
to get bigger and as well as the growth
of the Internet of Things will create
opportunities for you to interact with
your users in the physical world we've
seen this slide before just from Mateos
presentation but I think what it does it
captures the point really well and for
you as developers it's a key challenge
to find strategies that take advantage
of the growing connected device
ecosystem but and what we've seen across
categories and of apps is that frequent
regular interactions with your app build
loyal audiences and and increase your
chances of building you know long-term
customers or a long term relationship
with your users so what I want to do
today is look at how you can build Smart
interaction strategies for the multi
device contextual world
so oh so not in the in the spotlight and
so in this sort of more complex world
developers are asking or finding new
answers to their questions so how do I
personalize and tailor interactions with
my users how do I take advantages of
these new device classes that are
emerging emerging and how do I build a
good interaction strategy around it and
how do I enable users to interact with
others and the world around them so in
the next 20 minutes or so
and we'll talk about how Google can help
you with those are finding good answers
to those questions and building a good
strategy so let's start with tailored
interactions so this chart is for the US
and only but it holds true for many
European countries as well so think
about this for a minute next year 60% of
your app users on your on their
smartphone will also be able to use your
app on their tablet
I think that's quite a staggering figure
so what that means for your services or
for your apps for your products that
depend on logging in users to deliver a
personalized content or services and or
to track the value of your advertising
channel is that you basically need to
provide a find a way to provide your
users with a seamless login experience
across all the devices that they're
using and Google can help you with that
we went to an I want to introduce you to
smart lock for passwords today it's a
lightweight API for Android and chrome
that basically stores the login
information your users users on web and
in Android so I'm it remembers whether
they use their email and password or
whether they might have used Google
sign-in or Facebook to authenticate
themselves in your app and if they do
that on the web
smart lock for passwords will do the
same on Android and the credentials that
that the users enter will sync
seamlessly in the background across all
the devices where the user is logged in
so across Android smartphones tablets
and Chrome so let's see what it can
actually do so I'm if you have a web
presence and you have a user that's
authenticated previously on the web but
now installs your app for the first time
they won't see a login screen or a
prompt to enter into their password but
they will be signed in automatically so
I'm what with what we're seeing is with
the launch partners that we have out
there and is that instantly they're
signing in 10% of their audience on
Android just because they have built up
a big signed in user base on web if a
multiple accounts are registered and
smart lock for passwords will ask the
user hey do you want to sign in with
your Gmail account or with your hotmail
account and so what that means for you
is that as moot as users are moving
between platforms or between devices and
they all have no sign-in prompts you
have no drop-off and you'll have instant
personalization in your apps so you also
will encounter the the situation where a
user will sign up for the first time and
when they create an account in your app
a prompt will appear and ask the user to
sign to save their password or if they
um want to log in with Google it will
remember that choice and make that
available if they use your app on a
tablet or on the web and about 50 to 60
percent of users say yes to that option
when prompted and we think we can do
even better with some UX improvements
and that sort of prompt flow and what
we've seen is one of the launch partners
was Orbitz and they've seen a five
percent increase in the overall and
signed in users on Android just by
having that prompt appear so once you've
kind of identified your users on all the
different devices and made it easy for
them to
to authenticate themselves as they move
between uh between devices um
I want to talk a little bit about
notifications as a key user interaction
strategy and the tools that we have
available to help so we've seen that
notifications are a key key tool to make
sure that users can keep coming back but
to really have a a material impact on
engagement you need to ask yourself a
couple of important questions to kind of
formulate your notification strategy so
you need to have a key objective so what
this developer is doing share the meal
the key objective is to solicit a
donation so when they send you a
notification they want you to go into
the app and donate and they also feel
trying to figure out the context of the
notification and the timing so here the
context is you get a notification at
breakfast lunch or dinner and then the
timing would be or the frequency would
be um you know once a week once a month
once a day even and then what you also
need to figure out once you kind of have
those questions answered is to say how
can I target users that fall into these
different groups for rm4 notifications
and also you need to think about what
technical resources you want to invest
to actually implement your notification
strategy and Google Cloud messaging is a
free notification service from Google
that actually helps you deliver your
world-class notification strategies so
it's fit for all use cases you can send
it to use it to send messages to do
background thinking to do to do
implement messaging use cases you can
enable cross device platform messaging
so someone likes you photo somewhere you
get a notification on all your devices
the value is that it's built on Google
infrastructure and it's a reliable under
high message load so you don't have to
worry about not reaching your users when
it's critical it's a it also keeps power
consumption down which is great because
your app doesn't have to poke pull your
servers
and it basically reduces engineering
complexity for you as you're
implementing your strategy and the great
thing is it's free and it has any
features that out of betas don't have
any caps and or restrictions on usage
one key feature I want to highlight or
there's a little logo missing so this is
the cloud messaging logo here one
feature that's new and that's um was a
highly asked for feature is them the
topic messaging so yeah so what you can
do is you can assign users to topics so
first what you do with you create a
topic list say call it app marketing and
then you can automatically assign users
to that list so you have a list of
devices that describe to that subscribe
to that topic and or you can actively
ask users to sign in so you can have a
little question are you an app marketing
manager or something like that and then
you can send a message to Google simply
saying there's a new open beta on topic
messaging and send it to the topic app
marketing and you don't have to worry
about all your subscription management
anymore because all of that is taken
care of by Google and the great thing
about that is that you have a fast and
efficient way to implement subscriptions
at the moment this is still in beta so
there's a cap of 1 million subscribers
per app so we've covered the tailored
interaction piece now when I move on to
the how to extend your notification
strategies to other devices so starting
with phones and tablets I'm going to TVs
and wearables and cars Android is
expanding Android and play provide you
with a platform but these platforms
really come to life and create value for
users with the apps that you as
developers build so now this is still a
very new field so it's a great
time to think about how you can tailor
your interaction interaction strategies
to these new devices and platforms so
I'm really and we're all really excited
to see what you come up with talking
about where there are really three use
cases that in order of the integration
work and complexity that you can do to
drive users of the ware platform of end
of our smartwatches
back into your app and to interact with
them so notifications is great because
mostly into notifications already work
out of the box if you have Android
notification Ohta fication for Android
then they already work on where and if
you've interact if you've advanced
enhanced your notifications with action
buttons then those actions are to make
automatically work on where and there's
great where specific enhancements that
you can do like stacks pages and voice
replies watch faces are also great
because they give you or your brand or
your app really prominent space on the
wrist of the user and on the the most
glanced at real estate on their very
personal device so I'm what you can do
is you can push relevant updates from
your app into the watch face which is
great and then on the most complex
spectrum you have apps so and you can
build these apps and they run on the
wear device and economic they can do
almost anything that smartphone app can
do so and they are equipped they can use
the sensors on the wear device and we'll
go into a little bit into the use cases
so I'm enabling great wear experiences
we've an haven't been you know we
haven't stopped innovating as we are
launched where last year we've actually
made great improvements so one of the
key things I went to highlight is the
always-on functionality so basically it
allows your app to be on in the
foreground drawing very little energy
and updating and
at longer intervals so maybe every 10
seconds and so so for example running
apps can show the distance that you've
traveled and or you can it can show you
your boarding gate as you walk into the
airport without using too much energy
and drawing down the power of the
wearable and another thing that we've
that we've launched is the watch face so
an interactive watch faces so basically
you can and tap on watch faces on custom
designed watch faces to show other other
content or more relevant content so you
can tap on a watch face and what tap the
calendar button and see your agenda for
the day without actually going into the
app so and we've also launched other
upgrades so for example we're allowing
apps to use Wi-Fi and when you're away
from the phone that's great you can use
the onboard GPS so that's great for
running apps and then you can access
actually the Maps API and you have you
can have great mapping experience on the
where device and we also have iOS
support now so here's some great
examples one is the Guardian which so
taking long long time to load and the
guardian notifies you of the latest news
directly on your watch so and if you're
actually interested in that piece of
news you can make a note of it and have
it saved later for your foot for reading
on your phone and citymapper has a great
use case where and it shows you - how to
get from A to B in most major cities and
with always-on it saves energy while
you're commuting around London and
American Airlines has a great use case
where all your flight is available all
your flight information is available on
your wrist which is great if you don't
want to keep getting out your smart
phone because you forgot what seat
you're sitting in your also carrying
some luggage whatsapp is really great
because they've enhanced their their
wear app so that you sometimes don't
even have to open your phone anymore you
can reply right from your wrist and then
obviously Fitness I was talking about
that before you can have the always-on
mode
and always see as you're running how far
you've run and how much time you've
spent running and then for travel for oh
that's what they say music Spotify lets
you seamlessly browse your playlists so
if you're at home and you've got your
phone plac plugged on you're walking
around um can press play and you can
control your music from the from the
comfort of your couch without having to
get get up and getting your phone let me
talk a little bit about our TV
experiences as well so I'm we've got
Google cast and Android TV firstly cast
is a technology that lets you cast
wirelessly from your favorite
entertainment apps on phone tablet or
websites on a computer to your TV or
speakers so I'm we have a really strong
presence with cast we've got we've sold
over 17 million devices globally and you
can buy cast in 26 countries from 35,000
stores and this is a really mobile
platform so it aligns well with consumer
trends and what we're seeing is
everything a 60 percent year-on-year
growth of per device usage and already
22,000 of support cast Android TV is
designed for a for a different use case
it's more for a college Leanback
experience so you're just sitting on
your sofa and you don't already know
what you want to watch but you just want
to switch on your Smart TV and go there
is to create an experience where you
basically
discover new media content on you know
while you're sitting in your living room
some of the partners that we have are TV
TV vendors such as Sony Philips and
Grundig and we're also working with
over-the-top boxes and gaming consoles
so we've got Nexus devices Nvidia away
and rays or devices out there because
it's also a great gaming platform so
forecast how it works technically is
that you've got CAF for audio and video
you've also got games for google cast so
you can build great age
five games and you can another use case
is to extend your your apps or your app
user experience to a second screen so
you can have a dual screen experience
with Android TV and and the Leanback
libraries that we have and we're create
we are asking you to create a catalog
browser and to provide a card view and
detailed background playing card so if
if someone is watching a program in your
app and switches out of your app it
stills that keeps playing in the
background and what's really important
on an on Android TV is that you make it
easy for users to discover your content
so we met we advise that you make your
content searchable your app searchable
and also to enable searching while the
user is inside your app which is them
which is very important as well to find
so to surface the right content I also
want to talk to talk about Android auto
a little bit and we're sort of having a
slow start with Android auto but we've
already like we're already live which we
W say art and Skoda and in howdy is
coming soon
also at GM brands such as voxel is
announced for early 2016 and in Europe
you can buy pioneer aftermarket upgrades
for Android auto and our users can buy
aftermarket upgrades and we know that
other manufacturers so we've signed up
28 manufacturers are coming soon to also
offer Android auto experiences so if you
have apps in the messaging space or in
the music space and now is a really
great time so we kind of build a
footprint there I also want to quickly
mention cardboard what it does is it
basically makes it easy for developers
to build virtual reality experiences
from into their mobile apps by offering
an open-source toolkit that kind of
takes care of a lot of a lot of common
VR tasks that you're um that you're
faced with with such as dealing with
lens distortion correction
and have head-tracking so I'm that's a
great way to extend the user
interactions with your apps to different
platforms and emerging devices lastly I
want to talk a little bit about how your
apps can interact with the world around
them and how users can interact with
other users around them so let's talk a
little bit about the nearby proximity
API first this is a new technology that
was recently and released by Google that
basically allows you to build beautiful
experiences that lets your users
discover and each other when they're
close by or to discover beacons when
they are close by
so on there are two components nearby
messages so I'm that means devices that
are close by can exchange messages
easily such as I'm editing something
maybe a whiteboard in a room or I'm
forming a group of voting on something
or broadcasting resources and there's
also nearby connections which M lets
devices on the same network discover
each other and then it's used in
multiplayer gaming and the cool thing
about the nearby proximity API is that
it's available for iOS Android and also
for interacting with beacon devices and
it doesn't require you to sign in your
users which is great as well as well and
it also lets you concentrate on the
actual use cases that you want to
implement and Google handles the rest so
we communicate with other devices via
Bluetooth Wi-Fi and also by inaudible
sounds and that are picked up by devices
but not human not humans what we've seen
we've got some really nice showcase
implementations so and we have DJing
which has have a cool new case for a
playlist voting so the DJ publishes
their playlist and the listeners can
vote on what song they want to hear next
we have a pocket cast where basically
two people or more canned
publish the podcast that they're
subscribed to and then you can pick out
podcasts that I might that might be
interesting to you and subscribe to them
as well and Trello shares project boards
basically that are nearby so you can
subscribe to a project board but from
someone who's for example in this room
so that's really a really great
technology to enter to interact with
with people and you know other people
other users that are in your apps and
get them to engage more with your
product and I also want to mention
beacons so basically rather poetically
think of beacons as a kind of
lighthouses that are somewhere in the
you know attached to physical objects or
somewhere in the room and they provide a
perfect for a precise location and
contextual cues to apps that want to use
them so an for example we could label a
bus stop with beacons so your phone
knows to have the you know show you the
times when the next bus arrives or to
have the ticket ready or we can have a
museum that has a beacon attached to an
exhibit and provide additional
information or background information to
an exhibit the way that Google helps you
with this kind of interaction is we have
the Google beacon platform and it's
comprised comprised basically of three
parts you've got the low-cost beacon
devices and that have to comply with our
hardware specifications so that we know
and that they will work with our with
our api's we have the Eddystone format
that is the beacon format that Google is
an open-source format made by Google and
that basically defines three payloads
you can have a device identifier which
provide context to your app so that you
can engage with them that so you can
build interactive experiences on top of
them and beacons Eddystone beacons can
broadcast compressed
URLs so an you can launch experience
is right you know you can you can launch
a deep link right into the app where it
matters and they also broadcast
telemetry data data so I'm it will tell
you the time at a temperature in the
beacon whether it's moving things like
that and so you can build experiences
around that and then we also have the
proximity beacon API which lets you LA
allows you to register fleets of beacons
and manage them remotely so that you
don't have to go to every beacon that
you have installed and make sure that
they're still running and have enough
battery left the last thing I want to
get into is a kind of provide a little
look at the future what's out there what
we're working on and that's brillo and
weave we am we're trying to take the
next steps after beacon and really
enable the Internet of Things
so brillo is really the Android platform
for your connected devices
so they're basically our standard so
that they're easy to set up and they
talk to each other the way they should
and brillo think of it as basically the
operating system of the Internet of
Things we've is the Internet of Things
protocol on top of that and it provides
seamless and secure communications
between your devices so not just between
your smartphone and and the Internet of
Things device but also between devices
themselves and them it's also integrated
into Google Play so that right from the
start Android app developers can start
building beautiful applications on top
of that and it will make sure that all
the devices are interoperable and
there's a certification program in place
to make sure that all the standards are
kept that brings me to the end so thank
you very much for your interest I hope
that the path that I wanted to take you
on was clear so we have the tailored
interactions for the the platforms that
are really well established now in that
core to your business then we have the
emerging platforms like ware and smart
TVs and chromecast and cardboard
that are also important to think about
to really make sure you're reaching your
users where it matters and then going
beyond that the connected world the
beacons and the Internet of Things where
it's really important to start thinking
about how you're going to reach your
users there and how to make sure they
come back into your app so thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
