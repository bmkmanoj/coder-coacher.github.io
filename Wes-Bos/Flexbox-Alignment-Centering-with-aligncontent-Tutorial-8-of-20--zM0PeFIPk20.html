called
aligned content now in two videos ago we
looked at one called justified content
and what align content and justified
content essentially do is they say well
gee I got this extra space which is the
white space here what do I do with it
how do I deviate up who gets it where
does it go answers all those questions
so we talked about justify content and
we said something like space between and
give it a refresh and what happened
there is it took that extra space which
is on the right hand side and it divvied
it up in between so essentially you can
think of what happens to the extra space
on the main access again main access
left to right this is the main access
we've got another one which is called a
line content and it also takes the same
parameters that justify a Content flex
start Flex end space between etc etc so
if we set that to space between and
refresh hmm it doesn't really do
anything for us so like what does that
property even do if it doesn't actually
make anything work and if we think about
justify content taking the extra space
on the main access left to right aligned
content takes the extra space on the
cross access top to bottom and splits it
up so what's our problem here well we
don't have any extra space on our
vertical access because by default the
items are just going to stretch across
so aligned content actually only works
when we have multiple lines of code and
what it's going to do is if we open this
on up it's going to figure out what do I
do with the extra space on the cross
access and the vertical one do we put it
out the sum at the top sign up at the
bottom do we put it in between each one
individually do we put them on the top
or the bottom so for
we need to do before we even get rolling
with this align content just going to
comment that out is actually get some
wrapping so how do we do that last time
in one of the first videos we took the
Box in we gave it a width of 33.33%
something like that
refresh mmm 33 percent that's not 33
percent that's just it figured it out it
just divvied it up individually so how
did we fix that well we actually on our
Conflux container we did something
called flex wrap wrap and what that will
do is it will actually give a true width
to our flex items and it will allow us
to wrap it around so aligned content by
default just like justify content the
default is something called aligned
content stretch so you can see that
right now the items are just stretching
it's figuring out that we need four rows
and we've got all the space of my
browser vertically here so just divvy it
up stretch them across give each of them
kind of like a 25% height so that's the
default which is something called
stretch now I could I could just show
you real quick I make that stretch
refresh nothing happens so let's look at
the other ones that are available to us
we've got flex start no that's going to
do is now the height of them is no
longer stretch the height of them is how
high are they they're just taking
however much height they could possibly
need which is one two three four five
six right and one kind of a sizes
doesn't really have to do with it but
it's kind of interesting if I took this
too and it BR and I just do like a happy
face you'll see that two needs extra
room here so everything that is on the
same line as two is going to stretch to
be the same height which is super handy
a lot of times youth use javascript
packs to make sure that your columns
right here are the same size as the
others let's bring that back to where we
were now we've got all of this extra
room right here so right here we're only
worried about the cross access which is
top to bottom we've got all this extra
room right here
what do we do with it we can do flex end
put the extra room at the top because
you start the items at the bottom we can
do space between which we'll put them in
between each row what else we have space
around and that will put it on the top
and in between each one we talked about
this in the other and then finally we
also have Center which is again if you
are doing a row based layout and you
want to vertically Center items this is
exactly what you want you want to be
able to say this is how big my pop
container is and I want you to Center
them vertically inside of that one other
thing we want to maybe do here is like
this little straggler here 10 what if we
want to line that in the center now you
might think like oh I'll use a
text-align:center on on the wrapper and
maybe that will work so
text-align:center
put that on there refresh it doesn't
actually get the 10 to go in the middle
so one thing we can do is well think
back to two videos again we can also use
justify content and again if justify
content is the main access left to right
in aligned content is the cross access
top to bottom we can also just set
justify content to Center and then we've
got perfectly centered center both
horizontally as well as vertically so
that's aligned content again make sure
that you remember the two important
things that you first need a some sort
of rap it needs to rap otherwise it
doesn't take effect and then the other
thing is that we are only concerned with
the cross access which by default is top
to bottom unless we use flex direction
to change that alright well see you in
the next ones we're going to be taking a
look at the next one which is a line
self so so far we've been doing these
container ones where all of them just
follow but what happens if we want just
like one of them to sort of overwrite
the default so we're going to be going
from our Flex container into our Flex
item and applying some Styles there see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
