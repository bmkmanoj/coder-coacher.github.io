we start to talk about Redux and sort of
where it differs from just doing plain
old react and one of the main things
behind Redux is that we keep all of the
data that is related to our application
in a store so another way to say that is
rather than holding our state in a
component state we hold our state in a
Redux store and we don't have many
different components that have many
different states we have one giant
object that contains all of our data for
all of our stores so I'm going to go
ahead and go to our finished one right
here and I'm going to find our react one
here and I'm clicking on the provider
here we're gonna learn about what that
is in a future video but you'll see that
there's a store here and there's a
method called get state so if I want to
access this provider component I can
type dollar R and what that is that's
just a shortcut for whatever is
currently selected in the react dev
tools because they don't stored get
state and when I call that it's going to
return to us whatever is in our store
and in this case we've got our comments
which is this is all the different
comments for all the different pictures
you can see like what is your lighting
source alright what sort of these are
just comments from my Instagram posts
and then there's also all of the posts
here so this is the first one this is
the lunch and hand montt you can see
caption the code the source the ID and
how many likes are actually on that
specific photo so all this data is
stored in our store and when we go ahead
and click on one when we go ahead and
like it all of that data is going to be
updated in our actual store so we need
to go ahead in first we're gonna create
our store and we're not gonna see much
about how that works because once we
have our store we're gonna get into
reducers in actions and those are sort
of the two core components behind
working with redux in order to interface
with redux we need to create our store
now I've created this store JS file
right inside of my client folder not
inside of components and we're gonna
write our JavaScript to do that so of
course we need a couple dependencies to
import we need a create store
and we need compose from redux and again
we're gonna learn about what all these
are in just a second we need to import
sync history with store from react rotor
redux now what that's going to allow us
to do is to hook up react rotor with our
Redux and you're gonna see the benefits
of doing that in in a future video and
then finally we want to import browser
history and you may remember in main DJ
s or in our redux or Graham Dutch yes we
imported browser history and then we fed
that to the router now in order to get
us to connect the to react router and
redux we're going to not just feed the
router browser history directly but
we're going to slightly modify it in our
store dot J s so we need to import it
into here just for now and we'll modify
that in just a second so a browser
history from react rotor and now there's
a couple other things we need here we
need to import the route reducer now
what is a route reducer we haven't
learned that yet but we need to have it
here in order for us to keep going in
the next couple of videos are gonna look
at what our actions what our action
creators and what our reducers those are
sort of the the core concepts behind
redux and how we're going to be able to
update and pull data from it so let's
just say import route reducer from and
now here we're going to do a relative
link to a file that does not yet exist
well you will do that very soon so
reducers for slash index and that's
going to be a reducer and then finally
we need something like default data in
order for us to actually work with it
right because um the data that we are
working with here they've got posts and
we've got a whole bunch of comments that
are on here I'm not pulling these from
an API or anything for simplicity sake
but we need some sort of default data so
that when the application loads itself
it has something to do populate in here
before we go ahead and modify it by
liking them and and leaving comments on
these videos and that data is going to
come from I've got a data folder here
and inside of that we've got a postage
AS which contains all of our data and
you could be pulling this from an API as
well
as well as comments touch a switch has
all of the different comments related to
those specific posts so we need to
import those into our start at je s so
I'm gonna say import comments from data
for such comments yeah I'm just gonna
duplicate that over and we want to grab
posts from that so we've imported all
the methods that we need we imported the
reduce or yes we yet have to make as
well as the import of some data so let's
get actually writing some code first
thing we need is create an object for
the default data so those two things
that we just imported so it's a Const
default state equals and I'm going to
give it posts and comments so if you've
never seen this before this is some es6
it's the same thing as doing posts as
posts and comments is comments but in
es6 you don't need to do this if the
property key in the variable name that
you're setting it to is the same we
simply just need to put the name of the
variable there so good we've got that up
and running now we need to make the
store so Const or equals create store
right we just implement we just imported
that method right here and create store
takes two things first the route reducer
and the reducer is how we're going to be
able to interface with it and it also
needs the default state all right so
that's why we just created the defaults
they were here you could also just pass
in an object little right into that but
I like to keep it nice and clean in case
I ever need it to update the actual
state that I'm working with here and
then finally we need the history Collins
history equals sync history with store
and we are going to pass it the browser
history which is the browser history is
when I go from page to page to page to
page with react writer it's keeping
track of where I've gone so we're gonna
take that browser history in that push
state and we're going to sort of weave
in the actual store and need that to be
accessible to other files because we're
creating it in our store digest but we
are what we're going to be using it
right here right we're not gonna do it
just yet but that's what we're gonna be
using it so how do you get something out
of one file into another will you export
so we're gonna stick an export in front
of that one right there and then finally
let's also export our store right here
we could have also have done export
default constant store that we're gonna
say export default store at the bottom
right here good so we've created our
store right here it's not going to show
us anything just yet because we have yet
to create actions action Raiders as well
as our reducers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
