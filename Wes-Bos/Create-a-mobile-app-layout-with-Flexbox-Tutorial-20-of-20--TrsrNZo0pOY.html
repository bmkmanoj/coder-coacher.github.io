far congratulations this is probably the
most ambitious one that will take on and
really you'll probably find like it's
not that not too tough once we sort of
break down the big ideas and that is
building sort of this app layout that's
so common on a mobile phone with flexbox
now I think this is super important
because when you're on a phone you are
constrained by the height or the width
of the phone and you need to be able to
have something that you can just manage
the height of the the application so
what I've gone is ahead is I've built
this little app that we have here and
you can see like when you resize it
vertically because all phones can be
different size same width horizontally
actually if you size it vertically and
horizontally it will just kind of react
to go ahead with it
and I have no media queries in here
no floats no wits no heights none of
that stuff it's all using flexbox so I
think this is a really popular work I
think this is gonna be really big for
flexbox to be building this kind of
thing in fact if you've heard of react
native react native is this framework
where you can write apps in JavaScript
and it gets compiled into native and the
way that they handle their layouts is
with flexbox so it's kind of important
to know this stuff so let's get started
this is exactly what we're building
we've got things on the left things on
the right things that are centered we've
got all these buttons that are the same
amount and then we've got this content
area that's just gonna take up the rest
of the room after we we take room for
the header in the icon bar there so
let's jump on in and I'm just gonna
change this back to my base style and I
want you to open up style dot CSS and
you're gonna see a tons of different CSS
here and let me refresh that to see what
we're starting with so this is just
again
it's all just cosmetic stuff nothing
here really has anything to do with the
Flex property so that one shouldn't be
in there and we're starting off with
this so we got the header we've got C
it's link is on one line this is on
another and this is on a third we got
this content area you know let's look at
the HTML all we do is we've got the app
wrap which is this sort of this black
thing that looks like a phone you got
the header which is this big yellow part
we got the div of the class of content
which is the white it's just got a whole
bunch of content in there and then we
got this div with the class of an icon
bar and inside of that I've just got a
whole bunch of links inside of that
we've got some text and we've got some
font awesome icons which were using so
well let's get started I'm gonna go
through this kind of section by section
just so that we can understand what's
going on let's start with the overall
layout let's start getting things so
that it right now it's just spilling out
and that's because the app wrapper where
do we got it here the app wrap we've I
put a width or a sorry a height of 90 VH
on it and that means it's 90 percent of
the height of the browser you'll see
that it right here it resizes but the
content doesn't come along with it so
let's get all that fixed up and and
ready to go so first thing we're going
to do is select the app wrap and we're
gonna turn on flexbox so alright display
flex give that a save and when you
refresh whoo what's going on here so it
puts the navigation here just wouldn't
would be interesting for some apps I
guess you could slide it out from the
side but this is kind of what we've been
working with a lot so far and it's not
what we want for working with an app we
don't want to deal with rows we want to
deal with or we don't want to deal with
it one row we want to deal with a
multiple column so the way that we
change the axis so the horizontal in the
vertical axis the main axis and the
cross axis is we say flex direction
column and that will stack them on top
of each other okay so kind of back where
we were we got this we got that and we
are there and then we also want to set
these items to both grow and shrink so
I'm going to select all of the Flex
items in this case it's going to be the
icon bar it's going to be the content
and it's going to be the app header so
let's say that app wrap let's use a star
selector to grab those I'm gonna say
flex and I want it to grow one I want it
to shrink one essentially that means
just don't do anything stay as the size
and I'll tell you why that's important
in just a second and then finally for
the Flex basis how big it should be I'm
gonna say Auto and why am I gonna say
Auto because I want this header to take
up as much room as it needs maybe it's
gonna be more padding or less
I want this bar here to take up as much
room as it needs and then I want the
rest of the content to be dedicated
towards this content area that we can
scroll in there so I'm gonna say
Auto give that a save and refresh and
you'll notice that nothing really
changed there the height of this bar is
being taken up by the link in the header
and the other link however because we
said Auto we're allowing the content to
go as high as we want and because we
have scroll room really we've got all
the all the room that we could want so
what we need to actually do is go to our
content let's make a new section there
and we will select it and say overflow
why scroll so we're essentially going to
be turning on the scroll for this one
right here and then when we refresh
interesting what happens the header
takes up as much rooms that needs the
footer or the icon bar takes up as much
room as it needs and then the content
just kind of it takes the rest and
because we've put scroll on it it will
just scroll for the rest one other thing
we need to put on there is WebKit
overflow scrolling and we'll say touch
and what that will do is if you've ever
been on a a website on your phone and
you try to go through a scrolling
content area and it doesn't have that
kind of flick to scroll the inertial
scrolling that's because you haven't
turned on overflow scrolling touch to it
so if you test this out on your phone it
will work great so now that we've got
that that's great and you can see that
like this is still huge but because it's
huge it's going to take up that room for
now we're gonna get it trimmed down much
smaller in just a second so that's the
content I'm gonna go above that in will
do the header now and how should we best
lay this out if you know if you notice
before we had the back button on the
left we had this H what is that an h1 on
in the middle and then we've got this
cog icon on the right hand side now
previously this would have been done
with floats or you may be say like this
one is 20% this one is like 70% and you
give each of them up to 100% and
thankfully we don't have to do that
anymore we have the control and flexbox
so let's go ahead and select it dot app
header and this app header is also going
to be display flex why because we want
the header to be flex and we want the
link the h1 and the other link to also
be flex items so we can easily put them
to the left to the right in the middle
so just say flex and now I want to
refresh that look at what we got going
on here it puts them all on the same
line the h1 is no longer blocked like
where it takes up its own line it's
right in the line there and then these
icons like what's going on with them why
are they so big the reason behind that
is because it's taking the height of
this h1 and determining that that's the
height and by default these are going to
stretch so we need to go ahead and
change that we'll say a line items
Center and what that does is it's going
to remember we're on the flipped access
now it's going to vertically Center them
so they're all sent
in there and now we've got the issue
where we've got this title flexbox a
playout and we need this to go to the
right this to go to the left you might
be thinking yeah just add a bunch of
padding till it works out but remember
this is we're not sure what the screen
size is gonna be so we sort of need to
account for all the different screen
sizes whether it be bigger or smaller
and luckily for us we have the justify
content and remember space between what
that will do is it will take the extra
space which is right here and it's going
to put it in between the elements so how
many in between elements that we have
will we get three elements but we have
two spots one to the left of the F and
one to the right of the T that it's
going to divvy that space on up so
refresh oh yeah looking real good pretty
simple if I go in here and I were to
change this to less is cool you know
it's much smaller but it still works
perfectly no fiddling with floats and
text-align it just works perfectly so
that's good for that we've got this part
working and now really all we have left
to do is this icon bar here so let's
create ourselves a third section and
called the icon bar and before the icon
bar it's gonna be pretty simple well
grab that and we'll say display flex as
well and when that is flex sorry not
icon it's icon bar when the icon bar is
flex all of these links which are the
immediate children are going to become
Flex items and they go right beside each
other now we've got all this extra space
right here and what do we do to specify
the extra space well we apply a flex
grow and a flex rink on it so we will go
ahead and say icon bar a select all the
links and we'll simply just say flex one
and then what that will do is it'll set
a flex grow and a flex shrink of one
which means that the extra space or when
there's not enough space
they'll evenly get space or have it
get away from them so refresh oh very
nice right up into working so again just
a couple of lines of code understanding
that this is the power of flex box if I
were to ever resize this thing
horizontally or vertically everything
sort of just goes into place
so hopefully you like that one let me
know what you think and I'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
