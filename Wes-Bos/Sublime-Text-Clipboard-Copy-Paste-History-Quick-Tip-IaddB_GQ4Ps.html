texts power user I've got a really great
tip for you today on sublime text and
that is the clipboard history this is
one of those tips where I show people it
and they go oh man I had no idea
that's one could do that I didn't even
know that that was possible in other
applications that's really helpful to my
workflow so if you aren't familiar
clipboard history is the ability to kind
of have multiple things that you can
paste or copy paste or multiple things
in your clipboard and that's really
helpful because sometimes you're in some
code and you copy something and then you
head down to where you need to paste it
and exit and I copy something else now
where is that first one gone it's kind
of gone for good unless you have
clipboard history so the way it works is
really really simple right here I've
just got some JavaScript open this
obviously works with any little bit of
code and I'm just going to go ahead and
select one of these lines and I'm just
going to copy it my regular way so if
you're on Windows it's control V control
C if you're on Mac its command C or you
can do the right-click copy
pretty simple then maybe I'm going down
to the bottom somewhere around here and
then I actually I select this liner here
and I copy it as well now when I go and
paste it it's going to be controls walk
but what if I wanted that first one that
I copied well it's pretty simple rather
than just hitting command or control V
depending if you're on Mac or Windows
first hit command K and then hit your
regular command V and what you'll see is
this little pop-up box that we can
actually control with either a keyboard
or mouse definitely recommend you use
your keyboard and you've got all of the
items that you've recently copied so
this time scale one was the first thing
I copied I go ahead and hit enter and it
will paste it right in there now that's
really really cool because let me go up
here I can copy that one I can come
this one I can copy that one now when I
want to go ahead and paste again command
kV and you see I've got an entire list
of everything that I needed to paste I
also use this quite a bit is if you just
are on a line you can hit command X and
that will just cut the entire line so X
X X X I've gotten rid of a whole bunch
of lines now if I ever need to get just
one of those back because oops I deleted
like the middle one and I didn't want to
command K command V and I've got all of
them available to me right in here I can
hit enter and I'm off to the races
so just a really really quick tip
definitely will improve your workflow
when you accidentally copy something
over what you wanted rather than hitting
command Z commands Eid and going back to
what you want you can access those
things in your clipboard history so
that's it for more tips like this be
