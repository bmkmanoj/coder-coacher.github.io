you how to get the most out of slack so
if you're developer these tips are going
to help you out first one is code blocks
how do you post code into slack well
we've got three ways first of all you
can do it in line so you might want to
try salat say hey slack wha
did you try VAR x equals 100 and just
put them in back ticks and that will
give you surrounded one so again back
ticks R is that key above your tab now
if you have a little bit more code it's
multiple lines you do three back ticks
so one two three hold down shift and hit
enter which will bring you to the next
line but not actually send the message
pasting your code block there and then
end it off with three code blocks and go
ahead and hit enter that will surround
it in E entire one it doesn't highlight
or anything like that but if you would
like it you can go ahead and paste your
code in and hit command enter and what
that's going to do is it's going to
create a snippet as a piece of code so
maybe if you wanted someone to go ahead
and download it so this is JavaScript so
I'm going to go ahead and find
JavaScript and I'm going to give it a
title like bad code and create the
snippet and it's going to go ahead and
upload it and it will allow the person
to like go into it and have some syntax
highlighting I actually prefer this but
if you've got a longer code you can go
ahead and do that another little tip is
you can hit command shift V and just
paste it in so like I just normally did
a command V there but I held shift as
well and then that sort of created a
snippet as I pasted it so that is code
blocks and I'm going to go ahead and
discard that um next up what we have is
editing some code you want so maybe or
some message that you sent so maybe say
like hey how are you but you like spell
it wrong what you have to do is just hit
your up arrow key and allow you to go
ahead and edit it and you can hit enter
to go ahead the same thing happens if
you ever post some code in there and
then you're like oh no what if I done
just hit up arrow go to the top throw
some triple back ticks go to the bottom
throw your back ticks in and go and then
it will edit it and reformat it just as
you wanted you can also always go back
and delete the actual message another
quick one is if you want to jump to
different ones so like I wanted to go to
general here just hit command T or I
guess it's ctrl T and what that will do
is I'll bring open list of all your
conversations you can search
for it like maybe I won't talk to the
Dutch coder go ahead and hit enter he's
sending me silly messages and I didn't
have to use my mouse to go ahead and
click there and I want to go to general
I would just type general and hit enter
and it sends me up there these guys
they're being jokers you can also go
ahead and hold down your command in alt
I believe it's ctrl + Alt on Windows and
use your arrow keys and what this will
do is I'm just pressing arrow left and
arrow right and this just kind of cycles
you through your most recent so I was
like add slack bot then I was with Dutch
coder then I was in general and you
started to just go back and forth
between all your conversations so sort
of like switching tabs in Chrome or
something like that same same shortcut
but instead of switching tabs here
you're switching conversation so you
don't have to keep getting your mouse
and clicking the actual one that you
want
formatting how do you send things you
can send things that are strong so you
are really funny and if I wanted to make
funny I would just put it in put
asterisks around it and it would make it
star if I want italic I hope underscore
under it if I want to strike it out say
jokes put some Tilda's around it and it
will strike all three of those things
out if you've got multi-line things so
how again you hold down shift enter are
you go ahead and alas the weird thing if
you type something and wait it will try
to autocomplete it to someone's name so
make sure that you quickly enter your
thing what else we have we have commands
so if you've got a whole bunch of people
and like a hangout and people put all
kinds of gifts and annoying stuff like
or these are all YouTube embeds and it
starts to like really take away you can
just do collapse and that will just
immediately collapse everything in the
channel and it just sort of clears it up
for you you can go ahead and leave or
close or part if you have forward slash
you'll see a list of all the different
commands that you want so other than
trying to find like click around for it
just hit forward slash and you can type
in almost any command so I often do this
like for sauce message at the Dutch
coder enter and it will bring me over
to him you can also do shrug I'll just
put a shrug so if you have apathy
anything you can just use /to drug that
is it hopefully enjoyed it and get
socking thanks guys or thanks folks
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
