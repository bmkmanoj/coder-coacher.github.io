flex basis flex grow and flex rank in
how all that works and in this video I
want to take a little bit further and
see how it works when you maybe change
the direction of your accesses or if you
have items that wrap which is more
likely so I just got the Flex wrapping
in columns one open here again we're
just right back with our six little
emoji friends here that we're gonna be
working with so I've got display flex on
our Flex container and then on each of
our items like dot box I'll grab them
all I'm just gonna set a Flex basis of
500px and give it a save and you'll see
what happens is that since I gave it 500
px and this is that would be 500 plus
500 plus 500 refiner they're all clearly
not 500 pixels wide there are 233
pixels wide and how come well that's
because what is kicking in right now I
should ask you what's kicking in is the
Flex Gro kicking in is or is the Flex
shrink kicking in because do we have if
I don't have it after we have give the
500 pixels to each of them we actually
don't have enough room for all of these
six that'd be 3000 pixels wide and what
does our browser out right now we're at
about 1400 pixels wide so we just don't
have enough room for it and when you the
deep when you kick on flex drink the
default is 1 which means each item gets
enough space however we can go back to
our container and turn on Flex wrap and
just say wrap give it a save and refresh
and you can see okay that's interesting
now the items are now getting there if
you inspect one 500 pixel Flex basis on
and now we've got this extra space to
the right so you tell me how do we deal
with extra space well that
called flex Gro give it a save and now
each of them are going to be evenly
distributed between the two now where
this becomes kind of interesting is if I
select like box three for example and I
change the Flex grow to something
ridiculous like 10 and refresh look what
happens now previously we've only been
really working with one row and now
since we have flexwrap turned on flex
grow shrink and basis all of those work
only on the row that they are on so that
they don't have any effect on the item
before or after which is fantastic
because we don't have any sort of if I
look at the index here we don't have any
sort of weird HTML wrapping going on
here it's all just kind of working out
for us now what I want to do is change
the axis it's been a couple videos since
I've really nailed down access so by
default the access in flexbox the
default one is left to right as the main
access goes from left to right and the
cross access is from top to bottom so by
default the Flex Direction is what it's
row so if I just put on row does nothing
but if I change that from Row two column
what happens or refresh whoa what's
going on here interesting what just
happened let's let's kind of take peel
this back a bit if I take this Flex
basis off let me just take kind of
everything off here and refresh all
right so what's going on here the items
are stacking themselves vertically
because we've changed the accesses in
the main axis used to be left or right
now it's from top to bottom so our
elements are going from top to bottom
and now if I put a flex grow of one on
one of them and a flex grow of 10 let's
maybe not do ten let's do five on the on
the third one and refresh you'll notice
that nothing happens and that's because
again there is no height on this
container so if I were to put a boarder
10px solid golden rod let's get a new
color out of me keep it fun so see this
golden rod border here this is where it
ends at the bottom here so in order for
it to fill the available space there is
really no extra space and it's really
not hurting it vertically because
there's there's extra space here so what
we actually need to do again is put like
I'm in height on that and give it a save
and there we go
interesting what happens here is that if
I resize vertically you'll see that at
this point right here there is extra
space and because box 3 has a flux grow
of 5 it's going to get 5 times the
amount of extra space that this one has
in there now what happens if previously
when we were working with the left to
right in we ran out of space
horizontally it would wrap on to the
next line so what happens if we give
each of our items a flex basis of let's
say 250 px so each of them ideally will
be 250 px refresh now you'll see that
they just go all vertically right that's
each of them get their 250 pixels 250
and they'll go there's no extra space
there's no - there's not too much space
that's just because since we're working
vertically now we've got all the space
that we want browser scroll by default
top to bottom so the way we could fix
that is we could just put a hard height
on it instead of a min height and whoa
look what happened here let's just kind
of go through what's going on here is
we've got our 250 pixels for each one
however since box 3 has a flux grow of 5
it divvied up the 250 - to 50 the 250
and then there was a little bit left on
the bottom here and it gave three five
times as much as the rest and then
is where the really interesting part
comes in is that instead of when we had
them in rows where it would when it
would wrap around underneath it will
just wrap around to the side so you can
go ahead and give different flex bases
to all of the different ones that we
would want let's bring that down here
flex basis 100px and you'll notice that
Oh since now that one's 100px it
actually can fit inside of there and it
sneaks it down on there in five and six
why are they so big well because we
really only had two extra ones that we
went on here and by default it's going
to stretch them across evenly on the
available space so that's the way it
works like that if I see what happens
when we run out of space vertically here
once we hit that 250 250 250 plus 100
once we hit that limit vertically
there's no space for it but it does know
that it can put it right up here so it's
gonna wrap it around to the next column
and you can really go see if we just
duplicate this a couple times you can go
as far as you want and it makes them
pretty cool different layouts there when
you're really just working on your
vertical axis at a certain point they're
all just gonna they're all going to come
on to one column and you'll have a
horizontal scroll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
