a quick rundown of the tutorial about to
put up on the site what I've got here is
a real-time canvas drawing application
that I've built fairly simple but it
really shows the power of WebSockets
canvas and nodejs
so what I have here is just a simple
canvas element that I can draw too and
when I draw on to this element the data
is sent over a WebSockets over a
WebSocket on a node.js server and
interpreted by everyone that has the
window open and thus drawn on to their
canvas so I'm just going to open up a
few browser windows here and give you an
idea of what it does I just have my
WebSocket server running on Amazon ec2
in the tutorial I just show you how to
do it on localhost so just want to do
sudo node server j/s and that will start
our WebSocket server it's going to
refresh all of these pages
I just got it up and running in Firefox
Safari and chrome right now but a little
later on I'll show you a video of myself
doing it on a few other devices and
browsers so now that we're connected we
could just go ahead and draw
and as you can see whenever I make a
click and a drawing thing the data is
sent over the WebSocket to all of the
other browsers real-time and drawn to
canvas so that's that I'm going to cut
to video right now of myself doing it on
a few more devices including the iPad
touchpad iPhone and even ie9 and let me
know if you've any questions thanks a
lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
