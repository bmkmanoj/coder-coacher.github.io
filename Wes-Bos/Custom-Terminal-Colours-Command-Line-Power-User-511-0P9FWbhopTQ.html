of the more fun stuff in your terminal
and that is theming it or pimping it out
to look exactly how you want it so a lot
of people ask me and a lot of times you
see screenshots of developers working in
they've got all kinds of crazy colors I
got a really cool prompt and people
always asked like how did you get that
and how can I get something that's
similar to that so let's dive into that
now so let's start breaking it down by
there are two parts there are two kind
of different things that you need to
change in order to get colors the first
one is your prompt and the prompt is
essentially what shows up right here
when you hit enter so right now I've got
mine set up to show a little cross and
I've got my drop box and I've got kind
of my present working directory set up
right here
actually if I were to initialize a
github repository it would also show me
kind of what branch I'm on as well as
the state so right now it's yellow
because I have stuff to add if I were to
add everything and if I were to commit
that initial commit there we go and I
just committed it now it's green which
means that I don't have like a dirty
State or anything like that so kind of
nice to be able to customize your
earhole prompt as well as the colors
that surround it so that's the first
part I'm just going to hit command K to
clear everything out the second part is
the actual colors that get used so my
background here is kind of a blue color
this green here how does it know to use
that specific green or this specific
yellow this specific blue you get the
point right so those are actually the I
term or the terminal or whatever a
program you're using the colors are set
in that so let's start with that we'll
start with creating your own theme and
then once we've done that we'll move on
over into creating a custom prompts so
let's start with the kind of basic
colors the background and whatnot so
what we need to do is open up our
preferences so an easy way is command
and comma and I will open up your
preferences if you don't know how to do
that just go to I term in the top
left-hand corner and click on
preferences we want to head on over to
the profiles tab you think it might be
appearance but it's actually in profiles
and we're gonna create ourselves a new
profile a profile has all kinds of user
specific stuff in terms of like how many
lines should it keep or is there
transparency on the window or is my
cursor a box or is it a vertical bar or
what is it so we want to go ahead and
create our own one so on the left hand
here click the plus button and we'll go
ahead and call it my color scheme and by
default it actually doesn't set it the
star is the active one right now I'm
using cobalt 2 by OS boss that's the
theme that I've created but we're gonna
create a new one so select it on the
side here click other actions and set as
default and what that will do is it will
set that one as your default color
scheme it still says new profile but if
you click away and back it'll say my
clothes team what we want to do is go
ahead and open up a brand new tab and
you'll notice that the color scheme
actually didn't change well it did but
we haven't changed again it's it's
inherited the styles from the previous
one in my case it's the blue one in your
case it may be a little bit different so
what we want to do is click on the
colors tab here and at the bottom we
have the ability to do loading presets
or even importing one that you found
online so you may say hey I like cobalt
- I've got it available up on github
right here and you want to download this
cobalt to I term colors we'll head back
here load presets import you to be able
to select that file however now let's
let's build our own so load presets
let's start maybe if you click on pastel
it gives you a default pastel dark gives
you a dark color tango here let me get
some stuff on the screen here so we can
see exactly what everything is
go into the command line ll LS just l
PWD just to get some stuff on the screen
and see what that looks like now if we
go ahead and select some of the colors
here you see the background is by
default black but if I were to slide
this bar around and just kind of select
whatever colors I want you'll see a
changes in real time so that's the
background we have these ANSI colors
here so black what color is black maybe
you want like just a bit of a you can
see that black is being used for the the
text here so if I change that black to
be like maybe like a slightly different
black you might like look of that the
red the yellow that's what I did in mind
the default yellow is this kind of muddy
yellow and I like it to be nice and
bright so I brought it right up green
this green I think is being used for my
tag right here so if I change this green
to be something a little bit more in
line with with what I want you can see
you get the point you have all of these
available colors and you're able to
change it however you're not able to say
I want this to be blue I don't want this
thing to be green you're simply able to
say when a program uses green when a
program uses red when the program uses
blue use this color blue and it'll go
along so that's your basic color scheme
how you want it you can also take a look
at some of these things you can play
around with the cursor you can play
around if you want an underline see it's
just an underline there for me or you
want a vertical bar you want a box if
you want to blink you can do that I'm
sure if I go here see it blinks you can
change your font which is something that
we're going to need to do in just a
second as well as a non ASCII font so
that's the basic colors I recommend that
you play around and have some fun with
that or just jump online and there's all
kinds of I term color files available
out there so I'm going to switch back to
my cobalt theme
it just made a mess of this right here
so set as default if I close this down
and I open up a brand new one or if I
just go back here I am back on my nice
blue cobalt theme in the next video
we're going to take a look at the prompt
in how do we get a custom prompt as well
as what are the different themes that we
can use
