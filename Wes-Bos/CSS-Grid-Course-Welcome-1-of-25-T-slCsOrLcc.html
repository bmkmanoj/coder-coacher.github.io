for checking out the CSS grid a couple
things before we get going first thank
you so much to Firefox for sponsoring
this course the reason why they are free
is because they have sponsored my time
in order to create them we're going to
be using their dev tools all throughout
this course because there are fantastic
when dealing with CSS grid a couple
other things to get the most out of this
course the all the videos are captioned
so if you like captions on your videos
if you need the captions on your videos
make sure you turn those on and you'll
be able to read what I'm saying as at
the same time that I'm speaking through
it second post your progress on Twitter
and Facebook I always like to see how
far people are getting through the
course what they've learned what they
really enjoyed what they didn't like I'm
at West's boss on Twitter and the
hashtag for this course is hashtag
gritty up GRI ddy u P what else did we
got here pay it forward what we really
need in terms of the CSS grid on the
Internet is lots and lots of content out
there so whether you're writing or view
of this course or writing summaries of
each of the videos or just creating your
own CSS grid content on your blog or on
YouTube whatever it is I encourage you
to do that and share what you've learned
with the rest of the people if you would
like to link back to them there's a list
in the readme on github for this you can
send a pull request to link off to your
blog or your to your YouTube videos in
terms of like how should you do these
videos it's totally up to you some
people like to watch them all at first
and then try to do the exercises and the
things that we've done some people
prefer to watch them first and then
watch them again and code along with me
and other people prefer just to code
along with me as I'm doing it so try a
couple different ways and see what works
best for you other than that make sure
you go ahead and grab a friend if you're
someone who likes to take these courses
with someone else maybe have a bit of a
support system and accountabilibuddy we
called them in the JavaScript 30 course
make sure you grab someone and maybe
meet up for coffee a couple times a week
and and go through them together other
than that I hope you enjoy the course
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
