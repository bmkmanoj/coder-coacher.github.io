install that Sh on our computer and
hopefully understand a little bit about
it so what I've done here is I've
actually created a new account on my
computer just so that I can show you
what it is and how we can install it
right from scratch so all I've got here
is your Safari in an empty terminal
window I'm actually don't even have item
to open to install it so what Zen Sh is
is a shell that runs on your computer so
if we back it up a little bit and open
up our terminal window you'll probably
something see something just like dollar
sign or or maybe in mind this is bash
33.2 and what that is is a shell that
runs on your computer and it allows us
to do things like we did in the last
video for creating files moving folders
traversing going just moving around on
our computer via the terminal ash is one
of the most popular shells out there
however people have said I can improve
upon it and have created their own
shells so Z shell or Zed SH is one of
the most popular ones especially among
developers that do a lot of git and gulp
or grunt or a lot of terminal stuff that
we do it it really makes our job a lot
easier
there's another one called fish shell as
well as a whole handful of other shells
that are pretty handy so o mais SH is
actually a framework that's built upon
zat a sage so Bash and Zed SH are the
shells
Oh mais datastage is a framework built
on top of it that makes our lives even
easier so you can think of it if you're
coming from the web development world
JavaScript would be thatís a CH and o
mais that Sh would be like jQuery or
honor score like a framework built on
top of it so to install it I've just got
a blank shell here it doesn't matter
what directory you're in because we're
just going to paste something in there
and I'm over at the Zetas sage website
at o mais sh you can also grab this info
off of the github
so there's two ways to install via curl
or double you get girl is just a little
thing that's installed on almost every
machine chances are it'll work for you
so just go ahead and copy this little
line right here if you get an error
that's as a command not found curl try
the dub you get one but we're gonna go
ahead and copy this one head over to a
terminal again doesn't matter where you
are
paste it in hit enter what it's gonna do
is go ahead and install it all for us so
it's downloading a bunch of stuff it's
creating files and now it's trying to
change the shell for screencast so in
this case screencast is my username so
yours might be Ryan or whatever whatever
your name is so type in my password hit
enter and it says oh my said SH is now
installed some links to their Twitter
etc etc kind of cool however you still
see dollar sign or bash so you don't
have to worry about this after you open
a new tab because that Sh will be set to
the default shell so let's open up a new
tab in here and right away you can see
that my prompt here has changed a little
bit so it's colorful it's got a little
arrow there's this little tilde if i
type LS just l you can see that there's
all of my documents I've got some
highlighting CD and desktop you can see
that it adds the desktop folder right
here to my prom so right away I'm gonna
close down my bash shell you might get
something like this terminate good now
I'm running you can even see it right
here
zedd Sh I am up and running with my Z
show so that's all we need to know for
now as long as we have it installed
we're good to go in the next videos
we're going to take a look at what are
all the features of it and how do we
customize it like we want a cool theme
we want a cool prompt etc etc so see you
in the next video
