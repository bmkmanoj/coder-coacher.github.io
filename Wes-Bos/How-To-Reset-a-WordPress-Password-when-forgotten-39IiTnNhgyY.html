give you a quick tip today I had
somebody asked me how to reset the
password on a wordpress account it's
actually pretty easy so let me just show
you how to do it this is the screen you
generally would hit if you're not sure
what the password is it'll shake a bunch
of times and you finally just give up
what you need to do is go into your host
provider whatever it may be you go Daddy
whatever may go to the database section
of it and then click Edit databases if
you're not sure what your database
password and username are open up your
ftp and go into WP dash config-if on
your database name here you'll find the
the username to get into it right here
and the password to get into it here I'm
just on localhost so it's just rude
route but you're so you're should be
something a little more secure once you
have that you can log into your PHP my
admin and you'll see a screen that looks
like this on the side there's a table
that will say WP underscore users click
that and then go over to browse and
basically what this is the database that
drives your blog so you'll see a list of
all of your users here right here says
the users password that's obviously not
your password but it's encrypted in
something called md5 so I just want to
go ahead and click the edit button and
just get rid of that that's your old
password there's no way you can really
unencrypted that so you just want to
delete it and then you want to type in
your new password
and then this is the important part
where you click md5 so what's that's
what that is going to do is going to
take your new password and crypt it in
md5 and then store it in the database so
let's click go and everything is good
and you can see that our new password is
now encrypted here if we go over to our
min and type in new password we're able
to login successfully so there you are
if you have any questions please feel
free to leave a comment and I'll be sure
to answer them thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
