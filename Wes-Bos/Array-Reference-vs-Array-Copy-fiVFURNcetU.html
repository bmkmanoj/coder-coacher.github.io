a question about references versus
actually copying specifically regards to
an array that look like this we have an
array of cards and then we have a shoe
which is basically like a copy of the
cards array which you take cards from
and what was happening is as you take a
card out of the shoe use finding that
the the cards array also would would be
depleted so I'm just going to
demonstrate what it means to have a
reference versus an actual copy so right
now I've got this card's array and I've
assigned shoe to card so if I console
dot log shoe and I also console.log
cards on page load we should see we both
get we get two arrays that are exactly
the same now let's say we wanted to do
something to this shoe array here for
example let's say we just want to take
one off the front so or off the end so
they should pop or whatever method
you're using to to take one off of that
array and give that a save now and if we
look at shoe you'll now see that seven
is gone but now if I look at cards you
also see that seven is gone similarly if
I were to say shoe of 0 equals less is
cool now shoo is the first one is
obviously wes is cool just like we did
but if I go and see what cards are that
also is wes is cool and that's because
we did not take a copy of the array
right here we simply just referenced it
so shoe is not its own array it's just
pointing towards this original cards
array so how do we actually take a copy
there's a really nice stack overflow
thread that goes over all of the
possible types that we have here and it
really boils down to what type of data
do you have so in this case where if
it's just strings or numbers things like
that you can use a couple ones like this
we could say shoe equals cards not slice
and what that will do is just going to
take a copy of the entire array now if I
console.log cards and shoe after we do
something to it let me let's do shoes 0
equal
I changed now hopefully cards will be
the the original and shoe will be our
new one there we go Ace King Joker 7 I
am change game Joker right so we took
one off with pop and we reassign the
first one with change so that is good
another way you could do it is you could
take a blank array and call concat on it
and just pass it cards that's going to
take the blank array and concatenate in
the new one so give that a save you
still get the same same way there's a
couple other ones right here there's
some really nice libraries like dollar
extend and jQuery or we have extended
clone deep it depends if if you have an
array of objects sometimes you might
need this although you might want to ask
yourself do I need an entire copy of the
entire thing or you can use
json.stringify finally we have a new one
in es6 that's called the spread and what
we could do save our shoe equals make a
new array and we spread all the items
from cards onto it what does that do
it's going to take every item from the
cards array and apply it into this brand
new array that's what a spread does it
takes each item from something and puts
it into the new container so that's
another way to take a copy of the actual
array C exact same thing so again to
summarize if you want to take a copy of
an array in modify one but keep the
existing one in intact you need to take
a copy of it and make sure that it's not
just a reference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
