New York Times implemented a paywall
recently and what that is is when you
viewed more than 20 articles in a month
it throws up an overlay onto your page
and says hey you should buy the premium
like this what they didn't do is
actually hide the content when you have
viewed too many times because I still
want to reap the benefits of the SEO so
I was on Reddit and I saw this guy
posted for JavaScript lines that have
feed the New York Times paywall
basically just what he did is using
their own prototype library he just hid
the two overlays and then set the body
back to scroll I thought that would make
a great Chrome extension so I hopped
into it and then I realized that you
don't need even neat JavaScript to do
this you can do it with two lines of CSS
so here it is let me just create a
little bigger for you we just want to
hop hop get the overlay and the gateway
creative those are two divs that pop up
I'm gonna display:none
and set the visibility to hit it in just
in case and then we after that we just
want to set the body back to scroll they
said they said it to not to scroll so
just open up the manifest at JSON file
to make it a Google Chrome extension
fill in all of this make sure it matches
on your x and bring a little bigger for
you again and then we just want to load
in our CSS file when you let it so go to
your extensions load unpacked extension
select the folder that you have it in
back here and refresh it
now LePage is fully unloaded and we
don't get that overlay anymore you can
go over onto any other page and we're
not going to get that overlay so that's
hidden for now until New York Times
finds a better way than CSS to foil
everyone all right thanks a lot see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
