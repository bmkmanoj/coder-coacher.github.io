that bugs you is that we can't hot
reload our reducers just yet that means
that we can open up a like photo
component right here and this is a
component because it's a component no
problem
- hot reload it I can add something like
hello and give it a save and you'll see
that immediately it will show up here
without me having to refresh the page or
really change around any of the existing
stuff but if I try to change a reducer
like right here let's say for every
person that likes I want to have 10
likes so I'll change that to 10 and it
gives us this little warning here that
says you can't it can't hot updated or
hot reload it it needs to have a full
refresh so we give it a refresh and now
when I like it it's gonna go up by 10
but then I want to go back to 1 it's
going to yell at me for the exact same
thing so we can actually hot reload
reducers just as we hot reload our
components and the way that we do that
is you open up your storage a/s and you
need to accept the hot reload and you
need to rear acquire the reducer and
what that's going to do is it's going to
recompile the reducer and swap it out
inside of the store without us ever
having to do a page refresh so first of
all we check if the module is hot then
we accept it and we run a function that
is going to rear acquire and swap out
the module for us so we're going to
we're going to grab it and we use
require here because you cannot use an
ESX import statement inside of a
function it must be done at top level so
we have to use the common J's required
syntax that you may be used to from node
or from some earlier module loading so
we're going to require our main reducer
which is the top level index 1 and if
you don't remember that let's let's just
take a quick look this is the one that
pulls in posts and comments and combines
them into a reducer we're essentially
going to rear acquire this whole thing
and load it back in and hit this type
default on the end because we're using
common J's syntax and then finally we
just replaced the entire reducer with
store dot replace or do
and we pass it our next route reducer so
give that a save and now one last
refresh I'm going to go back into my
photo or sorry my posts reducer here and
change this to ten and now when I like
it there we go
change it went up to 66 maybe I'll make
it too now I click it again
it's gonna go up to 68 and I bring it
back to 10 now it should go to 78 good
now it is hot reloading our reducers and
every single time that we make a change
to it it's going to be playing back all
of the state changes on top of it and
then the next video what we're going to
do is we're going to be looking at the
redux dev tools which is going to help
us visualize in time travel between all
of this happening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
