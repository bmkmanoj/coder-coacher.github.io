rundown on how nth child will actually
works because this is cause for a lot of
confusion with people so what I've got
here is I've got a div with a class of
posts in a whole bunch of articles each
of them having a class of post will look
at that special in just a second so if I
want to select like the second one right
here what would I do well I would go
down here and say dot post and child 2
and that would just grab the second one
and we'll give it a background of medium
spring green and when we refresh you see
that the second one is highlighted and
that makes sense right you want the
second one and it gives you the second
one but what happens is sometimes people
will come around and go okay all of our
selectors are working I'll just pop a
quick h2 in there and say maybe like
posts and now when i refresh the first
one is selected and that's because of
the way that these ends of child
selectors work is it doesn't select what
you asked for and then filter it out for
the second one it looks for what you
want then immediately looks for the
parent which in this class is post and
then it says okay well this is the
parent of the thing that I selected now
let's go ahead and find the second one
and because we added in this element
here this article one is technically the
second element in that so that kind of
throws us for a loop and a real quick
thing we can do to fix that is instead
of child we can say n of type give that
a save and that will bring us back to
where we want it
however what if we have these like a
class of special on these articles and
we wanted to we wanted to select a
special and the background is going to
be light golden rod yellow got it and
you see that the ones with the class of
special are now let me put that special
on another one here they're now being
highlighted however what if I wanted to
get the second special right so you
might think okay maybe I can use ents
child here so say and child to give it a
save go back here and refresh you notice
it's not being applied to anything and
maybe think oh because it's green was
overwriting it and select it and I don't
see the selector happening anywhere and
that's because the way that it works is
that these ends child in these
of type and all the enth ones they don't
apply to the specific selector the
selector is simply there for selecting
the element and then it looks at the
parent and goes down to find the actual
child that I want so in this case
because we're looking for something that
is the second child but also has a class
is special nothing like that exists so
it's not going to highlight anything for
us so really what we want is something
like nth of selected where that will
give us the second one selected but we
just don't have that in CSS I'm not sure
if it's coming or not but ideally that
would be what we want so something to
think and sort of keep in mind when
you're building your nth trial selectors
that if you were just to add a second
one or if you're trying to select it
based on class like enth of class we
don't have selectors like that and you
need to plan accordingly all right

have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
