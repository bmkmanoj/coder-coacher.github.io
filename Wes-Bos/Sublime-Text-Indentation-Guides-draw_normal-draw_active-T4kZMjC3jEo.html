real quickly about indentation
guidelines in sublime text in a setting
that not a lot of people know about so
when when you're working with some code
that is based on indentation which is
what I'm working with right here is just
some Jade templating language but this
could be any programming language it
could be CoffeeScript it could be Python
or even some languages like JavaScript
or XML or anything that's not even based
on indentation you just want to maintain
good indentation yourself so when you're
working with languages like this it's
really important to understand what
level that your indented in so here I
have some Jade I have dot row and then
inside of that item and then I scroll
down here and I have this dot getting
and usually what happens to me is I look
at this whole page and I go okay is dot
getting inside of dot row or is it a
sibling to not row especially if this
page was three or four times length it
is right now so usually what I do is I
point my cursor there and kind of just
follow it up and then I realize that
okay it's the same level of item so
let's that's kind of a pain in the butt
so there's something that you can do
with salon text that will help you out
quite a bit with this so we're gonna
head over to my preferences file and we
see here we have indent guide options
and right now I just have drawn normal
which is actually the default so if you
don't see this at all that's because the
default of sublime is draw normal and
what that means is it it gives us these
indentation guidelines all throughout
every indentation however there's a
second option that we can add to this
right here and it is called draw active
so if I do comma draw others were active
and give it a save and head back to this
file you'll see that now we have three
different kinds of colors showing up
first we have this yellow one which is
showing the active indentation level
and then if you take a quick look here
you can see that this parent one which
is kind of the stacked version is a
lighter blue and then the children ones
that aren't currently active are in a
darker blue so this is really helpful so
if I could go back to my example of
getting and just click this I can see
right away when I click on getting ro is
the parent item would be a sibling of it
right and I can also see from a glance
if I were to click on this that it's
inside of row and it's inside of dot
what so by default sublime text is going
to give you some colors for this and the
colors of these completely depend on
your theme so I'm using the cobalt 2
theme which I've created here and you
can install it on package control or
from github and I went ahead and styled
them myself so that I'm getting this
lighter blue here this darker blue here
and then this prominent yellow one for
the active one if you want to add it to
your own theme that you're working on
you simply just go over to your theme
file and you add guide active guide and
stack guide and these are the three
colors that we are seeing here otherwise
just go ahead and install the cobalt 2
theme or any other reputable theme that
will probably support it all right
thanks a lot talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
