when you explicitly define our columns
and you don't define any rows they are
just automatically created which is what
we call implicit now let's talk about
this thing called grid Auto flow and
it's I don't think this is something
you're going to be using all the time
because it determines if your your new
elements are added as rows or as columns
but let's learn it just in case you ever
do want to do one of those horizontally
scrolling elements so let's open up o 6
and autoflow start I've got two items
here and I've displayed gridded it let's
turn on our dev tools just to make sure
we're sort of watching what's going on
here now let's add two columns real
quick so grid template columns 400px
200px good give it a save and you see
that we have one row two columns and
we've explicitly defined the two columns
now what happens when we add a third
item well you should know this by now
that it will automatically be wrapped on
to the next line and we will have an
implicit row that has been created now
grid autoflow what that will do is it
will determine whether when you need to
add another row or column because we've
only defined enough for two spots here
but we have three so what do we do with
the extra it will define whether that is
then created in a row which is the
default or if it tacks it on to the
right-hand side over here or actually
one little neat thing is depending on
which direction your language is in some
some languages CSS grid will read left
to right but that's a that's another
video so it will determine whether we'll
tack it on to a row or another column so
by default when we can go in here we can
say grid auto flow and if we say row
it's not gonna do anything because
that's the default the other option is
column and what that will do whew look
what we got here let's change this to
black and see when we got now you can
see that the extra item is not being
created as a row but it is now being
created as
extra column so as we add extra items in
here but I do to do you'll see that they
are all automatically added and they
will go to the right and eventually
cause a horizontal scroll to actually
happen and then we could also go in here
and say grid Auto columns maybe we want
them to be 200 pixels wide and now this
grid Auto columns is saying anything
that any columns that have been
implicitly created do I need to zoom in
dotted line that means it's being
implicitly created you see the solid one
defines where the explicit grid ends
then those will be 200 pixels and you
can see that they scroll and I've got
some fun stuff going on with my
background here because of the gradient
that starts and stops so again I haven't
found a whole lot of use case for that
maybe you you will find a use case for
wanting them to go left to right or
right to left instead of top to bottom
in flexbox we sort of have a similar
thing with Flex direction which by
default when you add a flex item they go
left to right but you can also flip it
to be a column and it will go top to
bottom as well as reverse there is no
reverse in CSS grid other than that that
is grid autoflow you can change it to
row or column or and pretty cool one is
actually this called grid Auto flow
dense but that's pretty cool it'll sort
of like fit them in where they're spaced
but we need to learn a little bit more
about sizing these actual items first
before we can get into that dense one
see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
