will probably save your ass in the
future and that is using trash instead
of our M so if you're not familiar our M
is a way to remove files and folders via
the command line and when you want to
delete something
let me move into a folder here and touch
delete me dot mark down if I wanted to
delete something I would do
RM elite me MD and then it's gone right
however if you have a folder and you
want to delete something like delete me
there's a folder there if I type RM
delete me it says it's a directory so
you actually have to type RM - R and it
will delete the directory if there's
directories inside of that you have to
pass more flags and not only is it hard
to use
however it's terribly destructive in
that it doesn't throw it into your trash
so let me show you that again I just
emptied my trash there and you can see
in my trash here is totally empty if I
touch hi dot MD it's there are my MD
enter make sure it's gone however my
trash is still empty and no that's
really scary if you accidentally delete
the wrong thing there is no undo we've
all been there we've all accidentally
deleted the wrong thing and we go to the
trash and and generally it's there if
you're using the gooey however it's not
there if you just use RM I've even heard
of stories of people doing RM I'm not
even going to type it because it scares
me RM tilde and what that does actually
deletes your entire home directory and
sometimes your even your entire computer
so don't use RM it goes as far as just
remapping it to trash if you're used to
using it
what trash will do is it essentially
just it'll move it into your trash so
worst case you can get it out of your
trash just like we're used to by using
the GUI so the way that we install it
is installing it globally with NPM if
you don't know what NPM is just go to
node.js org Mitch make sure you install
node
it comes with NPM and you'll be good to
go from there
so just go ahead and copy this and paste
it into your terminal it doesn't matter
where you are because it's going to
install it globally and what that will
do is it will make available this new
command called trash and you can use it
just like RM except you don't have to
pass it any arguments it will know that
you just want to delete a folder or
folder with things in it or a file so
let's make something called garbo
MD let's whoops let's go ahead and make
some files and folders so I'm just gonna
make a directory called delmy I'm going
to make a couple files here let's call
it touch garbo MD touch wes is cool dot
txt
all right just ll okay I've got my as a
folder there I've got garbo I'm gonna go
into the delmy folder and touch hi dot
txt just so that I know that there's
something in there okay so we've got one
file to file we've got a folder in
itself has a file in it so what we can
then do is open up your trash make sure
that there's nothing in there then we'll
say trash garbo and you can use your tab
completions from zetas sage here so
garbo de md enter nothing happens
however now if you go into your trash
and you'll see it's right there if I do
ll you'll notice it's gone however I can
totally go back and restore it if I
wanted to from my trash I can do trash
dull me
you'll notice that it's it's in there
same with the the folder inside of it it
didn't have to pass it any weird flags
well it's left trash wes is cool you
probably get the point by now it's
totally gone they are all in the trash
here
so super handy please please start using
trash don't use RM although you may be
safe with it now you're accidentally
going to do it you're going to be sleepy
one day and all of your files are gone
it's irrecoverable hopefully you liked
