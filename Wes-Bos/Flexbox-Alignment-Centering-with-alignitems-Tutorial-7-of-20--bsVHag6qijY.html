look at justify content which if you
remember it's a way to align the items
this whole kind of group of one to ten
it's the left to the right space between
we could Center them as well and the
main thing that we took away from
justify content is that it aligns this
group of items on the main axis so by
default the main axis is left to right
however we did also look at changing
that the main access from left to right
to top to bottom when we used what was
it flex direction column so again when
you have flex Direction column it
changes the accesses by defaults left to
right now that makes it from top to
bottom okay
you're probably sick of me saying that
but I just want to drive at home let's
now talk about the next one which is a
line item so if we go here take a look
at Chris coiours CSS tricks alliant
items is kind of similar however the
main thing is we're not concerned about
the main axis which is left to right
we're more concerned about the cross
access which is by default top to bottom
so the one thing we need to go ahead and
do here is if I just go and say a line
items Center and give it a save because
this is this is what I'll everyone kind
of goes ahead and do they go oh flux box
is great at vertically centering items
I'm just gonna pop a quick line item
center refresh and everyone gets really
frustrated because hey it's not actually
centering my items at all and the reason
is is because we're vertically centering
things here along the cross access this
container with the pink border around it
there's actually no room for it to then
go ahead so we need to make sure that
this container has some sort of height
on it now if if you're one of your
contents we're a lot bigger than another
like for example if this ten would drop
a little bit down you might not need
this but for our cases let's pop a quick
height on it so it's a height 100 VH and
there
go oh look at that it vertically
centered them automatically this is we
have this aligned item center right here
so let me just take that off real quick
and give it a refresh this is what
happens by default where we've got all
of our items and by default the aligned
items is set to something called stretch
so stretch well then if we put it in
here you see like nothing happens it
just starts at the top of the container
and it will stretch yourself all the way
to the bottom of the container so we
also have Center which will vertically
Center them so again we're still in rows
here but we are vertically centering
them we've also got flex start which
will start them all the way at the top
even though that this space is available
for us we've got flex end which will
start it at the end and then the other
one so we've got start and center
stretch to default the kind of cool one
is this thing called baseline which it
looks at the text in your new changes to
baseline it looks at the text in your
items and we'll make sure that the
bottom of every single letter number
whatever is in there is aligned properly
no you we can't really see that much now
because they're all the same size but if
I go ahead and change it like box one
about size 30 PX and I'll see some other
ones box 3 on size 150 box for font size
200 oh no how crazy we get here that so
they can take a bigger bigger um maybe
I'll do a couple more box 5 on size 10
and 10 so and again this is not pixel
specific it could be M's rims VH
whatever you want so when i refresh now
you'll notice that these are all of
different sizes the the height of these
items is dependent on however big the
font is however if you take a line and
just draw it right underneath every text
it's all going to be perfectly in line
with the base line of the font which is
extremely handy a lot of times you get
these designs from designers and you've
got like maybe like on the left you got
a title and on the right
got like the date and those are two
different sizes and to try to vertically
or sort of align them on the baseline of
the font it's kind of tricky you end up
just kind of pushing them around with
maybe position:relative or some margin
or padding or something like that so
being able to just say a line items
baseline right along there oh that that
is so nice to have and it will just
figure it all out for you let's do what
we did last time is change the direction
so again tell me our main access left to
right our cross access top to bottom
again so this is top to bottom so if we
did flex direction column we are
switching our accesses which here is
it's all gonna start it along the
left-hand side of it but if I change
this to a line item center and refresh
that's kind of cool what happens here is
that our cross access is no longer top
to bottom it's left to right and it's
going to align the items along that down
the center so again very similar to
justify content just helpful for us to
know there the main thing I want to take
away from that is that it's on the cross
I guess access and needs a height to
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
