about just a simple flex property in
which that when you have extra space or
when things get cut down you don't have
enough space how will things distribute
the extra space or chop themselves down
when you have not enough space and we
were actually going ahead and just using
the Flex property and setting it to
things like one in two and what that
essentially means and we should be using
this but buy a one we actually have
three properties that are packed into
this one property there it's something
called flex grow and there's another one
called flex shrink and we have a third
one called
flex basis now what flex grow is is
essentially when we have extra space how
should we divide it amongst everybody on
the same line so what I'm gonna do here
is if I take that flex off I go to my
box and I just say Flex grow one and
refresh that's exactly what we were
doing before and we are also doing
something called flex shrink one
so again if you set flex to be one what
it does is it it's a shorthand for
setting flex grow to one and flex shrink
to one so flex grow is pretty pretty
easy to understand I think when you have
extra space how much extra should it
take but before we get into these to
much we actually need to look at the
third one which is called flex basis and
essentially what flex basis is in an
ideal world before we start growing and
shrinking before we start taking the
extra space and allotting it between all
of our Flex items how big should it be
how wide should the actual element be or
how high should the element be if we are
switching our axis
again our main axis is left-to-right
cross axis is top to bottom
so let's actually I've just made this
super simple example because this is a
little bit hard to follow along with if
you open up the Flex grow and shrink one
and I'm just gonna go ahead and select
box one and I want to say a flex basis
let's do 400px
and same for box 2 let's do that so
let's just go ahead and say here in an
ideal world each of these boxes would be
400 pixels wide assuming that the
wrapper of the container is going to be
800 so when i refresh there and I
inspect these elements here you'll see
that this one is 400 pixels wide and
that one is 400 pixels wide so take note
that that says 380 how come because I
got 10 padding in 10 on the other side
so in an ideal world that is 400 by 400
and that's great except well the
question is what happens when we have
extra room which is where our flex grow
comes in in this case we do have extra
room where should that extra room go
should one or two how should they divvy
it up between the two of them so on box
one we can go ahead and say Flex grow
and let's just say 1 and see what that
does
so what do you think should happen if
you set flex grow on this guy to 1 and
then nothing on this one refresh well
that's interesting so what happened
there is that we didn't apply anything
on box 2 for flex grow and if we inspect
it see look it's still 400 pixels wide
and then box 1 just ate up the rest of
it so what that tells us is the default
flex grow for anything is 0 essentially
it means when there is extra room
do anything which is essentially the
default when if we don't put flex grow
on anything when there is extra room
don't do anything just stay at your
ideal space however we're not really
that interested in that because we want
to go ahead and put aggro on it of just
I'll just put a one on each of them and
that's not gonna do much because it's
going to evenly distribute it however
now if I take this box one in make it
let's just do two I'm gonna put my
cursor where the middle is and refresh
you see that it moved to the right just
a little bit more because now box one is
getting twice as much of the extra room
as box two now where this is really
noticeable is if you make Flex grow like
something like 10 now one is getting 10
times the amount of extra space that 2
is so that's great and if I open up my
dev tools here and I go ahead and resize
my browser you'll see in the top right
hand corner it's telling us exactly how
wide main browser is so right now it's
1,400 ish pixels wide so that's great
because we've got extra room extra room
400 plus 400 is 800 and we've got all
kinds of extra space there but what
happens if I then bring my browser down
to let's go to 800 pixels okay look
let's inspect them real quick okay
they're both 400 so this is where flex
basis kicks in they're both ideally 400
pixels but now my question is what
happens when we go under 400 pixels
you'll notice that in in regular float
so just break on to the next line but in
this case they sort of start just
chopping themselves down a little bit
because we don't have any sort of
wrapping turned on with Flex box just
yet so that's where flex shrink comes in
so if flex grow is how do we deal with
the extra space available to us flex
shrink
is how do we sort of slim ourselves down
when there really isn't enough space for
all of us so again ideally would be 400
but we really just don't have the the
pixels to do that so how should we kind
of slim ourselves down so I'm gonna go
ahead and the default Flex shrink is one
so you'll notice that if I bring it
really really skinny here you'll notice
that that one's 279 and that one's also
279 so the default for flexbox is that
when there's not enough room just evenly
divide it amongst yourselves and
everyone's happy however we might not
want that um so what we could go ahead
and say is flex shrink and I'm gonna put
an outrageous number right on here and
say 10 again and refresh so let's go
back down to our 800 okay here and then
here we go watch what starts to happen
Oh interesting
so we put a flex shrink on one of 10 and
to the second box does not air it takes
up way more room than that so what that
tells us about flex rink is it's a
number as to how much of myself should I
give up
in proportion to the other one so you'll
notice that box 2 doesn't have flex rink
but again the default is 1 so when we
have not enough room I'm going to shrink
myself 10 times more than box - now
that's a bell rageous you might do
something like like 5 I'm gonna shrink
myself 5 times less or more than a box
to refresh you'll see there so - guys it
and that's really handy in responsive
design if you've got a content in a
sidebar where if you've got the space
you can do a really nice design when
you're in your kind of ideal scenario
you you can split it up evenly and then
once you get really small you can sort
of say alright this is how you should
handle it and we're not dealing with
floats we're not dealing with any sort
of adding up you know in
floats you need to make sure you always
hit 100% in this case I'm going ahead
and I'm using pixels you can use MS or
REMS or really anything you want
so that's flex basis grow and shrink now
you probably will never go ahead and
write it like this because we want to
use the property just simply flex so
we'll say flex we first say the grow
then we say the shrink and then we say
the basis and that's in a nice single
line and then we'll go ahead and do this
one as well
flex is going to be one one 400px and we
do it all in one go so even if you're
not going to be setting the basis like
if you just do something like that or
even like we did before you just set it
to simply one it's recommended that you
set it in this shorthand because the
browser is going to kind of look at your
your layout and intelligently figure out
how big these two other ones
should be which is kind of cool you give
up a little bit of control that you
might be used to with setting hard wits
and and floats with your regular CSS but
that's the beauty of flexbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
