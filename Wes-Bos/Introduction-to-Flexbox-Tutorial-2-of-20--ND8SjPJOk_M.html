video in this video I'm going to get you
set up with flexbox I want to make sure
that you're comfortable with the markup
that we're being going to be using as
well as comfortable with the two
fundamental concepts of Flex container
and Flex item so what do we got here
we've got a div of the console container
inside that I have a whole bunch of
boxes so this is going to be our Flex
container and each of these are going to
be our Flex items now these don't have
to be divs they could be really anything
you want images sections paragraph tags
whatever you really want but for the
case of simplicity here I've just done
plain old divs I've given them classes
just so I can style them but again
that's not totally necessary in the CSS
here I've just got some normalized got
my border box again not necessary for
flex box this right here just gives it
some basic styling as well as some
colors for the background there so
forget that refresh here this is what
we've got
we just got div all the way across each
one is sort of stacked on top of each
other now we can on line 31 here we're
going to go ahead and start writing our
Flex box and the way that we do that is
we define the container as display flex
now that's really important because you
might be coming to this thinking like
okay we have display block in line in
line block and none and a couple of
other kind of edge case ones and this is
a totally new way to think about laying
out your website so if you're really
coming at this from the perspective of
something like I'm bringing my floats
here and bring in my wits and I'm
bringing my percentage we sort of have
to put that aside and and kind of take
this in as something that's new to us so
if I set that to be display flex and
give us a refresh watch what happens
okay so what happened there is my
container here let me put a border on it
10px solid goldenrod give it a save you
see that the Flex container it goes all
the way across the
prior page and that's similar to block
level elements however we also have one
called inline flex and inline flex is
just like an inline element like a span
or something it'll really just kind of
wrap around the content and only take
the about the width that it needs so I'm
going to bring that back to flex and
refresh
so our Flex container goes all the way
across and by defining this container as
display flex what happens is
automatically these divs right here are
have become flex items so the kind of
relationship between the immediate
children of the Flex container makes
these divs flex items we don't have to
do anything special we don't have that
it's a display flex item on them they
are just automatically turned into Flex
items one last thing I want to kind of
get you set up on in the next video
we're going to be talking about accesses
in Flex direction and when I first
learned it was it tripped me up a little
bit because when we searched flip the
direction things started stretching
around for me so what I want to do is
that when you're working with Flex boxes
handy to have a box that at least has
some sort of height on it just so we can
visualize what's going on in your real
world websites the height would come
from the actual content that takes up
your elements but I want to go ahead and
just say height 100 VH now if you're not
familiar with VH that stands for
viewport height and what that will do is
it will just make the container stretch
the entire height it's kind of like
height 100% it's just a new way to say
it that really has nothing to do with
Flex box but it's just a nice way for us
to get a hundred percent height on our
div here and then when we resize
vertically we don't really have to worry
about any 100% height hacks so that's
just getting set up one quick review
we've got our Flex container as well as
our Flex items in the next one we're
going to be taking a look at sort of a
fundamental idea of accesses in a Flex
direction
