which you can sort of think like like
the empty database or an empty object in
where we're going to put all of our
information now we actually need to
learn about sort of three things we need
to learn about what our actions water
action creators and what our reducers so
in this video we're going to learn all
about actions and action creators in
it's a pretty fundamental concept behind
react so let's take a second to sort of
visualize what it looks like in the
finished application here so you can
think of an action in redux as something
that happens in your application someone
clicks on the photo someone loads a page
someone likes it someone deletes one of
the comments someone adds a new comment
and whenever any of the stuff happens
inside of your application here it
dispatches in action and that dispatch
action has two things in it first type
of action that happened which is
increment likes or add comment or delete
comment and then second a payload of
information that is needed so which
comment got deleted which photo should
be added what was the comment that
someone added well who was the author
just information about what specifically
happened so right here I've just got my
Redux dev tools open right here and
anytime that you may fire off in action
or dispatch in action if we're using
Redux terms here you're going to see all
the information about that specific
action so I'm gonna say Wes and say neat
photo and I'm gonna go ahead and add
that and as soon as I add that you see
that here it's logged underneath all of
the actions and what happened I added a
comment in the payload for that action
is it happened on this post BAC why
that's you can see it's in URL bar the
author was Wes in the comment was neat
photo and the really cool thing about
this redux dev tools is I'm gonna be
able to comment on and off this is
called time travelling where you can
toggle on and off actions that happen
and really see what exactly happened and
doesn't have to be the last one I can
add I could add another one like maybe
Kate said cool add that now I've got two
things that happen here I could still
toggle off the neat photo one but Kate's
is still there unless I explicitly
toggle that one off so that's what
actions are it's very simple when we hit
reducers we're gonna hit go on the other
end of that which is once I actually add
this this action right here which is I
added a neat photo by wes on this photo
how do I actually update the data and
how do I let react sort of handle all
the changes there so we need to learn
about action creators we're going to
create a new folder called actions
inside of our client folder and inside
of that I'm going to create a action
creators s now sometimes people will
create one action creator per file or
maybe just do a few of them but since
mine are going to be so small in this
case I'm gonna keep them all in one
single file but I feel free to move them
out into separate files as you see fit
inside of here we are going to do a
couple things we need to increment that
we'll increment it like so if I go here
and I increment the like 57 58 59 every
time I do that that should fire off this
action that we have right here so it's
hard a little bit hard to see
something's wrong with the dev tools
here but every time we increment the
likes it's going to increment or
decrement the actual amount of likes
that are on there so we have that we
have add comment and we have a remove
comment so those are the three things
that can happen inside of our
application and then there's also
changing of the route which is the
location change right here but that will
happen by Redux and that's why we use
the react read or redux because what it
does is even when you change a page that
is something that happened in your
application and we are storing those in
our store like look I turned it off it
went back to that photo I turn it back
on it goes back to my home page there so
we're just doing three things here
increment add a comment and remove a
comment so we are going to say function
and increment this function is going to
pass us in index which tells us which
comment or sorry which post is going to
have its likes increment and well it's
that one or that one and where you go
inside of here and we are immediate
just going to return an object why
because I said actions are just objects
where they have two things they have a
type which is increment likes that's
going to be sort of the the name of the
action that gets dispatched and you can
see that they're showing up here these
are the names that's the type that gets
showed up and then finally and we also
want to pass at the index so normally I
would say index is set to index but
since we're using es6 we don't have to
do that we just pass it along right so
that's really just the entire payload
here and you don't want to send the
entire post along with the increment you
just want to send as little information
along in your action that needs it so in
this case all we need is the identifier
for which post needs to be incremented
for the number of likes and in this case
we're just gonna say update the fourth
one there a second one or the third one
that could very well be a post ID as
well and you can handle the the finding
of it in your actual reducer now we
don't want the comment as well so we'll
say function add comment now this one is
going to take a few more things we have
a post ID because we need to know what
posted they add a comment we need to
know the author that commented and we
need to know the actual comment itself
and we are going to return an object
here the type is going to be add comment
and we also do we want to pass along the
post ID the author in the comment or
it's gonna paste those in here and pass
it along so that's the payload these
three things the type is add comment
finally we're going to function or
remove comment and we just need to know
the post ID as well as the index of the
comment that got removed so in this case
we just need to know what post should we
remove the comment from and what comment
should we actually remove so like if we
go to one of them there's five or six
comments here we need to know that I
want to delete like the third one down
or something like that so we are going
to return an object the type is going to
be remove comment and we are going to
pass the index as well as the post ID
along with it so those are the three
things these are action creators why do
we call them action creators because
this is the action right here but the
action creator
a sort of puts it together and then will
dispatch it out into the air so we need
to export all three of those in order to
be able to access them later on so we'll
just pop an export right in front of
them
next we actually need to create the
other side of this which is when these
things get fired and they're going to be
fired or the word is dispatched when
someone clicks a button we're going to
wire that up to the interface in a
coming video but when someone actually
creates an action how do we actually
handle that data how do we add that
comment remove that comm and increment
the number of likes do anything with
this data to update our store that we
created right here right so that is in
reducers in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
