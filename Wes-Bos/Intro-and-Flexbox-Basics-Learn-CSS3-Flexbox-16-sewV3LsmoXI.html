series on CSS flexbox and what that is
is a new part of css3 that allows you to
create super complex and super flexible
layouts with with just CSS so previously
if you've tried to do super complex
layouts especially when you're working
with responsive design you'll you'll
find yourself using a combination of
floats variable Heights as well as any
number of hacks to get things to work
smoothly across the board flexbox aims
to do away with floats and all of those
things in let us create super flexible
layouts with the new thing called flex
box
the reason I'm creating this web series
is because flex box is a very very new
idea and even for a seasoned CSS
developer it can be hard to first wrap
your head around both how it works in
when you should be using it in the
browser to add insult to injury there
are actually two implementations of flex
box out there right now so if you do a
little bit of googling around you're
gonna find a whole bunch of varying
tutorials as well as a whole bunch of
vendor prefixes on each of those ones so
if I look here this is a little bit of
code that I wrote recently just getting
started with the parent this doesn't
have to do with any of the children
it took me 31 lines just to get flexbox
set up right here so this is pretty
pretty scary and even if you're a
seasoned CSS developer you might start
running back two floats with something
like this so the aim of the series is to
really distill it down into something
that is easy to understand and to look
into every little single section of
flexbox and be able to figure out when
we would use and what each thing does
from there we'll take it we'll we'll
scale it up and look at how we can make
it work cross browser as well as cross
device when you it just
and you start looking at code that looks
like this so get ready and I hope you
enjoy it so to get started with flexbox
and to kind of understand what we're
working with I've set up some very very
basic HTML and CSS which will then
implement flexbox onto so as you can see
you're here I just have a simple HTML
document inside the body here I have div
with the class of wrapper that's going
to be our parent or our container as
well as I have 10 divs inside of that
they each have a class of box and a
class of box with their unique ID and
I've got a number and inside of them
this is just purely so that we could see
the different divs when we're working
with them in the browser you could
imagine this as maybe a grid of blog
posts or a listing of team members or
something like that on a website in the
CSS here I've done some really really
basic CSS
I've got normalized box-sizing border
box up and running neither of these are
quite as required for flexbox however I
do recommend them and then I've just
done some really really simple really
really simple content here I've just
changed the font size I've put a little
bit text shadow and then I've put a few
different colors on each of the divs so
nothing really too new here it's just so
that I'm set up in the browser I have my
10 tips and they're scaling right across
the browser for us so to get started
with flexbox you may need to take a look
at our markup right away and see what
that looks like to use flexbox you need
a container which in this case is going
to be a wrapper and then you need
immediate children which in this case
are each of our boxes so if you're ever
working with the Flex box it doesn't
just apply to one element it's kind of
an entire thing where you need to apply
certain property values to the wrapper
or to the container and you need to
apply certain property values to the
filed which in this case is our box in
box one etc etc so I'm gonna go down in
here and I'm gonna keep my CSS I'm just
gonna write the selectors again just so
that I can keep all this styling which
has nothing to do with flux box separate
from the actual flex box that we're
working with here so I'm going to go
ahead and write my selector for our
container which in this class is a div
with a class of wrapper so simply just
dot wrapper open my curly braces and the
the property that we want here is
display which you're probably familiar
from display:inline display:block
display:none but this is a new property
it's called display flex and what that's
going to do is it's going to turn this
wrapper from display block which it
normally is into a flexible wrapper so
if we open that up in the browser
refresh not too much happens except that
it just takes all of its children and
snaps them like this now what we
actually need to do is go one level
further to each of its children and
apply a flex value to each of those so
to select all of them at once I'm just
going to type dot box which is going to
select every single one of these ones
right here because they all have a class
of box and I'm just going to say flex
one give it a save and let's take a look
at it in google chrome one thing I
should note here before I refresh is
that you may remember that if you look
here you have all these prefixes such as
- WebKit - MS I'm using Google Chrome
which has standardized Flex box and we
are able to use the unprefixed versions
in Google Chrome as we go on in this
series when when it's getting ready for
primetime when you want to support other
browsers as well as legacy devices
you're going to want to make sure that
we have all of our vendor prefixes as
well so look the this course will be
purely
unprefixed and once we get to the N
we'll look at how we can convert that to
support the both vendor prefixes as well
as the older version of flexbox so here
we go display flex on the parent flex 1
on the Box go to here refresh and now
you'll see here that I have all of my
attentive and they go side by side and
you see that they've taken the width of
the body and divided it into 10 separate
sections here so if I were to resize my
browser to be wider it's going to resize
it and it's gonna go smaller I didn't
have to do anything in terms of widths
here I didn't have to say with 10%
left and any number of items maybe add a
clear fix to the wrapper and then would
be off to the races I simply just said
flex one and by saying display flex and
flex 1 what we're what we're doing there
is you're saying this flex number is a
proportion and we're saying each should
be one proportion which means that they
are all equal so when i refresh here all
of them are divided equally throughout
the browser now this flex number right
here is kind of interesting because it's
not a pixel value it's not an M value
it's not a percentage value it's simply
just a proportion compared to the rest
so this number could be a hundred if I
really wanted to and nothing changes
when i refresh because this number is
simply just in proportion to the rest so
if we were to add all those up it would
be a thousand so 100 plus 100 was 100
all the way down to ten and we're saying
that each one should take up a hundred
of the total so I'm gonna bring that
back down to one and let's create a
selector for box number three and give
it as a new flex value so if I say dot
box the
flex - what we're saying here is that
box 3 should be too proportion compared
to the rest so if we look at a code we
wrote earlier flex 1 means that they're
all 1 2 is going to be double that so
when i refresh here 3 should be double
of what all the rest are refresh and now
you see what happened there was the rest
of these got smaller and 3 got bigger so
basically we said 3 needs to be double
the size of the rest if I were to if I
were to resize you'll see that the rest
resize but 3 also stays double what it
what the remaining other ones have been
so that's the very very basics of
getting up and running with Flex box we
have a container and we have items
inside of it and we simply just say
display flex and we assign a flex value
to each of them if I were to go ahead
and do flex box 6 flex 4 you'll now see
that 6 is 4 times the size of the other
ones 3 is still double and then the
remaining ones are just taking the rest
of the room and splitting it up equally
between the two one other thing I should
note before I end it off we also have
something called inline - flex which is
very similar to the difference between
inline and block and as you know block
elements extend the entire width of the
browser while inline elements only take
the amount of space that they need so if
you're ever looking for not the entire
width of your container simply use
inline flex instead of flex that's it
for now be sure to check out the next
video which looks at rows columns which
direction they show up on the page as
well as how we can use flexbox to
reorder elements on the page without
actually having to reorder them in or
HTML see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
