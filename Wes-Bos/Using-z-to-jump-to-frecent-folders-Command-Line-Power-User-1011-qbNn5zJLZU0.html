while it has nothing to do with CETIS h
it actually goes hand-in-hand with it
quite nicely especially if you are sort
of in the mindset and workflow of how's
that sh works so what it does is
essentially allows you to jump around to
some of your directories really really
quickly so if you use a directory
frequently or if you have recently been
to a directory with a name that you sort
of remember you can jump right to that
by just typing Z and then space and then
after you just give it the name of
directory that you want so for example
I'm trying to get to my command line
directory and I'm not totally sure if I
named it properly or for example if it's
like three levels deep or four levels
deep I just know that somewhere in the
name of the directory has the word
command so I'm just going to type Z
command hit enter and it kind of keeps a
database of your most recently and
frequently used folders and it knows
exactly that I can jump into my Dropbox
and into my command line folder and this
is fantastic so I actually use a number
structure for most of my projects so if
I know that I need to go to project 185
which is my book website I can just hit
Z 185 and it knows exactly that 0 1 8 5
- book - website forward slash Express
that's the directory that I'm most
frequently in and I don't have to figure
any of that out I could have also said
something like Z book and it would bring
me right to the same directory then
again if I've got another my hacker you
folder I know that's 160 for my numbered
project so I hit enter and I'll bring me
right to that so you kind of get the
point you just type something that you
is in the title and if you've recently
or frequently used that directory it's
going to be maintained in a database of
possible once now there's a whole bunch
of different options that we could go
ahead and do but let's actually first
just get it set up so we can include it
there's a couple ways that you can
install it and if you have home
installed you can simply just go ahead
and type brew install Z and that will
take care of everything for you however
if you're not totally sure what homebrew
is that's a whole nother video so let's
just show you how to install it manually
which is really just a couple of seconds
to get up and running so head on over to
github column for uber fortune SC and we
want to download the zsh file so go
ahead and click raw and we want to say
this is somewhere where we're not going
to delete it so where I recommend
putting this is just right in your home
directory so if you hit command asks or
ctrl s on your thing and you hold down
the command shift G what that will do is
it'll bring up this go to folder and we
want to simply just type tilde another
way you can get to that it clearly you
just type hit your name in the your home
right here so make sure that you save
that as SH don't let the browser put it
any silly extension on here so save it
just as SH you can see I've already got
it right there and go ahead and click it
save you can tell if you've done it is
you just if you go into your command
line type LS tilde /z and hit tab what
that will do is it will say oh it's
actually there so you can just list it
there so it should be located in for
slash users /u or the name of what our
profile you're signed in at and zsh now
that we have it installed we actually
need to include it in every time that we
run our shell window and the best place
to put that in is is actually in our
Zetas H RC file which we learned about
in a previous video so let's go ahead
and open that up so you can you know
type open or I've got my sublime text
command supple forward slash or tilde
for /z dot or sorry dot said Sh
RC hit enter and what that will do is it
will bring open news @sh file and i've
got all kinds of stuff in here we've
talked about putting our theme and
analyzing some of our stuff this is what
we will want so this essentially just
includes that
every time that we open up in the window
so if I open up a new tab what it's
doing here is it's setting me up for
news at a sage session and it included
the Z file there for me so just say dot
space and then you give it a the URL to
the path so where is it located it's in
my home directory which is tilde /z sh
once you're done that click Save and now
we will actually need to make that take
place so we can either just close this
tab and open up a new one or you can
type source forward slash dot that SHRC
and what that will do is it just
actually it's equivalent to opening up a
new session and you can clear everything
out now that you are in there you can't
actually start using it because Zed
actually works on building up a database
for you so you actually need to start
going ahead and just like seeing over to
your directories just like you normally
would so maybe I do CD command line good
maybe I go up a level CD demos good CD
talks good I thought I'll go back and
after you do that
maybe give it like half a day or
something like that after you do that
you should start to be able to use
something like Z talks and it will bring
that to you go back to your home
directory I like to show people that it
doesn't just find the folder that's in
the directory that you're currently in
it will find pretty much anything so I
could say Z command it brings me to a
command line Z book brings me into that
one kind of cool thing that we've got in
this command line is a few different
options so if you head back to github
and we'll read the docs real quickly
we've got these great options that you
can use for example - C allows you to
restrict matches to sub directories of
the current directory where that's
really useful is if you have directories
that are named the same thing in every
single project and you don't want to
jump around to that so for example if I
jump over here I use WordPress quite
and I'm going to move into one of my
more depressed projects I know has the
word songs and it so I'm just gonna say
Z songs cool so that brings me over to
it and now I know inside of here
probably about three or four levels deep
I have a theme and it's called WB what
stands for West boss and I use that same
theme folder in every single project
that I do so if I just said zwb it might
jump to a totally different project that
I'm not working on but I want WB that is
inside of this this song's folder that I
have so what we do is I could just say Z
WB and then you pass in the flag which
is - C and what that does is it goes for
social code for wp-content for such
theme /wb however it makes sure that i
stay within this one and I'm not going
into some other project that's totally
different so that's extremely handy by
the way it's a little handy tip there if
you ever want to go back to the
directory that you just were you just
type - and that will kind of jump you
back to your previously one it's kind of
like if you remember the TV remote or
you jump between two ones you can just
keep hitting - and it will just bring
you back and forth between those two
directories we've also got - H for help
- L is kind of cool so I could say Z
talks - L and what - L will do is rather
than actually bringing me to it it will
show me what they are so it'll I've got
this one called live talks I've got
sublime text talk I've got a talk on
self-publishing and then I've just got
the this one right here and what's cool
about this is it shows you the score in
the waiting or this thing called what do
they call it here recency its frequency
and recency kind of combined together
and this is how it weights them so
clearly I've been to my talks directory
way more and more frequently than I've
been to these other ones so if I did Z
talks it's going to bring me to that one
because that one has the highest waiting
so that's kind of nice that you can
see what you want and if I wanted to go
to any other of these I'd be able to
just go ahead and make my search a
little bit more cleaner another way you
can do it is actually pass it multiple
reg X's or multiple folder names that
have the name in it for example if I go
into my command line 1 and I were to
just say LS you'll see that there is
this folder called Kate inside of it and
if I wanted to get to that Kate folder
but make sure that it's inside of the
command line folder what I could do is
let me just get out of this folder so
we're doing a freshness a-z command that
will get me that the command and then I
do space Kate and hit enter and what
that does is it matches the first one
for command and then the second folder
inside of that for Kate and you can
actually chain those as long as you want
- are match my rank only - T match by
recent access only and - X remove the
current directory from the data file so
sometimes you get like a directory that
gets stuck in here and maybe it's name
something that you use frequently and
every time you use your Z key for that
it brings you in to that like for
example like a cache directory or just a
project you're not working on it anymore
you can hit the - X on that and it will
just remove it entirely so it's a very
easy to learn very simple thing however
as you use it over the next couple days
and weeks it becomes an invaluable tool
for jumping around between directories I
