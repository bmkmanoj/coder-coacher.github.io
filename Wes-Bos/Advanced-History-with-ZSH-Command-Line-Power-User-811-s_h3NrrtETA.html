the kind of advanced history options
that it gives you when working in the
terminal so we all know or maybe you
don't know in in bash or any other one
if you just hit your up arrow it will
kind of show you all of your latest
things that you've done so touches or
lll or get add a get in it so these are
all things that I've run recently in
this terminal window and I'm able to
kind of view them however there's a lot
of stuff in here that I'd really don't
care too too much about there's a lot of
like LS dash L or LS or touch hello to
HTML and if I just clear that out and
now I see touch hello LS LS SL I don't
really care about those but I'm looking
for a command that maybe I ran at like
15 or so commands left but I know that
it was a git or maybe I know that it was
a touch or maybe I know that it was an
arcing command so what you can do there
is just tight I'll do touch in space and
now hit up arrow and it will allow you
to cycle up and down through your latest
touch commands same thing works forget
if you type get space it gives you all
of your latest git commands or maybe for
me I know I have an arcing command with
my book and I want to look through what
the possible ones are so my rsync
commands I just type our sync and I've
got that really long command that I may
not have remembered to type by hand
another really kind of cool one and this
is actually not specific disease Atta
sage but many people don't know about it
is if you hit control R it'll allow you
to search through your recent command so
for me maybe I knew I had a command with
the word book in it so I just type book
and right away it searches through my
latest commands and shows me that
command that I last run with the word
book in it so you can type any word in
there that you want and you'll be able
to pull those up real quickly
I hope you enjoyed that make sure you
