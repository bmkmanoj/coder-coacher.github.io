tutorial on how to install lamp server
so what web server is is it stands for
Windows Apache MySQL and PHP and
basically what this does is it allows
you to run a web server on your local
computer so you can devolve websites on
your what we call the localhost instead
of having to edit a file and then upload
it every time you make a change to your
server so you're probably used to to
uploading files to FTP to a server but
this just allows us to be a lot quicker
with with editing our files generally
it's for PHP things for sorry for
something like WordPress but it's also
great for just running HTML files on
your localhost as well so to download a
web server you go to lamp server comm
and you make it I think you get French
by default so just click English in the
top right corner go ahead and click the
download button now there's a whole
bunch of options here in two hours it
doesn't really matter which one you
download but I would recommend going
with either this one right here which is
64 bits in PHP through 5.3 or this one
32 bits in PHP 5.3 if you're not sure if
your computer is 64-bit or 32-bit don't
worry about it just download the 32-bit
one that's what I've I've gone ahead and
done that one so when you click it it
gives you this super scary warning with
all kinds of red text on there don't
worry about it you just click right here
you can download it directly when you
click that it'll download right to your
right to your files I've went ahead and
downloaded it right here so it's it's a
bit of a big file so it takes a couple
seconds
so I'm going to go ahead and just
install that with you so double-click it
run one thing I should know before you
get started on any of this there's a
weird bug with lamp server and Skype and
if you have Skype running when you start
WAMP server it won't work
alright sometimes a little bit more than
more often than not it won't work for
you so go ahead and quit Skype just for
the time being while we're installing
and starting wimp and then once you're
running you can start it up again but
it's it's a really common bug it's kind
of weird so I'm going to click Next
except make sure you read all of that so
it's just going to install a see lamp
that's fine next quick launch in desktop
icon yeah I'd like both of those next
okay that's fine
click install so this will probably take
a little bit so I'll just pause it for a
sec and I'll jump back with you is when
we're ready to go okay so it has
finished the install and it says Firefox
has been detected on your computer would
you like to use it as a default browser
for a lamp server - so basically what
this means is when you open up your
server it will use Firefox as the
default browser if you use Chrome or you
probably shouldn't be using anything
else you can click no if you do use
Firefox then that's great you can go
ahead and click yes
this is just a development machine for
me so I'm going to go ahead and click
yes and it's just finishing up the
install it just took about a three
minutes or so
okay so now that we have it installed
you'll get that you'll probably get this
Windows Firewall security alert and this
is really important that you pay
attention to this because this can
configure whether your server works or
not so don't just bypass this or push
cancel actually take a look at it so we
want to say the Windows Firewall has
blocks and features of this for the
purpose of our workshop you want to make
sure that both of these are clicked and
then when you are ever in say like a
coffee shop or something like that you
may want to go ahead and adjust these
firewall settings but just so that we
have a best chance of it working we're
going to have both of them checked go
ahead and click allow access and now we
have peach female parameters we're not
working with mail so don't worry about
that just leave them leave them default
click Next and now we're done so keep
that checked and click finish and a web
server is going to try and start we get
some sort of pop up here click yes and
now the important thing we need to note
is we see the lamp icon in the tray
right here you might need to click the
arrow to make sure you see it I like to
I think you're right click always show
I'll just drag it in there yeah I just
dragged it in there
and then there are four color or three
colors of lamp server there's red which
is bad there is yellow which is bad and
then there is green which is really good
so you want to make sure before you come
into the workshop that your green lamp
server you're sure your web server is
green if it's any other color we're not
going to run into issues so make sure
that you have this sorted out before you
come so um what's going on here
so now that mine is green if it is any
other color please ask one of us for
help and we'll be help happy to help you
out
click the lamp server icon if it is a
different color you can just click stop
all services and then start all services
sometimes I'll just kill everything and
then start them up again that might help
so now we just want to double check that
that everything is working so when you
cook your green lamp icon you'll see
there's there's a few items here first
thing we need to do is is turn on a
setting that will allow us to use
WordPress permalinks so go to click on
your icon go to Apache and then go to
Apache modules and there's a huge list
of a huge list of modules that we have a
little bit here don't worry about what
these are we just need to find one
called rewrite underscore module again
that's rewrite underscore module and it
should be checked not if it's on check
like it is right now and and that's by
default just go ahead and click it
rewrite underscore module I'm clicking
it a mam server will turn yellow for a
second and basically what that's doing
is it's rebooting it and there we go
it's turned back on its green against so
now we're in good shape next step that
we want to take is click on localhost
and basically what localhost is is if
you go here and click localhost
it's basically a domain name for your
local computer so think of it as a a.com
for your server but instead of having a
dot-com
it's just called localhost and it's
available only to you on your computer
so when you click that you should see a
screen that looks like this if you do
you're really good shape and then the
other thing we want to check is that PHP
myadmin is running so there's there's a
link underscore under tools here click
phpMyAdmin
and you'll see a screen that looks like
this if we if we if you see something
that looks like this you're in good
shape everything is working so again you
should go to be able to go to localhost
you should see that you should click
phpMyAdmin your lamp icon should be
green and you Apache Apache modules
rewrite underscore module should be
checked right there so those are that's
just the setup the last thing I want to
tell you is the directory that we'll be
working out of so a directory is a
folder on your computer where we're
going to be putting all of our files so
how to access that is actually really
easy just click on your greenway icon
and click wwr and this is the directory
that localhost pulls out of all of its
files out of when we visit localhost so
I click that it should open up in just a
second
a mount bit of a slow computer
there we go okay um so the www directory
is C lamp w W if you don't want to
remember that you can always just click
the green icon www artery and this is
kind of your home base so make sure you
that you have this folder always open
because this is where we're going to be
working out of if you're on a Windows
computer what we want to do is just test
things out so I'm going to right click
new and make a new folder called test so
I've made a folder called test and I'm
going to I'm going to double click that
and go into it and now I want to make a
new file in here called test PHP so I'm
just going to open up notepad
and I'm going to type hello everything
is working great and then I'm going to
save it and since this is going to go on
our web server we can't just save this
anywhere on our computer we have to put
it in that WWE directory that we are
previously looking at so remember it it
was C WAMP w w test so I'm going to go
on my computer C lamp www there's our
test folder and I'm going to name this
test dot HTML and really important here
don't save it as a dot txt file click
all files that's really important that
you notice that so test that HTML save
now if we go to our localhost and I'm
going to go forward slash if I just type
that it's going to go to our just my
normal directory but now you'll see that
we have a new heading here called your
projects and it's called test because
remember we made that folder called test
so go ahead and click that and you'll
see a file here called tests at HTML so
if you click that so again test test at
HTML you'll see localhost ford slash
test which is a folder that we made and
forward slash test at HTML which is the
HTML file that we made so now you'll see
hello everything is working great so
that means that everything has gone
smoothly for us in we're in good shape
to start the workshop so let me know if
you have any other questions and I'll
see you all soon
