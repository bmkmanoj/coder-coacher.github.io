I just got a tweet from this blue man
that said a small Friday JavaScript
challenge but like I've been doing these
challenges on Twitter and they tweeted
one out to everyone and I thought it'd
be kind of fun to actually try one
myself rather than making it up and I
thought it'd be fun to sort of record my
thought process in going through how all
this works so the challenge was you got
this huge list of tube stations which is
a subway in London and you've got this
word mackerel now they want to filter
this list for any words that don't
contain any of the letters from mackerel
so if if any of these stations have a
letter M AC ke R or L in them then we
need to filter them out so my first
thought was like maybe I can use some of
the new like array methods that we got
in es5 and he is six but I don't think
that those would work out so my second
thought was oh this is this is an array
so I'll probably use filter here so I'm
gonna assume that you you don't know too
too much about filter and I'll just
explain my thought process rough on the
way through here so I've got these
stations list and I'm going to run
filter on it and the way that filter
works is that you will loop through
every item in the array and it will pass
you the individual item I'm going to
call that station and you either return
true if you want it or tun return false
if you don't want it so I say far are
constants a log fish free just to see
what we've got here obviously that's
gonna give us all the stations and if I
return false it's gonna give us none of
the stations so next step I need to do
like a checking for all the stations I
need to check if they contain any of
those letters so I thought okay I could
use like dot match so I would return
station match and you can pass match a
regular expression which is sort of like
a way to match things that in I thought
maybe you could pass it things like if I
want us any of the words that contain
Church and that is going to return an
array of matches if it's
which is which is also true and then if
we're gonna return null if there's no
matches which is false in this case so
here that gives us all of the stations
with Church in it or if I said like ei
all the stations with an EI in them
there's a couple there so what you could
do here is match for like m.a.c K like a
mackerel I spent spell the entire thing
out and now that kind of works there but
we can do a little bit more of a fun way
so and and also they gave us this this
variable right here which is a search
term so you'll know that you can't
actually put a variable inside of just a
regular expression like this so what we
need to do is we mean to make a regular
expression outside so we'll say con
smasher equals new regular expression
and the first thing you pass it is what
you actually want to match for so we'll
do that in a second and the second one
is the actual flags that you want so I
want to be global and one with the
search the entire one and I also want to
be insensitive which means that like if
we have a lowercase M in mackerel but it
have an uppercase M on one of these
words here it's still going to actually
match it like in the case of Marble Arch
right here so what are we going to
actually match it with so you could say
a or B or C and that would give all of
them but I can't just pass it the search
term why because that's gonna look for
the actual word mackerel inside of it
and we need to look for each of the
possible letters so I have a search term
here which is mackerel how do I I could
split it and I could join it right again
I could join it with a dash so what that
does is it actually gives us the M or a
or C or K but one cool way we could do
and this is sort of like my last videos
we can use the new es6 spread operator
so what you can do is to say dot dot
search term and what that does is it
takes every item from your your string
and it will put it into an item of
this new array that we have right there
so Dada dot search term takes every
letter from the word mackerel and puts
it into an item and then we can call
join on it with you can join it on like
anything you want
oops you got actually do your JavaScript
right but we want to join it with a pipe
right so what we can do is you take you
pipe that right into your regular
expression here and it's going to sort
of build this regular expression for us
with all of the oars done for us now so
we've got this matcher
and then we don't no longer have to pass
it search term but we pass it this
matcher here so give that a save now
that's a huge list and the reason is
because that those all match right and
and the thing here said they don't
contain the word mackerel or any of the
letters from mackerel so what you can do
is you pop a quick bang on the front and
that's going to search for it's going to
if it's true it's going to return false
if it's false it's going to return true
it'll just return the opposite and that
way our list there we go it's down to
just one possible item so that's good
what we could also do with that is wrap
them in some paragraph tags so I'm going
to map right on that so I have this
array and I'm going to actually bring
this back to troops this I want to array
of a lots of things and the map will
give us our station and I'm going to
return you can use ESX template strings
here it's going to return a paragraph
tag with the station inside of it so now
let's see what this array looks like so
now it's an array just a paragraph tags
showing it to all of mine and then I
could run join on it with nothing inside
of it because you don't actually want to
use an array you just want one big
string of all the paragraph tags there
we go and I could say document dot inner
we're talking about by inner HTML equals
fish free freshness and there we go
we've got a big list obviously it's only
one item so I'm going to put that bang
back on there and you
so a little bit of a fun one I'd love to
see how other people would finish it
themselves but I'm pretty happy with
using filter map and join rather than
having to do some sort of loop myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
