wind we can use it with autofit and
autofit so I've opened up my min max
start this is in the 13 using min max
for responsive grids and for me this
this sort of combo of using autofit and
autofit as well as min max it has
actually replaced a lot of media queries
that I previously had written because it
sort of is just responsive by nature so
we'll turn on the dev tools here I'll
make that black and then let's take a
look at this this 150 pixels here what
if it was a hundred pixels we run into
some issues here where the the content
starts to spill out so we don't really
want to have to figure out how wide our
columns should be they should just sort
of flow as wide as they they need to be
so what we can do is replace that with a
min Max and then what we can do is we
tell it and two things I'll give you a
dollar if you can guess what they are
the minimum and the maximum that the the
track will be so in our case we'll say
minimum 150 pixels that's as small as
they could possibly go in a maximum I
like to do one fr and meaning that at at
a max they will be the entire width of
the the grid so give that a save now and
watch what happens to these items as we
get smaller so here we go get smaller
getting smaller and you see that they
start to wrap on to the next line
because at a certain point they just
don't fit and there allow themselves to
wrap and at a certain point they would
just become one entire stack column of
values rather than the 4 or the 5 that
we had and as you get bigger you see
that it will start to add more so that's
great because we don't have to
explicitly tell it how many columns we
want it will just figure it out given
that we have the min in the max now this
is using autofill kind of a neat thing
if we change it to auto fit this is
probably what you'll be using more
likely watch what it will do is it will
then not give us that extra space so let
me go back to autofill you see that it
will just I have four items so it will
just take up
the first four and continue to make them
I'll leave them this this big so we have
nine tracks here if I change that to
autofit you'll see that it will just
make those four tracks that we actually
needed and stretch the items inside of
those tracks too to fit so that's really
really nice because now watch it it will
always look perfectly clean but as I run
out of space it will still wrap itself
around as we need so autofit and autofit
combined with mid max that's something
we're going to be using quite a bit when
we get into the real world examples sort
of in the same vein of min Max and
though not directly directly related is
the content function in CSS so let's
just comment this out and let's make a
bunch of columns that we have great
template column and it's GTC i don't
know why i've been trying to type it
manually all this time GTC tab will and
will get you what you want and let's say
150px four times over one two three four
good that will give us four columns that
are 150 pixels each however if I change
the first one to auto what will happen
is it will just take up that remaining
space that it has in here after we've
then done it and actually what's kind of
neat is if you resize it you'll see that
it will also get smaller as we run out
of room now what we can do instead of
using Auto is use the fit content
function because sometimes you may be
telling yourself mmm that's good but
it's a bit too big especially if these
were getting even smaller so we can
replace that with fit content and you
can give it what's called a clamp value
the max width that or a max height if it
was a row that this thing should go to
so let's say okay I want it to be Auto
but I don't want it to go more than
let's say 100 px and then that will
clamp it at 100 pixels wide and then
leave that extra space just open to you
so fit content I don't use that all that
often but yes sometimes you run into
some edge case scenarios and just know
that that might be a solution to your
your sizing needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
