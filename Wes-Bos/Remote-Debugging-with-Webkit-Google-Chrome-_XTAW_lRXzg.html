to use remote debugging remote debugging
is basically using your WebKit developer
tools within your own browser on a
website or an application that is either
in a different browser or even on a
different device this is pretty useful
when you have something like a mobile
device you don't have a keyboard and a
mouse to maneuver around your developer
tools so this is currently only
available in the BlackBerry PlayBook but
there's people everyone's pretty hopeful
that we're gonna be seeing in iPads and
all the iOS and other tablets and phones
so I'm going to show you how to get it
up and running just on your local
machine it's currently included included
in the stable version of Google Chrome
so I'm going to use that as an example
and then use Safari to inspect that
browser so what you want to do is pop
open your terminal and we're just going
to move over to applications if you see
I have all of my applications here
visited what we need to do right now is
just open up Chrome with a certain flag
so we're just gonna do open Google
Chrome dot app and then we want to use
the args flag and one of those arguments
is remote debugging port equals nine two
two two enter and then open up Google
Chrome for us let's go to well so go to
my site take a look I know if I open up
Safari you could you really use any
browser for this ideally in a mobile
situation Google Chrome would actually
beat the device and your browser here
would be you on your home computer so if
we go to localhost 9 - 2 - hit enter
you'll see that we have a little server
running and we have all the tabs
available if we open up another one your
freshest page you'll see that's added
there so I'm going to go back to this my
West boss com1 click here and this will
be pretty familiar to you
it's just our regular dev tools so as
you can see I have Safari open as a
window and I'm able to inspect
everything
I could change the black background to
blue you can even you can use all the
features of it such as console and that
opens up in Chrome so that's pretty cool
looking forward to seeing that in mobile
devices pretty soon but for now and just
thought I'd show you how to use that let
me a few questions and thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
