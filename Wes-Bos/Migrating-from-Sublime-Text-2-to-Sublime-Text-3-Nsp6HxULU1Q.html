arrays been out for a while now and I
think it's at a point that most
developers are able to safely move over
from sublime text to over to sublime
text sory the question I get most is how
do i migrate over my plugins and
packages and what does package control
look like on sublime text 3 so what I
wanted to do here is give you a quick
tutorial on how to get package control
up and running as well as Margaret over
all of your settings all of your themes
and as well as all of your plugins from
sublime text to over on to 3 so if you
have what I want you to do for this
tutorial is open up sublime text - as
well as sublime text 3 you'll notice
that the author has renamed it to just
simply sublime text and no longer
sublime text - or sublime text 3 so if I
go ahead and click it you see that I
have it just here on whatever state what
I want you to do is open up the packages
folder for sublime text so click in the
top left hand corner of your screen
click sublime text preferences and then
browse packages if you're on Windows
that'll just be preferences browse
packages and what this will do is it
will open up your packages folder now as
well as show you a few more folders for
sublime text the contents of these
packages is probably be different for
everyone maybe you tried it a couple
months ago maybe tried to migrate over
your packages yourself and it didn't
quite work so what I want you to do is
just make sure you're in sublime text 3
folder and then just select all of your
files there and just blow them out
delete them all because we're gonna be
starting from a super fresh slate and we
don't want to have to be dealing with
any anything that you've set up before
so go ahead and blow them all out and
then quit sublime text 3 and then start
it up again what you'll see is that the
long text went ahead and populated it
with those four folders right again for
you no problem here
and if you go into the bomb text you'll
see that we're able to go ahead and
start writing code problem is that we
can't install any packages because
package control hasn't been installed
yet so we'll bond who's the guy that
work develops package control he's been
working real hard on getting package
control up and running with sublime text
3 so the way to get this installed
unfortunately isn't as easy as the
previous version because it's still in
development
but the way we do it is through with git
so what I want you to do is open up
terminal or I term and go ahead and what
we want to do is move over to this
folder right here so sublime text 3
packages so where this is located is
actually nested in quite a few folders
so we could go CD tilde library
application support sublime text 3
packages or a much easier way is just
take your packages folder drag and drop
it into your terminal window and hit
enter what we want to see here is that
we're in sublime text 3 forward slash
packages so if if I list my files here
we just have a user folder and nothing
else if we were in sublime text 2 you'd
see every single plug-in that you've
ever installed so the way we do this is
go on over to the package control
installation website and scroll right to
the bottom you're going to see we've
already seeded into the packages
directory but now we want to go ahead
and grab clone the repo which is from
github so paste it in there give it just
a second and now if I list the files
you'll see that we have this new folder
called package control if we CD into
that we're going to be in the github
repository yeah so if you are familiar
with how it works
it allows you to have different branches
you might see something like
master you might not see anything at all
if you don't the same theme as me but we
don't want to be on master we want to be
on the sublime text 3 branch of this get
repo so the way we do that is we just
type git checkout Python 3 and what that
will do you'll see a change to Python 3
here all of the files on our system have
swapped themselves and now we're now
we're running a version of package
control that works with sublime text 3
so if you go ahead and quit sublime text
3 and start it up again you'll see that
we're now able to install packages just
like we were in sublime text 2 so that's
great but none of our settings themes or
packages have moved over from sublime
text 2 so that's the second part of this
tutorial that I want to show you how to
do so if we go back to our folder here
you'll see that we're in sublime text 3
but if we move over to one folder down
to sublime text 2 you'll see that we
have a packages folder and inside of
that I have every single every single
theme and package that I've ever
installed into sublime text so the way
you might be tempted to just copy this
entire directory right over to this one
however that's not going to work work
for you so the solution to that is
fairly similar to that we want to go
ahead and select every single folder
that's inside of this packages directory
but if we were to copy that we'd be
overwriting some pretty critical parts
of sublime text 3 so we want to unselect
those those packages that are purely
just for sublime text 2 so I'm going to
go ahead and unselect that's just a
garbage file the important folders to
uncheck here are the default folder
because the default folder here are the
defaults for sublime text 2 not for
sublime text 3 so we don't want to move
that over if we do we're going to be
overwriting a bunch of sublime text 3
features so
make sure you uncheck uncheck that as
well you scroll right down you want to
uncheck the package control folder right
because this package control or folder
is for sublime text to whereas we just
installed the sublime text 3 1 so if we
copied that over it would just be
overriding all of our efforts that we
just did so with those two unchecked I'm
going to copy them I'm gonna head over
to sublime text 3 and I'm gonna click on
the packages folder and I'm gonna go
ahead and paste it in now right away
you'll probably get a pop-up with
something like this an item named user
already exists do you want to replace it
so user refers to the user directory in
if you've ever made a setting change on
sublime text if you've ever made your
own snippet if you've ever made a custom
keyboard shortcut all of those user
specific preferences that you've done
they all live in the user folder so when
you when you're migrating over all of
your preferences and snippets you're
going to want to overwrite the user
folder because sublime text 3 the user
folder there's nothing in there so go
ahead and click replace
and just a few seconds later they've all
been copied over if I go now to sublime
text 3 you'll see here that it looks
kind of funny if I open up a new tab it
doesn't exactly look proper and that's
just because I have some themes that
have been loaded so just go ahead and
quick quit sublime text 3 restart it and
then you now you should be able to see
it properly if I open up my settings
I'll see all of my old settings from
sublime text 2 that have made its way
over and I'm still able to install all
of my packages or I'm able to go ahead
and start using start using all of my
plugins just as it were in sublime text
2 so that's it just make sure you don't
copy over the default in the package
control folder and you'll be in good
shape so thanks a lot and let me know if
you have any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
