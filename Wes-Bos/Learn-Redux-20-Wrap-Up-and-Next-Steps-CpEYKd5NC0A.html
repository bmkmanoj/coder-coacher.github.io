app I want to do a quick review as to
what we learn here today and then
hopefully that will spur you forward
into creating more applications with
redux so first of all the main idea
behind Redux is that we have one giant
store we don't have many multiple states
or anything like that we have a giant
store that holds one of our states and
then we update that with what are called
actions so we have the file called
action creators which creates these
actions for us which includes what
happened and a payload of information
that is needed when those actions get
fired or when they get dispatched they
get handled by a reducer and then the
reducer is responsible for updating your
state past that we just had a bunch of
components and nothing here is any
different than our regular react
components that we've built before
they're really the only difference I
guess would be that we use match state
to props in match dispatch to props in
order to expose both our state as well
as these action functions to our
components now what's next for you to
learn obviously the data from here was
coming from a file and the reason we did
that is that we want it to be as simple
as possible we want to get you the ideas
of redux down without having to wrestle
with any external API now that you know
this you can take a look at maybe how
would I get this actually from the
Instagram or Flickr or whatever API that
I'm working with that now there's a
couple things you can use when you're
doing at that because you cannot put a
synchronous stuff in your reducers your
reducers should always be a pure
function that will return immediately
and if you need to do that you have a
choice of using something called a redux
thunk or you can use a Redux saga and
both of these will allow you to do
asynchronous calls to an API and then
when that data comes back you're able to
export your action so you like look
right here they are dispatching the
action with the data that comes back
from the API so I've heard a lot of good
things about Redux saga as well as Redux
thunk I would probably give saga a quick
before you look at thunk but that's
totally up to you as well as the author
of redux Dan Abramov also has this thing
called normalizer which if you have a
lot of nested data that comes back and
you need to be able to update that data
and work with an API then you need to
normalize your deeply nested JSON data
with normalizer so maybe what I would
encourage you to do right now is to take
a look at our simple app that we've
built and say what can I now build as a
secondary app what can I do that is
similar to this that I can get something
up and running but how do I take it one
or two steps further to really push
myself in in learning my react hopefully
you enjoyed it and I'd love to hear what
you think I'm at West vos on twitter
twitter.com for sloshed
OS boss and I just say hey Wes
I liked it great job or I hated it you
suck whatever it is that you prefer you
like I've got a lot more stuff coming
out so always head on over to Wes boss
calm and check out the courses page here
and you'll be able to see everything
that I have available that I'm
constantly updating and I've got a lot
coming down the pipe thanks so much and
I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
