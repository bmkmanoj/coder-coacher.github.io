that has to do with OS X so this is a
Mac only tip of Windows are it already
has this and it actually applies to
sublime text as well as every other
program on your Mac and you're
definitely gonna want to enable it in
what I'm talking about is when you have
a file opening you try to close it it
pops this little guy up or don't say if
canceled are safe and all the time you
try to either hit tab or your arrow keys
and try to move over to don't save or
cancel and you're not able to access
that unless you reach for your mouse and
hit don't save or cancel so we want to
be able to control that with our
keyboard rather than touching our mouse
so easy way to enable that is we go on
over to our settings and click keyboard
shortcuts and right here is where we
change it full keyboard access right now
it's only on text box and lists we want
it to be on everything so turn that on
close it down and now when you close a
file you're able to hit tab to move
along the buttons if you hit enter it's
going to hit save and if you hit space
it's going to click the button that is
currently highlighted so if I hit space
right now
don't save close down if I close this
one I can hit cancel space it cancels it
out so hopefully that will help you out
pick slot talk too soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
