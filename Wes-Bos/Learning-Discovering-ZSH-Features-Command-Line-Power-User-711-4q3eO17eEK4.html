the fun stuff that you can do with Zetas
sage some of the stuff that really makes
your workflow a lot easier and a lot
faster so what I'm going to do here is
just change into a demo directory so we
can kind of play around with some of the
stuff here so I'm gonna go into Dropbox
that's actually first of all that's the
first thing right there I want to move
into Dropbox and I just started typing
dr and you'll notice that the D is
lowercase and I just hit tab and what it
does is it takes a look at the possible
folders and autocompletes it based on
that we'll take a look at the more of
the autocomplete in just a second
however if you did that in bash you
would get nothing
why because Dropbox has a capital D and
in our case I type the lowercase D so
it's smart enough to know that there's
lowercase and uppercase that's probably
what you meant
so Dropbox and then I'm going to go into
the command line I understand type LS
dash L or it is LS to see what we got in
here we've got a couple files you see
that our folders here are color coded a
different color in my case it's blue
colored and sometimes you'll also have
shared folders you'll have symbol links
and all of those will show up as a
different color which is really really
handy when you're trying to take a look
at what sort of files folders sim like
etc chatter these are without having to
open it up in your finder so that's one
um if I was to make a directory make
their capitalized and I wanted to move
in to that if I hit C tab what happens
here is something called autocomplete so
I've got the option of capitalized or
CSS because both of those start with C
so by hitting cab I started that it
shows me them here and if I hit tab
again it allows me to select that one I
can hit tab again
tap-tap-tap you get the point I'd be
able to go in there hit enter and I can
keep typing as much as I would want that
is really really handy when let's move
into
the month's directory so CD months and
see what we got in here this this
happens to me all the time where I get
just like massive full folder full of
other folders and the names of the
folders they got spaces in them they got
numbers they've got words that might be
hard to spell
they've got capitals and trying to like
CD into November 2014 expenses in bash
would be something like CD November and
then there's a space so you have to
escape it with forward slash space and
then you have to type 2014 it's really
not fun to do and it's one of the most
frustrating parts about getting started
with command line is that you can't just
easily do things like that so what's
really cool is you know I want to move
into one of those directory I could just
type CD or in this works with any
command I could be doing RM or I could
be doing get etc etc so I'm going to do
CD and a space and when I hit tab what I
see here is just a listing of all the
directories you can see that they're
already escaped for me the forward slash
on the end notes that they are
directories it hit tab again and I'm
able to use my up down left and right
arrow keys to be able to move through
each one which is really really nice
because if you've ever done this before
you may've seen yourself go like left
left left left left left and you kind of
just have to hammer through them until
you get to the one that you want but
with something like this you can use
your arrow keys to go over to down three
and you're able to get to where you want
hit enter it autocompletes afore you
enter one more time and we're in that
folder
super super handy another cool thing is
a something called aliases and and we'll
go into sort of all of the aliases in
just a second but right now I need to go
up a directory so rather than typing CD
dot dot I can just type a dot and it'll
go up one directory same thing if you
did let go back in there Oh see that's
another kind of fun thing if I did CD
March 21
and it stopped because if I hit tab
again there are three folders one 2014
2015 and 2016 of which I may want to go
into so it kind of gives you everything
that you've been looking for up until
there's a couple matches and at that
point you can tab or use your arrow keys
to go through them select the one that
you want so again let's say I want to go
up three levels so this is one level two
level and I want to end up in the
command line directory again just type
this read aughts and it jumps me up
those three those three directories
there where that tab-completion is also
handy is the ability to type ls' and if
I already hit tab there it would just
kind of give me a listing of things that
I want it there however I've been typing
like LS L and there's L a sh - LS - a
thousand other things and for me to
figure out what the like a lash - a or L
- B or whatever all the the flags are
I'd have to go online and find some like
man page for you bash and kind of dig
through them and it's not super fast so
if you type LS - and just hit tab what
it will do is it will just give you a
listing of all of the possible options
for LS so hit tab again I can see
exactly what the flags are as well as a
description of what they do so LS - k
gives me print sizes of 1k unless
there's L that's what we've been using
LS - M that's kind of Handy so maybe I
want that one let's go down here enter
hit enter again and it gives me a
listing of all of the ones that I want
pretty pretty nice another kind of handy
thing is uh if I were to do echo HTTP
West boss comm just for example like
sometimes you have a link in your
terminal and for you to go to that you'd
have to right-click copy go to your
browser etc etc what you can also do
just hold down your command key and
click the URL and I'll bring you right
to that website so you'll notice as soon
as I press command watch the cursor
right now is just a selector if I hold
down command it turns into little Mickey
Mouse hand and I can go ahead and click
that other things we have are something
called take take is really really cool
because let's say I want to make a
directory and then move into it what I
would usually do is like make derp Wes
and then CD Wes and then I'd be in it
however that Sh puts that sort of into
one command and it's called take so I'll
make another directory called the Kate
so I'll do take Kate oops hit enter and
what that did is it created the entire
folder as well as CD me into that that
may not seem like a big deal however is
really nice to be able to do it in one
single command rather than two and I
can't tell you the amount of times where
I've created the directory but forgot to
actually move into it before I started
creating all my files and before you
know it you've got files all over the
place that you didn't mean to do I hope
