creating Emmet HTML so something like
dot warning will create you a div P dot
hello
paragraph of the class of hello that's
another video you're probably
comfortable with that by now however how
do you use those when you actually
already have the content now sublime
text has a built in kind of wrapped with
tag where it gives you some really basic
stuff you're able to kind of just select
your text and wrap it in a tag however
if you need to give it a class or an
attribute or anything like that you're
you're kind of out of luck you need to
do that manually so instead of using the
built in sublime text wrapping feature
we actually use the Emmet wrapping
feature which is much more flexible and
it's not you're going to fit into your
workflow if you're comfortable with
working with Emmet so the way we do that
is we just go ahead and select something
and now the keyboard shortcuts for mac
and windows are actually totally
different in this case so on windows is
going to be ctrl shift G in on the Mac
it's going to be controlled W so go
ahead and hit ctrl W make sure I don't
hit command W which will actually close
the window so ctrl W and I want to draw
your attention down to the bottom right
here where it says enter wrap
abbreviation so by default that will
probably be empty and now we can go
ahead and type any Emmett abbreviation
that we're familiar with before so the
obvious one being just p will give us a
P tag you can see it's been wrapped in a
paragraph T tag I could do P hello and
it will give it a class I could give it
an attribute of data - name equals wes
and all of that will be in when you're
done just go ahead and hit enter and it
will pop your cursor right back inside
of there so to show you again warning
warning maybe that will be a spin with
the class of warning hit ctrl W spend on
warning type it down here right here
it's auto-completed to span the class a
warning view more work
with attributes as well control W a ref
square brackets equals about HTML now
this works really really nicely if you
have multiple cursors so I'm just going
to go ahead and select all of them Ted
alert video if you want to learn how to
do that select them all hit ctrl W now
when I type in my breviary neck Ann type
Ally puts an Li around all of them and
we can even do that item of course but
if you put dollar sign in there it's
going to use that and swap it out with
the increment so 1 2 3 4 5 so a really
handy way to wrap your tags much better
than the built-in one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
