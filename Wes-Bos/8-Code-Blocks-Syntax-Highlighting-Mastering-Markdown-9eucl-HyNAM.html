quite a bit of markdown in slack or on
github or any of these other tools where
you need to be able to document your
code and it's important that you know
how to actually properly do it with your
code so first of all if you have a block
of code what you can say is I here is my
code and just take those and you can
indent it and give it a save and what
that will do is it will automatically
put it in a code block for yourself no
the thing I'm using right here it will
automatically detect what type of code
I'm using and if it does a good enough
job it will highlight it like right now
is some JavaScript here and it's doing a
pretty good job at highlighting my
JavaScript however I prefer to use
what's called code blocks instead of
using indentation only I like to fence
them off with three back ticks and then
you write the name of the language you
are writing and then you end it off with
three more back ticks and what that will
do is it will specifically tell the
browser or your editor or whatever
partial are you using that you are
writing PHP it doesn't have to guess
which is something that not all of them
do you have the added benefit here too
that your editor will start to realize
oh this is PHP and it will highlight it
as such so if I take this JavaScript
right here and I've got a little sniff
it here or just say Jas paste it in
there you see that I start to get my
nice JavaScript syntax highlighting
inside of my code block so three back
ticks you don't have to specifically
tell it what language you want so if I
have another one here and I don't have a
language I like just say echo hello
maybe I'm writing some bash it would
just output it without any language it
will still try to detect it in my editor
here one more thing that you can do is
use inline thing so maybe you're typing
a sentence and you would say hey did you
try VAR x equals 100 well you probably
want to do is wrap that in backticks and
what that shows your user is that it
will wrap it in an inline code tag
without having the multi-line one here
and it'll show the person what is code
and
what is you actually talking so if you
ever see someone talking like on Twitter
like did you try and they put back ticks
around it that's because they are saying
that this is the actual code and the
back ticks are not part of it one more
little tip I like to show people and
it's not totally known is that if you do
three back ticks and say it's a DIF and
three back ticks what you can do is say
maybe VAR x equals 100 and then you have
our y equals 200 and you want to show
someone that you should delete that and
you add VAR y equals 300 and what was
done there is that your highlighter
should automatically show the user that
you deleted this line and you added this
line and so it's very helpful for when
you are trying to show something github
or even just email someone what has done
you can see it clearly in your editor as
well as when it gets rendered out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
