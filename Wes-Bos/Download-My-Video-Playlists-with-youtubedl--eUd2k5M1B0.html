question that I'm getting a lot and that
is how do i download your video so with
my paid series I allow you to download
them and you can take them on your
commuter or wherever it is on an
airplane if you're going to be offline
but the free ones they are hosted on
YouTube which doesn't have a download
option however I'm totally fine if you
need to download them yourself and so
I'm going to show you how to do that now
you need this thing called a YouTube DL
and if you haven't heard of this you are
going to go crazy because what it does
is it allows you to download YouTube
videos or Vimeo videos or any sort of
online video and it just works it's you
don't have to deal with any of these
online services where it strips it and
you download it it's all done via the
command line so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to open up my terminal
here I'm going to make a directory
called Wes I'm going to go into it and I
need to make sure that have the YouTube
DL command you can see if you have it by
just typing youtube-dl if you do not
have it if you have brew you can type
brew install YouTube DL and what that's
gonna do is it's gonna go ahead and
install it I've already installed it
here if you're on Windows or something
else like that you can totally run it as
well just head on over to the
documentation here and figure out how to
install it for yourself once you have it
installed all you need to do is point it
to an actual video so I'm gonna like
just take one of my videos here and just
take the URL and type YouTube DL and
just paste the link in and it's gonna be
smart enough to actually figure out what
the video ID is right here and it goes
and downloads the webpage it goes and
figures it all out and now it's going
ahead and downloading it so I'll just
pause it a second there we go it took
about 30 seconds or so to download that
one and if I open that on up you'll see
that I've got my learned Redux one up
and running I can open that up in my VLC
player here and I've gone ahead and
downloaded the entire video here pretty
cool there's a whole mess of options
that you can use it by default is going
to MKV it but if you go to the
documentation you're going to see that
there is all kinds of documentation that
you
can use to be able to save it as
different different types you can also
just download the audio you can download
different titles you can name them
special things you can rate limit it
really cool now one last thing I wanted
to show you is that rather than having
to do that 20 times for all my 20 videos
what you do is you go to my YouTube you
grab the playlists you grab the playlist
that you want in this case learn Redux
you copy the URL and now instead of
doing it on an individual video you just
youtube-dl the entire thing and it's
going to download every single one as
you go along that was the first one
you get the point it's gonna download
all of them for you so really cool you
can run this right before you hop on
your train and then you've got them all
on your laptop ready for some learning
on the train so hopefully that helps you
youtube-dl take a deeper look into it
also works on Vimeo and pretty much any
video player that you could imagine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
