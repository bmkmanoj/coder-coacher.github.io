to talk about nesting flexbox and how
you can use that to your advantage when
doing a little bit more of a complex
layout than the stuff we've been doing
so far and this is something that I
stumbled upon fairly recently and it was
something like this so we had like a
slider up here and I just put an image
there to just kind of give you a feel
for it and then underneath the slider we
had all of these items that were for
each slide so maybe it was four slides
here then we had back and next buttons
and I wanted to use flexbox because I
wasn't sure how many of these items were
going to be added there might be four
there might be two there might be three
and then I also wanted to make sure that
the arrows didn't take up as much space
as the rest of them so perfect use case
for flexbox where I ran into some
trouble was I have these if you just
look at the HTML here I've got this ul
which is going to be in my Flex
container and then I've got a li and
inside of that I have a link a pretty
standard now that you're gonna find in
most web development scenarios and the
problem was that I wanted to Center
these things both horizontally and
vertically which you might see like oh
that's that's perfect in Flex box but
the problem became where I actually
wanted the see where I'm hovering this
kind of darker purple that is the link
part because you want to be able to
click anywhere on that darker purple so
I wanted that to be stretch I wanted
that to stretch regardless of how high
like you'll see that this line this is
three lines high and this one is only
one so sometimes it's only going to be
one line high sometimes it'll be three
lines high and I wanted it to just
stretch to the height of the biggest one
which is something fluxbox does very
well the problem with that is if you
want to Center them in that Fox then all
of a sudden that purple box went from
being this high because by default the
align item is stretch in the align item
went to Center which
was just the height of the actual
content inside of it so I asked around
on Twitter and I finally figured it out
which is the answer to it is nesting
flexbox so what we're gonna do in this
quote along is I'm gonna start you off
with with the HTML and the CSS which I
thought we're gonna run into the problem
and then I'm gonna show you how we can
both edit the CSS in HTML we're gonna
have to add one extra element in here
and we're gonna show you how to how to
fix it so let's get rolling all right so
what I have open here is our style that
CSS in our index.html these are just two
kind of starter files and in our style
dot CSS I've just got some base styles
so it looks pretty good if you open it
up in your browser it looks like this
you should see that these things are
sort of running together because by
default they're links and I add a whole
bunch of padding to them and because
links are inline their padding is going
to overlap and not push them down but
not to worry we're gonna fix all of that
and what else I did here is I just took
list-style margin and padding off
because by default that's what a hollis
looks like so let's get up and running
and the first thing we need to do is
since these allies obviously we're
working with the UL the UL is going to
be our Flex container and the list items
are going to be our Flex item so flex
container Flex items and the way we do
that is we say display flex and what
that will do is right away it starts to
look quite a bit better we've got all of
our list items here and they're really
just taking up as much room as they need
to we've got a little bit of extra space
right here and you can see a little bit
of unevenness at the bottom and the way
that we take care of that how do we kind
of distribute the extra space evenly
well we say dot slider - nav Li which is
our flex item let's go ahead and say our
first flex item and then maybe up here
let's give ourselves a comment our flex
container and I say first because we're
gonna actually be nesting them in just a
second so and the way we do that is will
just say flex one and that will just
make them all even so
give it a refresh and whoa what happened
it starts to look like crap again well
um when when I don't know what's going
on with my layout my number one thing to
do is I just put a tiny little red
border around all the elements just to
sort of understand where they are and
I'll give that a refresh and okay this
makes a little bit more sense to us
where we've got these list items and
they're actually falling perfectly into
place it's just the links that are
giving us some grief so we are going to
make these nested flex in just a second
but we're not going to get there just
yet so let's say dot slider - Nev a and
just say display:block with a hundred
percent and what that will do is there
we go that'll just make things look a
little bit nicer so we can kind of see
what we're dealing with here so again
we've got our Flex item which is this
and then we've got our individual links
inside of that now a couple of things I
want to happen here I want these links
to stretch themselves entirely across
and then I want the text to be centered
both horizontally and vertically and
then finally I want these arrows on
either end to be a lot smaller so let's
actually start with those arrows we will
go ahead and select each of them that
slider nav Li or dodge arrow I think
that's it let's check our HTML yeah I
got a class arrow and a class of arrow
we could also said slide it I have Li
first child and then also do a last one
but we got a class on there so let's
let's stick with that and I want these
to be about half the size of the rest so
I'm actually going to put flex one on
here and then go back to our other one
and make that a flex two so that the
these ones will take up double the room
of the arrows so let's see how we're
doing there okay that looks a lot better
we've got these two arrows on being a
little bit smaller than the rest of them
now I want to go ahead
and center the text so let's look at our
flex items here and just centering
horizontal is just text-align:center we
can do that pretty quickly yeah it looks
good but now is where the hard part
comes this is where I thought I was
almost done and I could just say like a
line items Center and we'd be off to the
races so let's try that if you remember
from the one of the first videos the
align items goes on the cross access so
if you remember from left to right is
the main access and the cross access by
default is top to bottom so that's what
we want we want two line items because
we want to Center these suckers
vertically across these this access
right here so where do we put a line
items if you're not sure you can always
head back to the CSS tricks article here
and go and look for the a line items
property let's just take a look here
line items here we go and the Alliant
items it looks like it goes on the
parent the Flex container so what's the
Flex container in our situation well
it's the UL so we need to go back up to
that and we'll say a line items Center
and then this is where I thought I'd be
good to go refresh and oh well that's
not exactly what I wanted now it depends
on how much content is in there now
they're just resizing them so the
default is something called stretch
which is great because you can see on
the list items we're not thinking
talking about the links just yet the
list items are stretching as high as the
highest one is which is this one is
setting the height of it if we were to
change that like if you added a whole
bunch more content in there you'll see
that the list items all of them span the
height of the tallest one so that line
items Center doesn't really work for us
because we still want them we
essentially we want Center and we want a
line item stretch and you can't you
can't just do both unfortunately so what
we actually need to do is do neither
these and what we kind of want to say is
the list items should stretch all the
way the links should stretch all the way
and then whatever is in them inside of
it will vertically align itself so what
we actually need to do now is use nested
flex box so this slider nav Li it is
still going to be a flex item same with
the arrow they are going to be flex
items you can still append a flex
property to a flex item however we can
also make it a Flex container as well so
we'll say display flex so we say display
flex and still flex to so maybe we'll
put a little comment there that says
this is flex item ish so that's like a
property that would go on a flex item
but then this this is flex container ish
and when we say display flex on that
list item there give it a refresh haha
now we're starting to get places where
because we made this list item display
flex it is now a Flex container and now
what is our flex item well if you make a
can something a parent a flex container
then the immediate child which in this
case is our links they become Flex items
so that's great we've already got a
selector down here and this is where we
can take off all that and don't worry
about that we can just a flex basis 100%
and that okay good so that that got us a
little bit further we just took off that
temporary fix and now since it's a flex
item we can use our flex basis however
we still have the problem of the
vertical centering and we still aren't
able to vertically Center them and I
really wish we just had like a text
align vertical right now and just save
it and we'd be off to the races but it's
just not something that we have in CSS
so what we could try is we could
I aligned or on our list item we say
align items
Center maybe that will Center it it does
but then we still have the problem of
these items since they're not by default
they're stretch we're by saying this
we're saying the links these guys were
here need to stretch but it still
doesn't work it's it's similar we and
then maybe you think oh well we also
have one called aligned self could we
say a-line self Center I know that does
the same thing that just tells the list
item to align itself in the center of
the parent so again we're in the
situation where we want maybe we'll put
a little comment we want to stretch as
well as Center so we need to go one step
further and do another display flex now
if we say display flex on this one right
here and give it a save you'll see that
kick good this is this is pretty much
what we want only now we've got a couple
more issues and when we made that
display flex let me bring that back what
it did is it stretched them all the way
across
however like look at the our
text-align:center no longer goes all the
way across as well as the vertical
centering doesn't work at all just yet
so if we make the link flex which is now
a flex container as well as a flex item
we don't have a flex item that's inside
of the link because if we look at a link
this is just the content right so we
don't have any element inside of here
that we can then apply our align items
to so this is unfortunately where we
need to go ahead and add another element
inside of this link and then the easiest
way to just sort of do that is to just
wrap a span around all the elements that
we have so I'm just going to wrap a
span around each of those and we will
give ourselves a selector for that so
dot slider - nav span and we can give
ourselves a little comment says this is
the Flex item and on our link here we
can now say a line items Center because
when we say a line items it's going to
take the child Flex item and center it
let's see where where that brings us
okay good good good now we're almost
there I got a couple issues in here now
we've got it looks like these links
right here aren't centering themselves
looks like none of our text is centering
us and we've got a little bit of a
weirdness going on here so what we need
to do is because by default spans are
display:inline we need to change those
to display:block refresh that does
nothing for us why because we need to
give it a width of 800 percent okay get
in there get in there
our one last little issue that we have
here is like what's going on with this
one why is why is it kind of wrapping
around here and I'm not actually sure
what's going on here probably a little
bug on my end you're probably yelling at
me right now that's it's super clear oh
there we go
so I when I wrap this fan around the
text I it looks like I didn't get it all
so let me jump back to this one right
here on it's because it was on a multi
line make sure you put all the text
inside of the span and that should do it
let me take off that little red ugly
border there to make sure we're okay
and we're hovering it great maybe I want
to add some font size to loops not to
those I want to add it just to the
arrows so dot arrow a font size 30px
there we go that's kind of the one nice
thing about flex boxes you can just jack
up the font size and you're not going to
mess up your your vertical centering on
the items that are different font sizes
so I
that's a little bit confusing to follow
however if you ever run into a situation
where you need items to both stretch as
well as be vertically centered you have
to do the whole nesting flexbox thing
and hopefully this would be a pretty
decent little starter template that you
can pull out of and sort of customize to
make your own see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
