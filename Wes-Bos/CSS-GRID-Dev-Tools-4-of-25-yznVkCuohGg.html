because we're we're essentially making
these things called
columns and tracks and rows and gaps and
they're not elements in themselves like
most things else in in HTML were able to
inspect element and change the color of
her or add a border but with CSS grid
where we're making these things that are
sort of untouchable so what we need to
do is use dev tools in order to get a
better idea of what's actually going on
so open up o for dev tools and I've got
the starter files open up in here and
this is just our standard div of the
class container we got our ten items in
here and I went ahead and display grid
on the container now what I want you to
do is to inspect element and in your
Firefox dev tools you are going to see a
tab here called layout it doesn't matter
which item you've actually selected but
actually you can click on the container
you can see that there's this little
grid here and you can either click that
and that will turn on and off the grid
highlighting or you can go over to the
Layout tab and you see that it will
automatically compile all of the
different grids that are in here now
again the other one that we have here is
the container
the only reason all these other items
are showing up is because I've also
displayed grid them in our base CSS so
no need to worry about those just for
now now what we can do is go ahead and
turn on the visual grid that we have
there and you'll see right away that
we've got some lines overlapping on top
of our grid and this is going to help us
understand where the tracks are where
the columns are where all the different
rows are now there's a couple settings
that we can have here we can first turn
on the line numbers and you'll likely
always want to have those on because
when we get into placing items that's
going to be really helpful area names
you can turn that on or off we don't
have any area names yet we're going to
be learning that in coming videos and
then finally you can extend the lines in
indefinitely so if you want to extend
them way off sometimes are a little bit
hard to see over top of what you've got
and you can change the color of the
items here just click on
I found that if you make them black
that's the easiest to see in all types
of color obviously unless your grid is
black you can change it up a one other
little tip that I found in order to be
able to see them especially when we get
into what did these mean is I turn on
the OS X accessibility zooming so I can
just do zoom in and out we zoom in and
out nice and quick like that good so
let's actually go ahead and start making
some columns we'll leave this open and
we'll sort of see how it adjusts in real
time so let's go and make some columns
first you can see that we really only
have one column so say grid template
column and we'll have 100 pixels and 200
pixels and see what we've got there good
so now you see that we have our first
column or a second column and all of our
rows are automatically being put in
there so first of all one thing we need
to know is that how come that we see
three well you need to know that the
columns and our rows which are
collectively referred to what are they
called tracks they're all called tracks
tracks are numbered not by the actual
column itself but by the lines that
start and stop them so for you're always
going to have one more number than you
actually do column or row so we can
start at one go to two and go to three
now you'll see that we have a bunch of
actual different types of dots in lines
in solid lines showing up here and
actually if we add some grid gap of 20
px you'll see that we also have it so
what what do these values actually mean
it's going to be helpful to sort of hold
these values in our head well I made you
another really nice diagram if you open
up today there's gonna be a line meeting
stop PNG open that up and you're going
to see that the solid line and what that
means is that that is the start in the
stop of the explicit grid and we don't
know what that means yet but we're gonna
be doing it in just a second the
obviously the dashed diagonal lines mean
the gap the dashed lines means that it
is an explicit track so if i zoom really
close in here you see that these dark
dashed lines are going vertically and
because we have explicitly created an
actual column right because we recreated
a column here and we said one will be
100 one will be 200 so the fact that
they are dark dashed lines shows us that
we made those on the flip side we didn't
create any type of rows here they've all
been created themselves so if we zoom
right in you'll see that they are dotted
so I like to call these long ones dashed
and these where ones dotted and you see
that they're a little bit more faint
they're a little bit see-through and
that means that they are implicit again
we'll go more into this but that means
that they have been created without us
saying so because the browser has
created them so we'll come back to that
quite a bit more but it's helpful to
know that all of these lines do mean
something and having them open in your
dev tools is going to be very helpful so
that's it for now let's jump into the
next video which is actually
understanding the explicit and the
implicit tracks in grid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
