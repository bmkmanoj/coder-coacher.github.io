different today I wanted to give you a
quick tip just something I was working
on a top secret website here and I've
got these what I like to call flashes
where it's just some information that
will pop up on your screen now I want
I've got this button here that will
remove it and I want the button to go
all the way to the right-hand side and
then I want this paragraph here if I
inspect it you see it goes all over
cross I want the paragraph to go as just
take up as much room as the button
doesn't and and previously what I would
have done with that is I would have
given like my paragraph like a width of
95% you give your button no with the 5%
then you add it together but with
flexbox
it's a really good use case for
something like this so what you do is
you go on your container in this case
it's a flash and I'm going to display
flex on that element and what that will
do is immediately the two elements will
just take up as much room as they need
so the paragraphs are just taking up as
much room as they need and then the
buttons are going right next to each
other but I want the paragraphs to take
up all of the room that - what the
button takes up so in this case what I
can do is I can go to my paragraph tag I
can apply a flex 1 value to it and if I
also give that a background of read
you're gonna see that because I've given
it a flex 1 it's going to flex grow at 1
and because I haven't given any flex to
the button it's just going to take up as
much space as possibly is available
after the button has given its little
piece of space right here so I could go
ahead and do that so the other one go to
this paragraph tag apply a flex 1 to it
and then we'll slide it over so
hopefully you enjoyed that let me know
if you want to see more of these and I
will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
