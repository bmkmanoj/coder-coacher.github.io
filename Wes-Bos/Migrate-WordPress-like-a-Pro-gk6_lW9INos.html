give you guys a quick tutorial on how to
migrate WordPress it's not a hard thing
to do it's just tedious in that there's
a lot of steps I get a request fairly
often on help on how to do this so I
thought that I would make kind of a
bulletproof video that will step you
through all of the steps what I'm going
to be using in this video is my new
website so I've been redeveloped my West
boss comm I'm not totally done but I'm
going to use this as a good example
there's lots of content lots of images
things like that I'm going to use that
as an example of how do I get it from
localhost which is what I'm working on
right now I'm just running it on test
comm but that's my localhost and I'm
going to move it up to my server so I
can have live on the Internet
so for this I'm using MAMP on my Mac
here as my localhost you might be using
zamp you may be using lamp those are
exactly the same and on my server I'm
using Bluehost so don't worry if you're
not using MAMP if you're not using
Bluehost these are going to be these
steps will be similar to pretty much any
host and you'll be able to follow along
so the first thing that you need to do
when you want to migrate your WordPress
is you need to open it up on your local
computer so here I have just my
WordPress right here you can see all
these regular files and my content in my
themes I've got the theme that I've been
working on I want to put everything in
this folder so not just my theme a lot
of people think oh I just worked on the
theme I only need to upload theme but
there's all kinds of other stuff in here
like in the uploads folder there's
images that need to go over in some of
your other folders there's other assets
neat that need to be pushed up so the
entire kind of folder of files needs to
be uploaded and you're going to want to
do this as soon as you can just because
this will take a while maybe 15-20
minutes to up
load so you want to get it started as
soon as you can so I'm not going to show
you how to use FTP that's another
tutorial altogether but hopefully you
have FTP connection what I've done here
is I'm just using transmit and I've
logged in to my FTP where these should
go they're generally going to be in just
the root which is forward slash however
I'm going to put mine on a in a folder
just because it's not ready for
primetime yet
so in West boss knew these files right
here you may or may not see them these
are kind of the default files that
Bluehost gives me we don't need them so
I'm just going to delete them I don't
like to clutter them up when I put in my
WordPress so delete those now I'm going
to open up my WordPress let's remember
this is my wordpress folder I'm going to
select everything don't suck this da
store file if you see it
and I'm just going to drag and drop it
up there so this again this is going to
take you 15-20 minutes to upload so
while that uploads we're going to move
on to the next steps
now you're probably familiar with when
you install wordpress locally that you
have a database you have a database and
you have your files right now we're
uploading files but we need to take care
of the database section so we need to go
ahead and create a blank database on our
host and then we want to import it into
that so go on and login to your host if
it's blue host you can log in on
Bluehost calm whatever host you're
you're doing just log on in and look for
a button that says cPanel once you click
on cPanel you can scroll down and look
for something that says MySQL databases
you can see it right here
it's got the dolphin on it previously
locally maybe as PHP my admin we don't
need that just yet we want to use MySQL
databases so I'm going to go ahead and
click on that and we need to create a
blank database so with Bluehost they
prefix them here boss type-c underscore
I'm going to call this West boss new
click create database
now it's really important that you log
down this information now so I've just
created a blank database and I've called
it boss type C underscore West boss new
I'm going to go ahead and copy that and
you need to keep these in a safe place
until you're ready to set up your
WordPress so I'm going to go ahead and
copy that notice how I'm only selecting
the words right here
I'm not selecting any of these quotes
and I'm not selecting the period that's
on the end all too often I see people
just go ahead and copy the entire thing
and guess what it doesn't work that's
because there's a period and a quote
there
those aren't part of your database name
may seem obvious but so I'm going to see
fairly often so copy that it's going to
go into my sublime text right here and
it's going to paste these in so DB name
is good so if you got a name however now
we need a username and we need a
password so we're going to click go back
now we're going to scroll down to where
it says MySQL users and we're going to
add a username so I'm going to call it
Wes boss that'll work
password now on this is you're not going
to want to use your regular email
password or whatever it is because this
is going to go into your file where
potentially other developers can see it
so you want to use a password that you
don't use anywhere else so it should be
true for every password however it's not
always is not always true so go ahead
and click password generator and it's
going to suggest to you some crazy
password so just go ahead and let's copy
that and before we do anything else
let's put it into our file here and say
DB password
that's password click I have coffee this
in a safe place click use password go
ahead and click create user and they're
going to say added user oh we also need
that so boss type C underscore West box
so I'm going to put that in here
DB user is aunt oops ok so we've got the
name of the database we've got the user
name and we've got the password again I
can't say stress this enough do not copy
the quotes do not copy the period here
so I've got that click go back now you
might think alright I'm in good shape
I've got my name I got my username I've
got the password let's go ahead and
install WordPress well one last step we
need to add the username to the actual
database so that's the third step that
we have right here says add user to
database so I'm going to say the
username which we just created was
underscore West boss the database name
was on a score west boss new I'm going
to go ahead and click Add
now it says manage user privileges the
user boss type cos boss and the database
of West boss new is going to say which
permissions would you actually need and
when you have more complex applications
you may want to allow people just to do
certain things however in this case
we're press will take care of all of
that so we're going to go ahead and just
click all privileges and then make
changes good user boss type C underscore
West boss add it to the database once
boss new good so I'm going to go ahead
and click go back now we're all done in
this screen right here the next step
that we need is we need to take our
database locally and move it on up to
that new blank one that we just created
so let's go ahead and click cPanel
here we're going to again we're going to
scroll on down to where it says database
tools right here it says PHP myadmin
so this one with the boat you want to
click on that one and this is going to
take a second that's going to redirect
us to our PHP myadmin you've probably
used this before locally but if you're
not familiar it's a way to manage your
database import and edit and all that so
username password you may be you may
think right now oh my Bluehost username
and password that's not the username
password we're looking for we're looking
for this one the username which we just
created and the password which we just
created paste those in there click go
wait for that to log in now we're logged
into our PHP my admin on the sidebar
here you're going to see that we have
West boss new in information schema this
is obviously the one we want we just
created it so go ahead and click on your
database in the sidebar and you can say
see it says here no tables found in the
database basically it says there's no
data in this database there's no
information there's no posts there's no
pages no content at all so we need to go
on our localhost and grab the database
that we're using to develop locally so
um this is going to be different for
pretty much everyone I think on wamp and
zamp it's localhost forward slash PHP my
admin but with map you can go to your
thing right here and there'll be like a
web start or home button that you can
click so go ahead and click that make
sure your server is running as well if
it's not it's not going to work you're
going to see you might see something
like this you need to click on the tab
that says PHP my admin
now in the sidebar here you're going to
see any number of databases depending on
how many word presses you have had
installed locally I'm going to find the
one that I want to export
I've called mine West boss 2014 so I
click on that and all we really need to
do here is click the export tab when we
click on that it says export method
quick or custom if you click on quick
and click go what's going to happen is
it's actually just going to dump all of
your data in right here which is not
really what we want we actually want a
database file so then click back we want
to click custom and there's only one
thing that we need to set here and it
says save output as file so make sure
you click on that and ignore all the
rest click go and you can see that my
database is downloaded to Chrome here so
we're done on the localhost I'm going to
close that tab and move back to the PHP
my admin for my Bluehost on my server
I'm going to click the import tab and
it's it lets you import it by just
browsing your computer so browse your
computer choose file I just downloaded
it right here and click open when you're
ready to go click go
and it's going to take a sec depending
on how big your database this may take
10 seconds it may take a minute
depending on how big it is to upload and
it looks like mine is done here import
has successfully finished 111 queries
executed
sometimes in Bluehost specifically I see
this error that it's read and it says so
something about there may have been an
error or something like that if it says
there may have been in my experience
there's not any error and you can just
ignore it safely so as you can see if I
go to my WP post table there's all kinds
of all my blog posts are in here learned
sublime text line bubbling this is all
the data now and I've moved it on up so
if you have that you can go ahead and
close your PHP mind min we're done with
all the database stuff on on our hosts
I'm just going to go back to my transmit
here and see how well we're doing looks
like things are moving pretty slowly so
I'm going to pause the video and come
back when we're done uploading okay so I
have everything successfully uploaded
just for a quick review I've taken all
of my files in my WordPress directory
and I've uploaded them to a folder where
I'd like it installed now if I go ahead
and visit West's boss a new boss type
comm or whatever the domain is that you
set it up to be you're going to notice
that it'll say error establishing
database connection now that's because
WordPress still thinks that we're
editing locally however we've now
updated our remote credentials so what
we need to do is update the WP - config
file and allow it to point towards our
new database name database user as well
as the password so where do we do that
that's done in the WP config file right
in the root or the main directory of
your WordPress if I go ahead and open
that up you're going to see it says West
boss 2014 root and root now those are my
local host configuration options however
now that we've moved it to Bluehost and
we've actually imported our database we
need to update those three things with
these guys right here now kind of a
little trick to get around this if you
update if you update the WP config file
locally then you're not going to be able
to work on it locally because it's going
to be pointing to your remote server so
you'll want to kind of leave this intact
a great way to do that is to basically
just take your WP config file
duplicate it so it's going to be called
WP config - copy and rename that to
something like WP - config - prod the
name of this is not significant because
we're going to be renaming it back to WP
config a little in just a second however
it's just so that it doesn't overwrite
our local WP config so open up this type
of P config prod in your editor
and we're going to go ahead and update
the database name the username and the
password
so database name let's go back to the
well what we just typed in here it's
this one
next up database username so this one
and finally the password this guy right
here
save that paste it in there give it a
save now we've been doing this locally
and we need to get that up to our server
so we're going to go ahead and take this
guy drag it into our FTP upload that and
you can see it's shown it's going to
refresh this WP config - Prada showing
up right here so we've got this dippy
config and we've got this double P
config sample we actually don't need
them so we can go ahead and delete them
now we want to take this WP config prod
and now we're going to rename it back to
wp-config.php because this is the one
that has this updated info that we just
put in there so I've updated that I've
renamed that on my server not locally
that's important rename that on my
server here now if I go back to my
domain name and refresh what you should
see is either it will take a long time
and just fail or you'll see something
like this where it actually is starting
to pull in pull in your website now if I
go ahead and click on something it's
probably not going to work you'll see
right here it actually just redirected
me back to test comm if I were to even
stop my map
and refresh you'll see that you probably
see something like this it's just broken
nothing's working and the reason is
because if we view source and look at
some of these style sheets let's look
for style dot CSS right here look where
it's trying to to access it from test
com forward slash westballz column
forward slash 2014 dev that's my local
path that's not my West boss new boss
type comm so we need to update the
database every instance that says test
comm four slash westballz comm forward
slash 2014 dev needs to be or whatever
your local domain one's needs to be
updated with the new remote domain and
the best way to do that is to use a tool
called search replace DB so I'm going to
search WordPress search and replace I'll
put a link for this in the notes and I'm
going to go ahead and download I'm going
to do the stable one right now unzip
that and what this is going to do is
it's going to give you a file called
search replace DB to PHP and we need to
upload that to the root of our folder so
take this guy search your face DB to
upload it to our server now we've got
this file called search replace DB to
PHP if I then visit it on my remote
server /search replace DB to PHP hit
enter we're going to see and this is a
tool where it's going to take all
instances of our local let's say maybe
it's localhost ford slash wordpress for
you or maybe it's something like
localhost 888 or for me it was test comm
ford slash west bascomb
for its last 2014 dev whatever your
local URL was where you're developing it
we want to take that and we want to
replace with our new domain name which
in my case is West boss new da boss type
comm so West boss new boss type comm
yours might be something like your
domain calm or hello world.com whatever
it is you want to basically write these
two things out you want to write down
what was the domain name locally so in
my case it was test comm forward slash
these directories and where is it going
to go now this is probably the most
important part so you need to pay super
close attention here notice how I did
not use HTTP forward slash forward slash
notice how I did not use WW or anything
you need to just use the domain name and
where it's going to go do not put
anything in front of it do not put any
forward slashes on the end of it if you
leave a forward slash on it's not going
to replace all of the instances for you
if you leave the forward slash on one of
them you will be in trouble because your
URLs will start to look like let's say I
left the forward slash on here but it
didn't put it on here then my URLs are
going to look like
let's boss new dot boss type com images
or JP content forward slash content or
whatever the URLs are going to be so
because I put the slash on there and not
here my finding replace is going to be
all goofed up so super super important
do not put forward slashes or HTTP or WW
in front or behind on anything we want
kind of just the root here not without
anything on it
so head back to your search replace DB
it's going to go ahead and grab the word
press credentials for you so the hit
submit you can see that it's grabbed my
username my password in the database
name write from my WP config file so I'm
click submit now it's saying which
tables do you want to scan most likely
you want to scan all of them unless you
know you have a reason not to I'm going
to click continue it's gonna it's going
to be a little bit scary so SEC are you
sure are you sure as you sure you should
be sure as long as you have a backup of
this because you just downloaded it so
go ahead and click OK now it's going to
ask search for which is going to be that
first one that we just decided and
replace with most boss a new boss type
comm so I'm going to go ahead and click
Submit
ok completed it did a total of 67 six
thousand seven hundred sixteen rows and
it updated that URL two thousand times
in my website so now if I go back to my
website actually sorry first thing you
need to do right now this is really
important for your really important for
your security you need to delete this
because if someone were to stumble upon
this script and believe me people are
looking for it they're going to be able
to find your database username and
password so we need to go back to our
FTP and delete that file right away
don't leave it too later because if you
forget it you'll have a huge security
hole so now if i refresh this
it's gone it's it no longer is this so
I'm going to head back to my website
here my homepage seems to be loading
just fine if I click on one of my blog
posts I get this error internal server
error now this is because I'm using
something called permalinks on my
website and none of the links on my page
are working so easy fix for that we go
to WP 4 slash admin and log yourself in
I'm just going to go ahead and login to
my website
and all you really need to do here is to
go to settings permalinks and you just
have to click Save Changes again don't
worry about changing any of these
whatever you had set before is already
going to be set you just need to click
Save Changes again and what that's going
to do is it's going to update your
permalink structure and all of your
links should start to work so there we
go
it's worth kind of running through your
website to make sure everything is in
good shape but after that all those
steps should be able to get you up and
running
so let me know if you have any questions
or ways to improve this tutorial thanks
