tip for you today to do with the iPhone
so what happens is when I go to bed and
I whip open the brightness or contrast
in my iPhone and I make it as dim as
possible however we all know that that's
actually not dim at all when you're in a
really dark room it still really burns
your eyes though it still really lights
up the room so what I went searching for
was a way to figure out how to make it
dimmer than dim now there's no apps that
do this I'm not jailbroken on my phone
so there's actually a feature hidden
under accessibility that lets you do
this so that's how I'll show you how to
do that today so open up your settings
and we'll go on to general and then
accessibility which is right here
now the dimmer and dim feature is
actually hidden deep inside of these
zoom functionality so tap on zoom and go
ahead and turn it on now what that might
do to you is actually go ahead and zoom
your entire phone in and it might give
you a zooming magnifying glass so what
you want to do with that is first turn
at the bottom here you see zoom region
make sure that's on full screen zoom not
on like window zoom we want on full
screen zoom and then the third second
thing is if you're actually zoomed in
right now
I want you to take three fingers and
quickly triple tap your phone and what
that will do is it opens up this kind of
zooming menu now you can use this bar
right here to zoom your phone in and out
we don't actually want a zoom it has
nothing really to do with the thing that
we want however it's just hidden inside
of here so zoom it all the way out we
want to tap on choose filter and you can
select low light so I'm gonna select low
light right here you can see I don't
know if you can see this or not but my
phone is almost unreadable but when
you're in a really dark room it's
actually a really great level so a great
way to use it at night however when
you're done when you want to bring it
back to normal all you do is take your
three fingers again triple tap really
quickly oops that was a double tap
triple tap really quickly you can then
select choose filter and then you can
select none from that so that's a nice
little tip thanks a lot let me know what
you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
