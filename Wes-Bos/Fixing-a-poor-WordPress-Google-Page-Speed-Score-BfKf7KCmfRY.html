checking this out hope you're doing well
so I was talking some friends today
about Google PageSpeed and if you
haven't used it it's this tool where you
pop your URL in it analyzes your website
and comes back with whole bunch of
suggestions as well as a score as to how
fast your website is as well as how
usable your website is on mobile and
desktop
so essentially what it is I popped in my
own website and I found out that I had a
fifty one out a hundred which is tons of
room to improve and I'm not really a
performance guy I know quite a few
little tricks and stuff here and there
so I thought like how easy is it to
really fix your website for just a
regular old Jo Josephine developer like
myself so what I did is I got up from me
51 all the way to a ninety four in about
an hour's time my website is a WordPress
website it's pretty heavy on images and
it's been kicking around for a while so
I'm just gonna step through each of the
sections as to what the problem was I
just kind of recorded it just explaining
what the problem was and I went out to
fix it and then I came back when it was
fixed telling you what I did so pretty
off-the-cuff pretty pretty unpolished
but hopefully you can learn a thing or
two from this I'm at West vos on twitter
w es BOS if you've got any suggestion
I'd love to hear from you so enjoy
Thanks hey everyone West boss here so I
was checking out my own website on the
Google developers PageSpeed insights and
I actually get a pretty bad score on
mobile and on desktop it's really not
that great as well so what I was
planning on doing was sort of going
through some of the ideas as to what
they suggest you should fix and see if I
can get it a little bit faster I'm just
gonna document my my findings and what
I've done over the day so a quick run
down my website West boss calm
I've had this website probably kicking
around forever probably just a WordPress
website I've redesigned it a couple
times but it definitely has some cruft
hanging around from the past years so
pretty standard WordPress website I know
a lot of people have WordPress websites
they struggle with keeping it fast so
I'm gonna fix it all right see you in
the next one
all right first one I've got is
eliminate block render blocking
JavaScript CSS in above-the-fold content
so essentially what that means is your
page it says your page has for blocking
scripts and seven blocking CSS resources
and this is generally a problem with
WordPress because you enable a couple
plugins and it just dumps all kinds of
JavaScript and CSS into your head so it
looks like if we take a look at my
website right here this wrapper right
here that's where the content is so I
have been kind of loading in jQuery and
my plugins and some of my own JavaScript
in below the content which is great
because that essentially when the page
loads each of these script tags here
here these ones right here it stops
everything goes and downloads it and
then continues on stops it and downloads
it continues on etc etc so what I need
to do ideally is have most of this after
the content so that people can just
start reading the content and now I have
to wait for stuff like this to download
it's so fast that you won't probably
won't even realize the difference and
then the CSS as well most of this stuff
I think you don't you definitely want
some of your Styles to be in the head
because you don't want to have a page
that has some unstyled temporarily but
it doesn't look like I need all of this
to be in the head and like especially
things like it looks like I'm doing a
bunch of stuff for syntax highlighting
so I'm gonna look at how I can move that
to the foot okay so I actually managed
to get it up to 74 and 80 on desktop
just by doing two sort of simple things
and about half an hour's worth of work
first one was I was actually loading in
a bunch of my scripts via script tags
which I know is not the greatest way and
it's just because this is an older
WordPress theme so I took this all of
the script tags out of my header and
footer dot PHP and use WP in queue
script instead and when you use WP in
queue script - and cute any sort of
JavaScript that you need so I've got
some Google API stuff I've got jQuery
going on here I've got some type kit and
if you're the last parameter here is
something called in foot and you say
true and what that will do is it'll
queue them all up and put them in the
footer and the but they'll still give
you into
script tags at that point so I went
ahead and used this really great plugin
called Zen cache so normally I would
have like a gulp deploy or something
like that or a gulp plug-in that would
come concatenate all my scripts into one
but since WordPress uses plugins I don't
have access to all of the the different
JavaScript that I need
so what Zen cache will do and by default
you turn on it works pretty well but if
you pay for their one it's about 40
bucks it's totally worth it what they'll
do is they will just concatenate it all
your JavaScript into one file and
concatenate all your CSS into one file
as well so if I go to my page in an
incognito tab because if you're logged
into your WordPress I won't show you the
cached version but if right if I just go
ahead now and view page source you'll
see that first of all concatenated all
my HTML together which is gonna save me
a little bit on on page load and then if
I just search for dot CSS it just took
all of my CSS and just mangled it into
one tiny little or big little file and
then if you look for J s dot J s down
here you'll see that right here I've got
my compressor parts J s and this is all
of the JavaScript this is jQuery and
everything that we're required to
actually run my site there's still some
other JavaScript stuff here for loading
in a kismet and some stats which I'm
sure I could get those into the same
file as well if I really wanted to but
they're out there at the bottom page so
they're loading there and what that will
do is it definitely helps me out to get
it a little bit faster I'm at a 74 now
so now it's telling me it should fix
leverage browser caching so setting an
expiry date or maximum age and HTTP
headers for static resources instructor
browser to load previously downloaded
resource and local disk so essentially
what's happening right now is that all
of these like images that I have on my
website first of all they might be a
little bit bigger than they should be
you know I'll take a look at fixing that
but more importantly is every time
someone visits a website there's no
expiration set on it so it's going to
redownload the same image every
single time that they come to it and
things like my logo things like a post
image they may come to my site like four
or five times a month and they don't
need to read download those so I'm gonna
work on that now and I'll see you in the
next all right so I got up to eighty
which say a couple lines added to my
htaccess so if you're not familiar there
is an HT access file generally in the
root of all servers that run WordPress
it's an Apache file but you can also do
this if your server runs engine extra
something like that so you know if you
open your HD access file you probably
see something like this don't worry
about that that's for permalinks but
what I added right here is this header
set cache control max age six sixty
second hundred four thousand eight
hundred essentially what that means is
it will cache all of the images and
files that it sends for up to one week
so if someone comes to my website more
than once in a week they won't have to
redownload all of those so I reran it
and I got eighty one other thing that I
did is I've just found this little
snippet here to turn on what's called
gzipping on my server and sometimes
you'll you'll hear of gzipping and
people say oh it's library is this big
but it's this big gzip and essentially
what gzipping does is it takes sort of
duplicate text like like for example if
you have the word console dot log like
six times in your JavaScript or if you
have Alert seven times in your
JavaScript because you've set it seven
times it's not going to send it seven
times that it will just kind of minify
it and it knows that it just sends the
word console.log once and then it
replaces all the other instances with
some sort of like notifier too deep into
how that works but I know that
essentially if you have the same amount
if you have the same word over and over
it doesn't really matter so I just went
to his website check gzip compression
comm and this is your blast well thank
you so uncompressed my site was that
much but now that turned on gzip it
significantly quite a bit smaller so
pretty happy about that so I'm at 80
I've passed all of the should fix and
now I'm at the desktop looking pretty
good mobile still needs a bit more my
user experience is good but it says
consider fixing
optimized images and then a couple other
of the things here so I'm going to keep
working on those alright one little
thing that PageSpeed is telling me here
is that my images are way too big 7% 47%
too big 7% etc so all this stuff can
really add up to slowing a page down and
I actually use this service called
Kraken dot IO generally what I'll do is
I'll use some sort of like a local gulp
task to compress images and that's free
but when you have a client who has
WordPress they're just uploading all
kinds of images to the WordPress
back-end and you can't really tell them
well boos were on the gulp gulp task
before you upload anything so I use this
cracking image optimizer I think it's
about 5 bucks a month and there's a
wordpress plugin where essentially when
you upload your images it will run them
through cracking and give you all kinds
of really amazing savings like look at
this I'm just running a couple of pngs
through here and they are giving me 75
85 41 percent savings 58% savings so it
turns out I had that turn off on my own
website which I shouldn't have so I
turned it back on and I'm running it
right now and that should save me quite
a bit that's four images uploaded but it
also looks like some of these images
here are in my theme which I'm going to
remedy now just manually run them
through the web interface here on crack
and IO and get those to be as small as I
can as well so all you know what I've
done all right I did it so it's about an
hour's worth of work and totally worth
it brought it from what do we start out
like a 50 something all the way up to 87
on mobile and a 94 on desktop so I just
want to go through these last couple
ones so it tells me consider fixing
eliminate render blocking JavaScript and
CSS above the fold so if you opened it
up it's yelling at me and saying that
the one CSS file that I do have on my
page maybe I shouldn't have that in the
head and essentially what you could do
is you could split that CSS up into what
is needed for the first paint like this
entire one right here and then use the
rest of the CSS in your in your foot and
at the end of the page and load that in
but I'm really not that concerned about
it it's it's a pretty small file and it
loads pretty quickly so I'm not that
concerned with that one what else is it
telling us here leverage browser caching
so I did turn browser caching on that
was in the HT access but it's just
yelling me at me for things like this is
the Facebook Connect it's the only me at
Google API for Twitter o auth Google
Analytics so all of these external
scripts that I need in order to run my
website I don't have any access over
those so they have turned on some sort
of caching but it's not like two days
like I have it set on so nothing I can
do there minify your JavaScript
again it's yelling at me because of
something from Facebook and something
from Google again nothing I can do
same goes for desktop it's it's the same
stuff so that's it
definitely worth putting about an hour's
worth of your time into figuring out how
to make that faster because I went from
a pretty pathetic score to something now
I'm pretty proud of and definitely I'm
definitely interested to see if it
starts to increase the time on my page
and the amount of people that come to my
website so let me know if you have any
questions I'm at West vos on Twitter
twitter.com forward slash West's boss if
you've got questions or anything or you
want to talk about this I'm sure there's
quite a bit more I can do with my
website to make it more performance so
if you've got any ideas on how to do
that I'd love to hear you thanks a lot
