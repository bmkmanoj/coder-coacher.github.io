on sublime text in a video series on
react and one of the questions I get is
how do I use Emmet in sublime text
inside of my react when I'm writing JSX
now there's a lot of misinformation out
there on the internet all kinds of hacks
with reg X's and find in replaces and
whatnot and I'm just going to set the
record straight to just show everyone
how to do it properly so you'll know
that if you've written JSX before you
can't use class equals when you want to
give your HTML entity a class you have
to go ahead and say class name equals
person in that throws people for a bit
of a loop so what you need to do is
first of all this comes built-in to
Emmet and if you were just to type like
P dot person instead of hitting your tab
key I'll show you how to get the tab key
working in just a second you need to hit
ctrl E and that will expand that's the
global keyboard shortcut for Emmett's
expand and that's going to expand
whatever a little recipe that you've
written and it's gonna automatically
detect that you are inside of a
javascript file and it will give you
class name equals person you can go
ahead and start saying hello in there
this works as well as if you have
something like you well with the class
of dogs and you have a line with the
class of dog dollar and maybe you got
ten of them you can just hit expand and
it will give you that increment as well
as the proper class name in there even
more so if you want to use JSX as
variables interpolation you can we can
go ahead and say maybe we want like a
paragraph with the class of name and
inside of that you want the person name
say we have a variable person not name
and beside that we have a paragraph with
the class of age and inside of that one
person's age and if I go ahead and
control e to expand this we get the
proper class name but we don't get our
object and property properly in the
curly brackets so what we need to do
there is take each of them and wrap them
in a second set of curly brackets so I'm
gonna go ahead there and those will turn
blue and you'll notice that the first
set of curly brackets is telling Emmet
that this is content of the element and
the second set of curly brackets is just
going to be saved so that when JSX runs
that you'll see it so that's all you
really need is
control Ian it's going to go ahead but
if you are used to using the tab key to
expand all of your HTML let me show you
how to get that up and set up so the
reason why it doesn't work by default
because when you hit the tab key and
Emmet what it does is it it will assume
that you want to you write HTML and the
tab key is used for a ton of other
things inside if you want to
autocomplete a variable name as you're
typing or something like that so I
recommend maybe just use ctrl e but if
you really want the tab key to be
working you've got some documentation up
on the Emmet sublime one I'll put this
in here and now this is just one key
which is tab and it has a whole bunch of
logic for when the tab key should expand
to Emmet and when it should just leave
alone and use it for the regular tabbing
in sublime so what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna copy everything that we've got in
here and head back to my sublime text
here preferences key bindings - user
don't use default use user and you might
have nothing in here if you've never
specified a custom key mapping in
sublime text just make sure that you
have if you have nothing make sure
you've got a set of square brackets
because it's an array of different keys
you can see in here I'm remapping my
shift TM or command T I'm remapping my
command and and I've got all these
different key mappings that I'm using
here but what I'm gonna do is scroll all
the way to the bottom here and I'm going
to add another one I'm doing comma first
here if you aren't using comma first
make sure you add a comment to the end
of the last one that is there so the
comma and then I'm gonna paste in that
entire thing that we just got it's it's
quite big and the important part that we
need here is if you look on where it
says operand scope selector we need to
change that to tell it what scope that
the tab key should expand to Emmet
abbreviation so we could say something
like source j s and comma text dot HTML
and that means it's gonna work in our
HTML and our JavaScript so if I give
that a save now and you don't want to
restart or anything like that if I go
back into right here and I just type ul
I hit now I'm just hitting my tab key
and it's working perfectly and then
maybe inside of there I can do an Li I
can use my class name
hell I doubt person I can use that
double brackets we were talking about
person dot name and hit tab and it's
working great the only issue is that if
you're not inside of JSX like if I'm
just inside of here like VAR x equals
lol tab it gives me a lol tag instead of
like maybe I wanted an lol variable so
what I did inside of mine is instead of
scoping it right to all of source J s I
use this little plugin called scope
hunter and what scope hunter will do is
it will show you what scope you are
inside of in sublime like right here I'm
just inside of source set yes but if I
go inside of these return ones right
here you'll see that I'm inside of some
round brackets and curly brackets so
what I've done is I've just taken that
kind of round bracket around braces
scope and replaced it with the source
replace the source ijs with the medic
group braces around j s and that means
that when i hit tab i have to be inside
of a set of round brackets around
parentheses and it won't work for me so
here again if I type you all hit tab it
works but if I go down here and hit ul
and hit tab nothing actually works
inside of that so not everyone uses
parentheses to return their item but
definitely a best practice to do so so
we'll recommend that so again I'll post
this entire snippet up along with this
video but if that interests you make
sure you check on out react for
beginners comm if you're interested in
learning a little bit more about react
and firebase and building a whole app
yourself
if you want a little know a little bit

bunch of stuff like this thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
