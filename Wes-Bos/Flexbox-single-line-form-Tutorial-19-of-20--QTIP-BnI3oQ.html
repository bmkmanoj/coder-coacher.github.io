about using flexbox in forums together I
was on the Airbnb website the other day
and they got this really nice little
simple bar that you can use so it's got
a place where you can search where you
want how you can check-in checkout
select the number of guests and hit your
search button so I know that'd be kind
of neat to recreate we could have done
this with floats in wits and stuff like
that however it's nice to be able to
throw your form just a whole bunch of
inputs and have them just kind of
perfectly fit together without having to
worry about how wide are things and
things like that so I've got this sort
of demo up and running
it might not work perfectly on all the
other browsers but the parts that might
not work are just the video and the the
input type of date that's really not to
matter we're more worried about getting
these actual kind of alignment things up
and running so I grabbed this video from
cover if you've never checked out cover
it's covered up Co awesome little
website where they give you just free
auto-playing you videos so I've got this
as answer that's what we're gonna be
building but I'm gonna change it to just
where we're starting off so here we go
this is kind of where we we start off
we've got our inputs they're not all the
same sizes they are kind of a little bit
weird and we've got all these this is
called like a ghost space because inputs
are in line but default they'll just put
some space in between which can be a bit
of a pain when you're trying to align
them all so HTML what does that look
like we got a deal with the classic
cover and that is set to just kind of
span the entire browser it's a hundred
VH and a hundred VW each way then I got
a form with the class of Flex form and
inside of that I've got my inputs and my
labels my dropdowns and sort of
everything that I've I would need so
let's get up and running with that jump
into style that CSS and we are going to
go ahead and start with our flex box the
first thing I want to
do is to actually get this form here
Center so I want it votes a vertically
Center in horizontally Center so we'll
select dot cover which is again that's
the whole thing and we'll set it to flex
so I flex give that a save and it
doesn't do too much just because we
really only have one item inside of it
but we can use flex locks to align that
both horizontally as well as vertically
so first let's do the horizontal and if
we want to horizontally Center something
that is on our main access which is left
to right and for that we can use justify
Content Center and make sure you spell
it right give it a save and bam there we
go our form is now centered left to
right and then we want it to also
vertically be centered in the middle of
this cover div so we'll for that we'll
use a line items Center and there we go
it's perfectly centered BAM right inside
in the middle of the browser and that's
great so we'll move on from cover onto
the actual form itself so this is a flex
item right now but we're again we're
gonna do the same thing what you did in
previous videos is also make it a Flex
container so go ahead and select it and
we will say display flex and what that
does for us is it makes it flexible and
the cool thing about that right away by
saying display flex what happens well it
starts to look a lot better because it
takes everything now that flex form is a
flex container the input the label the
input the label the input the select and
the input those are all of our flex
items and by default it's going to
stretch it across it's going to evenly
make all of these things the exact same
size for us which is fantastic to you to
do
what else do we need to do on there
we'll put a quick border on it so a
border 20px solid rgba put a border
radius on it something like 5px and
alright that's looking good to me so
that's pretty much it so far but we just
got the the issue of this one input
right here not being big enough that's
sort of just the default size that we
have in before you reach for your width
and CSS let's actually go ahead and
select it and use our Flex basis so how
do we select that one it looks like it's
an input with the type of search so we
can go down here and say input with the
type of search and we'll say Flex basis
is set to 500 px let's see so ideally in
a deal world we'd have that input as 500
px so what refresh and we're off to the
races so that that seemed really easy
this is a pretty short video really all
we did is one two three four five
different flexbox or six different
flexbox
properties and that's kind of the beauty
of flexbox is that when you actually
know what you're doing with all these
different properties you can quickly
slap something together which previously
might take a lot of math and a lot of
manual alignment alright I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
