tutorial on how to install a lamp on
your Windows machine this is this will
allow you to run WordPress locally on
your computer rather than uploading it
to a server or you have to upload it
every time you make a change so go over
to lamp server comm click downloads
scroll down and you'll see download
website over 2.2 oh it's sorry I should
also mention that you should be at web
server column for /en so when you're on
the downloads page you'll see web server
to point to click this one it'll
download it for you you want to go over
to your downloads - don't let it yeah I
thought I had it there we go so I have
downloaded ready in my downloads folder
right click run as administrator click
yes to all the popups this will be real
quick next except cyf is fine except
that we want a desktop in a quick launch
next and click install this will take
about a minute or two so I'm just going
to pause the video a sec and we'll come
back when it pops up
okay and we're back the setup is
finished and it's asking us for our
default browser all right it's saying
Explorer which is Internet Explorer
that's no good so we want to use
something like Firefox or Chrome
say you want to go to see Program Files
Mozilla Firefox and click Firefox click
yes to any pop-ups in the installation
is just finishing up you'll get this PHP
mail parameters we're not going to be
sending any mail so you just click Next
leave it as is and finish as you can see
in the bottom we have now over a web
server the icon should be green and not
gray or yellow if it is you can right
click and click start start all servers
or restart all services and that will
hopefully bring it to green for you so
now that we have our local server
running we can just go pop open PHP my
admin or pop open the drip directory if
I give it a second should open fire fog
and we now have something called
localhost on our computer so if you just
go to a new window type localhost you'll
see that we have a server running we
want to now create our own little space
which we can build our website in so
head over to your Explorer and you can
really put this anywhere for simplicity
sake so I'm just going to put it right
on the C Drive you know right click
oh sorry is
here we go sorry new folder we're just
gonna call that WordPress if you double
click that will have nothing in it and
now we need to create a new alias so if
you go to localhost and we type in
WordPress it's not gonna show us
anything but we want that to be our year
all for our new wordpress install so
just go to web server take a look a posh
e and then up ah she directories and
click add an alias now this might be a
little scary but bear with me it's
pretty easy you just want to create the
alias so we want to call that WordPress
and then hit enter and then it's asking
where is it located and if you remember
we just did it at C WordPress so I'm
just gonna copy that back to this I
guess we can't paste C WordPress so
that's where it is we're hit enter yeah
just created press exit hit enter again
and it's gone now if we refresh that
you'll see it's still not found because
we don't have any content in there well
let's say we start up a notepad type
HelloWorld
and we want to save that
again you want to go to your C Drive
WordPress and then we'll just call this
index.html all files save after refresh
this we should see nope we don't just
see a second there we go
sorry you had to have the trailing slash
so if you've got a WordPress site
we're sorry localhost ford slash
WordPress you'll see hello world and
that's just about it this is where we're
gonna be creating our entire WordPress
install so let me know if you do
