creators get fired off or dispatched
with information about what happened so
if I go ahead and comment on a photo it
will say Wes commented neat on this
specific photo what it doesn't do is
update our state which is our store in
redux so we need to create what's called
a reducer on the other end to be able to
handle and update the actual state I
like to think of actions as just regular
JavaScript events that get fired off so
in the browser you can listen for a
click or a scroll or a hover on
something and those events happen
regardless but if nobody is actually
specifically listening to that click
then nothing gets happening so we need
to create a reducer to handle the data
for that so let's go ahead into our
application here and we're going to
create another folder called reducers
and the reason why we create a folder is
that we create a reducer for every
single piece of state now what are the
pieces of state that we actually have if
we open up our store j/s here you'll see
that our state is composed of two things
we have a whole bunch of posts and we
have a whole bunch of comments that
posts are being loaded in from the post
file and the comments are being loaded
in from the cons file and you may have
six or seven different pieces of your
actual state depending on how large your
application is and we need to create a
reducer for each piece of state so when
posts get updated we run the post
reducer and when we run when comments
get updated we run the comets reducer
and eventually those two reducers are
going to get reduced into a single big
one but it's getting a little bit of
ahead of ourselves let's take a quick
look at how we can create a reducer for
one of them so we go to our reducers
folder and we're gonna create a new file
called posts and inside of that we just
need to create a function why because
let's let's do a little common right
here a reducer takes in two things one
it takes in
the action so information about what
happened and then it also takes in a
copy of current state right because
ideally what's gonna happen is it's
gonna say okay here's what happened
which is the action and here is the
store or the state that we have and what
we're gonna do is say okay let me see
and we're going to return a brand new
copy or an updated copy of our actual
store right so in comes the store and
information about what happened we do a
bit of work on it like maybe update the
number of people that have liked this
specific photo and then we then return
the new updated store and then from that
point react is going to take over and do
everything it needs to do in terms of
updating the UI and all of it's a
virtual Dom special stuff so we are
going to create a post reducer right
here so we'll say function posts and we
give it state equals that now why do we
we do that because the first time that
this runs this function right here the
state is not going to be equal to
anything so we're going to set it this
is using es6 default parameters here
we're going to set it to be an empty
array right there and then we are also
going to pass along the action now for
now let's just go ahead and console.log
the state and the action just means to
make sure that it's working once we've
got it all hooked up and let's just
return state why because the way that
these reducers work is it's going to
take in state it's going to modify
answer and return state and we're gonna
have a big old switch team in here but
for now let's just return it make sure
that it actually works and then just
take this function post and make sure
that you export it so I'm gonna say
export default posts and take this code
here and just create a secondary reducer
for our comments we'll call that comment
such yes paste it in there and we're
going to name that comments now one
thing about Redux is that we can only
really have one reducer so we've created
comments reducer and created our post
reducer but we need
to put them into what's called a route
reducer in order for us to use it so we
sort of like make a reducer for each
part of state like posts and comments
and then we put them into one big
reducer and it's going to be able to
handle it from there so in reducer let's
make an index that J's file and this is
exactly where if we go to our storage a
s remember we did this import reducer
from reducers for slash index I said
we're gonna create that in a second now
we're actually going to be creating it
so what do we do inside of that one well
first of all you need to import a method
called combined reducers and that needs
to come from redux itself we also need
to import the router reducer and I'll
show you why we need this in just a
second from react router Redux package
and then we need to import our posts
from our posts reducer and we need to
import our comments from our comments
now you'll notice that I'm using dot
forward slash and that's because we want
to pull in this comments reducer and we
want to pull in this post reducer
because we're going to take this these
two reducers and make them into one so
finally we do Kant's route reducer
equals combined reducers and we pass it
our posts we pass it our comments and
then finally we also need to pass it the
routing because really there's three
things that are gonna live in our state
the posts the comments and then also the
changes of our URLs here so every time I
change that's going to be logged in our
redux as well so we want to say routing
is set to router reducer and what does
that we just pulled it in from here put
it in there and then finally we are
going to export it good so we've got
that up and running before we go any
further let's make sure we've got
something up and running so in the next
video we're going to actually hook it up
to our application so we can fire off
our actions and make sure that these are
running and then we can actually start
getting into the nitty-gritty of
displaying and hooking it up to you I
because the last couple of videos really
we've just been coding and
it's sort of a lot to put together
before we can actually see it run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
