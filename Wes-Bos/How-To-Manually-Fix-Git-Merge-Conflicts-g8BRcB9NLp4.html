this something a little bit different
today and show you some get stuff and
that's because I get a lot of people ask
me like what GUI do you use to handle
your merge requests and and to be honest
I tried a whole bunch of them but I
never really found one that I liked so
what I ended up doing is learning how to
actually read a merge conflicted file
and manually resolve it myself so I've
just been working on this public API is
it's from Todd motto it's like a really
nice little github database of different
api's that you can use and and he's been
like overwhelmed with pull requests so I
offered to help him mountain I merged
about 30 of them so far but now like
we're starting to get to this problem
where we've got a whole bunch of pull
requests where everybody has sort of
pull requested them at the same time and
they all have merged conflicts right
like everyone just added this one line
to the end and they're all trying to
overwrite each other so I thought I'd
show you exactly how I would fix
something like this so first thing I
want to do is there's actually pretty
good instructions here if you click on
the View the command line instructions
and I'm going to open up my terminal
here to make sure that I am on it then
what you want to do is we want to check
out a branch and sort of do the dirty
work on that branch so I like to do
exactly what github tells me to do so
I'm going to check out - B means create
a new branch called this and we're going
to base it off of master what is master
I'm a master right now and that's sort
of like the most up-to-date version of
this github repo so I'm going to check
that out good now I'm on this branch but
I still don't have this code that this
Paul one fits is trying to submit to me
so I'm going to pull it from his repo
and this is where we should end up there
we go now we've got the merge conflict
right here so if I say git status you'll
see that they're both people have
modified read meet MD so I'm going to
open up the readme and I'm going to take
a look at it where we are so the thing
I'm actually looking for right
is somewhere where it says head there we
go so this is what you want to look for
you want to look for all these Chevron's
or angle brackets right here you want to
look for the equal sign and then you
want to look for the closing ones as
long as this is what it's called a
commit hash now how do you look at
something like this because it can be a
little bit overwhelming when you're
trying to merge especially if it's
multiple lines so now what you need to
do is essentially what's happening is
that this line right here head which is
our master the head is like the thing
that we are currently working off of is
is this line that anything between head
and the equal sign is what we have and
anything between the equal sign and the
closing angle brackets is what they have
so we need to look at this what we have
and look at what they have and figure
out how do we manually do this ourselves
now sometimes this is going to be like
some CSS where you might have to merge
them manually you have to put a little
bit of thought into this but in this
case it's pretty straight forward where
this is a line that we want to keep this
is also a line that we want to keep so
I'm just going to go ahead and what I
like to do is just take the pieces from
what they have and move them into what I
have and then when I'm totally happy
with what I have here I go ahead and
just delete delete delete and that is
going to give me everything I like to do
a quick look to see if there's any other
because it's possible that there's merge
conflicts other in other places in the
file but looks like that was it now I
just go back to here I say get status
again we still have that one modified so
I'm going to commit that I fixed it so
I'm going to add everything get commit
minus ten fixes the merge conflict now
it is good you can see my terminal is
green here I know that there are no
there's no weird stuff going on here so
I'm going to check out master so now I'm
back to master if I go back to this file
watch is gonna change it's gone because
now I'm on my master branch and I want
to get merge Paul one fits - master so
I'm going to pull his branch into our
master there we go and now if I go back
to here watch it
back up good now I can just say get push
and then to the origin that you want it
Minds origin and I'm going to say head
or you can say master head is just a way
to say current branch name so git push
origin master Oh cut push get push
origin master there we go I pushed it up
let me go back here now and see like it
automatically merged itself the file
change is still intact this guy still
gets credit for the merge request and
everything is nice and clean because
it's been added so hopefully you enjoyed
that I found that to be one of the best
things that I could learn when learning
git if you'd like to learn more just hit
subscribe and and let me know what else
and get you'd like to learn about
because I'm thinking about doing some
more of them thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
