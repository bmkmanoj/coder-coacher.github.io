how to set up a very basic flex box
where we have display flex on the
wrapper and we can use flex values to
proportionately give sizes to each of
our boxes what we're going to learn
about today is how we can use rows
columns as well as reverse and reorder
each of these boxes however we want so
by default when we look in here we have
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 left to right what
we can also do is use something called
flex - direction so flex - direction and
by default it's going to be row so if
you want it to be a single row like this
across no problem there if i refresh
you'll see nothing's happening however
if I change that to column and give it a
save and refresh you're going to see
that we flipped to a stacked column look
here so all of ours instead of in a row
or in a single column 1 through 10 now
you may be saying well what's the point
of that I could just do with 100% that's
not really flexbox that's just normal
CSS but the benefit of this comes when
we are when we get into wrapping
elements as well as constraining widths
so you can think of this as a blog post
and if we had it as flex direction row
you could imagine we would have 1 2 3 4
5 and then maybe it splits on to the
second line 6 7 8 9 10 if we have column
you could imagine we have 1 2 3 4 5 as
it is and then 6 7 8 9 10 to the left of
it so if you've ever tried to kind of
spill over content to the next column
you know that that's not really that
easy with HTML because you have to
create a second div and float it to the
right with flux box were able to just
say
put half of them on the left and half of
them on the right and show me the first
five on the left-hand side show me the
second five on the right-hand side and
we're going to get into that when we
take a look at wrapping as well as
widths on our flex boxes the other two
that we have are is the ability to
reverse the items in our Flex boxes so
we can say column - reverse and by
adding that - reverse what's going to
happen is we're simply just going to
reverse all the elements on the page so
instead of one to ten we're starting at
ten and going down to one and this is
purely visual which is one of the really
really nice things about flex box is
that if we open up our dev tools here
and I inspect box number ten it's
actually still the last one in our HTML
so we're not taking the HTML out of the
Dom rima nipple ating it with JavaScript
and spitting it back in like you may
have done previously
right now all we're simply doing is just
displaying it differently than we
normally would this of course also works
for row reverse so flex direction row
reverse give it a refresh now we're
going from ten to one instead of one to
ten our flux value of four is still
there in our flux value of two is still
working just fine now that's great but
the real power of flexbox actually comes
from the ability to reorder elements on
the page by a case-by-case scenario so
so often it happens where I get a design
and I'm working on it for a client and
it looks great on the desktop and then
when we resize we get into responsive
what happens is they say oh well put
this thing at the top and nothing at the
bottom and the reality is is that you
you can't really rearrange items what
unless you're using javascript to take
them out of the page and spit them back
in but we're servers with responsive
design we don't have the ability to to
reorder elements
the page so how they lay in the HTML is
generally how they lay when you see them
on the page but with flexbox we are
actually able to order the elements on
the page how we want them to display
visually and that's art that's with a
property called
order so by default all elements are
going to be order zero which means that
they have no order at all and they come
first but when you bring it any value
higher than zero such as one what it's
going to do is it's going to just
rearrange it totally for you so here I
have box three with order one and
refresh you say three is here now three
broad itself all the way to the end and
you may be saying well what I just said
one shouldn't it be at the start well
that's actually because all of the
previous ones like I said are order zero
so if I were to go to box and type order
zero you see that all of those boxes
which is the default come before one so
it's I can take box three and do order
one I can do dot box to do order oops
order two and that's going to bring it
so zero one two I can do box one order
three and then we can skip over to box
six here order for it's going to bring
it to the end here and now we've got ten
right in the middle let's so if I want
to tend to go at the front or maybe in
the middle somewhere I would just take
the remaining numbers and give them an
order that is higher than zero so pretty
simple pretty straightforward little
tool a flex box but super super powerful
that lets us reorder elements based on
how we want them to show up in the
age this is especially helpful when you
have items that are sometimes in the
sidebar you you want a few of them to go
before your content and you want a few
them to go after the content using
flexbox is a really really powerful tool
for something like that
so stay tuned and in the next video
we're going to be looking at using
widths on flex boxes as well as taking a
look at flex Gro flex rank and flex
basis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
