centering videos if you made it this far
congratulations I know that sometimes
it's tempting to just say I'll do these
tutorials later but these videos are
short in to the point on purpose and I'd
love to hear how far you've made it and
how you're feeling about it just tweet
at me I'm at West possibly ESB OS just
tweet at me and say hey I made it to the
alignment and Saturday videos and let me
know what you're thinking of it so
alignment and centering the next four
videos I think this is kind of the meat
and potatoes of flexbox these are some
of the more important parts of flexbox
and I think stuff that you're actually
coming here to learn so what I've done
here is I'm just in the alignment and
centering HTML here but we've got still
the same container and Flex items that
we're talking about and I've just said
display flex on the container so nothing
else nothing else if you've got anything
else in there
make sure you get rid of that I just
want them very basic so the other thing
I want you to do is go to the CSS tricks
article on flexbox and this is a great
reference for everything that is in flux
box and we are going to be starting with
justify content so what is justified
content justify content says how are the
items aligned on the main axis now hold
on what's the main axis again remember
we talked about that in a video before
the main axis by default is from left to
right across the screen from your left
to right and the what's this one called
again where it goes top to bottom top to
bottom that's the cross access good good
great job so we aren't concerned with
vertically centering right now we are
well I shouldn't say vertically centered
because if the they switch then we would
we'll look at that in a second but we
are only concerned about how are these
items here aligned on the main access
which right now is from left to right oh
let's go ahead and go into CSS and we
will say justify content now
justify content has a number of
different options we have flex start
which is the default so if I say flex
start refresh nothing happens that
because the items are aligned to the
start of the Flex container right so
again left to right they start here you
probably figured out that we also have
flex end which means that the Flex
container is we can't really see it
right now but if I say border 10px solid
Misty rose best color ever you'll see
that this is the Flex container it's
kind of going all around here with this
little pink border so it starts on the
right hand side because that's the end
of our Flex container what else do we
have there we've got Center give it a
save refresh and it will just align it
center there we don't want any margin
tricks or anything that doesn't really
make sense it actually just makes the
sense to say justify content we've got
one called space between which this is
kind of cool so right now before I did
any of that our items are just as wide
as the amount of content so most of them
are just as wide as a single number
except for 10 it's a little bit
different in a future video we're gonna
be looking at the Flex property which
will allow you to divvy the the space up
however if you don't have that or if you
have maybe put a width on them or you
just have a natural with on them which
is the case right now if you say space
between it's just gonna start the first
one at the Flex start the last one at
the Flex end and it's just gonna divvy
up the rest of the space in between each
one it's really nice because if you're
doing this with floats you'd have to do
a whole bunch of different math to be
able to figure out all right I have 10
items but I only have 9 spaces in
between and how do I work all of that
out with margins so space between and we
also have space around so what's the
difference between space between and
space around maybe think about it real
quick 3 2 1 refresh ok so what just
happened there is it also took into
account the spacing on the left and the
right so sometimes when you're making
grid or a column or something like that
you don't want space on the left and the
right which is why you have to figure
out
they have the space in between them but
space around will give it you space on
the left and the right how come in this
space right here it looks to be only
about quite a bit less than this one
here is it because of the border or is
it because of something else it's
because on this one one on the right
hand has some space and two on the left
hand has some space so it's not actually
perfectly centered like that even if you
take the border off you'll see that this
space is only half of what we have there
so those are all of them again we got
flex start it's a start
flex end at the end Center pops them
right in the middle and we've got space
between and space around which do a
number of different divvying up of the
less the available space now let's real
quick talk about switching around the
flex direction because I'm really
stressing that our main axis is from
left to right and our cross access is
from top to bottom
however we learned in the previous video
that when you go ahead and change that
so by default the flex direction is set
to what you tell me correct that's it is
set to row by default so that's not
gonna do anything but if I change it to
column give it a save and refresh like
it's just totally different and this is
generally where people get confused as
to flex box because you change it to
call them and all sudden all that really
nice spacing is gone and the reason why
this is happening is because of two
things first of all how high is this
container here I'm gonna put this border
back on a refresh how high is it well
this border goes all the way down it's
really just as high as the content needs
to go and if you made this content any
bigger or smaller it would just kind of
go ahead on up and down with it so for
us to actually take advantage of
justified content when we switch the
main access from row just left to right
to column just top to bottom is we need
to actually give this container a height
so I'm just gonna go ahead and say min
height 100 VH like we did in the past
videos and that will set a fixed height
on the or at least a minimum fixed
height on
there refresh that does nothing why
because these are way too big for it
it's actually spilling on out of it so
how do we make these items a little bit
smaller so we can actually visualize
that now let's go back to here and
change these to 20 does that work
perfect so now we are still on justified
content space around but let me change
that back to flex start okay so now our
Flex container is this pink border here
goes all the way down into the bottom
and we are at the Flex start which
instead of going from left to right
because the main access was left to
right now our main access is top to
bottom it's going to start at the top so
you probably figure out what happens
when we make it flex n it starts them at
the bottom and goes on up same goes for
if we change it to Center and there
that's the Big Kahuna everyone wants to
know how do i vertically sin or
something with Flex box and that is one
of the ways we're gonna look at a couple
more ways that might not say because you
might not want columns in your case you
still might want to stick with your rows
but that's definitely one of them again
space between better between you're
gonna see the space between similarly
space around is going to give you some
space at the top in the bottom so again
when you're doing this stuff just always
stop ask yourself where is my main
access where is my cross access tell me
right now where's our main access top to
bottom where's our cross access left to
right so okay that's good in the next
video we're going to be looking at a
line items which is sort of the
flip-flop of this instead of working the
main access we're working on the cross
access so see in that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
