just dead simple equal height columns
and talked a little bit about what you
do with the extra columns at the end
once they've wrapped on so what if it
got here is if guy did with the class of
elements and then I've got a whole bunch
of divs here with some text in it so
open up your style dot CSS and again all
this is just regular CSS to make it look
decent we're going to start down here so
if I want these things to go beside each
other I want them to be in columns and I
want them to be of equal height of the
largest one how do we do that well go
ahead and select the elements so
elements again this is gonna be our you
tell me Flex container good I heard you
from wherever you are
so we'll say display flex give it a save
refresh and oh holy smokes
so what it does by default is it will
put them together and how is it
determining the the width of these
columns
well parkansas is determining the width
of these columns and that's really not
what we want but when you say Flex
things by default are in a row and they
will just go forever they do not wrap
that's the word we're looking for they
do not wrap by default so how do we turn
wrapping on well flex wrap wrap and I
give it a save and bam
okay I was starting to starting to wrap
and it's kind of interesting this is
something that you might want it kind of
just tries to fit as many as it possibly
can how big are these elements here they
are as big as the content and needs them
to be sometimes you only get one on a
line sometimes you get to I don't see
any three but if I were to make this
bigger
you'll see that you can fit a whole
bunch of them on the line so that'd be
kind of a cool layout for tags or
something on a wordpress blog however we
also want to give these a width because
we want to be able to sort of fit them
in as we can so select the flex items so
that's touch item I believe yes it is
and we'll say flex one grow one shrink
and let's give it a 33.33% wit save and
ok well that's its first of all we've
got our columns here it's working but
let's let's put that on hold for a
second I said thirty-three point three
three and there's only two on there so
what's the deal here well since we
supposedly gave it a width and if you
look up here I gave it a margin of 10px
so again we're over budget thirty three
point plus 33 plus 33 plus twenty pixels
of margin on either one we're over our
hundred-percent budget so what we could
do there is just set this to calc - 20
px right because we're gonna have 10px
on either side and calc is not part of
flexbox was just part of css3 and
sexually can I use comm let's let's take
a look what's the support support is
really good if you're using flexbox
fluxbox doesn't work in ie9 so if you're
using flexbox you can go ahead and use
calc as well so calc we're gonna set it
to 33.33% - the 20 pixels that we need
and that should give us three per line
there we go
alright so look what's happening here is
this is as bare basics you can get for
equal height columns by default flexbox
will just make the column as high or as
low as it needs to be so this one's
pretty high maybe if we go in here and
take these let's just make these ones
really really small just put like one
word in each give it a save see look how
these ones are much higher than these
ones because it just says alright who is
in my row and how how tall are you and
I'm going to size myself as tall as
the highest one so that's great if we
scroll down to the bottom here you'll
notice that we've got a number that's
not easily divisible by three or is not
cleanly divisible by three so what the
browser does has no problem I'll just
split up the extra area that's the whole
point of the Flex and that's great but
if you don't like that look we have a
couple of other options we go to the CSS
tricks article here and we've been
dealing a lot with the align content and
align items where inline items where we
do it vertically we can do it on the
Flex end or the center and things like
that but we're not really concerned with
the vertical here we're concerned with
horizontal and how are these items split
up so which one are we actually worry
about we're look at justify content so
again this goes on the this is a Flex
container element so we're gonna go
ahead and put it on the Flex container
and with justified content and we can do
things like space between and you'll
notice that it doesn't work and the
reason behind that is because we've told
it to flex grow in this case we've got
extra space and we've told it to evenly
split the extra amounts to if we change
it to zero what that will do is in the
situation where we have more space than
we need which is the case we previously
told it to just split it up evenly and
it did but if we say zero do nothing
with I had the extra space now I've got
this extra space on here and the items
are going to go on either end let's take
a look at the other one since we've got
this extra space that's left over
justified content lets us do we just did
space between which it takes the extra
space and just puts it in between and
since we only have two elements here it
just puts it all in between the two
elements in one big go but we could also
say things like space around which will
split it up between here here
and here as well as flex start flex and
you probably get the point here or I
really like to do Center which makes it
look kind of neat and tidy depending on
it
what you might be tempted to say no I
don't like that let's bring it back
let's bring it back to stretch and give
it a save and it won't work and why not
because stretch is not a justified
content property you'll see it's not
listed here but how do we do that well
we just take justify content all the way
off and we tell our items to grow with
the extra space in a magnitude of 1 and
we're off to the races and good to go
so again super simple this is something
that a lot of people need to use flexbox
for so keep this one handy and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
