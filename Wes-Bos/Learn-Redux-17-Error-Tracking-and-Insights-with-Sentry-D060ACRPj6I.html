application or a client site that you're
working on email you a part call you up
and say hey the website is broken I'm
not able to download this thing when I
click an error it's broken and that's
the most unhelpful information ever
because you have no context as to how it
works and the classic thing that always
happens is you try it out on your
machine in it works just fine
so what century does is it provides
error tracking as well as some fantastic
insights into what happened it works for
JavaScript as well as pretty much any
language you can think of but what we're
really concerned here is the client-side
error tracking so this is what it is and
I'm gonna bring you over to my century
dashboard I've been running this on an
application and I caused a couple things
to go ahead and error out now sentry is
generally used for your production
application you can figure in your app
and you let it run in production it's
going to track all of the errors that
actually happen on your users console
and send them back and give you great
insights so here I've got cannot read
property map of undefined if I click
through to that what it's gonna give me
is some really good insights and
information as to what happened so it
tells me that this happened three times
to one person over the last 24 hours it
recently just spiked up in over the last
30 days we've never seen this before and
I find that really helpful because
sometimes I'll see an error spiked up in
here and I'll know okay that's a that's
a recent thing that's happening to a lot
of people or no that's just an edge
cases happening to do one person who may
have some issues with their browser and
then it gives us some information about
what browser it happened on in what
device had happened on this saved me the
other day where I was getting a bunch of
errors from from users saying hey the
Downloads aren't working and I really
didn't know why it was happening so I
was able to go into sentry and peer into
the tags here and I was able to say oh
this download error is only happening on
Safari on the iPad and I was able to
just whip out my iPad
reproduce the issue and get it fixed
without that I would have had to email
them and hey what iOS are you on what
browser are you using
and even if they they care enough to
contact you it tells you the level of
the logger what OS they're actually
running and then what's helpful is the
URL that they're using so which person
or sorry which website are they on which
you are all only on this is happening on
two different pages because I tried to
view the comments on two different ones
so that's really interesting now I can
actually go to the stack trace here and
you know that we are actually running
bundle j/s which is just a minute
version of our JavaScript but it's able
to download your source maps and D
compile them and show you the stack
trace as to where you actually authored
it so I can crack this open and I can
see that we're trying to map on the post
comments and in one case I was on this
one right here and there just was no
actual comments on that one so I'm
trying to run map on something that
doesn't exist so I know that I can go
back to my single here and say or an
empty array and we already coded this
ourselves and that will make sure that
if we call map on an empty array it's
not going to error out on us it gives
you all the information that you would
ever possibly want as to what's going on
in here I'm going to show you one more
error and then we'll get going on our
other one this thought props that
comment is not a function so if I go
through to that be able to see the same
information as to what happened when it
happened who what's happening to what
page is happening as well as a great
stack trace okay I can see this not
props I'll comment that they're saying
that that's not and then I can go back
to my comments here and go ah it's not
comment it's ad comment that was my
actual function name I did it
incorrectly so let's look at how we
would integrate this into our
application and we'll go through some of
the Handy features that sentry makes
available to us
what I like most about sentry is that
it's very passive you don't have to do a
lot of setup you simply just integrate
it into your app and it will do all the
work for you I've got a config dot J s
here and it will import Raven from Raven
jeaious that's the tool that they use to
actually send the arrows from your users
browsers to century and then you have
your key in your app which will I've
popped into a string right here which
gives us our actual century endpoint
I've exported that because we're gonna
need it in our reduction of Graham J s
we also have a log function here which
I'm going to get into in just a second
so what you need to do to integrate
Center into your app is go to your one
point of entry which for our example
it's a Redux of Graham KS is sort of our
our main file here and we're going to
import Raven and we also want to import
that sentry URL now we simply take the
Raven and pass it the century' URL and
call the install method on it that's all
you have to do to set it up and now it's
going to catch all of the errors that
would normally happen in your users
console it's going to send over that as
well as all the information about where
it happened in what happened with it so
I give that a save and now we actually
need to go ahead and write some bad code
so I'm just going to write it on page
load but obviously this would happen
inside of your application on click or
submit I'm gonna say console dot log
window does not exist dot nope and give
that a save and I'm gonna let this
refresh we get the error if you open up
your console here you'll see cannot read
property nope of undefined now if we go
back to our century dashboard here you
get the error cannot read property nope
of undefined
you go on into it you're gonna see all
the information that we are used to
seeing now that is basically how it
works and if that's what you want to do
just get it set up and run it
believe me you you're gonna want this
information collected because as soon as
an error comes in every report from a
user you're gonna have some really good
insights in to use it but let's take a
look at some of the more advanced uses
of Sentri which is going to make your
insights even better so first of all we
want a take a look at custom tags now if
we go into one of these errors
here like cannot read property map of
undefined we've got these tags at the
bottom which tells us what browser
device OS but what if you had some
additional information that you also
want it to group these errors by like
for one example would be if I want to
group all of my errors by a recent git
commit maybe I'm seeing a spike of
errors we can tag it with a git commit
and then see all the errors that are
associated with that specific commit now
the way that we do that is we go to our
config and pass it a settings object you
say tags and you can come up with any of
your own custom tags so I'm gonna say
git commit is something and I'm also
gonna say like user level it's set to
editor so maybe like this error is only
specifically happening on a certain
level of user because they don't have
access to some of the data so I'm gonna
save that in give ourselves another
error here log window dot user dot does
not exist just make another simple error
here I'm gonna make that error happen
there's our error cannot read property
does not exist upon to fine go back to
our dashboard we see this type error
does not exist happen a few seconds ago
after about 10 to 20 seconds your tags
are going to start showing up in the
centry dashboard and you now see that
the user level is 100% editor and also
our git commit is in there and that's
interesting because I can click through
to that and I can see all the errors
that are associated with this specific
git commit or that specific user level
another thing that we can do is create
our own custom exception and that is
exactly what this config function does
here where we log in the exception and
we can provide some additional context
to it that's what I'm going to do here
is I'm going to go back in I'm going to
import the log exception and we can use
that log exception function to log our
own errors you can also pass it a
settings object right here which will
provide additional context so if you
have some information you want to bring
along maybe the person's email address
that information is going to show up
attached to that specific error I should
know here that I'm actually throwing the
error myself here but you may also put
it in a try-catch or maybe a catch from
a promise you get the point as to when
you would log it right here so I'm going
to save that and give myself a new error
and get that error download failed there
it is it's throwing now I'll go back to
my application download failed it's now
showing up click through to it and
you'll see look additional data
email what's boss at gmail.com so if
there's ever any valuable piece of
information what download were they
trying to download any other piece of
information that you want to come along
with it you can pass it along at an
exception level in that object there now
I want to show you how what if you just
want to log in a message and you don't
need all the information about what
happened in the stack trace you can use
the Raven capture message something bad
happened and that's great if you just
need to capture some sort of message
that happened you don't necessarily need
all the information that comes along
with it i refresh this you don't see the
error here because the error didn't
actually happen but I can go back to my
venturi dashboard and you'll see
something bad happen and I get all the
information about what happened
specifically there without the stack
trace finally what I want to show is the
report dialog so sometimes you do need a
little bit of more information from the
user or sometimes the user wants to
provide feedback as to what happened and
what went wrong now I've done this
before where we have a provide feedback
button and that generally pipes into
like a bug tracking system however I
found it really hard to connect the bug
that the person submitted with the
actual user session that the person was
having so what I prefer to use is the
actual Raven report dialog or after you
capture a message or after you log in
exception you can call Raven show report
dialog and that will pop open this
really great feedback form says look
like we're having some internal issues
it allowing me to fill it out now I'm
going to give my email address and it'll
allow me to tell what's wrong
I'm gonna submit that crash report and
go back to the backend of my dashboard
here and we can go to user feedback and
right away it shows up I click the thing
and it didn't work I can see who did it
who submitted it and I can click on that
error it's going to show me the regular
error that we used to but now the
feedback for that specific error is now
showing up giving you even more context
as to what happened so thatís entry
definitely worth signing up for a trial
and running it on some of your apps you
may be surprised as to sales or users
that you're you're losing because you
have some edge case errors that are
popping up on the client side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
