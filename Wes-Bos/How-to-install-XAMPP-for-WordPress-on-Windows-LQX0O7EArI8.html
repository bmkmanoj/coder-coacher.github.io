tutorial on how to install zamp and
what's amp is is a it's a little package
that lets you run applications locally
on your computer so we are going to be
working with wordpress locally on our
computer and we want to be able to run
wordpress on our computer so zamp will
allow us to do that we'll go into more
of what zamp actually is during the
course but for now just know that we
need to have it up and running before we
get to to the class so zamp is is
pronounced zamp you might think it
starts with the Z but it's actually
spelled X a X am PP and first thing we
want to do is go ahead and download it
so if you go ahead and go to google and
search for zamp you'll want to find the
link that says sourceforge so it's it's
about the third third link down when you
search for zamp go ahead and click that
and click the download button now this
will download everything for you and
it's actually quite a bit big download
it 102 Meg's so depending on how fast
your internet connection is it may take
anywhere from one minute on my fast
connection or maybe 10-15 minutes on a
bit of a slower one so I've gone ahead
and installed it or downloaded it ready
I'm just going to go ahead and open it
so you're going to get a few of these
pop-ups here and I'll kind of guide you
through each one of them so this one go
ahead and click yes give it a second so
it's going to pop open now the first
thing that happens is we get this
warning here and basically just is
important because activated user account
control basically what this means is
that because Windows has a bunch of
security concerns on it when we're
installing it we need to kind of pay
attention on all point out this step as
we go through it so when you see this
don't worry just go ahead and click ok
click Next here you'll see all the
things that were able to install this
should be all checked and you can just
push next now here's the really really
important part they need to pay
attention in order for exam to work
properly on your computer it needs to be
installed to see colon forward slashes
zamp so if this says anything other than
that you need to make sure that it says
C colon forward slash stamp you may see
sequel and forward slash program files
for it slashes amp if it's installed to
program files is not going to work
correctly so make sure it says again C
colon forward slash zamp next bit now
means the guys that actually develop
zamp sampsa free program so they kind of
try peddle their services here they
don't need to learn about that just for
now so go ahead and uncheck that box
next and then just go ahead and click
Next so this will take about a minute to
install so while we're waiting for it to
install I'm just going to talk real
quickly about getting it up and running
and some other stuff for the class first
thing is if you have skype running you
need to turn that off while you're
installing it and while you are well
you're starting it you can have it open
later that's totally fine skype has a
bit of a interference with zamp
so in order for to work properly just
make sure that it skypes turned off when
you start start the program second thing
is that your browser that you're using
so we recommend that you use something
like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
Safari is great if you're on a Mac
computer as well though the reason we
don't recommend using Internet Explorer
is because when working locally there
can be some security stuff that Internet
Explorer doesn't like and it can kind of
just get in the way so make sure you
have a copy of either Firefox or Chrome
or Safari installed on your computer
looks like this is just about finishing
up and there we go everything has been
finished and you'll get this screen here
and there'll be a checkbox do you want
to start the control panel now we do
because we want to test that it's
working properly so make sure that's
checked and press finish and this window
is going to open up so this is kind of
like the remote control for getting
everything started there's all kinds of
stuff in here that we that were using
here but the two important ones that we
want to start our Apache in mysql and
we'll learn a little bit about what
these two things are so go ahead and
click start on both of them so i'm going
to click mysql and click start and the
thing that we're looking for here is
that the background of mysql turns green
you see a PID and you see a ports here
basically what that means is that
everything was working properly you can
see a little bit of a log right here it
says it's running so my school is good
I'm going to go ahead and try and start
apache click start and it looks like we
have a little bit of an error here so if
you look at the log here a pot you shut
down unexpectedly made to be to a port
blah blah blah a whole bunch of stuff
you probably don't understand this
happened to me the first time I
installed it so what I'm going to do is
just do a quick restart of my computer
and hopefully that
fixes things okay I'm back and I'm just
going to go ahead and start up that
screen that we had previously so if you
click on your Start button you might see
it here zamp control panel if not click
all programs finds amp and go ahead and
click zamp control panel it's going to
open that up I start my MySQL again
looks like it's working properly start
my Apache yellow and now it's green okay
so this is the the most important part
of coming prepared to the class if
you're having trouble with this make
sure that you email someone myself for a
mentor at your local branch and make
sure that you have both apache and mysql
up and running the last thing we want to
do real quickly is to check that they're
actually working in in the browser so go
ahead and click admin for both of these
and it's going to open up a few
different things so when we click the
apache tab we get this zamp kind of
landing screen and when we click the my
SQL tab we get this which is PHP mine
minutes it's for holding the database
and we'll learn more about that in the
in the actual class so if you see this
and you see this and you see green green
you're in really good shape and you're
ready to start the course so thanks a
lot let me know if you have any
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
