going to learn about a few new array
methods that come in handy when you're
working with data so we've got two
arrays here with some people and some
comments and first we're going to learn
about dot some and dot every dot some
will check if at least one thing in your
array meets what you're looking for
so we'll say Const is adult equals and
called some against it now some will
take a function that will check it for
every single one that we have that's
going to give us our person and we will
say if person dot year and now we need
like the current year so you could take
the current year in and minus that or
what we could do is we could say Const
current year equals new state dot get
whole year if current year - person that
year is greater or equal to 19 then
return true and what that should do the
console.log is adults give us true
because there is someone who is greater
or equal to there we go
a little thing you can do in calls the
log is if you swap curly brackets around
it it's going to show you the name of
the variable as well as the value so is
adult is going to be equal to true that
makes sense now we can make this a lot
simpler I'm going to rewrite it here
counts is adult equals people dot some
person and from that we will have a
block and we need the current year again
and then we can simply just return
current year - person year is greater or
equal to 19 that's going to be a lot
simpler than writing like this I think
it reads a little bit nicer we use an
arrow function here in to return the
current year you want to be a total
hotshot you could take this entire thing
pop it in some parentheses here get rid
of that and then use the
implicit return without the curly
brackets here whoo hot shot that would
do the same thing let's save it I have
to comment this one out so we don't
duplicate the variable and you still get
true in there all right let's do the
next one which is going to be dot every
so is everybody 19 so we can simply just
take this what we've done here and
replace it with dot every and it counts
all adults blog adults that's going to
give us false why is that giving us
false because not every single item in
the array is going to meet our criteria
so some will check if one every will
check for every single one of them next
up we have our a dot prototype dot find
and find it's kind of like filter but
instead of returning you a subset of the
array it's going to return you the first
item that it finds so we want to find
the comment with the ID of eight two
three four two three so say Kant's
comment equals and we'll take this
comments array will call dot find on it
we will run a function against it which
will give us the comment and we'll say
if comment dot ID I believe it is so
we'll check that here we go comment that
ID is equal to that is it a string no
it's a number then return true then we
should build a console.log a comment
good we've got that one specific comment
this is super good now take a second
pause the video try convert this to a
arrow function with an implicit return
what we could do instead is Const
comment whoa whoa comment there we go
comments find comment and then we simply
just return this bit right here and
because that is going to be true or
false we don't need to have an if
statement because it's just going to
return a boolean of true
or false and then that is a nice one
liner rather than having to do it in
that long and then that should still
work exactly the same good
next up and finally we have dot fine
index which is going to find where
something is inside of the array let's
say I wanted to delete one of these but
in order to delete something from an
array you need to know where in the
array it actually is so if we've only
got this ID we say Const index equals
comments that find index and that we do
the exact same thing we did before
comment is equal to that and then for
compa log the index it'll tell us that
it is one which means it should be the
second item in our array there we go now
how do you delete it well there's two
ways you could you could delete it from
the array we could simply just say
comments stop splice we could start at
the index and go for one let's take a
look at what we got here if we type in
comments now console dot table are
comments you see that the super good
comment is totally gone or what you
could also do is and this is very
popular in the Redux world if you create
in a new array of the updated comments
where you would say something like comp
new comments equals an array and what
you do is you just take a copy of the
comments before it so we say comments
dot slice we start at 0 and we go until
the index and then we start at the index
plus 1 and go until the end you don't
pass it anything and that's just going
to build a new array of the comments so
if I console that table the comments
good console table new comments new
comments oh what did we forget here you
give us an array of two arrays so what's
what's wrong with this it's because we
did not spread the items into the new
array and again if this is not making
sense to you feel free to stick with
your splice or go back in
- my es6 videos and check out the spread
operator one so if we console a lot
tables and new comments that that one's
gone however we still have the original
comments array where it says super good
so that's just a couple more array
methods that you should keep in your
back pocket
knowing all of the possible array
methods and when to use them can come in
really handy when you're massaging your
data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
