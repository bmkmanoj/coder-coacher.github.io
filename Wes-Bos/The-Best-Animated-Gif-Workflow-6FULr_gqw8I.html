people ask me what do you use to make
animate a gift what is your workflow
look like and it's a little bit
complicated but I've done a lot of
testing and I found that this is the
best way to get them so if we take a
quick look at my Twitter here there's
two ways that you can upload animated
gifs and really at the end of the day
they're all just mp4 is because animated
gif is a really a crappy way to to
deliver some sort of animation because
the file size is huge and the quality is
very very low but that said if you put
an animated gif on Twitter it will
actually convert it to an mp4 but when
you do it as a gif it will make it
repeatable which means that it will loop
indefinitely and then it will also start
Auto playing in people's feeds which is
really nice to have the downside to that
is the quality is really really poor and
it can't be very long and the upside to
using mp4 is this is mp4 much better
quality I couldn't do this one as an
animated gif because I really wanted to
show the buttery transitions that I have
here and it just wasn't working for me
when I did animate a gif cuz the frame
rate is so low so both of those I've got
two ways to go ahead and record that and
the first one is if I just have a quick
animated gif that I need to do and I can
do it in one shot I use this little app
called cloud app to upload all my
screenshots to and you can it's kind of
cool you can see like how many people
click on them and all you have to do is
you click on this one you drag and drop
where you want the animated gif to go if
you make it big enough you get the
ability to change between mp4 and a gif
I only this one as a gift for now go
ahead and click start and then just go
ahead and do your thing
like move some stuff around jump around
and then when you click finish it will
automatically upload it for me to this
URL here and it should show me a pretty
nice-looking gift the quality is really
good here the speed at which it uploads
everything I'm really really happy with
it the only downside is that there's no
editing and for me editing is pretty big
because let me show you what I've done
here I've got this little thing that
I've written and I say ul Li times 5
this is just the Emmet inside of that
and want a link and inside that I want
item dollar dollar and a hit tab and it
go so if that's like a little trick I
want to show on Twitter or in an
animated gif
I would go ahead and use ScreenFlow
which is a way to record your screen and
then I edit that down I chop it up I
speed the segments up and I'll export it
to mp4 at the end of the day so I've
gone ahead and recorded just uh myself
doing it here and we're at almost 16
seconds here and you can see like it's
going I kind of slow because I need to
make sure that I'm typing it properly
and I did a little typo there I said
t'aime and then now I say item and I
don't want to include all of that and
rather than try to like rerecord it
eight or nine times just absolutely nail
it what I'll do is I'll just use this
editing tool just to trim it down so
first thing I'll do is make sure that it
starts right away when I'm typing so if
i zoom this in a bit and I drag start
typing right about there let's trim it
and then I will go ahead and that one's
fine that's fine that's fine
and that's where I hid the typo so I'm
gonna go ahead and split that and I'm
just gonna let it go and I type the typo
and I in a backspace okay stop there I'm
gonna split it and I'm just gonna go
ahead delete that one piece and bring
this back up here so now it's pretty
smooth I type item dollar dollar and
then I hit tab so good I can just stop
it right there
trim the rest of it good now we're at
about six and a half seconds however
there's still a little bit long for
someone's attention to sit there and
watch it and especially if they catch
the animated gif about halfway through
and they have to wait till it starts
again it's just a little bit too long so
what I like to do is chop it into pieces
that are slow and speed those parts up
so this li when as soon as I type that
Li I'm gonna go ahead and split it and
that part that is too slow for me so I'm
gonna go ahead and split that up and I'm
going to speed that just that part up to
be one second so I'm gonna move these
guys back so you will Li x 5c nice and
fast and I'll probably even go ahead and
make that a little bit shorter and same
with this just make sure that is slow
slow or fast fast fast now let's give it
a quick watch
good hit tab good and we're at about
four seconds now I'm happy with that I'm
gonna go ahead and export it actually
first thing I need to do is trim it so
I'm gonna trim to just about there there
sometimes I'll add a whole bunch of
extra padding on my editor so that you
get like a nice blue background behind
it I'll apply that make sure that
everything oh that's a little bit too
much trimming down apply good so I'm
happy with that I'm gonna go ahead and
export it I have a folder called tweet
gifts I'm going to call this Emmett
expansion mp4 so I'm exporting to mp4
here I'm on a 4k monitor so I scale it
down by half just because the pixels are
doubled otherwise it's gonna be way too
big to convert I leave mine on high all
right you can monkey around with those
if you want and I'm gonna go ahead and
export it almost else base there now if
I go to my tweet gif I can open that up
we called it Emmet Emmet expansion let
me just see what that looks like it's
gonna open it up in VLC and here we go
you will lie it's a little bit blurry on
mine because I'm on a 4k monitor but it
won't be regularly I'm really happy with
that now I got to convert it into a gif
and I've tried all kinds of gift
conversion tools and the one I've
settled on is called gif a Phi and it's
a node module that will take in your mp4
Xin it does an awesome job at making
them very very small I've done I've used
all kinds of tools and this one makes it
the smallest possible size with the best
possible quality so there's a lot of
stuff on here but essentially you just
need to do NPM install - gif I and then
you will get this command called gif Fi
here - OH Emmett expansion dot gif and
it wants Emmett expansion dot mp4 go
ahead and hit enter and I should be able
to open up the current folder
and we'll take it look what we've got
here I'm an expansion gift 43k super
small four and then he made a gift and
then I would just head over to Twitter
make the tweet and upload that sucker
onto here and you're good to go so
that's my that's my animated gif
workflow I'm usually able to crank out
one in just a couple of minutes I've
taken about ten here on this video but
it's it's a lot faster let me know if
you have any questions and thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
