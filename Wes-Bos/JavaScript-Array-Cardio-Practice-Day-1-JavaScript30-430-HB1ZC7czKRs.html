today we're not dealing anything pretty
we're not dealing with CSS we're not
dealing with Dom elements really we're
dealing with the fundamentals of
JavaScript and that is working with
array methods I found that when I forced
myself to get really good at filter map
sort reduce all of those array methods I
found that my JavaScript programming got
a lot better and this is really what I
want to drive home today's just throw a
whole bunch of examples at you and
really get you better at working with
these array methods a lot of people like
to call these filter map sort reduce
these are sort of like the gateway drug
to functional programming so what we've
got here is some data constant Venters
and each inventor is an object and then
I've got also a people are right here
which just has strings but inside of
that string the last name comma space
the first name so first of all let's
kick it off here and and if you think
you can do these on your own please
pause the video and at least try them
yourself but if you're fairly new to
this stuff then then stick with me so
first thing we're going to do is get
people who were born in the 1500s so I'm
gonna say Const 15 equals and we'll take
the inventors and we're going to filter
over it now the way that the filter
works is you pass it a function and that
function is going to loop over every
single item in our array so Albert Isaac
Galileo and it's going to give us the
inventor invent or inventor it's I don't
know eyes they all fancy so what that
does is we take the inventors we loop
over and for each inventor we can decide
whether we want to keep it or not
so go here we'll have an if statement
and we say if the inventor dot and the
dot year so that's when they were born
if the inventor year is greater or equal
to 1500 and the inventor year is less
than 16
or we could do less or equal to $15.99
whatever you prefer whatever reads
easier for you then we are going to
return true and by returning true that
means we keep it and then you don't have
to a lot of times I see else people have
an else here and you return false if you
do not return anything other than true
or something that is true the-- it will
just throw it in the garbage so there's
no need to return false here you just
return true if you want to keep it so
let's take a look at our variable here
will console dot log it 15 we've got two
people as a bit of a pain so I'm gonna
show you a little tip console dot table
aha very nice so these are the people
that were born in the fifteen hundreds
that we here have here now this can be
greatly reduced first of all we can make
this into an arrow function so delete
the word function so you can delete the
parentheses around a vent or if you
prefer and we'll make that an arrow
function good that still works and then
this right here this just is either
return true or return false so what we
can actually do is do it all in line
where we will just return these two
things so it's going to give us the
inventor and we're going to return the
result of these two things which if both
of them are true it's going to return a
boolean of true and if that makes you a
little bit uncomfortable reading that
you can throw an extra set of
parentheses around it I can delete this
we've done it all in one line still
works just as we planned good
next one give us an array of the
inventors first and last names
what does map do map takes in an array
it does something with that array and
then returns a new array but of the same
length I like to think of map as sort of
like a factory machine where it takes in
a raw material and will stamp it somehow
and then and then kick out that item on
the other end or as filter you can bring
in ten things and return to map will
always return the same amount of items
as you give it so here's what we're
going to do
is will say Const full names equals
inventors dot map and we have our
inventor and there from that we are
going to return the inventor dot first
because that's the first name and we can
return inventor last and console.log the
full names kind of works but we still
have a problem with the space here so
you could either concatenate in a space
which will work or you can return back
ticks and use template strings working
great for us past good next up the sort
sort the inventors by birthdate oldest
to youngest so if you've never used sort
the way that sort works is that you get
two items and you have these two items
in your hand and you're asked to sort
just those two items so you say is
person a older than person B and if so
you put the older person on top and the
way that we do that is by returning one
and negative one and that's going to
bubble these items up and down in the
array so we say Const ordered equals
inventors dot sort and we have a
function which that function is going to
give us like the first person and the
second person or a lot of people like
just like to use a and B so whatever you
prefer though so the first person is
going to be a the second person is going
to be B and then we will say if a dot
and we need to do it based on their
birthdate here so a dot year is greater
than B dot year then we returned one
else you return negative one and that's
just going to move these people up and
down in the you can sort of imagine the
bubbling up and down inside of the array
that we have let's take a look at way
here Oh got an error here on line 39
what
we do should be able to smell function
right there we go and now we have the
oldest people here while as the youngest
people now this is really really long we
could really cut that down by doing
something like this so ordered
equals inventors sort and you have a and
you have B and from that we are going to
do what's called a Turner area Turner
area I can't say a properly Turner Eric
Turner area operator whatever somebody
once sent me a message after a talk and
said you said turn right or wrong and
now I'm self conscious every single time
that I say it so from that we want to
have a Turner area which is like a
shorthand if statement was a ear is
greater than B ear and if that is true
return 1 otherwise return negative 1 and
that is the exact same thing that's what
we are doing here just doing it in one
line with an arrow function and implicit
return and a ternary operator let's
double check that still works works
great next one how many years that all
of the inventors live so what our reduce
will do is we're like a sort in a map
they will just take items in and either
sort them or they will turn them into
something else or they will filter them
down what a reduce will do is allow you
to sort of build something on every
single one so if you've ever done code
like this or you like do like var total
years equals zero and then you you bust
out the the old for loop which one is
that right here and then you have
inventors and then you do like total
years plus equals inventors you've done
this before right where you have a
variable before and then you do this
crazy loop and then finally when you're
done you can call so log total years
write a reduced is just a much cleaner
way to do that
and you don't have to do this crazy
square bracket eye which I've seen a lot
of people have a trouble learning so
that's what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say Const total years equals
inventors dot reduce
and the way that reduce works is it's
going to give you sort of like your
running total total or what you've
returned from this function last time so
we're gonna call that total and then we
it also is going to give you the
inventor and from that you wrap those in
some parentheses have an arrow function
here and from that we are going to
return the total which is what the total
was last time around again all these
functions reduce sort filter they just
loop over every single one and then we
are going to return the number of years
that that inventor had lived so where as
a inventor dot past
- inventor dodge year now let's let's
try that it's not gonna work totally for
us constant log little years and we get
this object object seven like what
what's going on here and and the problem
is that that first time around we don't
have a total and it's equal to undefined
so what we need to do is just make this
zero and that will then allow us to add
it up five hundred and twenty three
years
how you doing maybe need to go get a
drink get a sports drink something like
that we have another one coming up here
sort inventors by years lived
okay so Const oldest equals eventers dot
now we're going to sort them and we are
going to get a and B and before I do the
returning one or negative one we're
going to Const we're going to create
some variables so we can use that in our
if statement so that counts
last guy how old did he live a dot past
minus a dot year and then we'll say next
guy is equal to B dot year then from
that we are going to say if last guy is
greater than next guy we are going to
return one or negative one sorry
and then else we are going to return one
now that seems a little bit long
we can really clean that up and we can
simply just say return we can use our
turned our River ear operator return
next guy if that is true negative one
otherwise if that is false return one
and that's the exact same thing as doing
this if statement we just do it in one
fell swoop
it's console.log the oldest consoled on
table that beautiful this guy lived a
whole bunch of years this guy didn't
live as many looking good next create a
list of boulevards in Paris that
contained do anywhere in the name all
right so let's I've got this link here
and this one we're gonna have to do from
the Consul I'm gonna open it up now
we've got all of these boulevards here
and I need to first get the Dom elements
out of the page so how would we do that
well we could say document query
selector but we don't know what to
select so well we have to do is get out
our dev tools inspect whatever it
contains this let's see what contains
all of these here there we go MW -
category Const cat document out query
selector dot
MW category so let's see we got here
there we go category is equal to that
div and then we want to find the links
within it so I'm going to make another
one console links equals against a
category dot query selector all again
you can call query selector on any
existing Dom element doesn't always have
to be document it could look inside of
an existing element and that's really
why I'm doing this in two steps I could
have just said and don't be category a
and found all the links but I really
wanted to show you that you can call
query selector against any existing Dom
element to look inside of that Dom
element so I'm just gonna look for links
inside of that oh let's see we got links
AHA so this is a list of links is every
link on the actual page now what I want
to do is first we're going to convert
that list of links to a list of names
and then we're going to filter that list
of knee
for only ones that include the actual
name silver say Const duh equals links
dot map remember if we take in a list of
links and kick out a list of names so
we're gonna map over each one it's gonna
be a link and from that link we are
going to return just the link text
content and that will give us whatever
the text is inside of that rather than
the entire link we don't really care
about the the rest of the link so let's
see we got here uh-oh link stop map Oh
perfect I'm glad we ran into this what
did I tell you in an earlier video query
selector will return to you a node list
and if we open up the prototype you
don't see map you see for each but not a
map so what we need to do is change this
into an array because right now it's
just a node list so there's two ways we
could do that first you can just wrap
the entire thing and array dot from and
that will convert it into an array or
you might also see see people doing
something like this where you create an
array and then you use es6 spread to
spread every single item into the array
and again if you've watched the es6
videos that I've done on spreads you'll
know that a spread will take every item
out of something an iterable which in
this case is going to be a node list and
put it into the containing array so I
think array dot from is probably a
little bit more readable in this case so
let's go with that and then we need to
this should work now I can't rerun this
code here because I've used Khan so it's
sort of one of the pains of using cons
it's gonna tell you it's already being
declared so I just need to refresh and
rerun this code here duh there we go duh
is a huge array of every single one and
then I'm just going to immediately
filter that so what I like to deal with
with mine is let's just put them on
their own line the first one will map it
and then the second one will filter it
so let's say the street name and we're
going to only return if the street name
includes
so let's see what we got here got a
refresh again and rerun this now duh is
equal there we go now we've got a subset
of that initial array only containing
the inside of it sorry for my French
users I'm we have Canadian French which
is not the same as European French next
one we've got a sort exercise which is
sorting the people alphabetically by and
last name so we're not dealing with the
inventors anymore we're done with those
guys now we actually want to work with
people okay well there's no like nice
object here so how would I do that
well let's go up here to the sort
exercise you know I'm gonna say Const
alpha equals I take the people and we
are going to sort over it dot sort and
let's just use a regular function here
and we can go over to the es6 and we're
going to get the last one and next one
now I don't care about returning
anything just yet what I want to do is
just console.log the last one just to
see what we're working with oh we get an
error because I wrote this code in here
which this was meant to run on the
Wikipedia page and here you're trying to
call query selector against category and
if this category comes back with nothing
you can't call query selector against it
so you'd have to do a check there if you
weren't sure that it was coming in I'll
just comment that out for now and deal
with what we've got here there we go so
look back Glen Lake William so that is
the last one but what I really want is
to convert that into a first name and a
last name so what we can do is we can
say cost parts equals last one dot split
and what are we gonna split it on well
one thing that all of these people have
in common is that there's a comma and a
space so I'm gonna split it on a comma
in a space and let's look at the parts
that we have here okay so now we get an
array where the first thing is the last
name and the second thing is the first
name it's a little bit back
so what we could do is we could D
structure that meaning that rather than
return an array we can put those into
their own variables right away so we say
square bracket last comma first and now
if we just console.log the last in the
first as their own separate variables
there we go
Blake William William make videos
whatever we have there cool now we have
some proper variables to work with and
then we have to do that with the next
one as well and we probably want to
rename these suckers to be something
that obviously we can't use last at
first so let's say a last a first a
first and this one is going to be B last
and B first
that's that's gonna be the last person
and the next person so what you have
here good then we do our simple last
name here that's really all we're
concerned about in this case so turn a
last is greater than B last if that's
true return negative one otherwise
return one lots console.log alpha there
we go
sorted Lake William is the first one
last one is back Len oh we're backwards
there I need to return one and a
negative one instead go back as a first
one
Blake is the last one so you see that
where we're actually not using this data
that we've just made here that's simply
for the conversion but we're still
hanging on to the original string that
we were working with if you did want to
return an array or an object or
something like that
that's where reduce would come in so my
editor is yelling at me here is telling
me that I shouldn't be using a proper
function should be using an arrow
function in this case it still works
just good whoo one more here we go and
this one's going to reuse user reduce
sum up the instances of these so we've
got car car truck truck bike walk car
and I want to I want to tally at the end
of the day in order what to work with
and reduces like one of the most
flexible methods that we have in an
array and this which is another way that
we can use it so sake on
Trane's for tation equals data dot
reduce and we are going to then give
ourselves a function which is going to
be the object obj and then the let's
call item which is going to be car car
truck truck bike on every single one now
we need to start with an object which
has to have something like a car zero
walk zero truck zero and if you're
looking a bit like OS I don't know what
all the possible ones are you can't just
like hard code those in there and that's
right we're just gonna start with a
blank object here and we'll do this by
ourselves so let's go back we're just
gonna start with a blank object that's
the starting and we're gonna loop over
every single one so what we will do is
just console.log item and then return
the object and I just want to show you
here that we're gonna get every single
item as we loop over it good car car
truck bike walk cetera et cetera now
what we want to do is we need to say if
let's do this we'll say object of item
plus plus and usually what that would do
if we had a walk zero here it would just
increment it to 1 but because we don't
know if that key exists just yet what we
need to do is check for it on the end
here so we have to say if there is no
object item then object item is equal to
zero that will just set the initial one
to zero and then we can move along and
increment it and return that object so
if that has worked here althought log
transportation here we go
object bike car truck van so you see
what they're there i I find that reduces
probably the hardest one for people to
get but we start with a blank object and
then every time we loop over one we
first see is there even a zero there to
work with at all if not we mean to make
we need to make an entry for that and
then we go ahead and increment it and
that's really nice because then I could
come along here and add like a like a
pogo stick and when i refresh the key of
pogo stick is going to be added no
problem to that actually probably
wouldn't shouldn't put spaces in there
but no problem added in so whew I know
that was a lot um it's just a lot of
exercise we've got another one coming up
in a couple days that we're gonna go
over as well but if you feel at all a
little bit shaky at these just keep
doing them over and over until you get
til you totally understand what's going
on as well as you feel comfortable just
going into a website and doing one of
these boulevard or Paris or taking some
data and being able to to filter and
sort over it see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
