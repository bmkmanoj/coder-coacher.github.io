Twitter this thing called tukana popped
up everyone was really really excited
about it it claims to do live sauce
editing now if you've ever done this in
the past maybe it was something like
live reload or grunt or gulp watch
plug-in you know that it's not live it's
not instant it's pretty quick in that
you edit your sass and you give it a
save it regenerates and then finally
it'll update your browser right the
problem is that while the demo works
great once you hit really really large
sass files maybe have a really big
project the regeneration of your sass
can take anywhere from a couple seconds
up to sometimes I've seen 10 seconds
depending on the size of your codebase
in the speed of your machine now I was a
little bit skeptical of this so I
decided to give it a shot turns out it
is fantastic and it's awesome so I
definitely recommend you give it a shot
the reason why it's so fast is it's
built on something called libsass now
souse is generally built on ruby however
that starts to slow down with large
projects so a couple of guys have built
this thing called libsass which is just
basically re-implementing sass in c and
c++ and it is fastest hat so right on
top of libsass is what tikona is built
on and i'm just going to show you how to
get up and running in just a couple
minutes so first thing you need to do is
install the node Takano project so if
you don't have node installed make sure
you go to node.js org and install it
probably you already have it and we just
type NPM install toccata and then we do
- G on the end that means it's global
and it's going to install it globally on
our machine sometimes you have to pop a
pseudo in front of there if you get an
error while installing I already have it
installed so I'm not going to go ahead
and do that the second thing is that
Takano works only with sublime text 2 &amp;amp;
3 no other editors supported at the
moment I would imagine that's coming but
we need the Takano plug-in on sublime
text so make sure you have sublime text
package control type install
package now this is gonna bring up a
list of packages and just go ahead and
typed Akana
when it pops up I already have it
installed so I can't reinstall it
however you just typed Akana
and you would see it somewhere in here
just click on it so once you have the
package here installed in the package in
your sublime text installed you are
often ready to get going what Sakana so
I've just got a couple files here I've
got a style dot s CSS and I've got an
index.html don't worry about the Bourbon
folder right now that's totally not
required I'm just going to show you how
it actually does work with some of the
frameworks like bourbon so I gonna have
HTML right here pretty straightforward
I've got an h1 I've got a wrapper and
the P tag inside of that I've got that
open I'm not even running it through a
server I'm just running it straight on
my filesystem right here so it's running
in sublime text but what we need to do
is get the Takano server up and running
on in our terminal so to get that
running I like to just go to the where
you're going and just typed Akana and
then the path of where your website is
located in this case dot is good enough
because I'm in the folder hit enter it's
gonna start up and everything is green
here the one thing we need to do is pair
our browser so you can be using any
browser with your sublime text now if
you've ever used a live reload or
something like this you know that you
either have to use a piece of JavaScript
that you pop into your HTML file or you
use a browser plugin there's no browser
plug-in just yet but I'm imagine that's
coming so I'm just gonna pop this in
you'll notice it's pointing to localhost
and that's the Turkana server that's
kind of watching for changes it's
talking with sublime text so make sure
you take that out before you push alive
otherwise you will have some errors so
now when i refresh this you'll really
see nothing different however if I go to
my style dot CSS and start typing let's
background black you'll see as soon as I
finished the word black like I just
typed that last K it's instantly updated
same if I type color white or font size
10px maybe I'll bump that up bump it
down as soon as I type any of these
things it's instantly updated in the
browser there's no waiting for compiling
and now this is really really nice
because what a lot of people do is they
edit in dev tools then so they can see
it live and then they copy paste it back
into their CSS file wow that's great
it's even cooler when you can do
something like this or maybe you have a
max width of 500 px margin:0 auto
border:1px solid red whoops now you say
okay I'm not 500 px isn't that great and
I maybe need a little padding you can
just use your sublime text shortcuts to
bump it up and down as you want
and you can see it live editing right to
my left in the browser works with any
property really really fast instantly
updated now my first thing was well
that's great but doesn't work with a
libraries like compass or bourbon so I
really like to use bourbon the one
problem are the one snag that we run
into right now is that lip sauce is
right now it's not updated with the
latest version of sass which means that
some of the latest versions of bourbon
encompass don't run with it so if you're
using burr burr and compass make sure
that you grab a version of your library
that runs with SAS version 3.2 I imagine
that would be updated fairly soon though
so I've got bourbon installed it's just
a one one version older and I'm just
gonna import bourbon bourbon good to go
let's open up this
now I can just use any of my existing
let's say let's find the gradient one so
just pop my gradient in there and
instantly as I pasted that in I didn't
even hit save yet you can see my editor
still shows us in the dirty State but
the website has updated right away so I
can just change that to any color that I
want blue red etc etc you get the point
instantly type instantly update so
that's it really easy to get up and
running definitely recommend you give it
a shot and try to work it into your
workflow I'm pretty excited about this
and I think it's going to be a big step
forward for people who like to live edit
their SAS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
