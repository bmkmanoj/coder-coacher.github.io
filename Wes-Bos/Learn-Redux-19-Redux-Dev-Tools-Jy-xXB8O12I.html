dev tools that allowed us to look at
exactly what's happening inspect the
payloads and even toggle on and off
actions that have happened when they
aren't necessarily the last thing that
has happened so for example if I delete
this one and then I go ahead and add one
and then I'll add maybe a second one now
I've added two comments and removed a
comment if I'm working on something and
I'm sort of like debugging or I want to
go back in time to turn that one back on
I can simply just toggle the roof
comment on and off you see it's right
here this one looking great Wes that one
gets turned on and off on and off on off
without having to affect any of these
other things because what happens is
that we we change the state and it's
going to replay all these actions back
on top of us same thing happens when we
hot reload our reducers as we've just
learned is that all of these actions get
played back to us which is really
exciting so let's look at how do we
actually install it and then we'll look
at some of the more advanced features
with the reset revert sweep and commit
so what you do is we use a store
enhancer which will allow us to add
things to our store like redux dev tools
and there's a whole suite of things you
can do with your redux store you can
take a look at the github but the redux
dev tools is probably the most common
and sort of like an entry level one so
let's open up our dev tools here and
let's go to the redux dev tools and you
see like this says no store found and
that's because the Chrome extension and
redux dev tools doesn't know about our
store so we need to enhance our store by
first of all creating the enhancers so
I'll say constant answers equals compose
and compose is a method that we imported
from redux so what this is gonna do is
going to infuse our store with any of
the answers that we want and I put that
on its own line and you could load in
the dev tools yourself and and pop them
up from here but it is much easier to
just use the redux dev tools Chrome
extension and first of all check for
the dev tools extension in the window is
a ternary operator here so if that is
there then we will run it otherwise we
will simply just return the store itself
so that will enhance it and then we take
this enhancers right here and we when we
create our store we pass it the reducer
the default store and then we can also
pass it enhancers so when I save that
now and refresh get a little bit of
error double check what that is compose
is not defined oh we got a swell compose
right go over to our redux dev tools and
now we've got everything happening here
I'm gonna like something increment likes
that's our action that got fired you see
that this is our payload right here it
has an index we go to the comments we
changed our location that is also part
of it that's when we infuse the react
redder with our store that's why we're
able to go back and forth between those
things I can go ahead and add something
and add it in there you see this payload
is a little bit bigger it has opposed 2d
an author in a comment so this is really
good for inspecting like what actions
are getting fired at what time and and
what information is in each of those and
as well it also gives you a copy of
state at the time of this happening so
I'll go back I like a few more like a
few more like a few more and obviously
you can turn these things on and off and
you see like that goes from 79 to 69 was
he doing 10 because we changed it to 10
in the last video you can change it back
to 1 if you like it so that's really it
to set up your store with redux dev
tools now let's take a look at all these
buttons reset revert commit and sweep
sweep will remove any disabled actions
from your log so let's say like okay I
did all the stuff but like maybe it
didn't want this increment link and I
didn't want this increment like I go
ahead and sweep that it's as if they
never happened they get swept from the
thing whereas the rest of the actions
that we have do still stay commit will
work similar to a git commit where it
will remove all of the actions from your
log and make your current state the
initial state so if we think
about like the initial state generally
when you load the page that's your
initial state but if we commit
everything now you see that it's all
cleared but the likes and the comment
that I added to this is still there so
what we did right there is we committed
that to our initial state and then
revert what we'll do is it will revert
anything since your last commit so I'm
going to add another one right here and
says a stupid dog right and then I
realize oh that's not a very nice thing
to do so I'm going to revert back to
that last commit that it just made so
I'm gonna revert so if a couple things
happened it put me back to the home page
because that was an action and then it
also took away that mean comment that I
previously had left but everything that
I've done since the page load wasn't
gone because we what do we do with those
we committed them and then finally reset
we'll bring all Act will remove all
actions and bring your store back to its
initial State this includes anything
you've committed so maybe you say okay
this is the center just a page reload
for you so I'm going to hit reset you
know see that now that zero that set
that first comment that I did there was
gone so take some time and play around
with it you can really see the benefit
of using something like this after you
you play long especially once you get
into some really heavy-duty stuff maybe
not so simple as a like in a common ad
but when you're building some really big
applications this is going to be a life
saver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
