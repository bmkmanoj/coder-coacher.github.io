fundamental understandings of CSS grid
and it's something that's going to keep
coming up so let's make sure that we we
absolutely nailed us before we move on
and that is understanding the implicit
grid implicit tracks and explicit tracks
and the explicit grid and how will we
can sort of use them together in in
order to make a really flexible and
fluid looking website so open up oh five
and the starter file that we have there
I've got four items here and I've
displayed grid it let's go ahead and
turn on our dev tools here so we can see
how it's looking and I'm gonna make my
tracks black good now let's go ahead and
make sort of a 2x2 grid that we have
there first we'll put some gap on there
20px good and then we'll add some
columns
let's do 200 pixels and 400 pixels now
we've got a grid with two columns in it
and then we have two rows so this is the
difference between the explicit and the
implicit I have explicitly defined what
the columns will be and then I have not
defined what the rows will be so those
are what are called implicit so if you
do not create them they are called
implicit meaning that the browser says
oh okay well you've made two columns
great I can put one into there but now
I've got these extra elements left what
do I do with them right like you can't
just throw them out they need to go
somewhere so what it will do is it says
okay well I have no more columns to put
them in so I might as well start to wrap
on to the second line and that will then
create a row so even though we did not
define any rows here the they have been
implicitly created so if we then zoom in
to see everything that we have you'll
see that the solid line means that that
is where our explicit grid has been
started and then the dotted lines means
that is where the explicit columns have
been created and then the dotted
horizontal lines are a little bit
lighter and that means that they are
implicitly created watch how that change
is if we just let's do + / and chain
over two rows as well and now you'll
notice that if we zoom in first of all
we they are much bigger because we have
defined what the sizes of those rows
will be but now if we zoom in you'll
notice that the horizontal lines that we
have in dev tools here are now solid and
dashed and not opaque and dotted and
that is because we have explicitly
defined what they will look like if we
scroll down here you'll see also we have
a solid line and that means that is
where the explicit grid ends so solid
line is where the explicit grid starts
and stops so you can see that it's the
the column starts here and the columns
end here and then up here the columns
start here or sorry the rows start here
in the rows end here so this is a
hundred percent explicit let's make
these a little bit smaller in terms of
rows so maybe we'll do 50 px and a
hundred now here's the big question what
happens if I now add a fifth and a sixth
item to this whoa what just happened
there well we only told it that we want
two columns just is fine so one two and
but then we only size two of the rows
however we have six items so what's
happening is that CSS grid is going to
say well okay I'm done with the explicit
grid see how this solid line ends right
here but I've got extra items so it's
going to then create a a new row for us
and that is referred to as a what an
implicit row good so we've gone over
these we've got our gaap we've got our
grid template columns and our grid
template rows we've done those a bunch
of times now the question is how do i
sighs these implicitly created ones
right we can we can go ahead and size
the values for the explicitly no problem
but the implicit ones will look a little
bit something like this so we say grid
auto rows and the grid auto rows will
define how big the rows are for when
they have
been added so if I were to then add
let's do something ridiculous like 500
px now you'll see that any extra
implicitly created rows are now going to
be 500 pixels high so if I were to dupe
these over into 7 &amp;amp; 8 you'll see that 5
6 7 8
all of those implicitly created rows are
going to be 500 pixels high you might be
thinking okay well could I do something
like this 100 px 500 px and if we go and
inspect it you go on 5 &amp;amp; 6 let's look at
the rules here let's look at our
container you'll notice that it's
actually crossed out and that's actually
currently an open issue at the time of
recording in Firefox is that in Firefox
you are not able to define what multiple
implicit the size of multiple implicit
rows and if we were to open that up in
chrome you'll see that it actually does
work so you should be able to do it it
should be fixed fairly soon but at the
time of recording you're only able to
pass one value for the implicit rows
okay we also have grid Auto columns and
let's say that would be 100 px and give
that a safe now that doesn't that didn't
do anything and that's like how do you
get extra columns so by default what
will happen is you define your columns
and then any extra elements will
automatically be turned into rows but
that's where the next video comes in
we're going to be talking about
something called grid Auto flow and that
is instead of automatically giving us
rows we're going to automatically give
us more columns so I'll see in the next
