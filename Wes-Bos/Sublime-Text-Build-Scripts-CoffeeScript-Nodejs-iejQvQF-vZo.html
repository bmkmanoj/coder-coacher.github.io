tip on how to use build scripts in
sublime text to those scripts are
particularly helpful when you you're
coding in a language that needs to be
compiled and you want to be able to
compile it straight from sublime text
and rather than exiting out to some
compiler so personally I use it on
coffee script and when they need to run
a simple node program so normally what i
would do is just go open up a terminal
window and type see my files here we
have tests coffee I would just type
coffee compile test coffee and then we
have tests j/s um that's kind of
annoying to go in there every time
another thing that we could do is just
watch the file and every time there's a
change to the coffee script file it will
compile itself it's kind of annoying to
have to type in the entire path every
time we want to do that so a quick way
to do that is to create a build script
with in sublime text so you want to go
to tools build system you'll see they
have a bunch of built-in ones we're
going click new build system and this is
kind of a boilerplate that it gives us
we're going to get rid of that make and
the command is basically what we were
just typing into terminal so it's coffee
let's compile and then we need to use
the variable file there's a number of
variables that you can use when you're
running your command so i'll post a link
to that list within my tutorial on my
blog on the next line we need to use a
selector and basically what the selector
is as a way of telling sublime to what
builds group to use within what type of
file so if we go to build system we see
that's on automatic it's going to say
it's going to sense what type of file
your raining use it on that one so we
want to use this on a coffee script file
so we're just going to type source
coffee
and then it will know and then the final
thing is the path and what the path
means is that because when we run a
build script it's going to run through
the Python console because sublime text
is built on Python we don't really want
that we want to run it in bash so just
mean to make sure that we tell it that
we want to do that so says user local
bin zip codes one of us typing user
local bin coffee and then our file name
if we just type coffee that's just a
shortcut so that's it we want to go
ahead and save it I like to keep a a
subdirectory called build this is
obviously within your library
application support sublime text 2
packages and users where all of your
stuff will live I like to keep it build
folder within that so I'm going to name
it my coffee script filled we're going
to save it go over to the build you see
it's not showing up there that's because
we need to restart sublime text so I'm
just going to start it quickly nice
thing about sublime is that it restarts
super quickly they are back up again
load of tools build system and you see
my coffee script filled click that get
also cited to automatic if you don't
have any other ones that are going with
the coffee filename so you see I just
have a bit of coffee script written here
save it show you my window over here
test coffee if we just hit command B
you'll see the Python console pops up
here it says finished and the test ijs
file here
has been compiled if you don't want to
hit compile every time that's fine we
just go ahead and hit WC WC means watch
and compile so that means every time we
make a change drawer file it's just
going to compile it again if we delete
it and run a build I'm good to go the
next one I want to show you is actually
simpler than that one and that's just
for running a simple little no files so
tools build system new build system the
command we want to do is node and we
just want to run against file
selectors sourced is in the path again
Sam is CoffeeScript user local bin save
that we're going to go into our build i
call it my node build save it you start
go over to our node test make sure not
my note build is on hit command B and
you'll see that we just a verra VAR i
equals 9 we just loop through each of
those and you can see it logs them right
up there for us actually there seems to
be an error in here because i have an s
in it also gives us the error that you
normally see in your terminal window
build it again good to go oh so that's
that there's a lot of cool things you
could do a lot of people use it for SAS
um and that's it let me know if you any
questions thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
