you kind of a quick little fix on
something that has been bothering me for
a little bit of time now it's not that
big of an issue so I've never really
gotten around to figuring you know but I
just took a couple of minutes now and I
wanted to share this solution with
everyone so the problem that I was
running into is when you have text that
spans multiple lines however because I
have text wrapping on it's actually just
one line here so often what happens is
I'll be at the front here and I'll be
typing like maybe a P tag and then I
want to go to the end of the line and I
want to go right here and then maybe
close the P tag however a problem is
that with sublime text if you were to
hit the end of line keyboard shortcut
which is on a Mac its command over if
you're on a Windows computer you can you
can also hit the end key and that'll
bring you to the end of the line but you
can probably see what the problem is
here is that my cursor has gone to the
end of the viewable line and not the end
of the actual line number one here so
look what happens when I when I bump up
the text size now my cursor is in the
middle of second line here and if I were
to resize you can see that it just moves
along or is it right here now so that's
not really helpful because what are the
chances that you want to go to the
actual end of the line here which is
right in the middle of your your content
what I want to do is go to the actual
end of line which is right here and this
is extremely helpful when you're on
using multiple cursors and maybe you
want to go to the front here open up a
Peet AG and then jump to the end of it
and close your P tag however now you see
that we're in trouble because I've
closed here and something's going on
here not a really good solution so I'm
gonna go back
so I figured out I went to sublime text
Docs and I was looking through the
commands because basically what I want
to do here is overwrite my keyboard
shortcut which is command left or right
or some people like to map it to command
semicolon or something like that you can
do whatever you want the main thing we
only need to look at here is this move
to command has two options we have
position and by default that's just set
to AOL and yo L takes in two it doesn't
take into account line wrapping so it's
going to put us right here however hard
Yoel is going to ignore in line wrapping
and go right to the end of it so if you
go to your salon tax preferences and
then click on keybindings - user we're
going to open up the actual key bindings
your your key binding settings file you
may or may not have other may or may not
have other key bindings in here
depending if you've done other
customization but what I want to show
you right here is I've already written
it but let's walk through it real quick
I've set mine to super right and
basically super right is command right
on a Mac you could set that to super
semicolon or pretty much anything you
want you can you can play with the keys
depending on your own preferences here
you'll see that move to command that we
just took a look and we have this
argument so we're saying to hard end of
line and basically what we're doing here
is we're overriding the default
functionality of just going to the end
of line with hard end of line we also
have another one here this is extend and
what extend means is should I select it
or not so now if I give that a save it
head back to
my content right here I'm at the
beginning of the line here now on a push
command over you'll see that my cursor
jumps right to the end of it so I could
be on three of them here oops
I could open my P tag do command right
jumps to the end and close them all off
nicely um so and the next thing is that
you probably want that for the the
opposite way right so if I hit command
left I'm still just jumping to this
front of this line here so it's exact
same thing is Super Plus left we do the
exact same thing except we switch out
right with left so if I give that a save
I put my cursor in the middle of these
sentences command left moves it to the
front of each line there's two more I
have in here and you may or may not be
interested in these but what I like to
do a lot is select the entire line and I
do that command shift right and
basically that does the exact same thing
except it selects it so you see I'm
running into the same problem here where
the rest of line number one isn't being
selected so pretty simple we use the
exact same key combo so we did but I
added in the shift key word as you can
see right here it basically this is
going to overwrite the command shift
write command shift left keyboard
shortcuts the other thing we've done
here is we've added these extend here
it's false which means it's not going to
select the text and here it's true which
means it will select the text so when I
give it a save now if I put my cursor at
the front jump to the front command
shift right all three lines are selected
and I can then go ahead and
let's start doing whatever I want
could wrap them do whatever I really
want one downside to that is when you're
working with indented text let's say I
have div and then inside of that I have
a P low there and I was here and I
wanted to select this entire P I could
hit command shift right downside is that
it selects those two indented space
where previously it wouldn't select
those for you oops comment that one out
see it would just select just the text
so still looking for a way around that
but a lot better than normal
let me know what you think and thanks a
lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
