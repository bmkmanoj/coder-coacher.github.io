something called array cardio and
everyone loved it because it's a great
way to just get a lot of practice in and
we've got a lot of like real-world
practice coming in the second half of
this course but I feel like right now we
need a little bit of practice in terms
of making columns and rows and spanning
and really making sure that we
understand placing and sizing items on
our grid so open up get sweaty - start
and I intentionally have not done these
myself so I kinda do it along as as we
do it so our first one is to make the
grid ten columns wide every other taking
up twice the free space so I should also
say at this point don't if you haven't
at least given this on a shot then pause
this video and try to do this yourself
but if you either aren't feeling
comfortable with it or youyou've give it
a shot and you want to see how I've done
it then let's go so giddy up first thing
I want to do is grid Grod grid template
columns and we're going to do repeat we
want five columns or we want ten columns
but every other one so one fr and two fr
and that should give us that should give
us a bunch it's not why oh it's because
I missed a comma there we go okay good
so now we are seeing our one two three
four all the way to ten columns and
every other one is taking up twice the
amount of space good I'm happy about
that
make the grid have ten explicit rows
fifty pixels high each so grid template
rows we are going to repeat ten rows
each one is going to be 50 pixels high
good and now that didn't really do much
but if we were to open up our dev tools
and we were to take a look at our actual
grid you'll see that the grid actually
has all of this free space in which we
could use to to place our different
items in there I'm actually gonna leave
my dev tools open as we do that's good
now let's get into it with item one
start a column three and go until five
so item one we are going to say grid
column and we could say grid column
start our grid column n or do it all in
one so I want to start
three and go until five good then the
next one with item to start I call five
and go until the end so item to grid
column we want to start at five so this
may seem weird that like you can end and
start it the same but remember that the
numbers are the lines in between the
columns and the rows not the actual
columns and rows or tracks themselves so
start at five and then go until the end
well I could say eleven in that would
for sure work but if we were to change
this to being like six then it wouldn't
work anymore so what I want to do is
ensure that it will always go to the end
with a negative 1 and that will span it
to the end and if we were to change this
to something like ten columns or 20
columns it will always go into the end
regardless of how many how many columns
we are actually having good next one
make a item five doubles ban two columns
and two rows so dot item five we want to
say grid column span to good and we also
want a grid row span too and that's
going to be too wide and too high
make item eight two rows high and I'm
eight
what does that grid row span 200 that
didn't work item 8 obviously it didn't
work because I didn't select the right
one make item 15 span the entire grid
wit item 15 so we're going to say grid a
column and the member the trick we're
going to start it at one that works and
we're gonna end it at the end negative 1
and that will span the entire width good
make item 18 span for widths but end at
9 huh okay so item 18 we want it to span
for so grid column span for but we want
to end it at 9 so we're just say 9 and
what that
do is here we go 18 they will anchor it
at the end of line 9 and then it will
size itself for out from there so that's
kind of neat to anchor it based on where
it will finish itself not where it will
start and make item 20 start at Row 4
and go for 3 so dot item 20 you know
went to grid row we want to start it at
row 4 and go for 3 so span 3 and where
do we got it item 20 there we go it's
going up again these empty spaces we're
gonna learn all about that when we talk
about dense good I'm really happy with
that hopefully you are a little bit more
comfortable with placing them let's move
on to the next which is talking about
auto fill and auto fit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
