autofit autofill and min/max and I'd say
after I don't know six months a year of
using CSS grid along with grid template
columns the autofit autofill and min max
are probably my most used pieces of
grids so get ready it's gonna be
exciting so open up twelve autofit in
autofill we're first gonna learn about
what they are and what the differences
are and then we're gonna look at min max
where you're gonna it'll probably click
and go oh that's super handy so I've got
a whole bunch of items here and now I've
got the the word item in it because I
want these to be a little bit bigger and
actually have some content inside of
them and that will go and start to make
some columns so say grid template
columns and we're going to repeat now
instead of saying repeat something like
I don't know five at 100 px that will
just give us five and you don't really
know how many will fit because the the
content of these items could be bigger
could be smaller it depends on what is
actually inside of them and it's likely
not just numbers like we've been doing
so far so we have these keywords called
Auto fill and auto fit and let's see
what they do so auto fill let's do that
first
and let's about let's try 150 px right
here we have to sort of guess how big
one will be but in the next video we're
gonna show how we can automatically size
them so what does auto fill - well it
actually you don't tell it how many
columns you want you just say I don't
know figure it out see how much content
is in each one and then figure out how
many you could possibly fit in that so
I've got my dev tools open I've got good
the grid dev tools turned on to my
container here now when I resize this
you'll see that what's happening is as I
resize the actual items are just jumping
on to the next line and as there is just
enough space to actually put another one
it's going to reflow the actual value
there and break on to the next line so
that's great what is auto fit in as an
alternative to that that doesn't seem
too
to do anything different so what's the
autofill it doesn't do anything it looks
like they're actually doing the exact
same thing so let me actually show you
what the difference is the difference is
when you don't have enough items to fill
up the entire width or the height of a
grid so let's bring this down to four
items delete everything up until four
and then give that a save now what we
see here is that when we have autofill
on you it will sort of like chop up the
grid into as many spaces as it can so it
looks like that here we can fit four
five six spots and then you see it ends
the explicit grid this is the the edge
of the explicit grid here and then
there's just a little bit of extra that
is wasted space because we can't fit it
but as we were to make it bigger it's
gonna pop on an extra one you see it
back on and off on and off just as we
have space for that one
the difference with autofill and autofit
watch how we have it now give it a save
you'll notice that it actually ends the
grid right here it actually also it
still shows us that we have seven tracks
but they seem to all be piled on top of
each other I'm not sure if that's
actually how it's supposed to work or if
that's just a bug in in laying out all
the items there but you see that the
items the grid actually stops right here
and there's nothing done to the right
now why would that be helpful well if we
bring it back to autofill let's say I
wanted to put this item here and this is
something I do quite often where maybe
you've got a bunch of buttons here and
then you want to like put something on
at the very right side what we could do
is we select item four and we just say
grid column Auto or start it wherever it
normally would start and we're gonna end
it at the end which is negative one
alternatively we could just say grid
column end and just give it a ending
value and you see what happens is that
tacks it on to the end of wherever the
grid will end rather than putting it
right where it would normally flow at
the four line now if we were to change
that from fill to fit
there's there's no way to tack it on to
the end because there is no extra
columns being added here you simply just
end it right here so how do you tell the
difference between one well you try one
and if it's not what you want it's
probably the other one that's the best I
can think about remembering it now
that's not all that useful but in the
next video we're gonna be looking at
something called min max where autofit
and autofit do something a little bit
different so I'll see you in that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
