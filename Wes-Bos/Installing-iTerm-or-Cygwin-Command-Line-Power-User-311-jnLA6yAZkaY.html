up with our terminal client so you may
have noticed me using this kind of blue
one what it looks a little bit different
than the one that you might have and
that's because it's not the default one
so I'm on a Mac here and by default Mac
has this application called terminal and
it looks a little something like this
and you can actually configure the
colors and stuff like that however there
is a whole bunch of features that are
sort of missing and it's it's pretty
basic for what you can do with it so if
you're on a Mac most Mac users upgrade
to something called I turn to now item
two is a they call it a replacement for
the terminal and it's just an app that
you launch rather than launching the
terminal one you go ahead and learn
launch I turn so it does all kinds of
really nice stuff like split pane so if
you're running like maybe you're running
a grunt or a gulp task or you're running
a server and you got node running on one
you can find yourself having a few
things open at once and it's nice to be
able to have them all visible at once so
it's got split panes it's got hot key
where you can put it anywhere you want
it's got this really cool thing where
you can just overlay the terminal
instantly over top of whatever you're
doing so maybe your Debian something and
you want to just quickly bring up the
terminal it just kind of overlay it over
top of everything you'd be able to see
what's going on it's got search and
autocomplete and Mosul's coffee and I
don't go over all the little things
essentially where where it comes in
handy is that you find yourself being
becoming a power or user in the terminal
and you wonder oh it'd be nice if they
had this little feature this little
feature and generally I turn to has all
of those little great features so
definitely get set up with that it's got
other things like bells and whistles and
and whatnot to alert you when when
things are up and running if you're on
Linux you probably don't need to have
this talk because you're on Linux
he's probably spent a lot of your time
in the terminal if you're on Windows you
actually need to use something called
cygwin so what we are using here is all
what we call UNIX based thing so OS X is
UNIX based Linux is UNIX based however
Windows is not UNIX based and all of the
terminal stuff that we do here
especially all the terminal stuff that
you do on a server that you may get from
digitalocean or whatever it is that
you're using there are all Linux based
so you need to be able to use the
commands that are unix based rather than
the commands that are window space so go
ahead and download cygwin I'm not going
to show you how to do that just because
there's tons of tutorials on YouTube on
how to install cygwin and get that set
up so once we're in here what you can do
is just open up your preferences you
just go to I term preferences and it'll
pop open your preferences one and just
take a look around here and see what you
can find it's got different things like
you can change the style of the tab
unified idiom I like the metal look here
tab position you can put them on the
bottom you can put them on the top you
can hide the tab bar when there's only
one show tabs etc etc all kinds of cool
stuff there's different profiles so if
you have multiple people on the same
machine I don't know who does that
anymore but if you have different things
that you like set up one example is that
I do a lot of teaching so I have my like
one profile for when I'm just working at
home but when I'm teaching I'm on a
projector and the color scheme and the
size and the fonts and everything need
to be a little bit different when I'm
teaching because the projectors not that
great of a quality so in that case I
might have two profiles to switch
between the two keys you can put all
kinds of little nice little keyboard
shortcuts just like you pimp out your
salon text or your vim or your Adam or
whatever it is that you're using you can
do that as well and hear things like
pointers arranged
on the screen etc etc all kinds of
really nice things that you can do there
so go ahead and install cygwin or go
ahead and install I term too and just
get rid of your terminal on your dock
you can get rid of it and make sure that
you have I term ready to go for all of
these exercises I hope you enjoyed that
