to talk about flexbox ordering which is
a way to actually move the order of your
dom elements without actually moving
them in your dom which is kind of cool
so I want to start just from scratch so
we make sure that we're still
comfortable setting up Flex walks from
scratch so if we look back again make
sure that I've got this container which
is our Flex container and then I've got
a whole bunch of boxes inside of it
which are called our Flex items so the
way that we do that is we select the
container let's go ahead and say dippin
dot container display flex and give it a
save and now when i refresh you'll
notice that all of the items are just
smushed together then we'll go ahead and
select each box each box is a class a
box on it and I'm just going to say flex
one and we haven't done that just yet
that's any future video but essentially
what that will do is it will just evenly
it'll take all the widths that we have
here and it will evenly distribute it
amongst each other we're gonna learn a
lot more about this flex property in all
the different arguments that we can give
it but if for now just know that the
Flex one distributes equally what am i
doing that just saw that this demo looks
pretty nice without it it kind of like
gets squished together and I don't want
to have to get into any more with tricks
than I have to I want to keep these
demos as simple as well so we've got
flex one on there but let's go ahead and
talk about the order property so the
order property if you go ahead and
select like box three its just order so
for whatever reason it's not flex order
like everything else we've done so far
as flex - something let's simply just
order and order we'll take a number
there's no pixels or anything like that
and if you give it an order let's say if
I give it just five give it a save and
refresh you'll notice that we took box
three which is this purple one and it's
moved all the way on to the end so what
did we learn from that well if we give
it in order
five first of all what is one through
four and let's take a look and what if
we just do order one and refresh nothing
actually happens so let's interesting
the default order for everything where
it is not set is zero so by default
everything is set to order zero and
you'll see that it's one two three three
just gets it in there so when you go
ahead and set anything to anything
greater than zero like one it will then
go ahead and put it on the end so it's
zero zero zero all the way to the end
these are all zero and one starts there
so similarly if we go to box seven say
order two it's going to give us all of
these one through ten these boxes right
here and then we've got three and seven
in the order there so if you really
wanted to if this is kind of throwing
you off you could just say everything is
order one now everything goes on ahead
in box three you could say order three
now we've got everything is 1 then box
three which is the purple one is three
and seven is two so they go in that
order so that's really helpful if you're
especially working on like your
responsive design
a lot of times I'll get website designs
from designers and they'll say this is
great and then when it gets to mobile
let's just totally change how everything
looks and you say like well I can't
really do that because the way that the
HTML is written is kind of the order
that it shows up we've got a few tricks
we could do positioning or floating
things left and right but if you want to
totally change the order like if you
want to take this this number three and
just take it all the way out and maybe
put it in the footer of a website then
you you don't really have an option
until now that we have flex box and
that's when you can use order what
happens if we make something negative
negative
let's try box three order negative one
give it a save what you'll see is it
also does work negatively if I make the
Box seven negative two it's going to
to negative one the rest of them are one
because I put it here or if I take this
off the rest of them are zero on so it
works kind of like z-index there's no
units it just kind of figures out what
order everything is in and we'll stick
them in um they're really one caveat
that we have here if I just make this
order one is that if I try and use my
selector here so I'm just selecting one
selecting two and then I'm gonna try to
select four look what happens where I
hover over four and one two and then
three is selected with my thing if I
keep going a little bit further it's
gonna select four let's get one little
one more out of there
so box five order 2 that should put it
right at the end there so 1 2 3 is now
selected 1 2 3 4 5 so like if you're
trying to like actually like copy some
text off of it like let's say I want it
to copy 1 4 2 in 1 and then I went into
here and pasted it I actually get 1 2 3
&amp;amp; 4 so it's not to be used for things
where you need people to copy text
because that's gonna make them or really
frustrate it but generally that's not
what you're doing you're not like
ordering paragraph tags you probably
have like a layout item where this might
be header footer about contact products
where you're just kind of changing the
order at which they come in
so that's order we will see you in the
next video where we're going to talk
about alignment and that's some of the I
think that's what a lot of people are
here to learn where you've got all these
boxes how do you have a little bit more
fine-grained control over aligning and
centering and justifying content of all
the items so see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
