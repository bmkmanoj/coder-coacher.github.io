to filled a pricing grid and I think
this is a really good example because
it's got a couple things first of all
we're in flux box to create these
columns here and then we also have
opportunity to either Center them like
they are now or show you how to use
equal column Heights but still make sure
that this button this call-to-action
button is at the bottom that's a request
I get from clients quite a bit and
previously had been a bit of a pain so
what I want to do is get started open up
your index in your style dot CSS and I'm
just gonna refresh so what we've done
here is I've set you up with some HTML
let's go over the HTML real quick I've
got this pricing grid and this is going
to be our Flex container and I've got
each div here is a plan div with a class
of plan div with the class of plan and
inside of it I've just got a whole bunch
of content that you'd normally find
things like headings paragraphs
unordered lists and buttons so that's
that let's jump on over to our style at
CSS and again this is just base styling
we want to scroll right down to the
bottom and actually start with our
flexbox stuff so my pricing grid I've
made it 750 and I've centered it I'm
just gonna put a border on that just to
show you where it is you get the point
right here's a 750 pixel wide div now we
want to turn on flexbox so how do we do
that display flex that will make it our
Flex container okay and let's see what
we got here alright cool so all right
away we have enough content that what
it's doing is its distributing the items
and because this dog one here is the
most content it's giving it the most
space however it's not exactly what we
want we want them to be equal width so
you need to go ahead and select each
item and if we look here pricing grid is
our flux container each dot plan is
going to be our Flex items a dot plan
and we will say flex one and that will
just individually split it up okay
that's good I'm just going to give some
styling to this one right here say
background 255 255 50.2 cool I'm gonna
go ahead and put some margin on this
maybe like 20 px and in a previous video
I said like yeah you have to sort of pay
attention to your margin because you're
still doing the box model but just like
regular HTML or regular CSS sorry when
you apply a margin to an item that
doesn't have an explicit width on it
it's just going to eat into everything
we had there and give some padding to it
border radius of 4px text-align:center
okay so that should alright that's
looking pretty good
all right now we actually need to go
ahead and we did our flex one I'm gonna
move this to the bottom here now this
might be the layout that you want I get
this request fairly often from clients
where you'd like to have three three
columns here and they should all be
exactly the same size determined by
whatever is the highest and then usually
what also comes along with that is oh
can you just put the buttons all at the
bottom because I know that the text is
sometimes shorter or longer but I would
like the call-to-action buttons to
always be all along the bottom so how do
we do that so by default these ones
right here the align items are stretch
and I'm gonna show you in just a second
where we're gonna change it to line
items into Center and we'll see what
that does it takes them and that's kind
of what we're looking for at the end of
the day however if we don't want that
the default is stretch and when we have
that on it stretches them as high as the
tallest one is which is pretty great
however how do we get these buttons to
then go to the bottom I know that we
have the ability to overwrite a single
item and say align self flex end so how
do we do that let's go ahead and select
our let's say plan what do we got on
that CTA there's a class so dot CTA
and let's say aligned self flex and and
that should stick it right to the bottom
so I'll give it a refresh and it doesn't
do anything and that's because align
self flex end that is a flexbox property
that is applied to a flex item now what
is our flex item in this case well flex
item is the plan in the flux container
is a pricing grid so anything inside of
this flex item it's really nothing for
us so we actually need to go one step
further and also make this plan display
flex as well so remember the last video
we talked about nesting flex boxes is
another situation where you would do
that so say display flex and oh my
goodness what happened well since we
display flex it's going to try and make
it in two rows so what we need to do
ahead here and do is say flex wrap wrap
so they will wrap on to the additional
lines and that fixes some of it but
still we've got all kinds of issues here
where maybe this like Sue this paragraph
right here it can technically fit right
beside the h3 of fish so really not what
we want just yet so we need to go ahead
and select all of the new flex item so
if this plan now is a Flex container as
well this h2 this paragraph is unordered
list this paragraph in this link those
are all flex items so we need to select
them so now a plan angle bracket star
that means all direct descendants of the
plan which selects all of your Flex
items and you can say flex one see what
that gives us it's broken again you can
see why this flex box stuff is so
frustrating
every time you try add something it just
gets worse and worse but again it's
because there's no width on though so we
can say flex basis 100% and everything
is fixed for us we can actually do a
little bit of a shorthand there one 100%
that'll set the grow shrink and the
basis all in one go and we're off to the
races there so great we're in really
good shape there however if we don't
want it to be 100 percent
hundred-percent hundred percent which is
kind of cool what we can do is go back
up to our pricing grid and get use our
align items property and we can set that
to Center so it's not going to stretch
them across it's going to figure out how
high is this pricing grid let's put a
border on that so we can see where it is
to see this red border I'll bump that up
a little bit and that's how big it is
and it's going to Center them right
inside of that flex container so again
another really nice example as to when
you would use flexbox as a component in
a website and as well as using a nested
flex where the plan is both a flex item
and a flex container see in the next
