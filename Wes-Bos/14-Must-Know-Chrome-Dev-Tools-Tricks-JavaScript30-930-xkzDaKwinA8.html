and console tricks kids are you know
most of these already but I hope that
you just learned like one or two little
nuggets from watching this quick video
so what we've got here is I've got a
paragraph tag when you click it it's
going to run a function called make
screen and this function here and I've
just done that in line for simplicity
sake I could add an event listener
there's no difference there and when I
run it it will just take the first
paragraph on the page and make it green
and up the size right so that's
something that happens to people where
they ask me hey like I have some
JavaScript running on the page but I
don't know what is causing it I don't
know what is actually changing it I know
it's JavaScript but I don't know where
the JavaScript that is changing that is
is running so what you can do is you can
inspect it find it in your Dom here
break on attribute modifications there's
some other ones here like when you
remove a child or you were to change one
of the children's text or attributes or
something like that we want this one
attribute modification now when you
click it it's going to pop a debugger
command in it's a breakpoint for us here
and it will then pause exactly where it
paused it'll tell us what the paragraph
is and it'll show us a line of code that
is causing that attribute I could pause
it and go through and we're done so we
can take that off just by going back to
our elements panel taking that off next
up we have a whole bunch of console dot
things and you probably know about
console dot log like Hello which will
give you obviously in this a million
times will log it you can also
interpolate values into it so console
dot log say hello I am a and then use
percent F string and then whatever you
pass it in the other ones you may have
done another language like PHP in the
past where it does this for you and that
will interpolate what
you have passed as the second one into
the first one now I don't use that all
that much anymore now that we have es6
backticks i much prefer just to do
console.log backticks hello I am and
putting my variable right inside of
there but it's totally up to you
whether it which one you'd like it we
can also style our text with percent C
so console.log oh and some great text
and if we put a percent C in front of
there and on the second one we do things
like font size and you can apply any
font CSS to it 50px whoa I am some great
text we can also do things like
background red whoa you can do things
like text shadow 10px 10px 0 rgba let's
just do blue you get the point here you
can do some pretty fun stuff with it so
you do % C in front of the thing that
you want to style and then the second
argument that you pass the console will
be interpolated right into there it's
going to calm us out cuz it's obnoxious
we have a console dot worn which we say
oh no and that will give us a warning it
will tell us the stack traces to where
it got called we have console dot error
which will throw any oh sorry we won't
throw an error it will just display in
there in the console and again that will
also give you a stack trace as to where
that was if we had a couple functions
calling to get to that point it would
give you the entire stack trace there we
have combo info which will give you a
little bit of info like I had like a fun
hold on let me find you a fun fact here
crocodiles eat three to four people for
a year that's a fun fact it should be
comfortable that fun fact but it's info
and it will give you the little I info
one you can use console dot a cert to
check if things are true so if one is
equal to one you will say that is
wrong and if we run this you don't see
anything why because that is true gospel
that assert will only fire if something
is wrong and then it will tell you
assertion failed that is wrong if I were
to grab a paragraph on the page so
constant P equals document query
selector paragraph and then you could
assert that P dot class list that
contains ouch and then you could tell
the user that is wrong and if the class
list is not contained ouch it will tell
you that is wrong or you must apply a
class you get the point here you can
test for something and if it is false it
will throw this error into your console
here and if it is true nothing will
happen so you don't have to have an if
statement in here we have console dot
clear which will clear your console if
you really want to mess with a developer
you could just put that at the bottom of
your JavaScript file so that's that's
really frustrating viewing Dom elements
so I've got this paragraph here and if I
were to come to a lot log that paragraph
that we selected earlier you see this is
the actual paragraph but how do you know
what are the available methods and all
the properties on that element well if
you want to use console dot Durer that's
going to give you a drop-down so that's
the element console log console that
Durr is going to allow you to open it up
and take a look at the class list whoa
open that right up child knows the
children the data set on that specific
one the style all the different
properties and methods that live if you
want to see all the methods you crack
open the prototype all of the stuff that
lives on that element console dot Durer
will show you where as console dot log
it's going to show you the actual
element itself grouping things together
this one is actually pretty cool and
it's going to run another console dot
clear in here if I were to take this
dog's array that I've got up at the top
here and loop over each one so console
dot
dog dot for each dog and then for each
of these I'm just going to let
console.log this is dog name and this is
Snickers this is Hugo but what if I have
some other information age I want to
have like another one dog name is dog
age years old okay and maybe another one
dog named our dog's age times seven dog
years old so this gets a little bit
hairy got a lot going on here and
imagine you're doing more stuff than
just console logging three strings you
have a lot of stuff so what we can do is
we can say console group and you can
start it up and we'll we'll use the
dog's name here dog name and when you're
done you say console group and and then
you pass the same string that you used
to define that group and now when you
open it up you've got Snickers and Hugo
these are the two groups that we've made
by passing it and you can close open and
close them if you feel like this is
still a little bit messy you can switch
out group with group collapsed and by
default they will be collapsed which is
really nice because you might not
necessarily need that information but if
you do you can crack open the Associated
one that you're looking for and see all
the info that is associated for that one
console that count will count however
many times you use a specific word or
number or object or domnode or anything
that you have so console account wes or
run that a couple times it's going to
tell me how many times i have run it but
if I were to take in Steve in the middle
and then do a couple more of those
another one down here and a couple more
so I'm all over the place here it's
going to just log them in real time
telling me how many we've iterated over
or telling me how many we've counted at
that time
finally we have timing if you want to
see how long something takes what you
can do is start a timer so console dot
time will say fetching data and then you
can do something that takes time
like fetch some data from github and
when you are done you simply run console
dot time end and then you pass it the
same string that you use to start it and
you can obviously console.log your data
at that time and then that will tell us
fetching data took 160 milliseconds so
I'm 104 milliseconds 57 60 to 75 etc so
you can see how long these things are
taking there is I know there also is
performance now in the browser but this
is a nice way just to get a quick idea
of how long your things are taking you
don't have to have variables or anything
like that you just start and stop them
finally there's one last one which is
console dot table but I've been showing
you that one in every single video so
far you probably know about it but you
can take an array of objects so an array
which is dogs of objects which is each
dog and assuming that they all have the
same properties like name and age it
will display them in a nice table for
you like that it gets a little bit hairy
when you have a few other but you can
always drag and drop the things
different parts that you want that's it
hopefully you learned a thing or two I
will see you tomorrow
