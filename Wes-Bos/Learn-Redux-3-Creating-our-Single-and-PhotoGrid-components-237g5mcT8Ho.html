this both the photo grid component which
is going to show all of the photos and
then when I click through one of them we
want to create this single component
which is going to show a single one and
we want to flip-flop between the two
depending on what URL we are on let's go
ahead and make a new file called single
dot J s and another one called photo
grid GS and inside of that I'm just
going to take the code from main j s and
paste it in just because it's pretty
much the same set up a lot of people
have nice little snippets that they can
use to create this they don't need the
link and I'm gonna delete all the HTML
inside of there we're gonna rename it
from main to single and we are going to
return a single - photo div with a class
name of single photo then go ahead and
go to photo grid and do the exact same
thing or and take single photo grid and
this is going to have a class name of a
photo - grid that just needs to line up
so that the CSS will kick in one last
thing let's just say like I'm the photo
grid inside of this one and inside of
the single let's just say I'm single why
because I want to make sure that when we
do routing in just a second I'd be able
to see single and photo grid now let's
talk about routing because we're always
going to be seeing this main yes that's
sort of like our parent component that
we have here but the child is going to
be either single or if I click on the
homepage it's going to be photo grid
right so the actual switching out of
this component is handled by react
router and normally what we would do is
we would say something like this this
thought props dot children and we will
put that in there and this some props
that children is going to be populated
by react router and that's going to
change into either photo grid or into
single now a little gotcha that we have
right here is that we're not able to
pass downn props that way normally if we
actually had like a single component we
would have like this dot props and that
would pass down all of the props but we
can't just do that when we use this top
props that children so what we're going
to do is use react duct clone element
pass it this thought process children
and you also want to pass this thought
props and what that's gonna do is gonna
take any props that are coming down from
these parent components right here and
pass them on along to either our photo
or our single grid so we're gonna go
ahead and give that a save now that's
not going to show us really anything
still looks like this but if we now
introduce react rotor we're going to be
able to check if we're on the home page
we see photo grid if we click on one of
them we're going to see single if you
take a look at what we've done you'll
see holy smokes we got this big red
cannot read property props of undefined
and that is totally okay the reason
we're actually seeing this is because we
have not yet passed it any children we
go to our reduction room right here and
we were to actually pass it some sort of
children so if I'm gonna make that like
a mean tag instead and if I just pass it
like hello a paragraph you'll see that
it will fix itself
and give it a refresh you'll see it
fixes itself but because we have not yet
passed it any children it's not going to
work and that's totally fine don't don't
panic if you see it we are going to now
put up the react router part of this
where react router is going to pass it
either photo grid or single I've said
that a couple times now and we should be
able to fix it with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
