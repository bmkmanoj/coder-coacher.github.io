our react code well it's going to be all
done in this client folder right here
specifically we're going to start off
with redux or MJS and we'll be creating
files from there on out all these other
files that are along here you can even
just open the client folder directly why
because all these files here are
development related and they have
nothing to do with the app at the end of
the day they're just tooling that helps
us get going and write good quality code
now we also have a Styles folder in here
which I have written all the styles for
this application in stylus if you are
not a fan of stylus you can also convert
this over to sass or CSS or if you would
like to use your curly brackets you can
go ahead and do that it's not really a
main focus for a class like this now
let's go ahead and start writing reacts
first thing we need to do when you write
a react application what do you need we
need react so we're going to go ahead
and import react from the react package
and anytime I'm doing import something
from something if you don't see a dot
dot forward slash or some sort of path
in front of it that means that it's
coming in from our node modules folder
and that's something that we npm in the
first video you can go ahead and look at
package jason and in that you're going
to see all of the different dependencies
that I've had you installed so when we
go ahead and import something there's no
need for you to go ahead and npm install
it yourself we've already done all the
dependencies there but if you are on
your own building an app from scratch
you would have to open up your terminal
and do an NPM install react - save dev
but in order to keep the numbers the
same as this video series I've done
everything along for you next up we need
to import just the render method from
the react dom package and what that will
allow us to do is actually render it out
to HTML react will also work for things
like canvas and native and whatnot so
they've taken the dom stuff and put it
in its own package there then we'll need
a little bit of CSS to import the CSS
now web pack is going to be handling all
of the CSS loading for us so there's no
need to actually have a link tag in or
HTML at all web pack will just
inside of the JavaScript embedded in a
style tag for us so we can say import
CSS from and then you give it a relative
path to Styles forward slash style style
and what that does is it's going to load
in this one which in turn will load in
our normalize or typography in our
animations file as well as all the CSS
that's needed for this application and
then finally when I'm working with an
app I just like to get something
rendered on the screen to make sure that
it's working so we'll say render and
render takes two things first of all
some JSX
i and second of all a mounting point or
like an element where it should dump
this application so say document dot get
element by ID and we say root now why do
we say root here because there is a div
with the ID of root in our index die
HTML right see this div with the ID of
root that is where it's going to be
dumped so we just pass a reference to
that actual element in this JSX will be
rendered there now make sure that you're
running your application if you
accidentally quitted it for whatever
reason you can start it again with NPM
start and it will give you the URL for
e1 and there we go you can see that web
pack notice that Oh someone's trying to
go to this localhost seven seven seven
zero and it went ahead and built it for
us now you see that high is in there I
can go ahead and change this to hello
give it a save refresh and I'll say
hello now in the future we're going to
look at hot reloading where if I were to
change a component and say hello to a yo
and save it it would immediately update
it you'll see that our everything is re
updating every time I save if I say this
again it rebuilds it rebuilds it
rebuilds it but in the future it's going
to e go even further and refresh the
entire page that we have there so with
that let's get building some more
components let's take a look back at our
application the finished version here
and see what are the different
components that we need now there's all
kinds of different components inside of
here
but what I'm concerned with is we've got
this one big component which is going to
be called main and inside of that that's
going to choose whether it should show
what I'm calling the photo grid which is
where you see all of them and then when
you click through to one this is going
to call the Singh
component and that component maybe made
up more of like the photo component in
the comments component now you can go
ahead and look at the react dev tools
here and you can take a look at what all
of our components are so we never mind
all these provider router router
contacts we'll be looking at all of
those but if you open it up look we've
got our main component here and if you
open that up you'll see that we have a
photo grid component as well as we've
got a header going on here now if I go
ahead and click through to one you'll
see that that photo grid gets replaced
with single go back that foot single
gets replaced with photo grid so we want
to make this main component here as well
as either the photo grid or the single
each of those components are going to
live in their own dot J's file and I'm
going to go one step further and make a
components directory now anytime I make
a component it will live in that
directory in its own file so I'm going
to make their components and I'm going
to move into that directory and then I'm
going to go ahead and make a file for
each of the three components we just
talked about so we need we said we
needed a main gas for the main one then
we needed a photo grid AAS and then we
also needed a single dot Jaz hit enter
now if I take a look of everything I
have that main photo grid and single you
can also go in your sublime here main
photo and single so let's start with
main jsn we're going to say Const main
equals react create class where we have
a render function and inside that that
is going to return a whole bunch of JSX
so inside of that we want a div inside
of that we want H 1 that says redux 2
gram and we want to wrap this redux a
gram in a link that I will actually
always bring you home so if I'm on this
one if I want to go back to home I want
to click that now we're using react
router in this application so we need to
import first of all we need to import
react itself because whenever use react
decorate class even though we imported
it in this one we need to import it in
every module that needs it and then also
import just link and now link is just a
component you can pull off of react
writer and we're going to use link
in here so it's a link and then we'll
put Redux or Grammys a link to forward
slash now that's not going to work just
yet because we haven't set up react
router but it's at least going to render
out an anchor link for us then final
thing we need to do is export default
main and you could also if you'd like
you could just put the export default
right in front of the Const so export
default consummate if that's a little
bit confusing to you we're going to
export default main right there and what
that will do is it's going to allow us
to go into our main application here
import that main GS and we should be
able to see this redux diagram main
component being rendered out so let's go
ahead and give that a shot so right
maybe below here we'll say import
components import main from this is
going to be a relative URL it lives
inside the components directory and we
want to go for main we don't have to put
the dot JSON there you can but it's not
necessary when using it now instead of
rendering out the paragraph tag we
render out main give that a save we'll
go back to our app here refresh you'll
notice that immediately Redux to Graham
is now showing up what's really cool
about this is if you were to change this
to west ducts to Graham and give it a
save you see that it will immediately be
updated I didn't refresh there change it
back to Redux to Graham save it will be
immediately refreshed as soon as and why
is that happening well our web pack is
hot reloading the components which means
that even if I were to make changes on
this page it would swap it out right on
the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
