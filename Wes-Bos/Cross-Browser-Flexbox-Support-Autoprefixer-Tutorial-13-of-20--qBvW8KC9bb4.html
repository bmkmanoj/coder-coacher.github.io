so before we do that we need to set up
what's called a build step and the
reason behind that is because flexbox is
actually been around for quite a while
however it's gone through three
different iterations of how flexbox
works and as these things came out and
crush core has got an awesome little
article here about it as they came out
browser ship so there's still quite a
few browsers out there that either
implement the old version of flexbox or
there are some devices that have vendor
prefix flexbox so if you try to like run
any of these demos just kind of straight
up in in any other browser other than
like most recent Chrome or Firefox
you're gonna run into a bunch of issues
so luckily for us we don't have to like
figure out what all of the different
things are we can just run our code
through a compile step so here's just
another silly example I was looking at
the Flex basis documentation on mdn for
a Flex basis and it says a brief history
it was originally flex basis Auto then
they changed it to main size then they
changed it back so like clearly when
they were kind of fleshing out flex box
there was a lot of confusion maybe a
little disagreement as to what was going
on but never fear we have this thing
called autoprefixer and you you may have
actually heard of it before and what
autoprefixer does is it just takes your
code and the idea that is that we write
our code with the latest and cleanest
flexbox spec so I just got some some of
the code we did here and one of the
other ones I'm gonna paste it in and
what it will do holy look at what
it does it takes your nice clean
flexball code and it will just prefix
all of the possible vendor prefixes as
well as the older display box so you got
display WebKit box
MS flexbox flex box Orient vertical
etc etc there's no way you could
possibly maintain this by hand it's not
like you're just doing like transition
and WebKit transition it's just way too
hard to be able to maintain at all so
the idea is that we're gonna have a
build step that looks at all of our
stuff omega center here at that back in
real quick so the idea is that we're
going to write the code here and it's
going to be built so we are going to be
using a gulp j/s now there's tons of
different ways that you can use
autoprefixer to compile your code you
may have heard of code kit or
preprocessor or any of these other apps
or even if you just paste your paste
your document your code into here and
have it kind of spit it out the other
end
whoever ideally would have something
that watches our CSS and every time we
save it it's going to recompile it into
this so if you're familiar with grunt or
gulp and you know what autoprefixer is
then feel free to just totally skip this
entire video move on to the next one but
if you're if you're new to gulp I'm
gonna show you kind of I'm just going to
cowboy it I'm gonna go ahead and install
it from scratch and show you sort of how
I get something set up like this I've
got an entire book and video series on
gulp coming out but this should get you
up and running for at least just
autoprefixer so first thing you need is
you need to have no js' installed if you
don't have node installed the way or if
you're not sure the way you can check is
just go to your terminal so on your
computer there is going to be a terminal
application or there will also there
will be one called that's called
powershell on the windows and you just
type node - V and if you get a number
back that means you have node installed
if you don't get anything back at all
that means you need to go it to node.js
org and click the Downloads and you can
just next next next it gives you a nice
little installer so when you have that
on open we're going to head over to the
command line here and just go into the
directory of where you have something so
I've just got some an index.html file
I'll show you in here index.html file is
just some HTML
that and then this is just a CSS that
we're going to be Auto prefixing so
that's it we need a couple more files to
get up and running the first one is
what's called a packaged adjacent file
in a package adjacent I won't go into it
too much but it essentially tracks your
dependencies it's going to track the
versions in which plugins we need
installed so to do that you type NPM in
it and hit enter and it's just going to
give you a whole bunch of different
questions here for our cases we're okay
to just keep hitting enter enter enter
until you're back at the command line
and you'll see that that created a
package that JSON file and then there's
there's just some information we'll be
looking at that in just a second next up
what we want to do is go ahead and
install gulp so you can type we need
some salt gulp twice actually you need
to install go up globally so the way you
do that is you type NPM install gulp -
JEE and that will install it globally on
your entire machine if you get issues
with that go ahead and put a sudo npm
install gulp - JEE in front of it
so sometimes people don't have the the
correct permissions to run install on
the global level so you have to type
sudo yeah I'll show you and hit enter
and it's gonna ask you for your password
you type in your password it won't show
you anything up here but I just type
mine and then you hit enter and it will
go ahead and install so I'm not going to
go ahead and Salk so I already have it
and the other thing that you need to do
now is we need to create a gulp file and
the gulp file is going to sort of hold
the the process for what we're doing so
I'm going to say touch go file J s and
that's just going to make a blank gulp
file for me there and then we actually
need to go ahead and install a couple
plugins that we need so we need a local
version of gulp and the way to install
is NPM install gulp and we want to say -
- save dev what that will do is it's
going to go off and install the gulp
thing for us but if you go back to your
package at Jason you should see that
gulp is added to your dependencies what
else do we need in there we actually
need gulp I'm sorry NPM
install gulp - auto prefix er - save
dev and you're gonna go ahead and stall
that as well
here we go it's in there cool I'm gonna
close that down then we head into a gulp
file and we this is how you ready to
golf I save our gulp equals require gulp
and that's gonna include the entire gulp
library and then we also need to include
all the plugins that we want in our case
we we only have autoprefixer but you
might have like SAS or or less or
whatever you're using here so we'll say
var Auto prefix R equals require gulp -
autoprefixer and then we are going to
make a task say gulp task and task takes
two things first is the name and cult
styles and the second thing is a
function to run so I'm just going to
pass it an anonymous function there next
thing we need to do is go ahead and
source our files so the way gulp works
is that you go and grab the contents of
your file we're gonna run it through our
plugins in this case is just run it
through autoprefixer and then we'll kick
it out the other end in another file
called know what like build forward
slash styles of CSS so we'll say gulp
SRC and I'm going to go into my CSS
directory in Styles dot CSS and and by
the way this can be any file if you have
a different set up you can always do
start out CSS or you could do star star
start CSS and that will grab all of them
it really depends on how your your your
setup but I'm gonna leave mine as
styles.css CSS styles and then I will
type pipe in the way that gulp works is
that you pipe the contents of the style
dot CSS into autoprefixer
and then once we've done that we can
type it into another one called gulp
test and I'll just pipe that into a
directory called build her output or
whatever you want so what that should do
we might have to play around the folders
here but what that should do is we
should be able to go back to our command
line now and run gulp and the name of
the task that we just created which is
styles and hit enter and oh I got an
error so let's let's see what we got
here
CSS syntax error missed semicolon oh
that's nice it's telling me that I
screwed up my CSS here so I'm gonna go
look where it's aligned content oh there
we go I tried to quickly add that in
later so then I go back I'm just gonna
rerun you can hit the up arrow to get
the most recently run tasks there and
let's see there we go
it ran it I should be able to open this
build directory and inside of that we
see styles of CSS and beautiful all of
my auto prefix styles have been added on
there so the way you would do it is
you'd go into your HTML and your link
would not go to CSS styles that CSS
because that's your unprefixed version
we actually want to go into build for it
sash styles and that should do it for us
last thing we want to do is add what's
called a watch task so I don't want to
have to manually rerun gulp styles every
time I want to rerun my compiler I want
it to do it automatically for me so you
head back to your gulp file and we'll
make another task called default and
actually can call it a watch there and
inside of that will pass it another one
but instead of doing like a gulp dot
source like we have been doing you can
do a gulp dot watch and pass it a list
of CSS files in this case it's just the
one that you wish to watch and then when
those change you can pass it a an array
of styles to run or sorry an array of
gulp tasks to run so in our case our
task name is style so we're going to say
just rerun styles whenever this file
changes so it's now I'm going to go back
here and instead of typing gulp Styles
and it's a
gulp watch and you'll notice that it
doesn't kick me back to the command line
why because it's watching it and I
should be able to go back to the CSS
file and every time I save see there you
go it will just save save save every
time I save it's going to rerun my
Styles task and going to update all of
the the code that I have so real quick
if I open up the build CSS open it up
there and I do something like change
this to like 450 immediately you see
it's changed there bring this one down
to 360 save you see it's compiled there
and then this one updates right away so
really nice kind of clean and fast way
to get our code to compile so that's
gulp autoprefixer definitely need that
in order to support all the different
browsers even the current browsers um
alright let's get into the code along
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
