talk about reordering when you hit a
certain breakpoint in the most kind of
common use case for something like this
is when you have your desktop view and
when you're going down to mobile or vice
versa and you want to reorder the items
that are on the page so rather than
taking them out of the Dom and spin the
backend we can use the flex box order to
get up and running so just a quick
little look as to what will be building
here just got a simple little website
here and let's take a look at the HTML
first so I've sort of broken it down
into sections which is generally how
your website is going to be and we're
just going to be reordering each of the
second so I just got a wrapper here
which is gonna serve as our Flex
container
I got a header which I've just sort of
put these backgrounds on each of them
this is the nav from the previous
exercise so all of that code is included
in this one but there's nothing really
that you have to worry too much about
this although we will I have added this
which is the little menu button and when
you click that on mobile it's gonna show
up and down we've got a hero which is
just like big photo so a lot of times
websites have these nice big photos here
when you load the page maybe it's a
banner for something you know we've got
a detail section which may have some
information about your product or your
website we've got a signup form and then
I've got a just a footer here so all of
those sections great and this is
essentially what it's going to do let me
just turn the style on the answer so
answer dot CSS refresh this so when I go
down and I've set this to go down at 500
pixels so you'll notice that this is
just normal this is how we had it before
but if I bring it on down to close to
500 you'll see what happens is whoa look
what happens here so first of all our
menu goes to the top because I'm more
likely than that you're gonna want
your menu to be able to open and close
something like that our header goes
below the menu then we bring this
details in the form box up so these two
above the hero and then we just let the
hero and the footer go at the bottom so
pretty standard little ordering it's
pretty straightforward I just going to
show you how to do it and there is one
little gotcha with this menu sure used
to using jQuery toggle because it's it's
specific to flexbox so let's go ahead
I'm just going to change this back to
style dot CSS and we'll head into our
style dot CSS what do we got here again
this is just really simple hTML is it's
probably it's not something you're going
to take and use on a website I've just
appended a bunch of styles to all of the
links but just for simplicity sake if we
scroll down scroll down pretty much
everything up until here is just styling
so all of that so far is just just
styling just make sure our demo doesn't
look totally terrible right here this is
you'll notice that this is for the
flexible nav that we built in the last
exercise so we're keeping that that's
going to work totally fine
then we got our this is for our flexible
map as well with the break point and
then here the 500 px that's where I want
everything to go on and sort of kick in
so underneath this what do we really
want to do so because all of these
sections here we've got a header a nav a
section a section a section and a footer
because we want to append an order
property to them you tell me what sort
of element does an order property go on
and it goes on a flex item right so in
order to have flex items like we can't
just go ahead and select the header and
say display flex item that's not a thing
in order to make something flex items we
actually need to go ahead and turn the
parent which in this case is the wrapper
which is why I always recommend even if
you're doing like a full bleed website
even if these
gives here we're just going left to
right you should always wrap your
website in some sort of wrapper div just
in case you run into a situation like
this so I'm gonna go ahead and say dot
wrapper display flex so that will turn
our wrapper into a flux container in our
immediate children into Flex items so
now I'm going to refresh you see nothing
changes because we got to hit that 500
pixel breakpoint so let's go ahead and
hit that and whoa what's happening here
is as soon as we hit that 500 px
breakpoint you'll notice that like
everything just kind of gets all jumbled
up here and I think this is one of the
frustrations with Flex boxes that you
just turn it on and then it just brings
your entire website and people go ah I
can't deal with this it's it's too much
work to get it up and running however
you'll know that by default the Flex
Direction is what the Flex Direction is
rose right we spent all these videos
looking at these columns of content in
which that they were lined out in a row
so we want to switch the main access in
the horizontal we want to swap them in
the way that we do that is we say flex
direction
column and give it that a refreshing
okay good so now it's column and all of
our things are laid out in column view
so good we're kind of back where we were
and next up what we want to do is start
applying ordering to each of these items
so the first thing I would want to do is
do it on our Flex nav so I go ahead and
select that it has a class of Flex nav
on there for and if we want that to be
first you might think like okay we'll do
order one and give it a save and refresh
and when we do that whoa
where does that go our now goes to the
bottom of the page and how come when you
say it is one it goes all the way to the
end so this is because by default the
order of all elements is what it's zero
it's a big fat zero so what we need to
do is put a default order on everything
else and this is kind of like z-index so
what I have been doing is I select every
flex item so that's just a quick little
selector of every immediate child of
rapper and they're gonna just put a
little comment here say flex item and
maybe we'll tell ourselves here Flex
container okay
and what we'll do with that is we have
put an order and if I want to be able to
say like 1 2 3 4 5 without having to
worry about everything being order 1 you
can do order and just put like a put a
high number on there like 9999 and give
it a refresh and now you'll notice that
so everything is set to a really low
number and because they're all the same
they're still gonna when the Flex order
is exactly the same for all of them like
if 2 flex items have the same order what
will happen is the order that they show
up in the Dom or in the HTML will take
precedence so now our order 1 is working
great but again when you get to mobile
you don't want your nav to be open by
default so we'll take a quick look here
I've got this link with a class of
toggled nav and then we've got this ul
that holds all of our links so we want
to go ahead and say dot toggle nav
display:block and that should there we
go and it makes this nice little toggle
nav one for us and we want to hide the
other one so that's flex nav ul
display:none great so while we're there
if I go ahead and click this you'll
notice that it's not working and the
reason behind that is if we open up our
dev tools here and go to elements and
just open this up so that we can see
this navigation here and go ahead and
click it and you'll notice that there's
a class of open being toggled on and off
on and off now why did I do that if we
look at the jQuery just at the bottom
here and say when the link with the
class at all
is clicked then grab the Flex nav 100
list and toggle the class of open so you
may be saying like why don't you just do
something like slide toggle which is
kind of cool because you get the
animation along with it so give that a
save and refresh and cool it works but
the main thing here is like remember are
these guys right here we're stacked four
in a row and now that they are just one
two three four stack like that and the
reason behind that is because for these
ones to stack side-by-side and
especially like if we're talking about
this one right here as well where they
stack one two one two one two and then
four beside each other for that to
actually work on our mobile when we open
it on up we actually need this UL to be
display flex not display block in when
you use jQuery toggle or slide toggle or
something like that it just changes it
from display:none to display flex so
unfortunately we can't use slide toggle
we need to toggle out our own class of
open and then go back here and when it
has a class of open you can go down into
here we'll say dot flex now if you will
open normally you'd say display block
but in our case we're saying display
flex I give that a save and it works
great so it just it just pops open and
close there's no animation there if you
wanted to you could you could pop some
CSS height animations on there which
would allow us to slide it open and
close open and closing it I think that's
sort of the better way to do it as well
we're slowly moving away of moving our
animations out of things like jQuery and
back into CSS so that's that's it for
our now if we've got that all up in
running up next we need to reorder some
of our items so we thought about this
this is one we have this one as two so
let's go ahead and do that so it's just
dot top why because if you look at it
we've got a header with the class of top
so just top is enough for a selector we
say not flex order to be able to save
and that's not going to do anything but
just because we're going to be changing
the ones after it we have to explicitly
set it to - next up we want this details
here so this is a section with the class
of details and section with classes sign
up we want those to be three and four so
I can go ahead and say dot details order
three and I'll just go ahead and say it
out sign up order for now I'll give that
a save and a refresh and perfect looks
like we've got everything in order and I
was still working we've got our header
got our details we got our content and
then we don't have to worry about
setting these to be five and six how
come because since they already set to
999 they are just going to be appended
at the bottom in the order that they
show up
so since hero comes first and footer
comes next
they are going to show up that's
actually kind of a neat thing to show as
well like this is the order just put
your cursor over top of your elements
and watch it jump around from top to
bottom so that's mobile reordering
pretty handy pretty simple I think just
make sure that you have your wrapper as
they display flex and then you can go
ahead and use the Flex ordering property
in order to move them around see you in
