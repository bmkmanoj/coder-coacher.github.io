Navin I actually think that building
navigations is one of the most common
and probably best use cases for actually
using flexbox so this is essentially
what we were going to be building here
it's just a standard navigation so I've
got a nav tag inside of that of an
unordered list and then a whole bunch of
list items they're really only different
thing being that these social icons are
gonna have a class of social on them so
that we can make them a little bit
smaller so that's how it's going to look
on desktop and when we go down to a bit
of a smaller screen I'm gonna make each
one of them 50% wide but these social
ones 25% wide and then finally when we
get down to about 500 pixels we're gonna
stack these ones while leaving these
ones to be 25% wide know the kind of
beauty of a flex nav is that you don't
need to go ahead and figure out the
proportions a lot of times if you're
doing this with floats you'd have to
figure out okay there's six items plus
four small ones plus however much
padding or margin that you need to use
and we'll figure it all out from there
you don't have to do any math here and
if you were to add one so if I were to
add like a new item to the list and
refresh you'll see that the new item
just slots itself perfectly in amongst
the other ones we didn't have to do any
resizing of whit's or do any sort of
math similarly if I go ahead and take
out maybe let's see two of these items
and give it a refresh it's extremely
flexible you get the point right you can
just throw a whole bunch of elements at
it tell them how much of the extra space
they should eat up in this case it's a
lot more than these ones and it'll all
just figure it on out you never have to
worry about adding up to 100% wide so
I'm going to bring that back to item
three and I'm gonna go and swap this out
just wild start that's all I'm going to
be work
from and let's just take a quick look at
the sort of the starting CSS that we've
got here I've just got my HTML set up my
border box I've got some basic styling
here again this stuff doesn't have
anything to do with flexbox it's just so
that the demo looks nice wrapper that
has nothing to do I just kind of
constrained the width of this navigation
so there's a wrapper around this and
then finally here's where we're actually
going to get started we got the Flex nav
which is this nav thing here and then
we've got a ul and Li so what is going
to be the Flex container it's not the
Flex a navigable that actually is the
Flex container and then the lis are
going to be the Flex items in our case
so we've gone ahead and selected that in
the way we well let's first see where
we're at actually this is kind of the
default um they all just stack
vertically right on top of each other we
can go ahead and say display flex and
give that a save and you'll see that the
items go from stacked on top of each
other to display flex which is they just
take up the exact amount of room that
they need it was a little bit of padding
on them but other than that that's as
much space so we've got all this extra
space on the right-hand side here what
are we going to do with it how are we
going to work with it so let's actually
just go ahead and select each individual
flex item so I'm gonna say flex nav Li
because the Allies are the Flex items
and we will say let's just try flex one
in from previous video we learned if you
set something to flex one what does it
do it sets the Flex grow which is how is
this extra space allotted between all of
the items as well as the flesh flex
shrink when you don't have enough space
for all the items how do you mix it or
how do you divide it on up so set the
Flex one refresh and what do we got here
looks like all of them have the exact
same space so that doesn't work
extremely well because these social
icons right here they don't really need
that much space and these items here
they probably do need that amount of
space because
they are a little bit longer in the text
that they have so what we want to do is
select the individual ones which where
you say flex Nev dot social and the
reason I'm doing that if we look at the
index.html we've got these list items
with the classic social on it and we're
going to make those ones a little bit
different than the other one so there
I'm actually going to set these ones to
flex one and I'm going to go up to this
regular one and set them to flex three
the reason I'm going to do that because
I want the regular flex I want these
item flex items to take three times the
amount of the extra space as the social
ones because really they don't need any
of the extra space so I'm going to say
that you take three times the amount of
the social it's worth noting that this
flex three is applying to all of them
and then this thought social is going to
overwrite it for these four social icons
so give that a refresh and you'll see
that right away we've got these ones
being a little bit smaller and then
these ones off to races so that's that's
it that's one to three lines of CSS to
get yourself a really nice flex box nav
it's a hell of a lot easier than using
something like floats and using your
percentages to figure out how much space
you they should take up now we want to
talk about mobile
we want it to we kind of have two stages
here as soon as we hit a thousand pixels
I want them to stack one or two in a row
and then I want to put these four all
along the bottom so what we need to go
ahead first to do is if we want them to
you see if we go really really small
here they're just gonna run into each
other so what do we actually need for
that to work is wrapping we need to turn
on wrapping you might think oh we need
to change it from row two column and
that's a pretty good hypothesis we could
go ahead and say flex and I have ul flex
Direction column and give it a refresh
when we hit that thousand pixel
breakpoint let's see what goes on here
I'll see they just stack vertically and
in many situations that would actually
be totally acceptable but the problem is
that we don't want them to go
just stacked just yet or maybe not at
all we want one two three four five six
and then when we get down to these
social icons we want four of them to be
so we actually need to keep it in row
which is the default so we're not going
to put that there what we actually want
to turn on is the Flex wrap so we'll say
flex wrap wrap and refresh now we'll hit
that thousand pixel breakpoint and
nothing's happening how come they aren't
wrapping and for something to be able to
wrap we actually need to give it some
sort of width and the way that we are
going to do that is with the Flex basis
property so we'll go ahead and select
each of our items we'll say
flex - nav Li and I'm just going to do
them all right now and then we'll go and
fix the the social ones in a second
so we'll say flex nav and flex we're
going to use this shorthand property
because we want them to grow at one we
want it to take evenly take the extra
space we want it to shrink at one we
want them to divvy up or we want to
chisel off the extra space evenly and
then we want to set it to 50% because we
want them to be 50% widened right next
to each other so go ahead and give that
a save refresh let's hit that thousand
pixel breakpoint and perfect look what
we got going on here one two three four
five six and then what's going on here
this is kind of pretty classic of
flexbox is that when something goes
wrong when you have like conflicting
properties it all just kind of pukes it
up onto the screen but the reason that
is there is because we still have this
social one probably overriding and the
way that we can sort of debug that is if
you open up your dev tools and it's just
inspect one of them and bring this down
to the bottom here and I'm just gonna
click on one of the social ones you'll
see that this is our Flex property that
we just wrote inside of the media query
one one 50% however this flex one is
overriding it and that means that there
is no flex basis actually being applied
so we need to specify a Flex basis on
that one
so I'll just say flex NAB Li or just
even just dot social will it be enough
you never want to over qualify your
selectors too much of those you're gonna
run into issues down the road I will say
flex one-one and 25% what that will give
us now is a nicely spaced out different
icon so that can kind of go on down the
last thing we want to do is once we hit
the let's say 500 pixel breakpoint and I
know this can be any breakpoint that you
want but we just want to then change
this flex basis one more time and to be
able to to stack just one by one by one
so we say dot flex nav Li inside of
there and I don't have to say flex one
one a hundred percent again just because
like we've done that already we can just
say flex basis right all together and
say a hundred percent and that's just
going to override this part and the Flex
grow and the Flex shrink of the previous
one is going to stick around so give
that a save refresh now go down down to
two and then we hit that five hundred
pixel breakpoint and they'll stack these
ones are small enough that they can say
they can stay for to a row as long as we
want so that's a very simple flex box
nav I'm definitely really nice and easy
in the next video what we're going to do
is we're going to be looking at how do
you write a little toggle nav that will
toggle that up and down as well as how
do we order different elements on a page
differently when they're on mobile
versus something like that stop I'll see
you in that video thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
