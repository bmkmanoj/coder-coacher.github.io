tough one and I really want you to give
it a shot on your own let me explain
what it does and I'll give you a shot to
go and do it on your own the end code is
not actually all that complicated I
found that it was a little bit tough for
me to come around to this idea at first
though so here's how it works you click
a checkbox you hold down your Shift key
you click another one and all the
checkboxes in between the first one and
the second one that you clicked will
then be checked this works top to bottom
but also bottom to top so if I click on
this one hold down shift click on here
it's gonna go bottom to top so it goes
all ways depending on what you're
working on you can go either way and
this is a fairly common thing that
you're going to see in applications such
as Gmail where you want to select a
whole bunch of emails and delete them at
once let's take a quick look at it at
our HTML here we've got our input with
the type of check box and a paragraph
tag probably a label would be more
suited for something like that but
whatever we're working with it then
we've got a script tag here and by the
way if you're wondering why I always end
up my script tags so far to the left is
just because I need the horizontal space
if it bugs you I'm sorry but I need to
make sure my code fits on the screen now
give it a shot yourself and I'll see you
back here hopefully triumphant maybe not
and we'll go through together so here we
go well first thing we need to do is
select every single one of the check
boxes because we need to listen for when
they get checked so we'll say Const
check boxes equals document query
selector all and we want to grab Inbox
and we're gonna grab the inputs that
have a type of check box and probably
public input on there as well good let's
just double check that we've got all
those check boxes queries so wet dog you
have to spell it right query selector
all we go input input input okay good
I've got all the inputs that I'm working
with here now
we need to listen for one one of them
gets clicked or changed so we will take
the checkboxes and we will loop over
each one checkbox and on that we are
going to take the check box and add
event listener we are going to listen
for a click I initially thought that you
could had to listen for the change event
but apparently the click event will fire
even if you use your keyboard which is
really handy to know we've got our Out
event listener and when someone clicks
it we are going to run a function called
handle check now let's go up here and
make that function that will have a svet
and what just console.log the event
click all right click click click we're
getting the information for every single
one now this is where the hard part
starts to happen where we need to log
when I check my first one we need to put
that into a variable because when we
check your second one or and you're
holding down shift we need to know what
that last one was so we're going to make
a variable up here called let last
checked and the reason why I'm using let
is because that's going to be reassigned
constantly and then inside of here sort
of the last thing that we're going to do
is we'll say last checked equals this
that's like the last thing we're going
to do but well we'll put it on there so
now when I click one and we type in last
checked we have reference to the input
that was last checked now up here first
a couple things we need to do we need to
check if they had the shift key down so
say if e dot shift key and if the event
or shift key is there that means they
were holding it down and then we'll go
ahead and write our code however the
other thing we need to do is when I
uncheck it will also trigger and I'll
check so we need to make sure that check
if they had a shift key down and check
that
are checking it so not unchecking it
right because you don't care if they're
unchecking it you want to check if they
are uncheck okay let's stop saying the
word checked let's got it and this
thought checked I just said we would
stop saying it so if the shift key is
down and they are checking the box then
we can go ahead and do we please and
inside of here now this is where our
sausage gets made what we are going to
do here is we are going to loop through
every single check box every time this
happens we're going to loop over every
single check box and what we're gonna do
is we're going to look for the first one
that was checked and then I checked down
here what's gonna happen is we're gonna
say oh you're not you're not the first
one oh you are the first one okay good
then go to the next one check it next
one check it next one check it this one
oh you're the last one that's checked
stop it and then these two will won't be
checked so rather than try and figure
out where in the Dom they are and trying
to figure out like which elements are in
between it and fault-finding parents and
i find that's really really fragile a
way to do it because you're depending on
having the HTML set just so and then if
someone else comes along and changes the
HTML a little bit it will just break so
we are going to loop over every single
checkbox we're gonna create a variable
called in between and what in between
will do is will loop over this one I'll
stay in between false will loop over
this one in between falls I'll loop over
this one it's gonna say okay this is
where we started we are now in the area
which we wish to check so let's check it
check it check it check it because the
in-between variable is going to be set
to true when we're here and then when we
hit our last one we're going to say in
between is false because we're done and
we're no longer going to check any
others so this will probably take a
couple read
but let's get it so we will go up here
before we do the if statement will say
let in between equals capital B on that
in between false so we're not in between
and then here we are going to loop over
every single check box so say check
boxes for each check box and let's just
console.log check box see where we're at
so if I click one nothing because and
now I'm gonna hold down my shift key and
click another one okay so when that
happened I get every single check box
along the way now we need to figure out
as we are looping for this we got to set
this in between variable to true and the
way that we're going to do that is we
say if check box is equal to this or
check box is equal to last checked then
in between is we normally would say in
between is equal to true but since we
wanted to go both ways we set in between
two the opposite of itself
what okay let's go through this one sec
if the check box is equal to this so
here we go check it and let me do it
backwards this way so if we can
understand it so I check this one I hold
down shift and I click on check one item
and what's going to happen is we're
gonna go through this one it's gonna say
is that in between no it's gonna go
through this one and say is the check
box equal to this and what is this this
is going to be the one that got checked
and that's the check box this one is
going to be equal to the same one that
we are currently looping over so that's
going to be true so we're gonna we're
going to turn on that in-between
variable and then the other way around
it is if we go this way last checked and
then we go down to good luck and click
it again it's going to still go from top
to
but it's going to say if the check box
is the last checked one mean that this
is the currently checked one but check
one item is the last check one so I feel
like I'm saying checked a lot but we got
this we got this
so in between so looka console.log
starting to check them in between check
their check their and what happens is
here we go one we get to this one and
says okay good now we're starting
starting to check them between and down
down down down and then down and then
once we hit this one that's the last one
that we checked so it comes will logs it
again that means we're finished which is
why we do this opposite thing so if it's
true it's it's false if it's false it's
true and then we hit these last two
which aren't going to be so we can say
down here we have another if statement
this if in between capital B then
checkbox not checked equals true uh-huh
check it hold down shift check another
one BAM
nailed it okay let's see what's going on
there we set a flag variable called in
between that is set to false once we hit
that first one it's going to be true
which is going to check if it's on and
then we're going to programmatically set
it to checked with JavaScript and we're
gonna do that for every single one until
we hit that last one which our flag
variable called in-between gets set to
false and it will no longer run it for
these first two or for these last two
and that works both ways from bottom to
top because we did this little ditty
right here where we checked if it's
equal to this which is the one we
clicked or if it's the one that we last
checked so that's it it's actually
fairly simple now that we have it it's
not a lot of code it's just a little bit
hard to understand what's going on so
maybe go through that a couple more
times code it yourself from scratch so
you totally understand
other than that I hope you enjoyed it
let me know what you think of that one
see you tomorrow
