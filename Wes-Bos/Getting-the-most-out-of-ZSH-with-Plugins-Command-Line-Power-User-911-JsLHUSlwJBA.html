plugins which are probably my favorite
part of the st. and in my opinion they
aren't used often enough from regular
developers so plugins extend the
functionality and the features of zetas
sage and just as if you were to have
plugins for your vim or sublime text or
whatever you're using someone had found
a plug-in extremely helpful to their
workflow so they wrote it and then
they're sharing it so you can extend the
functionality of your terminal here so
I'm just on the Oh my Zetas sage github
here I click on wiki and there's a song
called the plugins overview which is a
really nice listing of all the possible
plugins here so let's just take a look
we've got no plugins we've got
filesystem jumping around
we've got productivity ones once for
Python one for Mac OSX all kinds of
really handy stuff so let's first take a
look at how to enable a plug-in and then
we'll take a look at some of the more
popular ones so let's jump back to our
command line and the way we enable
plugins is via our settings file we've
done this before so just open up your
zetas HRC file again if you have sublime
text installed you can type subol home
directory forward slash dot z s h and
now that we know about tab completion
you really don't need to type that much
more you can just hit tab it'll give you
a couple options here there's a data
stage update file a history and as SH
our C file is what we want so so to say
char C is what we're looking for
I'm just gonna open that on up here's
our old theme that we already set
however if you scroll down until you
find plugins you can see here is just a
space separated list of possible plugins
that you may be wanting so the first one
we're going to take a look at is the
extraction plugin let's take a look for
it here here we go
extract
it's a swiss knife for archive
extracting so a lot of times you get
that zip or tar.gz or all these
different kinds of compressed files in
order to open them from the command line
it's actually pretty tough because you
have to memorize all these crazy
commands so what we can do is just
enable the extract plug-in so I'm going
to go to my sublime text here I'm going
to put it on the end here give it a save
now if i just type extract now so zetta
sage command not found extract well how
come that's because remember when we
make a change to the Zetas HRC file it's
not reflected until we do source so
we're gonna do source
that'ss HRC it's going to start
everything over for us and I move into
the command line folder that we have and
there we go so I've got here I've got
this WordPress plug-in that I was using
the other day it's a dot zip and I want
to be able to unzip it without actually
having to open it up in my finder so
what we could do there is just type
extract and if I just hit enter there it
says here's my options
so extract you have the option option to
remove the archives which when you unzip
it up delete the file as well as the
file so just type extract and now oh
shoot I forget what it was called I know
it started with a W or maybe I didn't if
I just hit extract in tab now I'm able
to tab through all of my files and
folders in this case there it is or
press multi and big can make master hit
enter ll you can see right here there's
that entire folder as well as the
original zip file another one I really
really like is the cloud app extension
so if you haven't used so for cloud app
is really just a short URL thing you can
you can shorten URLs or you can I use it
quite a bit to upload screenshots that
I'm sharing with people on Twitter or
clients or something like that so cloud
app is really really cool however if I
have like this index.html file that I
want
I get to someone my process before was I
would type open and dot dot refers to
the current directory open will open up
my finder and here we'd get this command
line folder and what I would do is I
would drag this folder or this file into
my cloud app and it would upload it
however now I can do it without actually
leaving the command line at all so I
have enabled let's take a quick look
I've enabled the cloud app gym here or
sorry the cloud app plugin there's a
cloud app file you need to use with
username and password it's in the docs
but I just have to type cloud app and I
can hit tab to get all of my files
index.html is what I wanted hit enter
give it a sec and it's going to upload
it to close out thought out for me there
we go
it's uploaded there again we can use our
little trick if I hold down command and
click it opens it up right in my browser
and you can see this is the HTML of that
really really handy a handful of other
plugins are actually just ability to
give you autocomplete and sort of
suggestions as to what you should be
doing in the case of of git or NPM or
power or something like that so let's
take a look at some of those that just
give you the the possible options so I'm
just going to clear all this out of here
and in a previous video I showed you
command K which would clear it out
entirely however sometimes people like
to maintain this history but they just
don't want to see it because it's
visually cluttered so rather than
hitting command K which would just clear
it all and you'd lose it forever if you
hit command R what that does is it
clears your screen shows you the same
thing but if you scroll up notice that
it's all still there so if you need to
scroll back to it not a problem
so again command K will get rid of it
for good command R we'll just kind of
take it off the screen for you and and
put your cursor up there so let's take a
quick look at what else I have here I'm
a big note I'm a big NPM user
i'ma get user the problem is that
there's all these options for NPM and
there's all these options for it that I
forget what they're all called there's
get ad and get push and stuff like that
but sometimes there's parts of get that
I forget how it's spelled or I forget
what the name of it is and all I have to
do there is hit it tab or sorry get
space tab and it says oh do you want to
see all hundred twenty-eight lines in
this case yes there's so many options
oops there we go and you're able to see
all of the possible ones that you want
it so for example cherry-pick apply
changes introduced by some existing
commits so you don't use cherry-pick
maybe not that often and you forgot what
it's called maybe you didn't know if
there's a dash in it or not you able to
get a quick look at what all the
available options are here and when you
find one like git diff you just hit
enter and it will put it in there for
you without you having to write it out
same goes for NPM you hit tab and what
it does here is it gives you all the
possible ones you can use your arrow
keys to go over up down and and find all
the possible ones like NPM login it's
probably not something you use that
often or NPM unpublish so it's nice to
be able to view them all at a quick
glance without having to leave your
editor at all so those are get puller
sorry those are Zen SH plugins there's
all kinds of cool ones and since the
last time I checked even just a couple
months ago there's all kinds of really
nice ones
I think there's ones for controlling
your volume controlling your iTunes
colorizing your cat colorizing your man
page that's really nice so take a look
at this try a few out and let me know
what some of your favorites are
