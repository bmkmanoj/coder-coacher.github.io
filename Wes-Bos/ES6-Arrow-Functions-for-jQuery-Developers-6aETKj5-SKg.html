es6 arrow function actually works
there's a lot of people out there a
little bit confused as to what it is why
you'd never use it and what problems it
solves so what I wanted to do is show
just a little bit of code some jQuery
although this works with anything but if
you've run into this issue and jQuery
chances are you'll understand exactly
what it is and how we can solve it using
an es6 arrow function so let's get on
into it what I have here is I've gotten
a button with a class of CTA and I've
got a click handler which listens for a
click and when someone clicks it it
toggles the class of on so right here
I'm just clicking on and off on and off
I've just got some CSS it changes it
from red to green pretty simple and that
works great so what does this refer to
inside of here well you can see I'm
console logging here this refers to the
actual element that was clicked it's you
can say that it's bound to that element
now that's great but what if you wanted
to do the toggling of class after like a
second maybe you wanted to wait for a
second and how do you wait for a second
we use a set timeout which will take a
function and we will run that function
after let's do one second and I'm going
to take the this tall little class and
put it on inside of my timeout
so and I'm also going to move that
console.log inside as well so give that
a save and refresh click it wait a
second and then look at the console and
what does it show us it shows us window
which what the heck is going on so to
sort of illustrate what's going on here
I'll say inside is equal to this and
then we'll put one on outside just to
compare it's the same word it's the same
variable give it a save you'll notice
that it's actually not the same word
same variable outside is equal to the
actual button that's this one right here
inside it's equal to window so the
reason behind that is when you enter
into a new function the scoping of the
keyword this changes its bound to the
actual function that it was inside so
that's kind of a bit of a pain for us so
how we actually solve that if I go ahead
and learn just call month out these
console logs is rather
and using all we still want to use a
function here but we don't want the
keyword of this to change so what
sometimes people will do is say czar
that equals this and then you go down
here and change your this to that and
then it will just magically start
working for you why because we save the
scoping of this outside of the function
and then carried it on in now that's
obviously not ideal because then we have
to make sure that we do that ahead of
time so what we can do is instead of
using the word function we can pass it
that just a to prep parenthesis and if
you had like something you want like an
event or something you wanted to pass in
there you could put it in there and then
a fat arrow which is an equal sign in an
closing angle bracket and what that will
do is it will still run a function this
is still the same thing as saying
function except what it does is it
doesn't change the binding of the
keyword this it doesn't change what this
is equal to so we're not entering into a
new scope for the keywords of this we
still are still new scope that's another
video altogether but the keyword this
will still equal to it so if I change
this back to this save it go ahead and
refresh now I click it wait a second and
it actually works even though I didn't
have to change what this referred to so
that's the problem everyone's running to
that's sort of a really simple example
as to why you might want to use es6
arrow functions and hopefully that makes
sense thanks a lot and let me know if
you have any questions suck you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
