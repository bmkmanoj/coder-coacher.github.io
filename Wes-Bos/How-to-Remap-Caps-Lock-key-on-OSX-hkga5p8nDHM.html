shortcut junky like I am you'll probably
find yourself running out of useful
keyboard shortcuts pretty quickly some
of the applications start to map to the
same things and when you hit your
keyboard shortcut sometimes it doesn't
do exactly what you're looking for one
thing we can do is actually make use of
the caps lock key on your keyboard the
caps lock key is obviously for making
text caps but we can remap it to
something that's a lot more useful so
things you may want to remap it to is
I'm a big user of Divi Divi as a window
manager so if I hit my caps lock key it
opens up my window manager and I'm able
to go ahead and just resize my windows
however I want
so that's what I've mapped my caps lock
key to but you may also be a big user of
Alfred it's the the window manager or
sorry the application manager where you
can launch your applications right from
there 1 I have mine map 2 option space
but you may want to map it right to your
caps lock key so whenever you hit the
caps lock key it pops up and your Alfred
so what you use it for is totally up to
you I'm going to show you how you can
set it up to remap it so first thing we
need to do is disable the caps lock key
so make sure it is in the off position
so the little light is not on and go to
your system preferences and we want to
click keyboard and in the bottom here it
says modifier key so go ahead and click
modify our keys and you will see we got
control option command caps lock key
should be mapped by default of amount to
caps lock change it to no action and
then if you have an external keyboard
you're using a laptop make sure that you
also check the other keyboard here and
select no action click OK what we've
just done there is we've disabled the
caps lock key now we actually need to go
ahead and remap it there's a great
little utility called seal it used to be
called PC keyboard hack if you've heard
a bit before
this is a tiny little utility it's
actually part of a larger application I
believe is called like remap keyboard it
this is just four caps lock and some
international keys it works great for
this utility so go ahead and download it
once you've downloaded you go ahead and
open it and you'll see that it has a
listing of a couple of your keys here as
well as some of your international keys
we just need this one right here make
sure you have change caps lock checked
and by default it's going to map it to
the 51 key so these are key codes kind
of an aside if you go to key code info
it's a little website that I made every
key that you type like if I type space
it's 32 they each have a key code
associated with with their number so
what we want to do is open up seal and
find a key code that is not being used
so you can't just map it to something
like control or delete because you need
your delete key right so we need to use
it on a key that's not being used so
some popular ones are forward delete
which is 117 unless you most Mac
keyboards don't have that key so you
could go ahead and use it or thanks to
kenan on twitter i asked what people are
using he said 80 so i figured out what
ad was and it was the f 19 key so unless
you have some insane long keyboard you
probably aren't going to be using your f
19 key which i think is even better than
the forward delete key so set it to 80
just double click this right here type
in 80 and then close that down now
whenever you hit your caps lock key it's
going to send to the system that you are
running the F 19 key so now you need to
go ahead and go into your whatever
application you're using and if for me
it's Divi so I'm going to go to the Divi
preferences most applications will have
this will have a little recorder for
what key you want so you just have to
click your record obviously you can do
things like option space or whatever it
is but I'm going to mount mine to the F
19 key so back to preferences here click
to record I'm gonna hit the caps lock
key and you see that F 19 shows up so
that's good close it now I never hit my
hit my caps lock key it pops open my
window manager here and I'm able to go
ahead and resize my window so go ahead
and do that it's a powerful little trick
that you can do to increase your
productivity without having to reach for
the mouse every time I hope you enjoy
them and let me know if you have any
questions sex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
