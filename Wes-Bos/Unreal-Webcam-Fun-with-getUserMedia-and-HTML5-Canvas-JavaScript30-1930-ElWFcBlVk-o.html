West boss here we are going to make a
photo booth with JavaScript today now
first of all if you see like I'm talking
and then later on the audio doesn't add
up
that's because I'm recording my screen
on a 4k monitor and piping video through
and it's just too much so when I stop
recording my screen this is live don't
worry if you wonder if the sound is off
or not so what are we gonna be building
today we've got this first of all we've
got our video being piped in from our
webcam and then we've got our video
being piped into a canvas element and
then once it's in a canvas element we
can start to do all kinds of cool things
with it like we're going to take our
photo and then you can go ahead and
download them and they'll download to
your computer and you can see them as
real photos handsome dot PNG and then in
these scripts once we have it we can
start to add effects like of different
filters where things should be red or
what we can do is make this really cool
RGB split where you can see like you see
my face don't look at the top right hand
corner I look crazy but the RGB values
are just a little bit off you can play
with the Alpha so it's just a bit of
like a woo ghosting effect that goes on
here and then finally the green screen
if you've never known how to
green-screen works essentially you pick
a color that's in the background and
then you find any color that's like
within the range of that specific color
use the green and then you pull it out
and whatever is behind it like a video
or a beach or something like that it's
going to show so we have these slider
values here which we can use to discover
what the threshold isn't in my case I'm
just pulling out the just a whole bunch
of stuff but you can do some fun stuff
and whatever would be behind that would
then show on through so this is gonna be
a bit of a big one but it's gonna be fun
so let's let's get rolling open up my
index.html and switch the scripts
finished
scrips Jas and go into our scripts Jas
before we get started today there is one
thing that we do need to get up and
running and that is a server so far in
this course we've just been working off
of the file we right-click and open that
sucker in the browser however because of
security restrictions with getting a
users webcam it must be tied to what's
called a secure origin and a secure
origin is a website that is HTTPS or in
our case localhost is also a secure
origin even if it's not has a little
icon lock there it's still considered a
secure origin which is localhost so what
I need you to do if you take a look at
is we have this index.html that needs to
be fed through some sort of server so if
you've already got some sort of Python
server or maybe map if you don't
WordPress or any sort of local server
running you can totally use that just
make sure that you feed this index.html
through your localhost server now if you
don't have any sort of server locally
what I've done is I've included a
package.json file and if we open that up
you'll see that I have one dependency
which is this thing called browser sync
and it's really really nice because it
allows you to open up your website and
start a little server and it also gives
you live reloading and a whole bunch of
other stuff so what do I need to do is
type NPM install and if you don't have n
PM if it tells you that's not something
you go to node.js org and download
nodejs so I'm gonna type NPM install and
when that has finished what you can type
is NPM start and what that is going to
do it's going to run this script that I
have here and this is just a really long
browser sync start to files it starts a
little server for you so NPM start and
that is going to kick open a little
server it's going to tell you that your
local server is 3001 and then it will
also give you an external server in case
you want to check it on your Wi-Fi maybe
check it on your Android phone something
like that so I've got that up and
running now let's go to our scripts j/s
and I'm going to load in a couple
selectors that we're working with here
just because you're probably sick of
seeing me type selectors for now let's
review real quick we've got this video
here which is a class of player and if
we
look at our HTML you'll see that we have
a canvas we have a video and we have a
strip now the video from our webcam is
going to come in hot off the webcam and
we're gonna pipe that into this video
element and then every I don't know 16
milliseconds or so we're going to take a
snapshot of that video and dump it into
this canvas once it's in the canvas
we're going to manipulate the pixels
change the color apply filters we're
gonna have a lot of fun with that but
just know that the video is going to
come off the webcam on the video element
and we're gonna dump it into the canvas
every so often and then finally the
strip that's we're just we're gonna put
all of our images so that's what that
video canvas context is where the work
happens if you've never used canvas
before go back to our canvas tutorial
that we've done earlier we've got our
strip and then we have this audio which
is a little sound that's gonna play
every single time that we play a video
here good first thing I'm going to do is
get the video being piped into that
video element so we're gonna say
function get video and the way that you
get someone's video it's actually
navigator dot media devices that get
user media and if you've done this
before you might have seen it as
navigator dot getusermedia it's now
changed to navigator dot media devices
and some of the newer browsers which is
getusermedia from that we pass it the
video which we want to be true in the
audio which is going to be false now
that thing is going to return a promise
and we can you know that from with a
promise we can all talk then on it it's
going to give us something called a
local media stream and from there we'll
run a function let's just console.log
that local media stream see what we've
got here so when you load it you'll
probably get a little pop up here saying
local host would like to access your
camera go ahead and click yes to that
and of course we need to run this get
video function on page load and you'll
notice it's refreshing automatically for
you which is a really nice feature so
here's what we've got here we've got
this media stream and then we've just
got some ID active true
and there's some stuff on the on the
prototype that we've we've working we're
working with here but really not much
for us to deal with so what we need to
do is to take our video and we need to
set the source to be that local media
stream now that's not going to work
automatically because this is an object
and in order for our video to work it
actually needs to be converted into some
sort of URL this is a little bit weird
because you might be used to having a
video like a dot mp4 but this is how you
set it to be a live video feed so we're
gonna wrap this local media stream in
window dot URL caps that create object
URL and that's going to convert that
media stream into something that this
video player can understand finally
underneath that we'll call video dot
play which is going to play it if I if I
try it without you might see like one
frame yeah see one frame if you mouse
over it it will sometimes open and why
is that because that's because we set
the video to be this media stream but
it's not going to update unless we
actually go ahead and play it so I'm
gonna call video dot play and now when
you load the page you should see
yourself in the actual video element in
the top right hand corner that I've done
here if you inspect it you'll see that
the video source is a blob and that just
means that it's the raw data being piped
in off this webcam right here last thing
that we need to do is we need to do a
catch here just in case someone doesn't
allow you to access their webcam we need
to handle that error so we'll say error
and when that happens we're just going
to console that error oh no and then
give yourself the error and you could
obviously tell the user hey you denied
the webcam maybe you should not do that
because we need to get access to your
webcam good so we are up and running
with getting the video being piped in
the next thing that we need to do is to
take a frame from this video and to
paint it onto the actual canvas on the
screen so that's what we'll do here is
we'll make a function
and we will call that paint to canvas
and we have a couple things first what
we need is the width in the height of
the actual video so say Const width
equals video dot video width and Const
height is equal to video dot video
height now what we need to do is the
video is going to have a width and a
height associated with it and if we were
to call that paint to canvas you'll see
that it's 640 by 480 that's the size of
the video that's coming in off my webcam
now we need to make sure that the canvas
is the exact same size before we paint
to it and that's really important
because if the canvas is not the same
size as the video or if your video
webcam has a different width and height
to it then we we need to change that so
we'll say canvas dealt with is equal to
width and canvas height is equal to
height good now if you refresh and you
inspect this canvas here you'll see that
right now it's 943 pixels but if I were
to call that paint to canvas will then
be changed it still shows me it because
I'm stretching it with CSS but the width
and the height have been explicitly set
on the actual canvas now what we want to
do is to every I don't know 16 or so
seconds milliseconds we are going to
take an image from the webcam and put it
into the canvas so we are going to set
interval and that is going to run a
function every let's start with 60ml
site and you really have to play with
how often is it going to paint to the
canvas a lower performance machine
sometimes you have to go up you could
also play with requestanimationframe
but I have had no success with that so
I'm sticking with an interval here and
we're going to take the canvas context
we're going to called raw image and you
simply just pass it your video element
so the way that draw image works is that
you pass it an image or a video element
and it will paint it right to it we're
gonna start at zero zero which is start
at the top left hand I guess you're on
the other side
start at top left hand corner of the
canvas and then paint the width and the
height and that's exactly why we stuck
them in their own variables right here
so if we run that paint to canvas now oh
we got an error set interval its capital
I probably drives you nuts washing me
code like that there we go
and whoa what's going on here every 16
milliseconds what's happening is this is
our canvas element right here and then
up here we've got our video element that
we're working with so we are taking a
frame from it and one thing I like to do
is just return that interval here
because if you ever need to stop this
from painting you can have access to
that interval and you can call clear
interval on it good now what we want to
do is let's work on the take photo
function function take photo and we are
let's let's work on the audio portion of
it right now so is a snap current time
equals zero and we'll say snap don't
play so console refresh we want to go
into a console and run paint a canvas
got it going and then we're gonna run
take photo which should play there we go
you might not hear it because it's not
recording my computer's audio but that
should say chip Chinchin just imagine it
going off right now
good so that is playing the photo but
before we go any further it's kind of a
pain to have to manually run this paint
to canvas so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go down to the bottom here
we're gonna listen for an event on the
video element called Ken play so when I
say video to add eventlistener
can play that's an event that the video
will emit and when that happens we are
going to run the function paint to
canvas so what will that do once this
video is played it's going to emit
because we got to get the the webcam
like sorted out first right once the
video is playing its going to emit
an event called can play which in turn
canvas is going say oh now we should
start to paint a canvas so that's going
to now happen on our page load good I'm
happy with that now how do we make take
a photo of this actual canvas here so
it's part of our take photo we've
already played the sound which is not
really anything to do with it what we
now need to do is take the data out take
the data out of the canvas and we can do
this const data equals canvas dot two
data URL and then you pass it image for
size jpg or j PNG or whatever you're
looking for us but it probably makes
sense to do a jpg with an e there
because that's its picture of me it's
not really a PNG and then I'm just gonna
console dot log actual data see what
we're working with here so I'm gonna go
to my console and see what we're working
with here I'm gonna take a photo okay
and this is what happens whoa what the
heck is this so what this is this is
something called base64 and this is a
like a text-based representation of the
picture of me so this like 8v p b 4f B
that means like stunning smile and this
R vs zero that means like sweet baby
blues and and these are just like little
attributes about the photo in text based
form so what we can do with that is we
can create a link and an image to
actually put it into our strip let's
create a link here so say Kant's link
equals document dog create element we
need to create a proper link here you
can't just use backticks and then we
will be creating a
anchor link and that link dot ref is
going to equal the data that's what we
have there then we are also going to say
link dot set attribute the attribute we
were going to set
download and we're going to set that the
handsome I'll show you why in just a
second and then we'll just say link dot
text content equals download and then
finally we are going to take our strip
which is where we're going to dump our
links we're going to insert before we're
gonna insert the link node it's going to
happen right before the strip dot first
child that's sort of like if you've
jQuery dot prepend this is how you do
that in vanilla JavaScript so what we
did is we created a link we set the ref
to or href apparently if ref is not a
word but let's make it a thing dot set
attribute text content we've created the
link we've put it in so let's see what
we got here it's running I'm going to
run the function take photo good now we
have a link here that is download photo
I'm gonna open it up in a new tab first
of all and oh look what we got here so
this the URL is just a data image here
but it's smart enough to know that that
is the actual image it's not anywhere on
our computer it's just it's just stored
in this really long text string but what
I also did is we made this download
attribute of handsome and when you click
that it's going to actually download it
to your there we go download it to your
computer where it will then be put on
your users hard drive and you can then
open it up in your finder whatever it is
you're using there we go handsome dot
jpg got it up and running cool so we've
got our download download image we've
got it now let's actually put the image
visible inside of there as well so
rather than link text content delete
that will say link dot inner HTML is
equal to an image tag and the source is
going to be equal to the data
so both the href and the source it's
going to be he'll to the data and then
just like handsome man just accordingly
if you're not handsome then when we run
take photo there we go you should see
now see your actual photo every time you
run that function it's going to take a
photo of yourself
and you can download any of the ones
that you like cool let's hook it up to
the actual button so if we go to our
index.html and we have this photo it's
already hooked up on click or you could
select it I've just did sort of like a
bit of a cheap way to do it without
selecting it and that button should now
work regardless of whatever it is that
you're doing good so we've got our get
video we got our paint to canvas we've
got our take photo really the last thing
that we want to do is is do some filters
on them so the way that a filter works
is that you get the pixels out of the
canvas and then you mess with them
changing the RGB values and put them
back in so let's go back up to our paint
to canvas let's go into our interval and
we'll just do something like this we'll
say Const excells equals CTX get image
data and then you ask for the 0 0 the
width and the height just like we did
before and this might crash my browser
browser but I'm gonna try console
logging it's gonna be millions of pixels
large but let's see whoa okay
so here we go we've got this sort of
special kind of array here which is
pixels dot data is going to be a special
kind of array that's meant for very very
large numbers and if you open up one of
those suckers where did it go here what
if we do this console.log pixels and
debugger let's just stop it altogether
there we go I paused it go back to our
console look at some of this image data
open up the data there we go we've got
one two three four five six one point
two million items and if you open up one
of those and one of those and one of
those here's the actual values now what
is this well zero is going to be R one
is going to be G be R red green blue
alpha red green blue alpha so this array
here is simply
a huge array of numbers which is the
first pixels read the first pixels green
the first pixels red green blue I can't
even remember
and then the first pixels alpha and then
it starts again the second pixels red
green blue alpha red green blue alpha
and it just goes over and over and over
so for every 1 pixel on this picture of
me you have 4 entries in your array that
describe the red the green the blue and
the alpha so what we can then do is we
take those pixels and oh this needs to
be let because we're going to reassign
the pixels array not constant wouldn't
let us to do that and we need to then
take the pixel say pixels equals and
let's do the red effect first we'll say
red effect and pass it our pixels then
we go down here and we'll make our
filter function red effect takes in our
pixels and then you loop over every
single pixel that you have say for let I
is equal to 0 I is less than pixels dot
length and if you're wondering why I'm
not using dot map here is because this
is a special kind of array in JavaScript
it doesn't have all of the regular array
methods that you are used to working
with and they say I equals I plus 4 or I
plus equals 4 and that's just going to
increment it by 4 not by 1 don't put
that's cool in there then we have access
to our red green blue and alpha because
pixels square bracket I is going to be
our red Channel I plus 1 is going to be
our green I plus 2 is going to be our
red green blue and then we actually
don't need to really mess with the Alpha
on this red effect on our own so we say
pixels y equals and then we can just
start messing with it and changing with
the red green blue one so I'm just going
to paste some stuff in here and you can
have some fun with it so what I've done
here is I've just said the first one
plus is the arrive just added a zero for
so I can see that it's
our second and third one that we have
here and I'm just equally it to itself
plus 100 second one minus 50 and the
third one times 0.5 and there's no rhyme
or reason to that I just was messing
with them and some of them are going to
go over to 55 and some of them are going
to go under and that's totally fine but
what that will do is it will give us a
bit of a cool effect we do here is we
return those pixels once we've done
messing with the actual RGB values and
then we go back up here
we're pixels equals red effect and then
we say context dot put image data pixels
zero zero that's going to we take the
pixels out maybe we should put some
comments here take the pixels out mess
with them and put them back so now if we
refresh this sucker I don't see a red
effect happening here why is that
let pixels equals let's just debug this
real quick we've got our pixels we've
got our pixels coming back and we're
putting it in any errors in our console
nope here is our one returning our
pixels I'm not sure
oh I figured out what it was our loop is
pixels data link because pixels is not
an array pixels that data is an actual
array so now if I save that there we go
now I've got this bit of a read effect
going on here and we are seeing all of
the different colors being changed and
if you were to mess with this like -100
you see you get a bit of a different
color effect or +200 it will just Jack
the red up really as high as we can go
so that's the red effect next up what I
want to do is what I like to call the
RGB split so let's say function RGB
split that takes in our pixels and we're
going to do is exactly the same thing
that we did here so you can just copy
and paste these values into here except
with our RGB split what I'm going to do
instead of just changing each individual
one is I'm going to take the red and
change it change the one that is 150
pixels back to be the current color and
I'm going to take the green and take the
pixel that is a hundred and fifty pixels
forward and set it to be the current
color and then I'll do the same thing
with the hundred and fifty pixels for
the blue so I'm essentially just pulling
apart the different red green blues and
I'm moving them to either side so that
when we're working with it we're going
to be able to see the different ones
that were working with so I'm going to
take that RGB split function I'm going
to comment out this pixels one and I'll
use this one pixels equals RGB split
pixels and now when you refresh you
should see your red green in your blue
channels sort of showing up where we
have it and I think we could go down
here maybe change this one to like five
fifty maybe I don't know I'm just met
there we go
you see the blue my face which is blue
is like totally it's five hundred and
fifty pixels off and then if I get to
the edge of the screen here it starts to
wrap around to the other edge of
Green because at a certain point if the
pixels on the very left hand side it's
gonna wrap around and you of course you
can play with this make this 500 whoa
that's way more fun I really like that
and then I also figured out that if you
go up right here and you take your CTX
global alpha to be 0.1 what that's going
to do is it's going to to write the
actual one that we have but the ones
that are underneath it are still going
to show through for ten more frames and
the reason that is is because we're just
like putting a transparency of 10% of
the current image on top and we're just
stacking and stacking and stacking so as
it goes it's sort of like follows you
around and you could make that 0.8 and
it would still be ghosting just a little
bit less of an actual ghosting effect
that's really really fun cool last one
up we want to work with the green screen
so we're going to go in here and have a
function called green screen that's
going to take in our pixels and again
I'm just gonna take this from the answer
here and explain it to you because
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
going on here and so I pasted it in here
first of all we've got this levels
object here and that's going to hold our
minimum and maximum green because the
way that green screen works is that you
say give me all the colors in between
this RGB value and take them out and
usually that's like you you find a
certain like range of special greens and
then you take those ones out and they
don't occur in the people's clothing and
whatnot so we have started with some
blank levels then I've grabbed every
single RGB input and actually this
conversion to array is not no longer
needed so that's all six of these
sliders here and then I've set the red
min red max green mint green max bloom
in and blue max to be on that so
a console.log the levels and we were to
go up here take off the RGB split in the
Alfa and say pixels equals green screen
pixels check out our console here you
see that we've got these objects
happening which is going to give us the
the red min red max etc etc okay good
then we have a huge for loop just like
we've done before we loop over every
single pixel we figure out what the red
the green the blue and the Alpha are and
then we say if the red and the green and
the blue and the red and the green and
the blue if it's anywhere in between
those min and Max values that's what
this huge if statement does we take it
out why because the fourth pixel is the
alpha which is the transparency pixel
and if you set that to zero that's going
to be totally transparent rather than
255 which would be totally there so if
we give that a save now and you play
around with these sliders now you can
just change your min and your Max red
green and if you have a bit of a green
screen or I've done it before where I
got a pink bristol board and put it
behind me and I found that slice of the
rainbow where we want to pull that
specific pink or blue out in this case
I'm just pulling out random colors that
seem to match and it's kind of fun to
work with so that is it that was a big
one I know that I went a little bit fast
but this is one where I want you to go
back and just play with it start to make
your own filters now that you understand
that it's just a huge array of color
values and especially if you understand
how color and math relate to each other
you can start to make some really cool
fun filters with them and I'd love to
see any of the filters that you do make
thanks a lot and guess what I will see
