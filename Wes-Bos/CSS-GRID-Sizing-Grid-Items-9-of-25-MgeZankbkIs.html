spending our time on the grid container
and we haven't spent any time on the
grid items or how to actually size them
to be the size that we want so let's
break that down open up o 9 sizing grid
items and open up sizing items now let's
give ourselves a bunch of items so I'm
gonna say dot item and I'm also giving
it give at a class of item dollar and
that'll give us item 1 item 2 item 3
item 4 inside of that I'll just give our
number again and let's go let's go nuts
and give ourselves 30 items here and
that should give us 30 divs each with a
class of item and item 1 2 3 all the way
through 30 what do we got there good
looking good now let's just give
ourselves a very basic grid that we have
here so a grid template columns let's
repeat 5 times 1f are good so this gives
us a grid of 5 by whore from any high
that we need alright so how do you
actually size some of our items in it
well you might think like oh I could
just go into here and say like item 9
now maybe we'll change the background of
that to be something like misty rose and
we should see item 9 is now misty Rose
and if you were to give that it width of
500 pixels what happens
whoa so this is very similar to how that
last one worked where we actually had an
item what we did is we explicitly put a
width on the 500 pixel item and what CSS
grid did is remember that F R stands for
free space and before you can have free
space you have to use up the the paid
space so what CSS does is it says okay
first item 9 has to be 500 pixels wide
so it takes the column that item 9 is in
and it will size that to be 500 pixels
wide and then it says alright I'm done I
got a bunch of extra space who wants it
let's split it up evenly with one fr
throughout the rest of the columns so by
sizing this 500 pixels and similarly if
I were to take that off and I were to
make my item 9 really long
put some text in there without putting a
space in it because if you put a space
in it will just break on to the next
line but let's say something inside of
item 9 whether it's a an image with a
hard width or a really long word or
anything that is inside of it is causing
that item to be that wide then it's
going to first allot the width of that
column because of the width of the the
content side of it and then it will then
divvy up the actual space between the
other two okay that's good but I'm not
really happy about the fact that it
makes it kind of takes the entire column
along for the ride so rather than
relying on content width or giving it a
fixed width of something like 500 px
what we do is we use something called
spanning in CSS grid and we can
explicitly tell some of our items to be
a specific width so I can bring this
back to 9 and let's open up our dev
tools so we can sort of see what's going
on gonna go to my layout tab and turn on
a grid inspector I get black beautiful
cool so we got our number showing up now
we have item 9 here and I want this to
take up the spot where 9 and 10 is so
the way that we can do that it was
something called spanning so I'll say
grid template no grid column and we can
say span 2 so if by default grid items
just naturally flow one after another
and as there is space for each one they
will fit themselves into the grid as
they can however if you wish for an item
to take up multiple spots inside of our
grid you can tell it to span 2 so give
that a save and whoa okay look what
happened here now so the it still starts
where it naturally did but now it is
spanning two without giving it any sort
of explicit width and then 10 was then
bumped on to the next line because
that's the the next available space for
10 to actually go we'll talk a little
bit more about that when we talk about
how grid autoflow dense works so span to
what we're what would happen if we did
span 3 where is it gonna is it going to
go all
here place your bets ladies and
gentlemen Babu what happened here okay
so now we have a bit of a dead space
here and the reason behind that is
because the browser will lay out each
one one after another and as it gets to
nine it says okay this one needs to span
three but I only got space for two so
what it's gonna do is it's going to
start again on the next line and leave
those empty we'll talk about how do we
like wouldn't it be nice if we could
just put 10 and 11 right there and that
that's totally possible with the dense
option that I've been talking about
similarly if we let's bring it back to
two so we can put it right there if you
want to span multiple rows as well you
totally can so it's just grid row and
that is span two and that will give us
too high and allow us to go and this is
really starting to show the power of CSS
grid because I'm not doing any floats
I'm doing any absolute positioning I'm
just putting the item four as wide as I
want and if I would have another item
before nine so here now just put like
like a poop or something like that in
there then it's going to push it on to
the next line and figure out where can
you possibly fit this item where it
makes sense good
so span to span to on row you can spend
them as much as you want what would
happen if you were to span more than you
have available so maybe if I were to
span like something like 10 whoa well
that's the kind of kind of interesting
there what did we have before how many
numbers that we have we had six but if I
were to span 10 more than we had it will
automatically force the grid to be
larger than it wants and let's let's do
a little zoom in investigation here
remember we talked about the the solid
line being the end of the explicit grid
we only told it to be 5 columns each one
fr but however if you if it just can't
fit itself it's going to start creating
implicit columns or implicit rows in
this case it's creating implicit rows it
makes extra ones and it knows to just
sort of keep
filling them with the the extra items
that we have good then in the next video
what we're gonna talk about is spanning
is great but what if I just want to tell
it exactly where I wish for this item to
go and that's where we get into actually
placing grid items</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
