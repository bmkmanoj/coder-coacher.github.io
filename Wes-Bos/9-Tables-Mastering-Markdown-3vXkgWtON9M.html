part of every markdown parser out there
is actually not part of the initial spec
but many markdown parsers have put it in
and it's actually being standardized
right now so the way that you do a table
with it this works on github and
everything is a little bit tricky but
essentially what you do is you put a
pipe in between each of the things that
you want so I'm gonna go ahead and put
some pipes around there well it doesn't
work pipe pipe and put a piper on that
and finally put a pipe around that and
fiber on that now you can go ahead and
indent these so that they're all exactly
the same width but I prefer just to put
pipes around wherever they flow now if I
give that a save you notice it doesn't
do much but we have to go in here into :
- Josh - Josh - and you can make these
dashes as long as you'd like as well put
a pipe in there and then do : - Josh
Josh again and then put in a third pipe
and now that will turn into a very nice
looking table the one cool thing is that
we have these Det colons right here in
when you put them on the left they're
going to be left aligned when you put
them on either side the text will be
centered see how that was one centered
there and when you only put it on the
right hand side it will be right aligned
so if I wanted this maybe I'll bring
that one back to centered and the dog's
age to be all the way aligned to the
right hand side I'd put the coolant on
the right hand side and it would put the
data on there so not the greatest thing
- right it's a little bit fumbly and
it's also a little hard to write but
then again it's not the something that
you're gonna be using over and over and
there's plenty of markdown table
generators out there where if you just
need a quick table or a quick mock-up
you can use that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
