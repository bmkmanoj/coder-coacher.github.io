another quick tip for you today this is
a problem that I have fairly often and
it's when you have an SQL database that
is too large to import into phpMyAdmin
generally when you import a database
into PHP myadmin what you'll do is
you'll create your database and I'll
head over to import and you'll you'll
find it from here
unfortunately the maximum for the web
interface is 32 Meg's and sometimes your
database is much larger than that I've
even seen it on some hosts where it's
around 8 Meg's so a solution around that
is something called big dump and what it
does is staggers the import of the MySQL
database so that your server doesn't
time out when you're doing that so the
way to do it is just quickly download
the thing here you'll see I got the zip
file right here and then I've also got a
SQL database from a form I was working
on me I believe it is about about 230
Meg's so it talks you way too big for
that so we're going to go ahead and
unzip that get rid of those if file and
what you want to do is open up the PHP
file and we've got to configure it a
little here on the server which will
most likely be localhost depending on
your server configuration the database
name that I've set up is called big dump
you can see right now it's just a empty
database username for me is just root
password root yours going to be a little
more secure because you are most likely
on a host and then the file name that we
want to do make sure they're in the same
directory called fatty dot SQL or
whatever your database is called so then
we're going to browse to that path and
it just give us this interface that says
start import let's go ahead
and then it's going to take a little bit
of time since mine my database is about
200 bags which is pretty big in terms of
a database size so it's going to take
about five minutes or so I'll just pause
the video come back and we're back it
took about three minutes to import the
entire database gives a little date
about all of it and this is
congratulation and the files reach
assuming okay so we'll go back into our
PHP myadmin
click database which we refresh it and
you'll see that we have all of our
tables and all of our data in there so
that's it that's just a something don't
want to share with you super handy when
you try to import a large database if
you have any questions feel free to let
me know thanks a lot guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
