here and that is line breaks horizontal
rules and block quotes now some markdown
parsers well with line breaks they will
allow you just to to Westen school he is
really cool and then I love you and then
what this should do in lots of them is
Weston school he is really cool that
should be a line break because I didn't
put a full break in between but only
that but in the one I'm using right here
it just puts it on one line so if you
want a full line break you just pop a br
tag in there
the reality is you often don't need a
break tag and you want a full paragraph
to go horizontal rules if you have
something and you want something in
between it you can go ahead and give
yourself at least three dashes and that
will give you a horizontal roll same
thing with equal signs that will give
you another horizontal rule the only
thing you want to be careful with is if
you put something in horizontal rule
what do we learn that these things would
do earlier give it a save you'll know
that that is H 1 and that is H 2 so they
are the same thing so just make sure
that you put some spacing between them
and they will turn back into horizontal
rules finally we've got block quotes
here if you want to quote someone based
on like if you're applying to someone in
a forum or if you have a quote on a
website what you want to do is put a
chevron there and that will give you
everything you can do multiple lines
with or without the Chevron's it really
depends I think I prefer to have only
one Chevron when you start but you can
do another line here and that will be
part of the same quote if you want a
break in between it what you have to do
is give yourself a blank one well you
can also you can see it just adds them I
was like you go in here well you can
also do is just give yourself one and
then give yourself the quote here and
that will also give you another one if
you want a space in between the two you
need to make sure that you either have
two spaces in some of the markdown
parsers or you need to have an actual
element in between each of the ones you
can use all the stuff that you're used
to inside of here like for example
if I wanted to bold Wayne Gretzky's name
here what I would do is first of all
give myself a line break and then I'd
give myself an M dash and I would just
bold his regular name and you can see
that it starts to form on itself pretty
nice you can't do any other kind of
formatting why because this is purely
for text if you want stylistic stuff
that will happen in the CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
