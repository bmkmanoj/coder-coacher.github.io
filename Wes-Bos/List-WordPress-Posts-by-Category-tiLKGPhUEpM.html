and I saw John Gardner tweet out for
some help or some WordPress what he's
looking to do is loop through each of
the categories and then within that show
the posts that belong to that category I
thought that was kind of cool so I just
thought I'd make a quick tutorial
showing you guys how to do that set up
here I just have your regular old
WordPress install and I've put a bunch
of lorem ipsum posts with each of them
are in a couple categories each what we
want to do next is create a page that
will be displaying these categories on
it so let's add a new one posts by
category we'll call it and then just
publish it next what we want to do is
create a custom template for that page
since we will be looping through each of
them with some custom code so just
create a new file and then I'm just
going to grab our code from the regular
old page PHP just so we can have the
same site structure you'll probably have
your own theme set up for that we could
also delete this part because this is
the wordpress loop that regularly
displays all of your either your page or
your posts since we're creating our own
custom loop we don't need it last thing
I want to do is create the template name
and then if we head back into our
wordpress refresh this you'll want to
select post by category as our template
we update that if we take a look at the
page is going to be nothing on it just
make sure it's working right high in
there you'll see it show up shows up
here but so now what we need to do is
loop through each of our categories so
let's set up a variable called cats and
we're going to use the WordPress
function called get categories and what
that's going to do is it's going to call
the database for all of your categories
and put them into our category variable
here just to show you what's inside of
that we're just going to print print our
that variable as you can see here we get
an array of a bunch of objects that have
all the information as you can see the
ID which is important to us the slug if
you're using pretty permalinks and the
name is also pretty important to us and
just lives through each of the
categories that I have listed inside of
my admin if you take a look here I have
them just listed here so it's definitely
not not what we want but that's that's a
good start
so to loop through each of those
categories we want to open up a for each
statement I'm going to say for each cat
as cat do this so now if we echo out
cat's name we should just get a list of
all the category names ducks you put a
little formatting in there
you can see them
cat and not cats and there you go
we have all the categories listed so
that's good let's actually keep that
just make it a little nicer
now that we have that we also want to
set up a variable sum to do it at the
top here called category ID and that
will be the idea of the category that we
need to loop through and get posts from
that so that's stored in cat term ID you
can actually just show it in here so we
can make sure it's working there we go
40 39 38 42 each of them have a category
ID appended to them next thing we want
to do is set up our WordPress loop and
to set up a custom WordPress look we
need to call the query posts function
otherwise it'll think the page that
we're on is what posts one a query which
is not correct and pass it to parameters
category equals student double quotes we
don't have to concatenate anything cat
ID and we also saw say posts per page
equals 100 so I'll say at most it'll
grab 100 posts at once
alternatively what you can do is head
down to your WordPress click on reading
and we could we could set this to 100
but you probably don't want 100 posts
showing up on your regular blog page so
we're just going to leave that and
hard-coded in here now that the query is
done we'll open up our if statement this
is just the WordPress loop if you google
WordPress loop you can read up on it
here it looks pretty complicated in here
but this is just the basics it's all we
need right now so if have posts going to
check over the half posts first and then
we're going to use a while statement
while we have posts and then we're going
to set up the posts for that singular
one
and we amount to make sure that we close
and while you want to close our if
statement and if so that now that's
working let's just try to show the name
of each of those posts the title which
is a built in more press function now
for you refresh this we should see a
list of all the posts that are each
category well query post it's pretty
posts it's what's it wrong and I did
that one wrong - so no that's right
oh there we go sorry guys have posts
can't frame is is today and there we go
you see a bunch of the lorem ipsum names
will just pop in a char in there so it
looks a little better for you guys there
we go
so under each category you have the post
names final thing what we want to do for
that is just actually set up a link so
people can click them take the ID as
well so set up a link the permalink will
get you the actual link to the post and
we'll just take our title hook it in
there
keep the HR there extra things nice
there we go you can see we put through
everyone
there's a lot more you can do with it if
you want to order them in a certain way
or let's say you wanted to get rid of on
categorized just take a look at the loop
and also WordPress query posts and they
have all of the specification arguments
that you can pass into it so you can
customize this how you need so that's it
I hope you enjoyed it let me know if you
have any questions and I'll be posting
the code up on my blog as well thanks
