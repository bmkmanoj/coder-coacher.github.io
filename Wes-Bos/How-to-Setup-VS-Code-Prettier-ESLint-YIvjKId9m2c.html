I'd make a quick video explaining how I
have my ES Lin and prettier set up with
vs code I've had some trouble with in
the past and I just asked on Twitter I
got some help from some people and I
think that the Miss configuration comes
because there's really a lot going on
here so first of all I'm using es lint
to lint my code and tell me when I have
specific errors in the code and then I'm
using prettier to fix the code so like
for example if I did have a space here
or I'm using quotes the double quotes
and then when I hit save it will
automatically fix it I'll change that to
single quotes and add the spaces for me
properly or if I have some sloppy
indentation and then give it a save it
will just reinvent it for me so that's
what's prettier is doing and I've
configured my prettier through my es
lint file too I guess
complicate or simplify things a little
bit more and then to take it one step
further in vs code there is a default
formatter in there which i think is
called beautify j/s which works great
but it's just not it's not my settings
that I need everywhere else so how did I
get it all working after all that
there's tons of different options so
first things first is you don't need the
prettier extension installed on vs code
if you're configuring it via es Lin I'll
say that again don't need the prettier
extension installed so if you go in here
and you search for a prettier there we
go so there's this one right here and I
have it installed but I don't have it
enabled because this will this will do
it for you but if you haven't configured
by es lint which is what I do then I
also have the es lint plug-in installed
and what was happening is both of those
were trying to fix my code and I was
running to into some issues so no
prettier plugin yes to the es lint
plugin and then let's head on over to my
own let me show you in my ESL and how I
have it so first of all the rules I
extend via prettier and prettier react
because I write some react and then I
configure my prettier things like
trailing coma
single quotes and the print width I can
figure that via my es lint file and then
finally the plugins this is the part
that auto fixes it I use the yet I use
the prettier plugin for es Linton and
that's why I don't need to care about
the prettier plugin for vs code because
I want to configure it via my es lint
and that allows me to fix it via the
command line I can bring that to other
computers I can fix it in my editor if I
switch to another editor for whatever
reason I don't need to reconfigure my
editor it's all done via my es lint file
then in my user settings so there's all
kinds of different save on file and save
on whatever and really what you need is
these ones right here so first editor
dot format on save needs to be set to
true and that will trigger it to save on
true and then what you need to do is
only for JavaScript you want to turn
edit format on save to false that way if
you are like the the formatter that
comes with it also formats your HTML and
your CSS and you you likely still want
those so you can just turn it off just
for JavaScript and then I have es lint
Auto fix on safe to be true and this I
always had this to be true yet it wasn't
automatically doing it on save until I
did this little ditty up here and then I
just have this always show status that
just shows me in the corner here if
everything is going well or not so
that's how I have it set up I know that
might not be the way that you have it
set up but I know quite a few people do
and they're having some trouble with the
perfect storm of vs code prettier in es
Lin so hopefully that will help you out
happy to answer any questions you want
just tweet me I'm at West boss see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
