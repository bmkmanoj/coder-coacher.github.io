running we need to install a couple
things and download a couple things
before we can start writing some CSS
grid first thing we need is to download
Firefox and the reason why I'm using
Firefox here is not just because they've
sponsored this entire course which is
great thank you for doing that but even
if they didn't do that I would totally
be using Firefox because at the time the
CSS grid tools in Firefox are by far the
best debugging tools out there chrome
currently does have CSS grid debugging
tools however they are not very good
they are very very simple I'm sure
they'll get much better with time but
currently Firefox is ways ahead so we're
going to be using Firefox for the entire
course now I'm using Firefox developer
edition you can use any version of
Firefox nightly or stable but I
recommend getting developer edition just
as they're always gonna have the latest
CSS grid features in developer just so
that we can debug it and get a peer into
it so we'll be using that throughout the
course download and install node.js you
likely already have this installed
however if you do not you can just go
ahead and download the current version
click next next next and that will
install it on your machine the way you
can tell if you have it installed is you
can just go to your your terminal and
you can use any terminal in this course
I'm using one called hyper term but you
can use the one that's built into
Windows or the terminal and OSX or if
you're on Linux you probably just boot
into that so you just type node if you
can spell no - V and that's going to
tell you which version you are currently
on i'm on 8.6
maybe I want it to update I would just
click this and download the next version
third we need to get the CSS grid
starter file so if you log into your
course dashboard at courses West boss
comm you're going to see a link to the
starter files that's gonna kick you off
obviously I don't have a CSS grid course
here yet this is just an example for my
JavaScript 30 but once the course is
live you'll see it in your dashboard you
can click off to the CSS grid right now
there's not a whole lot on my github but
you should see a get
repo full of different folders in each
video or each couple videos is going to
have a folder associated with that video
and we're generally going to have things
like it test - start and test us
finished and the finish is going to be
the state that the a file is in at the
end of the video and then the start is
going to be any any sort of starter HTML
that you don't necessarily need to write
as just sometimes it's just a bit of a
waste of time so you'll see that go
ahead and download the entire thing
you can also fork it to your own however
please be careful with forking it
because what happens let me show you
here on my JavaScript 30 is people will
a couple thousand people have forked it
and then when they try to push the
changes up to their own repo they
accidentally make a pull request to my
own which is it's an accident but I get
a lot of email so make sure you're not
accidentally pull requesting me and
you'll be good to go
so that's all that we have there once
you've downloaded all of the files what
I want you to do is to open them up in
your finder and it'll look a little bit
something like this just with much more
folders and you'll see that we have a
package lock a package JSON and you
won't actually see the node modules
folder let me delete that right there
the package JSON you can open that up in
your editor here there's really not a
whole lot here the only reason I asked
you to install nodejs is because we're
going to be using it utility called
browser sync and what browser sync does
is it's going to watch all of our CSS
HTML and JavaScript files and
automatically reload them in the browser
so that we can sort of stay in our code
here while just looking at the refreshed
result on our left without having to go
over and manually refresh it you are
totally fine to just open these files up
in HTML in your browser without browser
sync you can just scrap this entire
piece if you want however I think you're
going to be much more productive if you
use this browser sync tool that we have
here you'll see that I've created this
script called start and all that does is
it runs this command called browser sync
start and we pass it a couple different
our
humans here a couple different flags
we've got this server which it creates a
local host URL on our computer that we
can visit it watches all of our files
that end in CSS HTML and JavaScript and
we'll refresh when any of those change
its a directory and that will show us a
listing of our directories and then
we're running on port seven seven seven
seven and then by default I'm going to
open the browser called Firefox
developer edition if you would like to
change that to maybe just regular
Firefox you can just type Firefox or if
you're using Chrome for some reason you
could do that as well but I'm going to
leave mine at Firefox developer now what
I want you to do is to open up this CSS
grid folder in your terminal now if
you're not totally sure about how that
works what you can do this little little
trick that I like to do is to find the
CSS grid folder on your computer so I'm
gonna I'm gonna go one level up it's
right here type let's say I'm on my on
the root of my computer just type CD
space and then drag and drop the CSS
grid right into there and then you know
you're in it you can type PWD to see
where you are or LS l you can see that
we are in the folder with the
package.json then we can go ahead and
type NPM install or just NPM I and
that's going to install our one
dependency the only thing that we need
for this entire course which is browser
sync and then we've got it up and
running now what I can go ahead and do
is type NPM start and that will open up
a directory of all of our files and
folders you can go into Oh to go to
tests test start and you'll see sort of
this base style that we got let's go
ahead and actually open up that cash -
dart and value that we have here and
this is just a very basic HTML that'll
likely start you off with in a lot of
our videos so what you can do there if
you just have a paragraph tag and type
below and give it a save you see it
automatically shows up on the right-hand
side here
same thing if you have a style tag and
maybe we have a paragraph we want to
change the font size to 20 px it's going
to automatically change the font size or
any of the things that we change it's
automatically going to change it on our
left hand side no manually refreshing
that is needed
this editor that I'm using is vs code
you can use any editor that you want
however I highly recommend that you use
some editor that has Emmet in and if you
haven't looked at it just go to Emmet
dot IO and you can install it for
virtually any editor out there with vs
code it's automatically built in so
there's no package that you need to
install why do we use that well I like
to do things where like if we want a
container and then inside of that
container we want a like ten items and
we hit tab that's going to give us ten
so I'm going to be giving you these
little snippets to type and then to hit
either enter or hit tab and that will
automatically complete the HTML that
we're actually looking for same with
inside of CSS if I do something like
font size 50 we I could just type F z50
tab and that's going to complete it
those things are not necessary but it's
going to make us much more productive so
I recommend that you install that and
also to show you how it work so as we go
along the way why does this look so dang
good already well I have a sort of a
base CSS that I'm going to be giving you
I'm gonna run through it real quick just
to give you a heads up of what is in
this base CSS there's not a whole lot
related to CSS grid but it's more just
CSS that makes it look good and when
we're trying to debug things it will
look a little nice so let's open
actually that up it's in our assets
folder and style dot CSS first up we
have a couple CSS variables if you've
never used these before I really like to
use specific yellows and specific blacks
because I don't I'll have some pride in
your in your demos here make them look
decent don't use red green and blue the
base colors that we always use use some
nice colors the problem is I don't
expect you to remember what this hex
code is here so what we can do is if you
want the thing to be like border bottom
10px solid and I just say yellow that's
not the the actual yellow that I'm
looking for so what we can do is you can
say var - - yellow and then what that's
going to do is it's going to pull in
that yeah that's specific
yellow that I had been using in this
style dot CSS value same with here if I
said color black that's going to be pure
black but if I were to VAR it - - black
it's going to give us a little bit of a
lighter black value that we have there
so if you have a couple different colors
that like to use through all of the the
files that we're doing here you can just
stick them in the root here and they'll
be available in all of our files that we
have there
next up box sizing border box that will
just make sure that anytime we add
padding or a border to an element it
does not increase the size so that when
we're trying to divvy up the width of a
container then we we have it there if
you're unfamiliar with that maybe do a
quick google into how that works in the
traditional way how it was broken for a
long time we're using just a base font
I'm setting the color of everything to
be black and there's a little bit of a
text shadow on most of the stuff I don't
know if you can really see that next up
this is the inherit of the box sizing
border box that's where we've set it
here apparently that's a little bit
better than setting everything to
box-sizing border box and then I just
have a little bit of a background here
it's kind of a nice little gradient with
the typography makes it looks nice
nothing to do with that I apply some
margin to my things and then finally I
am using CSS grid in each of our items
we'll talk more about what an item is in
a bit but I just like the center the
content inside of the actual item that
we have so that's it that's the base CSS
that we have there everything else we're
going to be writing either in a separate
CSS file or most likely we're just going
to be writing in a style tag directly in
the HTML file that we're working with if
you have any other questions about my
setup I likely have answered it at west
boss com4 slash uses and here I tried to
detail all of the different themes and
fonts and everything that I use in my
editor if something is not there feel
free to tweet me I'm at West boss on
Twitter and I'll try to answer those as
many as again other than that let's get
rollin I'll see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
