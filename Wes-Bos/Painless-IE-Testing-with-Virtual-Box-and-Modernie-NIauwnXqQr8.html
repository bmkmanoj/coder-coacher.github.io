for you today on how to test Internet
Explorer from your Mac so if you've been
working on a website and you want to
kind of try it out on different browsers
you're definitely going to need to try
it on an internet explorer because
there's quite a few bugs that will pop
up the problem is a lot of you guys
aren't on Macs and you can't download
and install Internet Explorer just as a
normal program to try it out so the
great folks at Microsoft actually know
of this pain they they know that it's a
painted testing or Explorer and all
these different devices especially if
you have a Mac so they've made a really
fast and simple solution for you and I'm
gonna show you how to kind of go through
that today so we're gonna be using two
things today the first one is called
VirtualBox now since we cannot install
Internet Explorer straight to a Mac we
need to actually run Windows inside of
our Mac and a free program that we'll do
it's it's from Oracle
it's called VirtualBox and you didn't
kind of think of it as a computer inside
of your computer and will be able to
install Windows or Linux or whatever you
want to these virtual computer and then
kind of run Windows right inside our Mac
so you can see I've actually got a
pretty good set up already here
I've got some Windows 7 I have IE 9 on
windows 7 I've got fedora it's or for
some Linux testing but the way it works
is you have picked on when you want you
click start and it will go ahead and
start up windows just as you normally
would if you're running a Windows you'll
notice that this is just a window inside
of my Mac environment and after a couple
seconds it'll go ahead and load up your
Windows environment and from there you
can go ahead and boot up Internet
Explorer or you can even install Chrome
on Windows or whatever you would want to
do again this is totally free I don't
need to pay for a Windows license so
it's gonna close that down so that's
VirtualBox
there's a couple other
rooms that do this I'll talk about those
in just a sec and then the other half is
we actually need the software so Windows
to be able to install to it and then
viewer to head on over to Best Buy or
wherever you buy Windows you'd notice
that it's a couple hundred dollars in
you camp pay that just to test your
internet explorer websites so if we head
on over to modern dot ie this is a
website run by the kind of the developer
guys behind Internet Explorer and they
allow you to have access to all the
versions of Windows with all of the
versions of Internet Explorer so if you
hit the front page there's a lot going
on here what we really want is virtual
machines some of stuff around
screenshots but it's impossible to debug
a website with just screenshots so we're
gonna go to virtual machines and now we
select what are we on if you're on
Windows trying to test other windows you
click Windows but chances are you're on
Mac so click Mac and we want VirtualBox
for Mac we don't there's also VMware and
parallels which are fantastic programs
however they are paid and if you're just
testing Internet Explorer you don't need
the full power of these two VirtualBox
is fantastic and nice and fast for what
we're doing so go ahead and click on
VirtualBox for Mac and it's gonna kind
of pop down all of these different
versions of Windows and different
versions of inter Explorer so you kind
of have like permutations here so you
see we've got Windows 8.1 with IE 11
we've got Windows 8 with IE 10 we've got
Windows 7 with I 11 10 9 8 vista XP so
you can go all the way back to maybe not
that one it shot up so all the different
versions here what I generally recommend
for everyone to do is grab the latest
version of I 11 on windows 7 just
because it's easiest to use and ie 11
will include options to fall back to 10
nine and eight so you're able to kind of
emulate all of these browsers just in
one if you need native ie eight nine or
ten you can go ahead and repeat this
video over with them but Windows seven
and I eleven should do just fine
these images are huge so I recommend you
kind of grab a cup of coffee and do this
at a time where you have lots of
bandwidth so don't do it out of
Starbucks as well as lots of time for
them to download so to download we need
these four parts so you can just go
ahead and open in a new tab right click
new tab right click on your tab click
new tab and you'll see that my browser
will just download them all you can see
it's about three and a half gigs here
another option is just grab them all
with curl and that's actually a little
bit nicer so chrome doesn't if your
chrome crashes or something like that
you don't have to start again so I'm
just gonna edit go ahead and cancel
these and show you how to do it the
other way curl is a song is included on
all of your computers and it's a way to
download things or grab things off the
net so it gives us this long curl string
here so we can go ahead and just copy
that and this needs to happen through
the terminal now if you've never used a
terminal before you can open it up under
the utilities and look for the terminal
icon here I'm gonna open mine up we need
to go to a directory where we want to
download this so I'm in my downloads
directory I'm just gonna make another
directory so I bump that up for you so
make there ie 11 and then we see D
stands for change directory ie 11 now
we're in it yours might look a little
bit different but that's okay and then
we just go ahead and paste that little
section
like I grabbed it copy paste it in there
hit enter and it's gonna go ahead and
download that for us so that might take
half an hour an hour depending on how
fast your internet connection really is
so while we wait for that to download we
can head on over to VirtualBox and give
that a download so go ahead and go to
VirtualBox org and the home page is a
little bit confusing it's not the nicest
looking thing but a software works great
we want to go to downloads and you can
download VirtualBox for any platform so
probably you're on OS X which is a Mac
so go ahead and download that and when
you're done just follow through all of
the steps to install it just like you
would a normal program and you should be
able to open it up looks a little
something like this however you probably
don't have anything in the sidebar here
because you haven't installed any
machines so I'm gonna let those download
I'm going to pause the video and I'll
come back once we are ready to install
windows so it has finished downloading
it took about half an hour 45 minutes on
my connection which is pretty fast so
it's definitely something you'll want to
do when you have some time so if I go
ahead and open up what we just
downloaded you'll note that we should
see these four files with a dot SFX and
three rare files these are kind of like
a zip files however instead of zipping
them into multiple files we kind of
create one large file with them so if
you need a program to do that on rare X
on the Mac as well as a number of other
free alternatives I'm sure you already
know how to open up a rare file so
right-click open I've already done that
and what it does is it spits out a OVA
file which is actually an appliance file
you can kind of think of it as sort of
an installed machine already so if we
head on over to VirtualBox we can
sort of import this now so we would go
to you probably can't see us go to file
import appliance or just hit command-i
to import it let me click up open
appliance and I'm just going to go to my
downloads and we called it ie 11 and
here's the OVA file click open click
continue it's going to ask us a whole
bunch of stuff about the computer don't
worry about changing any of it the
defaults are just fine click import and
it's gonna go ahead and crack that file
open and install the computer that took
about three or four minutes and you can
see that there is now ie 11 Windows 7
installed right to the sidebar here so
go ahead and click start and this will
open up the VirtualBox image it'll take
a second thing on how fast your computer
is if you have an SSD drive it usually
is just a few seconds to start up
windows a little bit slower on other
ones while that starts I want to note
that the background image of this box
will give you a little bit more
information on licensing and if and when
you need to renew this version of
Internet Explorer how to do it so make
sure that you read through all this on
how to rearm and reactivate it if you
need to so when that's loaded you can go
right ahead click on Internet Explorer
and it will load up the modern ie ie
home page now the really important thing
that we want because this is ie 11 it's
actually pretty good let's say you
wanted to test Internet Explorer 8 I'm
just going to go ahead and search for
border-radius
example
right here so here we go here's some
Porter radius now I know that
border-radius doesn't work in ie8 so if
I wanted to test my site I ate you click
the little cog icon click f12 developer
tools these are the developer tools for
internet explorer very similar to those
in Chrome and Firefox now to emulate
older browsers you want to click the
down arrow all the way down until you
see this computer icon you're on the
emulation tab and from the drop down
here you can emulate all the different
versions of Internet Explorer so I want
in our Explorer 8 go ahead and click
that let it resize and you notice that
these are just boxes now so I'd be able
to go ahead and surf the web just as if
I was in Internet Explorer 8 you can
notice that not everything looks the
greatest hopefully that is helpful to
you I go ahead and download a couple of
them it's always great to have them on
the ready and let me know if you have
any questions thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
