really cool in CSS and I thought that
I'd share it with you I was on web
designer depot.com in a day and I
hovered over a link and I got this kind
of cool hover effect and I thought oh
that's really neat I'd like to know how
to do that so I inspected it and I took
a look and it's not any JavaScript it's
not any before or after a pseudo element
kind of tricks there it's actually just
using background position background
image with a gradient as well as a
transition so I didn't totally
understand it after looking at that so I
went ahead and rebuilt it in code pen
and I thought I'd just show you how that
works so here's the the final thing that
we're gonna be building or you hover
over these links and you get this really
cool a hover effect and the beauty is
that because links are inline elements
they'll wrap onto multiple lines and by
default like a background color we just
go across the entire element but because
we're using a linear gradient here and
as a background image it's just going to
go from one line to another and we're
gonna be using a background position and
a trick with background size to get it
to all work so I've got a code pen right
here where I've got it set up
there's nothing none of this stuff is
I'm writing it in stylus but you can
write this in CSS or whatever it is that
you'd like you can just click on view
compiled if you're not sure what stylus
is um and I'm gonna go ahead and select
each of these links so I've got these
links here they have a class of fun
hover so I'm gonna select those and
there's a couple things that we need to
put on here first one is that we need a
background gradient and you may be
looking at this being like that's not a
gradient at all however the interesting
thing about gradient is if you have a
very hard stop in your gradient it will
just be one color half the way in the
other color the other half the way or or
25 and 75 percent however you set it up
so what we're going to be doing here is
we're gonna be setting up a gradient
that is just two colors and we're just
gonna switch them out depending on the
background position when we hover and
when we not we'll use transition to
animate so say background image is a
linear gradient and then we're gonna
start to write and the first one's going
to be mint 50 percent and yellow 50
we're gonna end it off with so let's
give that look okay so here is the cool
thing about it what we did is we put the
background of this element 50% of it is
going to be mint and the other 50% is
going to be yellow and you can see it
there however that's actually not what
we want because we want the one color to
show up normally and then the other
color showed up when you hover so the
trick that a web designer people use
there is they use background - sighs
200% and what that does is it will blow
up blow it up and because this is a
gradient it's not gonna be pixelated or
anything like that okay cool so that is
now showing us just the first 50% of our
gradient and when we hover we want to
show the other 50% of the gradient so
and then go ahead and say and hover so
or if you're just doing regular CSS if
you dot fun hover
sorry fun hover colon hover but we're
gonna do it here
when you hover the background - position
is going to be a hundred percent so
essentially what we're gonna do is when
you hover over one of these things there
we go
we're taking the entire background and
shifting it over a hundred percent of
its width okay cool so now we're we just
got regular hover right here but we know
that we can say transition background -
position 0.85 seconds so what that's
going to do is it's going to transition
the background position over half a
second so hover and there we go looks
like it's it's working but now it's
going backwards so a quick fix for that
is just put negative 100 on the
background position and then it will go
from start to finish rather than finish
to start so it's looking cool one other
little cool thing that you can do right
there is I'm using two colors to clearly
show that I'm animating from one part of
the gradient to the other however I
could take that initial mint color and
just change it to transparent and then
you'll have nothing until you actually
hover and then the animation comes on in
so really nice smooth animation it might
be a little bit tricky here on the video
just because I don't get the frame rate
that you do by seeing it but kind of a
really cool animation trick that you can
do just with by
using background size in a linear
gradient so let me know if you enjoyed
this if you like to see anything else
I'm at West boss on Twitter and
