react for beginners my name is Wes boss
this course is for anyone who wants to
learn how to build react jazz
applications from scratch as well as
anyone who wants to level up on their
JavaScript skills you've got any
questions as to what this course is
gonna cover make sure you check out
react for beginners calm and they've got
a full listing of all the topics and
videos that we're gonna cover what I
wanted to do here is show you what we're
going to be building from scratch and
detail all of the different parts of it
so we have this app called catch of the
day and what that is it allows us to
manage the inventory in the order of a
seafood market and the problem with the
seafood market is that the price and the
quantity and the availability of
everything can change at any given
moment and as people are shopping that
data should be immediately updated we
shouldn't have to wait for a page reload
so what I have here is I've got one of
the stores inventory open right here and
I've got a listing on the left hand side
here of all of the different fishes that
we can have and you can go ahead and add
one of these fishes to your order and
when you go ahead and add a secondary
you see the little chit Ching pop up
there you can go ahead and add a third
one you can go on the side here and
change Pacific halibut to Atlantic and
it'll change it right here as well as up
here and what's happening right here is
that every time I'm editing my content
it's going to be updating on my firebase
as well as syncing with our react State
and updated and goes for a price if I go
ahead and change the price on this we're
gonna see it updating right here and
where we display the price the amount
that we have in our cart as well as our
order total we can go ahead and change
the description as well as if I go to
maybe like King Crab right here I can
change it from fresh to sold out and as
soon as that sold out it will display a
message to the user that sorry you can't
get that one any longer so what we've
got going behind the hood here is that
we've got a react state we've got props
passing data we've got a whole bunch of
different components that are sort of
working together we've got reacting
animations and we've got fire bases a
database on the backend so that's what
we're gonna be building in this
application and we'll cover sort of the
really good fundamentals up to building
a bit of a more advanced react
application if you've got any questions
please let me know and check out react
for beginners calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
