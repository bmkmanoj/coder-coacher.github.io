sort of a fun coat along and that is
I've got all these LinkedIn
notifications because I never go on
LinkedIn but I don't want to have to
click except like a sucker and also I
don't want to accept the recruiters
because they just send me emails about
exciting opportunities so what I want to
do is let's programmatically do it and
if this says recruit or anything like
that then we we don't click accept
otherwise I don't care everyone else can
can come on in the party so how do we do
that well first of all we need to accept
all of these and what I did is I
inspected this Li and has a class of
invite - card so I'm gonna say document
query selector all the invite - card and
that gives me a huge node list of every
single person that has invited now that
is not yet in array so we can use ESX
spread to convert that to a real array
here so that does everything that I want
now I just want to loop over them so I'm
gonna bring my code in here just so it's
a little bit saner to loop over so we
are going to use dot for each on it and
for each card we want to do let's just
console.log card make sure that it's
still working paste that in good I'm
getting a call to log of each an
individual card now we need to make a
couple variables one for this actual
thing right here so what is that that's
a paragraph at the class of headline so
I will say Const headline equals card
query selector is now we actually just
want to look inside of that specific
card for the headline and then I'm going
to call that text content on it why
because I want I just want the text
inside of it not the actual element so
let's see the headline
great now I'm getting like what people
are front an engineer a software
engineer now we now that we have that we
also need the buttons so that we can
click them so say counts except equals
card query selector same thing we all
want to look for what is that there's a
class on here BTW - invite except let's
just double check that we are also
getting the accept button working looks
like it good now I need to filter these
buttons for anything that says recruit
so we will say if headline dot match
recruit and we want to make it global in
case-insensitive and the reason I say it
recruits because it could be recruitment
recruiter and the recruit will just
match them all if they are then
console.log now and we maybe will also
grab their name as well
constant name equals card query selector
let's just do this name equals query
selector what is their name and know
what say a with a glass of name text
content so na name looks a little fishy
to me
maybe we'll get off a little bit of
emoji up here that one looks good couple
of them else console.log name looks cool
let them in a couple emojis make it nice
and fun cool so now let's do a dry run
on this hey so what do we got here looks
cool looks cool looks cool let's go to
the first one recruiter right here King
Janet recruitment and talent acquisition
specialist looks a little fishy to me
not something I can let on in cool so
now that our filters are working
properly we can go ahead and I'm just
going to click the button except so I
should end up with a whole bunch of
recruiters here that I've not yet
accepted so I'm going to
say except click and that will force a
or trigger a click on that actual
element so I'm gonna run it again one
last time
whoa all right looks like I stepped it
like sixty people all at once what's
left just a whole bunch of recruiters I
could go through this again and I could
select the the deny button and
programmatically click that as well
actually let's go ahead and do that real
quick here you see that all of them all
of them are still popping up twelve
there's a couple left here
BTN invite decline and that week is a
decline programmatically click that if I
run it again gone everybody is done I'm
off to the races so that's kind of a fun
little quote along you get to learn a
little bit about the spread you can
learn up a little bit for each we use an
arrow function here we selected the
things we trigger to click we use a
regex kind of a whole bunch of little
things all put together for without me
having to I did that how long did this
take me to record about five minutes
versus something like taking ten minutes
to actually click the buttons yourself
programming see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
