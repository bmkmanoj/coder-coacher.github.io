I've got action creator CAS which is the
file that actually makes our actions
that are about to get dispatched
remember an action is just an object
with some information about what
happened and what needs to change in
this case the index or the post ID the
comment we've we've gone over that a few
times now and then I'm also going to
open up the reducers posts and the
reducers comments and as a quick
reminder the reducer actually does the
editing of state so we let's take a look
at this post right here right now I'm
just console logging action but maybe
let's pop another console log the post
will change so anything that happens
inside of the post that this reducer is
going to handle that right so now how do
we hook the two on up the way that it
works is that we dispatch an action and
then the posts reducer is going to be
listening for that and it's going to
handle that action so I'm gonna show you
how to manually do it and by the way
sometimes you're gonna see this little
error I'm showing up or this little
warning following modules cannot be hot
reloaded that's because only components
can be hot reloaded so if you're if
you're reloading some of your other
logic in JavaScript you have to do a
hard refresh right here so we've got a
bunch of stuff in the console here let's
just clear it out and then let's go to
our reactive tools select the provider I
want to access this store you may notice
inside of the store there is a dispatch
method and that's the that's the method
that we're going to call in order to
fire off these actions so I'm gonna
click on the provider I'm gonna go back
to here I'm going to do dollar r dot
store and that gives us the actual store
here and you can notice that that's the
dispatch method that we need here
so Dollar dispatch now what do you
dispatch you actually just dispatch in
action so let's let's look at this
increment one like let's say I want it
to increment the amount of likes on one
of my photos here essentially what needs
to get dispatched at the end of the day
is just an object that looks like this
so we can manually recreate that
ourselves instead of hooking it up to a
button we haven't done that yet so
they type is increment underscore likes
and the index is let's just use ero the
first post in the array is going to get
incremented likes for us so when I go
ahead and hit enter that's going to fire
off or dispatch that actual action and
let's see what happens whoa okay
the post will change that happened in
posts that is on line seven that's right
here good that makes sense and then we
console.log the entire state in the
entire action which this is the entire
state right here you can see that those
are all the posts and then this is the
actual action that happened and then we
had another one in in comments jas which
that's kind of weird because I didn't we
just fire off a post one why is comments
running so let's take a look at what we
got here we've got the entire state of
comments these are all the comments that
have happened and then we also have the
actual action that got fired off so
interesting what happened here is that
and this is sort of foundational to
redux is that every time that you run in
action or every time that you dispatch
an action every single reducer is going
to run every single reducer is going to
run in whether you choose to act on that
action or not is up to the reducer so
this reducer is going to run this
reducer is going to run and we need to
write some logic inside of this posts
that will say if it is one of the
actions that I'm actually interested in
in this case we're actually interested
in increment likes for the post one then
do something otherwise we're just going
to return state and nothing is going to
happen so I'll say that once more or
less pretty foundational every reducer
runs every time there is an action
whether something actually changes in
state is up to you and that's where
we're going to start writing a switch
statement in order to handle all of the
different action types but first before
we do that let's get something showing
up on the thing because I don't know
about you but I'm ready to actually view
some stuff this stuff takes a little bit
of setup to get going and I want to view
some actual pictures I want some pups I
want some
I don't know some fun photos showing up
here so that when we actually update any
of our data we're gonna actually see it
visually changing rather than having to
live in the console</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
