I'm a fourth-year urban planning student
at Ryerson University um I find it
deeply troubling that this committee and
administration has routinely admit
dismissed the input of torontonians
because they are not the right kind of
torontonian soliciting public
participation and then promptly
rejection it when it doesn't align with
your personal ideology is shamefully
partisan an affront to our democracy the
collective proposed cuts represent a
modest savings of approximately 100
million dollars which equal the revenue
eliminated by this administration in a
form of both the vehicle registration
tax and the inflationary tax increase
that was not approve this year Friday's
polls suggest that three-quarters of
Torontonians oppose your budgetary
proposals and service cuts as the mayor
for all of the city's residents we
expect you're listening in Toronto we
enjoy the lowest residential tax rate in
the GTA if we raise this tax rate to the
regional average we could invite avoid
this manufactured crisis as your
inspiring predecessor once said you
can't have a great city for free I take
issue with the proposed cuts to the arts
funding as you know TIFF received eight
hundred thousand dollars last year and
contributed 170 million dollars in local
economic activity I think even the
accounting department at deco labels
would approve of this arrangement I
understand that Six Sigma has become
required a reading for the executive
committee's book club it should be noted
that fortune magazine reported that
ninety-one percent of companies on the
SP exchange have trailed on the index
since implementing this questionable
strategy finally councilor Mammoliti who
I guess has departed from us you have
been asking for solutions this afternoon
I have a revenue based solution for you
road tolls and zone-based congestion
charges it is inappropriate to cut TTC
services will continue to subsidize
drivers in Toronto thank you thank you
very much
thank you sir Thanks thank you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
