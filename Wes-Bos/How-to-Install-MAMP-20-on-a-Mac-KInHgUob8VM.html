you a quick tutorial on how to install
MAMP on your Mac computer so map stands
for Mac App ashie mysql and PHP and
basically it's a way to get a web server
running on your local computer so you're
probably used to having a web server
somewhere online that you pay for and
somehow like ftp you might connect to it
that can be a bit of a pain because
every time you make a change upload the
file again so we do something called
local development and we we run a web
server on our computer which provides us
with all of the tools that we need to
run a web server on our computer without
having to upload the files all the time
so this is primarily for PHP
applications such as WordPress but it
can also be nice just to have a
first-rate HTML files so to download map
you go to map info and right off the bat
you'll see that there are two versions
of map there is the map normal and there
is mamp pro so when you download it
they're going to give you both they're
going to install both for you which is
kind of a pain unless you are a really
heavy developer you don't really need
the map pro if you if you start to see
that you need some of the features of it
you can go ahead and look into buying it
but for our purposes the regular version
of mamp has no real restrictions on us
and there's no trial period or anything
and it's totally free so what we want to
do is go ahead to the downloads page and
you'll see here it says ma'am payment
pro 2.1 point 1 and this is the version
that almost everyone is going to need it
supports versions of Mac OS 10.6 point 6
and above so if you have a older macbook
or macbook pro that's running you
haven't been able to upgrade your OS or
you're not able to you'll probably want
you'll have to download
older version of map and it can be a bit
of a pain because it won't tell you that
until you actually download it so the
way you can check is if you go to the
Apple in the top left corner of your
screen click about this mac it'll say
right under here version see I have ten
point seven point five the latest is
10.8 so if you have anything above ten
point six point six you're you're safe
to download map to if you have an older
version scroll to the bottom and you'll
see that we can download may up one
point nine point six point one right
here and then this supports pretty much
every major OS X operating system in the
last couple years and above there's no
real real difference for our purposes
between the two so don't worry if you
have to download an older version so go
ahead and click it as you can see I've
already started downloading it in my
corner here it's quite a big file so you
might want to go grab a snack or
something and wait for it to download
I've already downloaded it previous to
the screencast so I'm just going to go
ahead and quit it so when it's done
downloading you can unzip it in there
will be installer file just like any
other installation process of any
application you can just go ahead and
open it up and install it when you're
done if I go ahead and open up my
applications here you'll see that it is
installed two folders for you there's
ma'am and there's Matt pro it has
installed both versions for you because
it wants to kind of entice you with the
free version of Mayor Pro for like a
month or so but we want to want to click
on map and you'll see the icon right
here is ma'am so when you click that
will see that we have this dialog box
open up and the most important thing
that we want to look for here to make
sure that its installed and working
properly is that both of these lights
here apache server and mysql server are
both green
if one of them is red you can click stop
or start servers here and try give it a
shot to see if if you can get it started
so what we want to do here just to take
one more step further is click open
start page and just make sure that these
these are working just fine you'll see
here that we have this new address in
our address bar called localhost colon
8080 basically what that means is it's
it's kind of like a domain name for our
computer no one really outside of your
your computer can it can access this
it's just for you so if you were to type
in local host localhost 8888 it's going
to go ahead and just load a local server
for you on your computer so this is the
home page you want to also click PHP my
admin and just make sure that after a
couple seconds at this page loads for
you so your mind insulating just fine so
I'm in good shape the final thing we
want to do before we get started is
specify the directory where map is going
to go so when we visit localhost 8888
it's going to act like a dot-com but
it's going to pull the files from
somewhere on your computer and where
those files comes it comes from is
totally up to you so if we click on the
map icon once more and then click on
preferences you'll see that we have a
few tabs right here you want to click on
apache and we have an input box called
document root and basically this is says
it's asking us where do you like to keep
your websites on your computer so for my
my purposes I've I've just put
everything into my dropbox folder but
you may be more comfortable putting it
in your documents or sometimes Mac OS X
comes with a folder called sites so go
ahead and just click
and you can go ahead and click that from
I don't know from if you have something
on your desktop or I don't recommend it
maybe go to your thing and click on
sites that might be a good one to put it
in there and then wherever this path
goes to is where you should we should
then be putting all of your your folders
in so for example on ladies earning code
will have a wordpress folder you'll put
the wordpress folder right inside of my
Dropbox folder or inside of your site's
folder whatever you've specified here in
when we visit localhost 8888 forward
slash WordPress or whatever our folder
called it'll then it'll then pull us up
pull it up for us on the local server
past that we don't have anymore thanks
to set up a pretty straightforward so
let you know if you have any questions
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
