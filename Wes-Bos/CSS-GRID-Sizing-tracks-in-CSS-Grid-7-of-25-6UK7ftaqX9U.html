sizing our rows and our columns or
sizing our tracks in CSS grid in we're
gonna how that relates to the box model
so open up Oh seven sizing tracks and
they start or fall and we have here oh
I've got 15 different ones in here now
let's go ahead and make a bunch of
columns so say grid template columns and
so far we have been using pixels because
this sort of the easiest to understand
200 pixels 200 pixels give it a save you
see that we have that now what happens
if we use percentages because I know
that a lot of you will think like oh I
would like to be 25% 25% 25% 25% right
you all adds up 200% well now we start
to get that horizontal scroll and and
why is that well that's because we are
really doing 25 plus 25 plus 25 plus 25
plus 20 PX 20px 20 px in between so
we're really 60 pixels over and that's
what's causing that horizontal scroll so
it's not that great idea to use
percentages to add up to 100% don't get
me wrong you can always use percentages
to maybe take up half of something or
80% of something or a quarter of
something but if you're trying to do the
whole song and dance where you're trying
to add up your values and then subtract
your grade gap from it it's just going
to be a big headache so rather than
using percentages in most case we're
actually going to be using what's called
the fr unit and that's referred to as
the fractional unit so let's explain how
this actually works let's start off with
just two columns 200 pixels 200 pixels
and give that a save you'll notice that
you know let's put a plus about a big ol
border on our grid so border 10px solid
let's fire it up bar yellow so this is
our grid here which is the yellow but
we're not using all of it that's because
we've defined them in pixels so what
would be great is if we could just
evenly distribute each of the columns
and that's where the fr unit comes in
the a fractional unit what it does is
fractional units represent the amount of
space left after all the elements are
laid out so what happens is CSS grid
will first go and lay out all of the
columns that it needs to that have an
explicit width or an explicit height in
in terms of rows so what it will do is
it'll say 200 px and then 200 P X and if
I wanted to add a third column called
1fr what that's going to do is it's
going to say well this much is extra
here so I'm going to take up that much
so if I give that a save now you'll see
that that third column is now going to
take up however much room is left if I
were to increase this to 400 there's
going to be quite a bit less left and
1fr is going to stand for that
interesting okay good now let's bring it
back to just 200px now I just have one
column in lots of extra space if I were
to say one fr one fr each of these two
new columns are going to take up one
amount of the they're sort of going to
split it between them and they're each
going to be the same size
now if you've used a flex grow or a flex
rink value this works very similar to
that in that you can start to double up
these values so these aren't like pixels
or percentages or anything they're just
in proportion to how much free space is
left so if this one is to Fr this one is
going to take up twice as much of the
free space as this one so it does stand
for fractional units but I kind of like
the the idea of it it's standing for a
free space Fr so now we see that the two
fr is taking up twice the amount of free
space as that one now that's great
because what I will often do is instead
of using pixels at all if I just want to
split it up really evenly I'll just do
one fr and I'll just do that whoa
I'll do that a couple times over and
over one two three four and that will
give me four equal columns and again the
way that the browser is going to be
laying this out is that first it will
take away any any hard needs that it has
and in our case it needs to
take away sixty pixels because it has
twenty twenty and twenty in the grid gap
and then you've got a whole bunch of
space left and it will just evenly
distribute the values between all of
them let's look at how that would look
if we have grid template rows in our
case if I give that a save nothing
changed and why is that well by default
the height of a grid and this is very
similar to display block elements the
default height of an element is just
however high the contents are but the
default width of the element is as wide
as the actual viewport that we have I
have some margin on the body here so
things don't butt up right against the
browser so what could we do there well
you could you could put an explicit
height on the container so we could just
say height and also something like 600
px and now you'll see that because we
now have a hard height to our grid each
of them are going to take up the amount
and if I were to take the second one and
maybe make it 10 Fr you'll notice that
the second row is taking up 10 times the
amount of the free space as the rest of
them so if our units are extremely
helpful before you reach for percentages
and again let me let me show you you
could do 50% here and what that will do
is it'll first take 50% and then we have
some free units but do not try to add up
to a hundred percent rather try to reach
for your fr units in there similarly we
can also use pixels and REMS &amp;amp; M's and
any other unit that you used to but I
find myself primarily using REMS and FR
units in most cases the next thing I
want to talk to you about is the auto
keyword so let's get rid of the rows
here and let's get rid of all of our
columns and what's the difference if I
have auto in one fr I'll give it a save
you can see that auto will just adjust
to the max size of the content so right
now you can see that it's likely the 13
or the 15 whatever is the widest content
that is defining the width of this
column so far were to go into 3 and make
it something like West boss is cool
you'll see that the entire column
wider because that one element is
auto-sizing
that column what you might expect here
is that the one in the 5 and the 7 would
just be much smaller and only this one
would go wider and what we really need
to know here about CSS grid is that it's
a grid it's not going to just loosely
place itself a lot of times people think
that you can sort of do a Pinterest base
layout where everything's just fits into
each other and while that sorta is
possible we'll go into some examples in
in the future once we get into more
real-world stuff what you need to know
is that the auto keyword will just
automatically size it as far as you want
and we can mix and match that again if I
do Auto 1fr again they'll sort of just
go back and forth back and forth now
interesting so you see that these ones
are really small because the 13 is
deciding the width whereas this one is
pretty wide because the West boss is
cool is defining the width so that's
Auto in the fr unit let's see it in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
