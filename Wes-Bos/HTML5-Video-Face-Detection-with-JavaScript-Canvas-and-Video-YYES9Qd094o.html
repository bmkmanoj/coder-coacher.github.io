CCV javascript face detection library
and basically what this library does is
you take an image it spits it into a
canvas element and it is then able to
detect your face based on some crazy
mathematical stuff so for it to give you
an example of how they do it you feed it
just a URL I have here from Facebook you
click the TechEd it'll load it in and
it'll show you exactly where your face
is I thought this was pretty cool and
it's wondering if there's any way I
could get it to work with video so what
I've gone ahead and done is created an
HTML video html5 video element of just
myself talking and when I could play
it's going to take the frames and spit
them into a canvas element that's going
to run it through this library that
detects my face and then it's going to
overlay some silly glasses that I have
right here overtop of my face based on
where it's detecting my face to be so
let's just I'm doing this over YouTube
because it can be a little laggy if your
computer isn't as quick as some of them
so currently working on Firefox 6 and
Google Chrome latest build testing I'll
see my test video for html5 glasses move
closer back
see if that works and there you have it
it's tracking my face and overlaying the
image so you can see here this is just a
regular old canvas element so take a
look at the tutorial let me know if you
have any questions thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
