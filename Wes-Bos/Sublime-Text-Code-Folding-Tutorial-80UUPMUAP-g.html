in sublime text - in the most recent
stable version of sublime text - they
added the ability to do code folding
which is quite a requested feature for
sublime text so I'm just going to show
you how to use it
here I just have some just fake
JavaScript code that I've cooked up just
to show us how we can do it there's
going to be four things that I'm going
to show you first is just basic
selecting text and folding it so let's
say I want to just fold these a couple
lines of text you select it you hit
command option and right or sorry left
square bracket and that will fold it for
you to unfold it you hit command option
right square bracket if you're on
Windows I believe it is ctrl alt in the
two square brackets the toggle between
folding and unfolding one thing you want
to be careful with is unlike textmate
where you get the arrows where you can
nicely fold and unfold it so I'm
actually just like packs it into one
little character here so if you hit
backspace on that character all your
code is gone so just make sure that you
are aware of that and you don't actually
delete all your code another cool
feature in code folding is the village
to fold it by block level so we have
this function here and let's say I just
want to fold all of this stuff in here
this is a whole block right here so as I
put my cursor somewhere within the block
and hit the same keys command option
square bracket to fold it and that just
nicely tucks up in there you can go back
and forth that's kind of cool but let's
say I have multiple blocks like this 1 2
3 and I want to fold them all
as you can see they're all a
second-level block so we hit command K
and then command two for level two so
command K two and you'll see it just it
folds all three of them finally one
other thing that we have here in sublime
is the ability to fold attributes of
elements when you're using HTML as you
can see this is my wordpress blog it can
get a little class heavy same thing when
you're working with something like
jQuery UI or you of Aria attributes all
you have to do is hit command K command
T and it will nicely tuck away all of
the tributes of all your elements to
show them all again hit command K
command 0 and it shows them all actually
should note that too when you're in any
other one command K command 0 will
unfold everything so that's that code
folding check the tutorial for all the
examples in text and let me go to any
questions thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
