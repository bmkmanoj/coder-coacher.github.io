sequencing detection and that means when
someone inputs a certain sequence of
keys into your window or into an input
or something like that then something
needs to happen and what does is use
most for online is the Konami code which
is if you grew up in the 80s or 90s
you'll know that you can type in up up
down down left right left right B a
start and what that will do is it will
trigger like unlimited lives in Mario or
something like that so I figured out
that buzzfeed of all websites has a
Konami code if you go to the website and
press up up down down left right left
right BA enter and it just changes all
the words to will key I'm not sure what
that is but it's it's pretty funny
different websites have little Easter
eggs that you can surface so let's see
how that works will go into our script
tag and we will listen for the window
add eventlistener you're gonna listen
for the key up event and when that
happens we are going to run a function
here which we're going to going to
consult log event key and that's going
to tell us the name of the key that they
have pressed so if I press up its arrow
up I down arrow down a SD f you get the
point right here so now what we need to
do is whenever someone presses one of
these items we're going to push it into
an array so we're going to first make a
pressed array and then we also need to
look what is it that we're looking for
so in case cons secret code equals in
our case I'm just going to look for the
word West boss now we go into here and
we will say pressed dot push a key and
let's just call it log press alright so
see what's happening whenever I type
something we get the specific key
whatever is pressed into that array now
that's great and it makes sense but that
could get fairly big and that is
essentially a keylogger
or you're logging everything the person
has logged so what we want to do is just
trim this array to be the maximum that
we would ever need
and in our case if we're just looking
for the word West boss then we are
maximum looking for six characters so
it's gonna splice that real quickly
we're gonna say pressed dot splice now
we want to start from counting from the
back because if I let me refresh this I
say West boss I guess I got to type it
up here West boss is cool if I want to
grab like say like I'm looking for is
cool what we want to do is we want to
start from the end and go into forward
we don't want to start from the start
and and go in so the way that we do that
is we use negative secret code dot
length minus one and that's going to if
I'm looking for six letters that's going
to go to the from the back up seven
letters and then we're going to trim
from there which is going to be the
pressed dot length so this is a length
of the array - a secret code dot length
and that will give us the exact number
that we need now if i refresh when we
say wes is cool you see as I start to
get over that budget of six letters it
starts to push out the first ones that
were pushed so I could keep typing last
boss at that point it says West boss but
if I type I the W gets pushed out into
the array now all that's left is we need
to check if this array contains the
secret code that we are looking for so
we say if pressed dot join is that we
want to turn it into a string really
quickly and that's I'll show you what
that does that will make it into a
string so if press dot join which is a
string dot includes the secret code then
we can do things that console.log
dingding that you did it so W e SB o s
and there we go ding ding it includes
what we're looking for and at that point
we can do some fun stuff so way back
there was this thing called cornified j
s and i'll show you what it does there
is a function called corn
if i underscore add and when you run it
was boss woo it adds unicorns or
rainbows or random stuff to the screen
so if I do it again it's gonna add
another one another one another one
another one you get the point right
we're just adding hilarious different
unicorns at random and all you have to
do is call this quantify add so that's
it that's the basics of getting up a key
sequencing detection store them in array
and then check every single time that
they key up if it matches what you're
looking
