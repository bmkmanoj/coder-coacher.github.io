function ones that we have here and
let's do a quick little grid where we
have four columns so how I would
normally do that is something like grid
template columns 1fr four times and that
gives us oh I forgot one four there we
go that gives us four columns each 20
pixels spaced apart now what I could do
instead of that is instead of writing
one fr4 times I just type the repeat
function and the function takes two
things first how many times you want to
repeat it for and what you would like to
repeat one if R and that gives us the
exact same thing what's neat about this
is you can actually pass it something
like to Fr and this is going to give us
eight columns and then it's going to
alternate between one fr to Fr one of
our to Fr right because you have it just
takes whatever you have right here and
multiplies it by four so you could also
maybe throw like an auto in here and
that will just auto size the columns
based on their content you can also just
mix and match it with values that you
pass in here so if maybe I want to start
over the hundred pixels and end it with
200 pixels and then inside of it I just
want to repeat this one fr twice and
then Auto twice you'll see that we have
one two three four five six columns
being added and of course you can add
more repeats on here as well maybe I
want to end it off with a repeat of five
fr and that will give us all kinds of
columns so the repeat function can
really just be used anywhere inside of
your grid template columns or a grid
template rows to just cut down on the
amount of typing that we need to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
