West boss here I am super excited to
teach you Redux now before we get
started I want to show you first what
we're actually going to be making and
second what tooling you need in place
before we get going now this is the
application called Redux to Graham and
as you may have noticed it looks very
similar to Instagram and it's got
everything that you might expect from it
you got photos you've got your captions
you've got your hearts the ability to
like it you the ability to go through
your comments you can add a comment and
it'll add it you can go ahead and delete
them everything that you would expect
now this is totally built on react react
router and all of the data that we have
in here and all the actions when I'm
liking in adding a comment and deleting
those are all part of our Redux store so
a pretty cool app get used to seeing
some photos of cute pups and pancakes
because you're going to be looking at it
for a while um what do you need before
you get started well first of all you
need to know react
this is assumes that you have pretty
good knowledge of reactant and how to
use it as well as pretty good knowledge
of es6 so if you are a little bit shaky
in either of those areas definitely
recommend that you brush up on react
first I obviously have a course it's
called react for beginners and this is
sort of a continuation of this course
where we're not building the same
application but it's for anyone who has
taken the react fundamentals and just
nailed how react works and then you're
able to move on and say what's next Wes
what should I be learning next so check
out react for beginners if you are
looking for a prerequisite to this
course what else do we need we need the
react dev tools this is going to help us
debug and look at state and props and
all that good stuff so go ahead and
install that to your browser and then we
also need the redux dev tools and this
is this is really cool it's going to
allow us to replay different things and
be able to toggle off and on actions and
really just time travel through our
application to to go through it at the
time we're recording redux dev tools is
only available for chrome as an
extension there is a way to get
up and running with a firefox or another
browser but the way I'm using in this
course is assumes a Chrome extension and
then finally you need nodejs and if you
didn't been doing any sort of react so
far you need to make sure that you have
that installed make sure that you have
at least version 5 point something
installed sometimes you'll get errors
when you're trying to run some of this
tool here and often it's because you
aren't upgraded to latest version of
node so with that let's get started we
need to go ahead and install all of our
dependencies so what you need to do to
get started is take the starter files
that you'll find up on github and take
the first directory and rename it to
learn - Redux or whatever the folder
that you're going to be working from and
this is going to be your home base for
the whole tutorial now if you get lost
anywhere along the stages you can always
restore I'm going to give you the files
at every single video but this is going
to be your home base for where you want
to work now there's a package.json file
in there when we go ahead and type NPM
install and that's going to go ahead and
fetch all the dependencies that we need
in order to get everything up and
running while that installs I'll tell
you a little bit about the tooling that
we're using here so we are using es6
modules and in order to bundle those all
into a single javascript file we are
using webpack now I'm not going to go
too much into how web pack works because
that's an entire video series on its own
but essentially if we open up our
package JSON file you'll see that there
is a NPM start and what that will do is
it runs this thing called dev server j/s
and that in turn is going to go ahead
and compile all of our JavaScript it's
going to start up a little Express
server for us and we're going to be able
to see something like this it's going to
give us localhost seven seven seven zero
and that will allow us to see what we're
building in real time when you deploy it
there are other ones for NPM build and
that's going to go ahead and build you a
static file that you can then put up on
your server but in order for us to have
hot reloading and library loading and
all that good stuff we're
we make our edits on the left here and
we're going to immediately say them as
see them as soon as we click Save
we're going to be using this so all of
that to say don't worry too too much
about what's going on in here but how do
we start it up we go to our terminal
once everything has gone ahead and
installed for us and you simply just
type NPM start and that's going to go
ahead and run it up it's going to
compile our bundle with webpack there
and then most importantly is that it's
going to tell us that it's available at
localhost colon seven seven seven zero
and a little trick if you're using I
term or anything on the Mac you can hold
down your command key and just click
that and that will immediately open it
on up when you open it up you should see
nothing and that's because we actually
have to write the code ourselves so I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
