markdown this is a quick and easy course
for anyone who wants to become better
with the tools that they use to write
markdown is a fantastic language that we
use to write both HTML and formatted
text it's easy to read just by itself as
well as it converts to HTML so we can
put it on the web whether you're just
taking notes communicating on something
like github reddit or email or if you're
writing an entire book I think that
markdown is the best language anytime
that you are writing something into your
computer markdown is the best way to
write it so with the series is going to
do is we're gonna start off by showing
you a couple tools that you can use to
write down I'm gonna show you my prefer
preferred workflow for working with
markdown and then I'm gonna go into each
of the different points of markdown in
in just an hour or so your going to be
up and running now let's talk about
tooling the best tool to write markdown
is in the editor in which you are
already comfortable in so if you're a
web developer you probably already
comfortable in sublime text or atom or
vim or whatever the editor is and I
suggest that that's where you write your
markdown we're gonna look at some of
these markdown viewers in just a second
but it's my opinion that don't get
another editor to go ahead and write
markdown in why not just write it right
in the editor that you're comfortable if
that allows you to use your snippets
that you're used to it'll allow you to
use all of the line bubbling in all of
your variable bumping and anything that
you're used to in programming it will
also work inside of your markdown I find
that this becomes really efficient
regardless of if I'm writing technical
material or not so I'm using sublime
text here but I'm gonna show you some
couple packages in sublime text markdown
editing is by far the best package you
can get and when you install it it's
going to enable all kinds of really nice
syntax highlighting for you as well as
it comes with a really nice theme out of
the box as well as some really nice code
highlighting and all kinds of stuff and
some snippets and keyboard shortcuts and
and you name it so if you're using
sublime text get mark
down editing installed in when you go
ahead and edit your markdown make sure
that in the bottom right hand corner it
says markdown gfm or multi markdown
those are two different kinds of
markdown that you can write they're
pretty much the same a couple
differences I prefer gfm and that stands
for github flavored markdown multi
markdown is just another flavor of it
and they are again they're pretty much
the same now let me go on open this on
Adam we have one called markdown writer
which will really help you out with all
kinds of different tools and a nice
color scheme that will help you out and
there's one called vim markdown for all
of you vim users so give those tools a
look and see what will work out for you
um when you're in sublime text what will
actually happen is by default it won't
use your regular color scheme and the
reason that is is because it comes with
this really nice one called markdown
editor TM theme and if you take a look
here look at this this is actually a
really nice way to write so if you're
looking for a light theme I definitely
recommend sticking with the one that
they have but I also I run a theme
called cobalt 2 and I'm a huge markdown
writer so I went ahead and made sure
that my theme also has all these great
things that come in it and I'm preferred
a darker theme so all the stuff like the
bolding and the indentation of the block
quotes and whatnot shows up as well the
way that you would change it if by
default it's going to show you this gray
one you need to go into sublime text
preferences package settings and you
find the one that says markdown editing
and gfm settings - user you open that up
and you can be able to go and edit
everything in here there's a whole bunch
of other settings in here you can also
see a listing of all the possible
settings but going back to markdown
editing gfm default and you can see like
some really good padding and whatnot
because this isn't code that we're using
this is just this is text so it might be
a little bit different so I'm going to
keep mine with cobalt - for this video
series but feel free
to go to any other ones now um viewing
your markdown once you go ahead and I've
written some markdown here we got some
nice syntax highlighting and on the
right here I've got an app called marked
and this is how I write all of my
markdown essentially like when I'm
writing it I actually don't have it open
at all I just have it either fullscreen
or in one of the panes on my editor and
I just write as they go and that's one
of the beauties of markdown because you
don't need to be able to view it in HTML
as you're right because the syntax is so
and the highlighting is so that you can
read it and you can understand what each
of these things are as you're writing
and however if you want to be able to
see it as you write it you can open up
an app like marked in on the right-hand
side as soon as you make an edit to
something and click Save or command s
it's going to immediately update it in a
little tick here to show where you last
edited the last thing and that's pretty
cool because you can go ahead and edit
it if you're trying to see visually what
it looks like or you're trying to read
it over you can see it go on the
right-hand side so that is called marked
- it is a paid app it's ten bucks but
well worth your money
when you are writing markdown for any
number of hours each day we also have an
app called Mao or moom not exactly sure
how to say it
and it's got some really nice things for
you because what you can do is you can
select your things you can hit your like
regular keyboard shortcuts I know this
is probably great for someone who's used
to using like a Microsoft Word or
something where you want to hit command
B to bold something you want to hit
command-i to make something Italian
it also comes along with some this
really nice thing where you as you
scroll it will also scroll the the text
along with it just sort of show you what
you're doing here it will have live
updating as well and it's got some
really nice syntax highlighting here as
well so I know people are huge fans of
this app as well there's another app
called multi markdown as well not
something I've ever used before but I
know people are pretty passionate about
it as well so give those tools a shot
and really just see what works well with
your workflow and always be changing
tools always be second guessing to see
if if your workflow is the best what I'm
showing you here is really just what I
use and that's not necessarily what you
should be using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
