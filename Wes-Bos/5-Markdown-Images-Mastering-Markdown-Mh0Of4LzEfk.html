exactly the same as links there's just a
few things that you need to know about
it so the format for is bang square
brackets parenthesis and then the bang
says that it's an image the square
brackets are the alternate text that is
going to show up to your screen reader
users as well as two search engines and
in the parentheses is where the link to
your image will go so I'm gonna take
this image and put it in here then I
have maybe like wow great pic give it a
save and you'll notice that it shows up
if I hover over top actually it's not
going to show up if I hover over top
because alternate text doesn't show up
if you actually wanted the tooltip to
show up that's a title and you can go
ahead and say this is the tooltip in
there just like we did with the links
and if I have our top of this now it
shows up this is the tooltip so again
bang is for images square brackets are
for the alternate text of that image and
you can feel free to leave that empty if
you don't actually have an alternate
text but don't give the middle finger to
your blind users and then your link to
the actual thing now a couple other
things that we can do it with is we can
say if we have a bang square bracket and
then another set of square brackets to
maybe like a cute pup I think this one
is a pup and we will say pup and just
like we did with the links we can go
ahead and say pup is equal to that now
give it a save you'll notice that the
pup shows up here even though that this
is the actual link like if I said pup
fix give it a save and put like the pup
all the way at the bottom give it a save
you notice that it still shows up and
anywhere I wanted to reference the pup I
would just have to use the square
bracket that we had in there another
thing that people often want to do is
make a link link to a larger version of
that photo so let's take this one right
here and I'm just gonna go ahead and say
maybe this is the large version the 500
pixels by 500 pixels version so I'm
going to go ahead and make a link
and paste it in there and if I said a
link in text you know that it will link
off to it however if I want to make
maybe a 50/50 mix Allah by 50 pixel
aversion of it I can go inside of here
and just do my nested mark down square
bracket parentheses paste that in there
and then change this out to be 50 px and
now when I hover over top of that it
will link to the larger version I can
click it and it will open it up in my
browser it's a little bit of a funky
syntax another thing you can do if you
don't like that is you can just go ahead
and use the image source that you're
used to and whoa there we go and that
won't work as well so that's one little
thing about markdown is that when you
don't have something that you can't or
when you can't do something in markdown
you can just write regular HTML in its
place and everything will work as it
planned same thing goes for width and
height there is no width and height if
you want to control the width and the
height you just need to use a regular ol
image tag with the link to your dog jpg
and you have to give it a width 500 and
a height of 500 in there if you are okay
with resizing it in CSS you can also
just pop a style tag in there and say
width:200px and that will apply assuming
that your markdown that gets output will
also resize it for you so you can put a
style tag pretty much anywhere you want
in this won't work on github and forms
and things like that but if you're
writing like a blog post or something
like that you can expect your CSS to be
applied to your markdown as it's
generated same thing goes for a fig
figure tag or you have a fig caption
caption tag you can't do figure in
figcaption in markdown so you would have
to write the regular old HTML that
you're used to for that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
