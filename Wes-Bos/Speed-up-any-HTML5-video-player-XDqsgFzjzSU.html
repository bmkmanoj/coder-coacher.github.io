for you today on speeding up html5 video
so often when I watch tutorials and
stuff online what happens is that I want
to speed it up 1x is just a little bit
too slow for me so YouTube's got this
great little speed bar here that we can
speed things up for you which is great I
find that I like to watch video
tutorials in 1.5 or 2x which helps me
get through them a lot quicker however
often I just stumbled upon this one and
this is just your regular html5 video
player and there's no like way to
actually speed it up however it's
totally doable with within Chrome or
Firefox or any browser really that
supports the html5 video so the way that
we do it is you right click inspect
element and you're gonna open up your
dev tools this is very similar if you're
using Firefox you want to make sure that
you're actually clicking on the video
element here
so once you've clicked on that go ahead
and click on your console tab and if we
type dollar sign 0 and hit enter you'll
see that dal times 0 is short form in
dev tools for the currently selected
element so that's why it's important
that we actually clicked it there so
dollar signs zero but if you type dot
playback rate with a capital R on right
there and hit enter you'll see that it
returns 1 and that means that it's just
regular speed so I go ahead and play
that and it's a regular speed but if we
say playback rate equals to hit enter
now when I play it it will be twice as
fast so that's two you can go to point
five you can go one point five you can
bring back to one if you're normal and
that just gives you a way to control how
fast html5 video goes so this works with
any html5 video so I'm just here on my
fizzell dashboard checking out some
videos let me open one up here so they
have a just a different player here but
it's still an html5 video because if I
or you can't right click on this but you
if you use your dev tools shortcut to
open that up
and make sure that you've clicked on the
video I'm just gonna play it in the
background do dollar sign zero playback
rate equals to hit enter it sounds a
little bit like a chipmunk but it speeds
it up so hopefully that will help you
out when you want to speed up videos
rather than having to download them
first and use something like VLC to
speed you up
thanks a lot back to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
