implement a your own customs @sh theme
as well as do some of these cool things
like get these icons in your prom so
what's that SH we have these things
called themes or some people like to
call them prompt and it's essentially
when you hit enter or when you do
something like touch index or touch
about die HTML it changes and it gives
you a little bit of information about
anything really it generally people like
to know where you are
what branch you're on if you're get a
repo is dirty or not and there's a whole
listing of themes on the zsh wiki so if
you go to the oh my zsh github you go to
wiki and they have all kinds of themes I
think it's right here yep this is a
listing of all the different themes so
let's just take kind of a quick look at
what some people are doing so some
people like to show their current
directory show the branch a little
asterisk depending on the state of the
github repo again this guy's like some
people like to put the machine that
they're on so a lots of times people use
that Sh on multiple different servers so
it's important to know which machine am
I actually running this command on if
I'm trying to remove files I want to
make sure that I'm actually on the the
development server not the production
server so they like to put them the
server the machine name in there what
other kinds of stuff do we have here
again lots of get master some people who
work in Ruby like to know exactly what
version of Ruby they're running in
sometimes they switch around in
different versions of Ruby some simple
ones this is kind of what I have master
green checkmark means is nice and clean
or ruby some people have a nice little
time stamp again this is the username
the actual machine all kinds of cool
stuff that you can add to your prompt
and it's just helpful information to
your workflow that you like to use so
how do we actually get some of these
themes into our thing
before we do that we need to actually do
a quick information about something
called dot files so all of your settings
for zetas h are saved in a dot file and
that dot file lives in your home
directory so if you've never used
terminal to go to your home directory
your home directory is simply just tilde
so if you hit tilde or CD tilde you can
actually was that as a CH you can just
type tilde and it will put you there
that's another screencast and that's
your home directory and I'll have all of
your information in it just going to
jump back in your home directory lives a
file called dot z SH RC and that holds
all of the settings the reason that you
may not have seen files like this is by
default most computers hide files that
start with a dot so in order for us to
get to it we actually need to open it
via the command line so let's go ahead
and open that file with whatever our
favorite editor is if you have sublime
text you can do supple will do tilde
which is our home directory
forward slash and then we just want the
actual file so usually be like dog jpg
but in this case it's just simply dot
CETIS HRC now what that will do is let
me drag it over here opens up our Zenoss
HRC file if you don't have that sub
welcome and installed on your computer
you can either just break for a second
and make sure you have it we've got
other videos on that or you can just do
the open that'ss HRC and what that will
do is it will just open it up in notepad
it's not as nice because it's not syntax
highlighted for you so I don't I don't
like it but you can do it that way as
well so ours is H theme you've got all
kinds of different settings in here I've
got
stuff and explain exactly what all this
stuff is in in a future video but the
one line we want to look for is the zsh
honor score theme equals and this is
where we're able to set the name of the
theme
so let's actually just start with a
random so I'm going to take cobalt 2
ouch and type a random and give it a
save and random will load a random theme
every time we start up our editor so in
order to have it work if I hit enter
nothing happens
one easy ways you just open up a new tab
and you can see right away I've just got
a brand new West boss at W b2b is my
computer name actually have a 2 in there
for some reason and I mean my Dropbox
folder if I open up another tab it
actually gives me another one kind of a
cool little timestamp etc etc another
way that we can do this is something
called source so this instance of zah
doesn't know that we made a change to
our Zetas HRC file so if we source it
then it will change make all of those
changes for us so we can just type
source and then again we go to that path
home directory for zsh RC and
essentially I'll kind of just do the
same thing as us opening up a new tab it
just starts a brand new instance of zsh
RC so I can close these guys down but I
run that a couple times you can see
don't pay attention to this this is just
for me understanding what version of
Ruby when I start it up if I run it
again you can see I've got this it's got
a timestamp every single time I've got
kind of like that happy face a random
theme this one's pretty simple it just
tells you where you are you get the
point right you're able to set a random
theme on every single one but what if
you find
theme they actually do like and you want
to have that set so how we do that is we
look at the available themes and we're
eight we can go ahead and set it right
here so what are the available themes
you could look at this themes one
however it's actually pretty out of date
you can notice there's a whole bunch of
broken images so it's a lot of these
screenshots aren't great quality so I'd
probably would take a quick look at it
but don't think these are the only ones
available so what you can do is open up
the themes directory for zsh so we can
type open and tilde is our home
directory
forward slash and rather than typing dot
Z shrc we just open a folder that's
called dot o and then if you hit tab
just type dot o and hit tab and it
should complete two dot o - my is that
Sh so if I open that up you can see that
this is my oh my Zetas say two folder
and there's all kinds of little goodies
in here including a themes directory so
these are all the themes that come with
Sh there's thousands and thousands more
on github if you find one that you like
and it's not in here you can just pop it
right into this directory for example my
cobalt two is not doesn't come with that
Sh I made it myself
however it's on github so you just
download it pop it in your themes
directory and you'll be able to set it
so let's take a look
agnostic on so I'm just going to copy
that one go back in here paste it in
give it a save we'll do the whole source
is SH our theme see again and I am able
to have all of my kind of layout so this
is actually similar to the one that I
use however you probably get these weird
little characters and it's not working
so when you want the checkmark or when
you want the cool arrows or when you
want something that isn't available
for you and you see these weird little
icons you need to install something
called power line fonts so if you do a
quick search for power line fonts github
you should see github calm for Tosh
power line four slash fonts and
essentially what these are is a list of
all of the fonts that you may use for
your terminal so look for your favorite
font that you use and they have been
patched to include the special
characters for my for these in this case
it's arrows it may be a check mark it
may be a smiley face whatever it is it
needs to be able to have this special
font in order to display the arrows
otherwise you're going to get weird
characters like this so what we would do
here is just go I'm a big friend big fan
of in console lotta you would download
in console a lotta for power line click
raw and it's going to go ahead and
download that open it up I already have
this installed so I'm not going to
install it but you would click install
then we would head back to our
preferences in in our I term and click
on text click change font and in here
what you do is just find the font that
you want in this case I'm using Menlo
for pilot power line and I have that set
up for my cobalt too but you would find
the power line font that you installed
and make sure that you click on that one
and get out of here and it should say
Menlo regular for power line and counts
a lotta regular for power line whatever
whatever for power lines so make sure
that you have the patched version of the
power line font installed and then you
will start to see the cool characters
show up if you're just using the regular
Menlo or the regular and console lotta
on here you're going to get issues with
this
showing up and that's one of the most
common thing I get questions about
people say hey I'm not sure how to get
this kind of cool prompt I see these
weird characters so again install the
font and make sure that your terminal is
using that font so I'm just going to
change my back to Cobalt to do a quick
source oh that's another little tip if
you want to if you just type something
recently just hit your up arrow and hear
your up arrow again until you find what
you wanted hit enter it's going to open
up and you can see that I'm I'm back in
my place here I've got my cool little
arrows here if I change into the car
command line directory you see that this
is a little branch symbol for github
this is a little plus/minus right here
for my git and I'm able to see the
information on that so hopefully that
gives you information on how to get a
custom prompt a custom theme in addition
to using the custom layout for I term in
the next video we'll take a look at some
of the things you can do with Zetas sage
so things like tab completions and some
of the plugins and and really dive into
what are the real benefits over a
regular bash shell thanks see you then I
hope you enjoyed that make sure you
