show you how to install a wordpress blog
on your website in just a matter of
minutes so by default you usually go to
wordpress.org in you go ahead and
download WordPress and it gives you this
just package of code and while that
might be great for developers it's not
entirely intuitive for people who are
just looking to get up their own
wordpress blog so if you want to make
your own totally customizable blog or
website and have all the great things
like plugins and themes in mobile ready
I'm going to show you how to do that in
just a matter of minutes so first thing
I need to do is to get some hosting
setup so my absolute favorite wordpress
hosting is called bluehost and you can
access that if you want the discounted
price because he has cross out here you
can visit West boss com forward slash
blue host or just click the link in this
video description so once you're on this
page I want ahead go ahead and click get
started now and this is where we check
to see if your domain name you calm your
don't work or whatever you're looking to
do is available so I'm going to go ahead
and type Wes boss blog check if it's
available if it's available it will go
to the next steps there we go if it's
not it'll make some suggestions for you
so this is the part where we can go
ahead and sign up so I'm going to
autofill that in there and this is the
account plan here it's cheaper if you
sign up for 36 months definitely
recommend it however there is a cheaper
option if you just want to go one one
month at a time we've got a couple check
boxes here which sometimes people get a
little distracted by you don't need any
of them unless you're you're
specifically looking for one of these
services but go ahead and uncheck them
credit card info down here and go ahead
and click on the next button I'm not
going to go through this just because I
already have my own hosting setup but
you click Next and it's going to email
you a username and password so from our
next steps there we just go to Bluehost
com
and click on the login button in the top
right hand corner what this is going to
do is it's going to prompt you for your
username and password that they sent you
in an email sometimes they give you an
ad here don't worry about that just
click the home button right here and
this is what we call air Bluehost main
page or kind of the cPanel main page and
from here we're able to do pretty much
anything with our website you may
eventually get into things like setting
up email or adding a more domain names
on or uploading your own files but for
now we're going to focus on installing
WordPress so to do it really clearly
quickly we go ahead and go to website
click install WordPress and what this is
going to do it's going to load up the
mojo script loader and this is pretty
pretty new to Bluehost a lot of the
videos you see out there are with the
old script loader so I wanted to do one
to show you how to use this so it says
we've got WordPress here go ahead and
click install and now it's going to ask
us where do we want to install WordPress
to so like what will the domain name be
so if you click from this drop-down you
probably right now only have one domain
in this list because you've only signed
up with one domain so go ahead and click
that domain name I'm going to go ahead
and go on boss type com that's kind of
my main company domain name and then in
the directory if you want to just go to
boss type com or west boss blog or
whatever com you don't need to put
anything into this directory however
maybe you want to put it in forward
slash blog or a forward slash website or
forward slash temp if you're just
building it so I'm actually going to
install it 24 / blog so click check
domain it's going to check to make sure
you don't actually have any other files
there or anything like that so we'll
just give that a second
there we go now here is kind of where
the important part comes in is you can
click install now but we want to tweak
it just a little bit so click show
advanced settings and here's kind of the
settings for your website so my site
name West boss blog admin username oh
it's really important to set something
you're going to remember here it likes
to use your email by default which is
great I'll leave that and then your
admin password make sure you set that to
something that is really secure as
WordPress is susceptible to people
trying to login with commonly used
passwords so great I'm just going to
make sure I copy that password there
click I have read the Terms and
Conditions if you want to give that a
read go ahead click install now and this
will take probably a minute or so you
can see right at the top here high five
your process is underway browser
marketplace will you wait so it's
installing WordPress right now and it's
going to try to sell us some wordpress
themes and whatnot so here they sell
some really really nice-looking
wordpress theme if you're not a web
developer you may want to look into them
however i definitely recommend checking
out some of the free ones as well before
you drop down any more money on that so
i'm going to say no thanks i'm a web
designer and i'm just going to wait here
well it goes oh it looks like it already
finished fully done so when we are done
that you can click on either view
processes or go to your main page and
click my installs and it looks like it's
set up it set it up properly on boss
type com four slash blog let me open
that up there we go you can see it's
logged in it's it's set up totally
properly on forward slash blog and it's
already put some default content
and what not in there so to log into a
wordpress site the URL to login is just
go to your url bar and type WP dash
admin and it's going to prompt you for
your username and password so let's see
what we did before there if you ever
forget this you can click lost your
password and it will send it to you so
click login there we go now i'm totally
logged in wordpress is set up from here
you can kind of have a little play
around with some of the features of
wordpress if you've never used wordpress
before it's it it's another video but
we've got posts here you can see there's
a default post that you can edit we've
got pages where you can add pages to
your website what you're probably
looking for is the appearance now the
appearance is a total customization of
your themes so WordPress comes with
three themes by default you can click
customize on the one that's already
activated and you've got all kinds of
really great options here is you can
change your site title the tagline you
can change the colors that are being
used maybe I like to use a little bit of
green change the background color you
can change the header image upload it
background image all kinds of stuff for
it when you're done go ahead and click
Save and publish close this down and if
i go to my wordpress blog on the front
end you'll see that those changes have
already been reflected so now there's
also an option to add new themes here
which will is really great because you
can search around for some popular
themes hover over them click install
and you are off to the races i just
clicked activate there and now when i
refresh this I've got a totally
different theme on my blog so hopefully
that was a really good introduction to
you remember to use the URL below to get
discounted Bluehost hosting and let me
know if you have any questions thanks a
lot see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
