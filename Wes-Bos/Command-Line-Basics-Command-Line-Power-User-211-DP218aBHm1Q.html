the cools that Sh stuff we need to know
a little bit about terminal basics that
is some basic commands that allow us to
move around create delete files on our
system so if you are already comfortable
with doing things like moving around
directories creating files changing
directories and feel free to just skip
this video and move on to the next one
this is just for people who are pretty
new to the terminal and might not know
about all the commands so let's get
started um what I've done here is I've
just actually opened up my terminal
window it actually might look a little
something like this for you it's just
green in black it might be just white in
black depends if you're on Windows or
Mac or or something like that so the
first command we need to type in is
called PWD and that stands for present
working directory because when we open
up a bash window here this is
essentially us moving through our file
system and when you open it up you
generally just get this dollar sign or
maybe an angle bracket or something and
we call that your prompt and it expects
you to know exactly what you want to
type in so first thing I always want to
know is like where actually am I in this
machine so PWD and it returns for sauce
users for slash West boss so that means
I'm in my users folder and then I'm in
my forward slash West boss folder so
that's great but I'm actually going to
work out of my Dropbox today so I need
to go into my Dropbox folder so the
command that we use for that is CD it
stands for change directory so say CD
and go ahead and type in Dropbox this is
case sensetive when we move into Zetas H
we will look at ways around that it's
really nice but right now we're just in
bash so we need to use case n so so CD
enter nothing actually happens it just
gives us another fresh prompt here so
but if we type in PWD again you'll see
that I'm in my Dropbox folder great well
now I actually
want to go ahead and make a folder to do
our stuff in today so I'm going to type
a new command called make directory it's
mkdir make dirt and I'm going to call it
command line so man line good now if we
type PWD again we're still in Dropbox so
this is something a lot of newbies
accidentally do is they assume that
since they made the directory they were
actually in the director and we're not
so we do again CD command line and then
if we type PWD you can see that we are
clearly in the command line so now what
we can do is I actually don't like it
when I have a lot of my history on the
screen I find it to be pretty
distracting so if you ever want to clear
things out you can just hold down your
command key and hit K on others I think
it's control and hit K and that will
just clear it so think of clear with a K
it'll clear out everything else that you
did previously so now I want to say just
double check where are we good we're in
the command line we want to list the
files are eight that are in this
directory so we use the LS and you type
dash L after it you can just type LS as
well or eyelash ALG
and when we type that nothing happens
and that's because this folder is
totally empty so we need a way to
actually start making things so let's go
ahead and make another directory so make
sure let's call it CSS so CSS now if we
type LS a shell you'll see that it says
a whole bunch of stuff westballz staff
December 11 etcetera etc
oh sorry December at 11:02 that's a time
right now and this is the directory name
if we type LS you actually just get a
short form of that the - alla means long
and it just gives us all the information
that is associated with that
so now we actually want to make some
files so let's say we want our index
so we'll say touch touches the ability
to create
file so touch index.html again let's do
LS look move that CSS folder
we've got index.html right now you can't
tell is this a folder is this a file the
only way you can really tell us there's
a extension on it with status H we're
gonna have some color coding now so we
know what's a folder and what's a file
let's say I wanted to create my style
dot CSS I need to go into the CSS
directory so I'll do CD CSS type PWD
again make sure we're there good we're
in the command line directory but we're
in a child directory called CSS and
again we can just say touch style dot
CSS there we go with type LS you see
style dot CSS we don't see a CSS
directory or index that's because we're
in a child child directory right now so
if we want to go one level up how do we
do that we can just use CD and a short
form just dot dot and you probably know
this from CSS or HTML and when you want
to go a directory up you just type dot
so CD dot then we type PWD again and we
are back in the command line one some
other commands that we have are we have
RM which is removed and I could just go
ahead and remove the index.html if I
wanted I'm not going to do that so I'm
going to need it later
I actually recommend not using RM we're
going to go into something called trash
in the future RM is a final delete so if
you actually accidentally RM a file that
you shouldn't have or some guys
accidentally do RM something like a star
or a Tildy or something like that and it
just deletes their entire hard drive so
I'm not even comfortable typing RM in
right here because it doesn't go into
your trash it just deletes it forever so
we're gonna look at a little utility
called trash which will allow you to
actually put it in the trash and get it
back if you want or your recycling bin
if you're on Windows so that's some
terminal
basics play around with that make sure
you're comfortable because we're going
to be moving around quite a bit in these
tutorials and that's it and I'll see you
in the next video
