show you guys how to use animate CSS if
you haven't heard of it animate dot CSS
is this great library that takes care of
all the messy key framing that's
involved in creating animations like a
flash or rubber band or something like
swing so it's just great library that
you can just pop into your website and
you're able to pretty much add
animations within a number of seconds so
to get it up and running all you need to
do is click on download animate dot CSS
and then include it into your project
via a regular stylesheet link so I've
done that right here for the purposes of
this exercise what I've done here is
I've just set up a very simple HTML
document have loaded in animate CSS I've
got ourselves a link of the class of
button and then I've got an input that
we're going to shake in just a second
then I've got some very basic style none
of this has anything to do with the
actual animation is simply just to set
it up so it looks a little bit something
like this then I'm loading myself in
latest version of jQuery just so that
when we get to adding it with jQuery
we'll be able to do so so very basic use
of using animate CSS is simply just
adding CSS class names so you don't even
need to be using jQuery if you really
want the base use the way that works is
you first you give it to class the first
one is animated and the second one is
the actual name of the animation that
you're looking for so we look somewhere
in here you could choose rubberband
or swing I'm a big fan of shake so we're
going to go ahead with that so shake
give it a save and now when i refresh
this button right here should shake
there we go so you notice every time I
hit the Refresh key it shakes so that's
great but chances are you're not
actually going to be using these
animations on page load
so we want to have a little bit more
control over how this works so things
you can do with just plain CSS is if we
look at the documentation here on github
this they show that we can change the
the duration the delay in the iteration
so let's go through each one of those
right now and see how that works so I
would apply this CSS to the element
that's being animated so here has a
class of button this is the one I'm
animating so here here's where I'm going
to do that I'll just paste that in there
and you're going to notice that it says
vendor that's just the vendor prefix on
different browsers you're going to make
sure that you need to put the vendor
prefixes in there how you know what the
vendor prefixes are great website you
can go to can I use calm and just search
your animation
oh sorry it's keyframes and you'll be
able to pick that up from here so it
looks like you only need WebKit and fire
and plain old you don't need MS you
don't need IE so I'm going to I'm using
Chrome right now so I'm going to use
WebKit comment these out for now
actually so I'll change that vendor to
WebKit and I'll comment these two X you
just want to work on duration duration
is how long it actually takes so by
default it's one second just the shake
generally you want to put that something
less than a second to get it a little
bit there we go
that's a little bit of a nicer animation
wherever you can do something ridiculous
like 30 seconds I'm not going to wait
here all day or three seconds and it
will go a little bit slower second one
we have is the delay so maybe you're
doing this on a header and you want your
your header to swing in you can delay
that so maybe you need two seconds or so
for the page to load so now if I have
this delay of 2 seconds refresh after 2
seconds it shakes a third one is
iteration count so how many times does
it shake by default it's one however you
can make it maybe something like 4 you
can see it go four times there or you
could put it on infinite which would
infinitely shake it if you really want
to annoy your users so that's what those
three do I'm not going to use any of
those right now so I'm just going to
comment those out what else I wanted to
show you was kind of the more kind of
the better use case for something like
this would be adding and removing these
classes with jQuery so this shake that
we have here is great for when you're
doing form validation and accidentally
someone doesn't fill out the proper
information it's great to draw attention
to the input
so how do we add it with jQuery so
rather than add these classes of animate
and Shaikh right in our HTML we're going
to do it when something happens for
example a click so I delete that I have
this button here and I want to make this
input shake when this button is clicked
so what we would do is we go down to the
bottom here we're writing your
JavaScript
let's give myself a document ready good
and and then once the document is ready
I'll say a dot button so let's grabbing
the button on click function and then so
once that button is clicked we are going
to grab the input and I believe I gave
that a name of first name dot add class
and then we're just going to add those
two classes we did before so animated
and shake
so again when I click the button it
should grab the input and add a class of
animated shake so refresh now when I
click this you'll see that this input
that now shakes great however if I click
it again and again again it only doesn't
want so I have to reload for that to
happen and that's because if we look in
our dev tools here and you can see the
link in the input here watch this input
when I click here see it adds a class of
animated shake however if I do it again
just going to add the class again and
it's not going to reanimate itself
so what we need to do is remove the
class of animated and shake once the
animation is done now you might think
yeah ok that's great I'll use a timeout
so maybe you say ok well this animation
is 1 second I'll set a one second
timeout' with JavaScript wait for it and
then remove
it however we can do one better and
actually listen for the animation end
event so if you take a look at the
github docks here you'll note that they
have these animations events here I'm
just going to paste them right here so
WebKit animation end models of animation
and MSN etc etc this animation end event
similar to click or hover or something
like that fires when the animation is
finished so what we can do is take these
animation events and say dot one and
I'll explain what that is in just second
that's similar to on and I will paste
those animations in there so when any of
these animations or events happen comma
run this chunk of code so when it's done
I'm going to say this which are first to
the input dot remove class animated and
shake so when when the button has
finished animating remove it remove
these two classes we don't need them any
longer so back up here let's refresh so
now when I click it adds the class now I
can click it again and it adds it so
watch watch right here where the class
goes on and off so on off on off great
so that's pretty straightforward one
other kind of improvement I like to do
is rather than writing this out every
single time same with this is animate
shake if you change one of these two
let's say bounce up then you'd have to
also change this one to bounce up and
it's going to get out of sync really
quickly so kind of one optimization that
I like to do is to say first of all
store the animations in a variable so
save
our animation name equals and we'll use
these guys and then we just instead of
add class of the string we'll just pass
it the variable and then we can replace
that variable here so whenever we want
to change the animation name we simply
change it in the variable here rather
than right side of our function we also
want to do that for this huge slew of
vendor prefixed events is too much to
take care of so what I will call it is
of our animation end equals all of those
and then when we say one animation end
it's going to just listen for all of
these events at once depending on which
browser you're in the reason why we use
one instead of on is because one will
actually only listen for the event once
and that'll unbind itself which is great
because every time you click it it's not
going to bind over and over and over
again so with these in variables let's
double check that still works there we
go
shake shake shake great so hopefully
that's a pretty good introduction to
animate that CSS awesome library for
adding interaction to your website and I
hope you enjoy it thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
