going to be working with giving these
elements widths and what happens when
there is there's too much space and they
go wider than they should be now one
thing I want you to do right now is take
your existing knowledge of floats and
when you run out of space it just breaks
on to the next line take that and kind
of just throw it out for a second
because the nature of flexbox is that
it's flexible and it's actually like a
little bit more forgiving than when you
have regular old floats so what we're
going to do right here is that we've got
this container here the display flex on
it and I'm gonna go ahead and select
each of these individual boxes now if
you remember back to video 1 we called
this the Flex container and then this
was called the what the Flex item now I
really hope that you just answers there
so we're gonna go ahead and select the
Flex item and we can go ahead and give
it a width let's say like 300 px give it
a save and refresh and well so I just
gave each box a width of 300 pixels and
10 boxes times 30 pixels sorry 300
pixels each what that means is that it's
3000 pixels clearly my screen is not
3000 pixels wide so and I'm not actually
scrolling side to side so this is kind
of cool the the nature of flex box is
that it's gonna try to work with the
widths that you give it but if it just
doesn't work out it's just going to
first of all evenly distribute
throughout the children or we're gonna
learn about flex the actual flex
property in a future video where you can
sort of assign more and less to other
ones so that's where flex wrap comes in
again this is a property that we don't
put on the flex item we put it on the
Flex container and we will say flex wrap
and by default there's no wrap no just
one word there's no dash in it like some
other stuff in CSS just their word no
rap if you save that and refresh you see
nothing happens so again you don't need
that one unless you actually turn off
but we also have rap and we will talk
about rapped our verse so if I say Flex
rap rap and refresh well look what
happens there couple things to note here
it actually works with 300 pixel now so
we get one two three we got three of
them in before you're out of space and
it breaks on to the next line so that's
sort of important we'll figure out how
we can get rid of that in a second and
then the other thing is that like look
at the height of them we didn't give
these a height but if you remember back
to before we wrap them how high were
each of them they were as high as the
actual container could be so by default
flex items will try to stretch their way
across their container and of course
that's because I've put a height on here
if I didn't have that they would just be
like that and when we turn the rap on it
sort of says okay so we need to stretch
across our container but we also need to
like split it up between the ten of us
so what happens here is that the browser
figures out that okay we need four rows
here and we have we're just going to
split it amongst each other so you'll
notice that the height of these is a
little bit higher than it needs to be it
only really needs to be about as high as
this number one here plus some padding
on either side and then I'll just kind
of stretch across and fit it to the
other ones now one thing I want to note
here is that my items are going from
left to right because I'm I speak
English and I have an English browser
that's set to English however if I was
writing a language where it went from
right to left some some languages read
from right to left and they would be
switched on the other side so again
let's talk about our accesses our main
access goes from left to right and our
cross access goes from top to bottom
however if I change this rap from rap -
reverse and refresh it what happens is
remember before when we did flex
direction or
cross access from left to right to right
to left when we change our flex wrap the
wrap the cross access which goes top to
bottom in this case instead of going
from top to bottom it goes from bottom
to top so I just did a quick quick swap
of that and my items are still starting
at the left hand side because my main
access just starts from left to right
but they start at the bottom and go on
up so I don't know that's not something
you probably will come across super
often not likely you want to reverse
your items but if you have it you've got
it so it's gonna bring that back to wrap
give it a refresh and I want to talk
about filling in this space so this
works similar to every other box model
in that you can use 30 points
thirty-three point three three three
three three percent and give it a
refresh and your items will go from one
two three one two three one two three
cool what happens if I change my Flex
direction to column remember by default
it is row we're gonna change it to
column and give it a refresh well what
happened there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so
what actually happened there nevermind
this white space we'll learn about that
in a future video is that because we
have this height 100 VH set on it again
the the height is just this kind of
goldenrod border across it reaches the
bottom here can no longer fit in in
eighth one it says I'm out of space I
need to wrap around or vertically
because we switched the main access from
going from left to right which means
that it would wrap from left to right
and now it hits the bottom and it's
going to wrap again from the top there
if we took this height or in some of the
other videos I had a min height on there
and refreshed it goes all the way down
how come because it never hits the
ability to it never needs to wrap
because if we keep scrolling we've got
all the space that we could want we
could add a hundred items and we'd be
able to scroll from top to bottom
one last thing is I change this back to
flex Direction row
or if I just take it off entirely since
that's the default and I go to the box
and add just a margin of let's say 10px
and give it a refresh what happens is
that we it breaks so you may be familiar
from this from your normal float space
layout in that margin is not part of the
box model which means that when I give
it a width of 33 percent plus 10px that
means I'm over budget it's 33 percent
plus 10px on either side plus 10px in
either side it's gonna break on to the
other side so if you really wanted to do
that you could do something like calc
it's a new thing in CSS you could set
the width to 33.3% minus 20 pixels
because it's 10% 10px on each side and
then that will actually go ahead and
resize it to 33% minus the margin that
you needed if I change that back back to
margin is broken but if I use padding
here you see that it's fixed now that's
because padding I used the box sizing
border box padding and border 10px all
misty rows padding is importer are part
of the box model whereas margin is not
so I just don't need to keep in mind if
you're ever having it break that's it
for this video in the next one we're
going to take a look at reordering items
in Flex box which is something that
instead of just putting all our Flex
properties on the Flex wrapper we are
going to go on the Flex item instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
