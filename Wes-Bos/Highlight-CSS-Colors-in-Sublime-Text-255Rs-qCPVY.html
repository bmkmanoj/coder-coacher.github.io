flexbox series what happened is I had a
some code that looked like this where I
had all of the colors highlighted and
everyone asked what's the plug in that
you're using and so what I thought I'd
do is just tell you what the plug in is
also show you how I got it set up so you
see the colors all the time rather than
just seeing it when you click it so the
plugin is called color highlighter you
need to install it from package control
so so open up your command palette type
install package and once that pops up
you're gonna want to say color
highlighter mine's not showing up
because I already have it installed if
you want to know if you have it
installed you can just open up your
command palette and type list packages
and then you'll see color highlighter so
when you install it it should look a
little something like this
once you have it installed you need to
go ahead and restart sublime text just
because it does some funky stuff by
tacking on some code to your theme that
whatever theme that you're using
whatever color scheme so it's best just
to give it a quick restart just hit
command Q or file quit
and once you've restarted it and then we
need to go ahead and so by default what
it will do is it won't show you the
colors by default it will only show you
when you actually click the files but
really that's not what we want to do
it's great if you can see them without
having to click on the the color itself
plus it looks pretty pretty badass so
what you want to do is go to sublime
text preferences if you're on windows
preferences isn't located under
something called sublime text it's
located over here right next to project
so you go to preferences packages where
we got package settings you want to go
to color highlighter now if you open up
settings default you're gonna see all
kinds of really nice different formats
that we have here and you can see like
this is actually how color highlighter
works by default is when you actually
click a hex code or RGB or HSL value it
will actually highlight it with that
color and what we want to do is change
that so that we see them all the time so
again in sublime text you never want to
actually edit the default settings file
why because that gets overwritten every
time this package is updated so don't
edit it right in there what you want to
do is go back to your preferences
and go to package settings color
highlighter say settings user and
settings user is a package where we can
put our own settings in that will
overwrite any of the default one so all
we need to do here say h a style filled
so if you want to know what the possible
ones are you can just head over to the
color highlighter on github and it will
tell you you can do filled outline or
none so outline will just show a little
underline on there and then filled is
actually what we want so give yourself a
new object these are just JSON files and
in double quotes make sure it's double
quotes H a style set to a string of
filled give that a save and then you
have to go back to your CSS your last
year style it works on any language you
that you write CSS in and make sure that
you save it because when you when you
write something like background
background blue it won't highlight until
you actually save it and then it will
kick it in so there you go once you have
that it should be highlighting them
automatically what's really cool is that
it works with your hex codes it works
with our GPA values you can see the here
if I change this from 0.2 opacity is 0.9
it will update the actual color of it
and it also works with your sass your
less in your styles for variables so
wherever you use them in the document it
will also do that so that's it let me
know if you have any questions I've got
a book on sublime text if you're
interested it's at sublime text book
calm and we use that to just dive into
everything sublime text has to offer and
you can grab the the book and you can
use the coupon code West boss all caps
for ten binos off enjoy thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
