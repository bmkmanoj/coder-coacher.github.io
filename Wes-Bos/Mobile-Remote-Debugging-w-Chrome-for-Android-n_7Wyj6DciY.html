portion of my latest tutorial on my blog
which is called remote debugging with
Chrome for Android Chrome for Android
released just last week and one of the
best parts of that is the ability to do
remote debugging so what that means is
you're able to use your full set of
developer tools within your browser just
as if we were to use this but instead of
editing the web site on our browser
we're actually editing the web site on
our device so what I have here is just a
Nexus S running Ice Cream Sandwich you
do need Ice Cream Sandwich to run Google
Chrome and I'm going to run through the
steps that we need to do in order to get
up and running with remote debugging so
first thing you need to do is head on
over to developer.android.com force is
forward slash sdk if you don't already
have develop the SDK installed I like to
do is download it for your OS here and
then go ahead and extract it I've
already downloaded and extracted it now
this is the entire Android SDK and
generally what you want to do is not
just leave this in your download folder
you want to move this over to somewhere
safe as with all SDKs on your computer
so what I like to do is put it in
forward slash developer so if you take a
look at the written blog post it'll show
you a little more info on that second
thing we need to do is go ahead and
within tools you can double-click
Android and that will launch something
that looks like this the Android SDK
manager and by default you're going to
have a whole bunch of these ones checked
you can uncheck them all unless you're
actually doing native Android
development and just make sure you have
Android SDK platform tools checked and
then click install one package
it'll take 2 or 3 minutes for you to do
that and once you're done that you can
move on to the next step which is if
you're on a UNIX based machine you
basically just have to add it to your
path which means we can use the command
which is ADB from wherever whatever
folder we are on our machine so I'm not
going to type this out for you right now
but just copy paste this little snippet
into your terminal and hit enter
obviously if you've put your SDK tools
in somewhere other than the developer
directory just update that so once you
have that all together you'll have
access you can to the ADB command and
you'll see here that I do and you'll see
all of these stuff that we can use a for
what we need to do for preparing our
phone is just two quick things is go
over to settings on your phone scroll
all the way to the bottom and click
developer options and make sure you have
USB debugging on you do need to have
your phone plugged in via USB for this
specific one and once you're done that
click home and then I want you guys to
open up Google Chrome so if it takes a
sec to
show there we go and open up your
settings and click the Settings button
and then again scroll all the way down
go to developer tools and make sure you
have enable USB web debugging both these
options will be turned off by default so
it's important that you do those now
that we're done that we're going to go
back to our terminal here so clear
everything out and what we need to do is
tell tell the computer to get the
Android device and sort of kind of make
a bridge from what's open on the device
so we can access it from our computer
and we're going to use the ADB command
for that it's called ADB forward and
then we're going to tell it TCP port 9 2
to 2 and then they'll say local abstract
chrome dev tools remote and we're gonna
hit enter there it's gonna start up and
tell us that we're successfully running
so if that has worked we'll be able to
go over to localhost forward slash 9 - 2
- hit enter and you'll see that it gives
you a list of currently open tabs in my
Chrome browser so let's see how you have
the jquery mobile website open right now
but if i were to click over to tabs you
have CNN in the daily je s website so
i'm gonna go back to the jquery mobile
website and click on it in my browser
here and that loads up just the regular
old dev tools that you used to so if you
hover over any element in here you'll
see that on the actual device it's
updating we can go ahead and change the
background of this to red we can you can
use the entire console so let's just say
hello
hello there and it all shows up
automatically on the phone so pretty
handy to have full dev tools
no more alerting or using any other
hacky situation so take a look at the
full tutorial and let me know if you've
any questions thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
