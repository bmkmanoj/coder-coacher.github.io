the Flex property so not display flex
but this is a property that actually
goes on the individual flex item so a
quick review we've got these containers
here which that's our flex container and
then each one of these things inside of
here
those are our Flex items so I switched
up the just a Content inside of them a
little bit just to show you like this
stuff works with different amounts of
content it's it's kind of nice to see
some words that are longer than others I
just put some emojis in there so we can
have fun so we need to go ahead and
select each one and the property that we
want is the Flex property now I'm going
to show you how to use flex with just
one single value first and then we're
going to break it down into flex Gro
flex drink and something called the Flex
basis so I what's a flex do well I it
essentially answers the question what do
I do with this extra space or what do I
do when I don't actually have enough
space because though the whole point of
flex box is that it's not going to break
your layout if you have too much space
or not enough space it will sort of just
do it'll kind of intelligently figure
out where everything needs to go so what
I want to do right now is like let's
take a look here what have I done I just
said display flex and I got our items
and the width of your Flex items by
default is what's called Auto and it's
just the width of the content inside of
them now if I go ahead and say flex one
on there and refresh you'll see that
each of the Flex items regardless of how
much content they have they are all
taking up the exact amount of space so
that answer is what flex is is flex is
at what proportion should i scale myself
up or down when we have extra space or
not enough space now because I gave all
of them a flex property of 1 remember
that we're talking about when we don't
have
flex on right here we're talking about
the additional space left on over or
when we get smaller how how they scaled
down together I'll talk about that in a
second so when I say flex one we're
saying that each of you should divvy up
the remaining space for fortunately and
that's why they are all the same size
however now if I go ahead and say box
two and give it a flex property of to
watch what happens to this one right
here you see that it is twice the size
of all the other ones and why is that
well we said when there is extra space
or when there is not enough space oh
look at that in a second box two should
have double the amount of all the other
ones as flex 2 is just overriding the
Flex one of this previously set so
that's great and when I resize watch
what happens so at a certain point if I
take all this off real quick at a
certain point right about here we're
gonna move from too much space too much
extra to not enough and that's the other
thing that flex box does is yeah it's
great when you have extra space but what
happens when there is not enough space
there so let me put that back on here
and hey let me show you what it looks
like when it's just flex one just
they're all evenly divvied up but when I
give box to a flex value of two it says
alright I'm extra hungry I'm extra
hungry Pizza div here and I want to eat
up twice as much of the extra room as
the rest of you now flex properties they
can be decimal points if I were then to
move dot box five and two flex three
you'll see that now box five takes up
three times the amount of room as
something that's still flex one so it's
all in proportion it's not pixels it's
not percentage anything like that we'll
be looking at that in just a second
however it's all about how much of the X
your space on that line we'll look at a
multi-line example as well in just a
second how much of the extra space or
when there's not enough space how do we
divvy that up amongst all of my siblings
that we have here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
