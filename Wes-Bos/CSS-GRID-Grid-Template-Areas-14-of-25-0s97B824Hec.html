we can size grid items by spanning them
and we looked at how we can put them
where we want them to go by using the
track numbers where they start and stop
or we're just specifying where they
stopped or if it was a span across the
entire grid now there's a couple other
ways we can also both size and place our
items and that is using something called
grid template areas and that's giving
specific names to areas on your grid so
the first thing we want to do is
actually make some areas in our grid so
I'm going to make a quick grid I kind of
want to make your standard website with
a sidebar on the left and a sidebar on
the right and some content in the middle
and then a footer across the bottom so
that's going to be a sort of a three
column grid so say grid template call
him and I'm gonna say one fr 500 px 1 fr
and what that should do is it'll give us
this 500 pixel middle and then
whatever's left on the left and the
right will be taken up accordingly by
these sidebars and then let's flip on
our our dev tools here I also want to
specify a couple rows so I'm going to
say grid template rows and we'll have
let's say 150 px 150px and 100 px good
so I've got a grid sort of three by
three here now what I want to do is
actually name the areas I want this
these two squares right here I want that
to be sidebar one these two squares I
want to be sidebar to this whole center
column I want to be called content and
then the the strip along the bottom I
want that to be called the footer so the
way that we do that is it's actually
kind of kind of funny it's it's very
explicit you simply just sort of like
type it as if it were a ski so let's say
grid template areas and then for each
row you give yourselves a set of quotes
and then you just type the name of the
area that you wish for it to be so I'm
gonna say side bar one content sidebar
two
and then if I give that a save you'll
see now and make sure that you have your
dev tools on and this this one right
here display area names you see that it
starts to overlay it with the name of
this area is called sidebar one name of
this area sidebar two in this area is
content good but I also want these areas
as well so what you can do and this is a
bit funky syntax as well is you do not
put a comma or anything like that you
simply just put another set of quotes
and this can all be done on one line in
fact some editors concatenate them like
that but I like to put each one on its
own line and that will just kind of give
me a visual of what we're working with
so if I give that a save now you'll see
sidebar one sidebar one sidebar two
sidebar two and content content good and
then the last row I want to just be
footer footer footer and that will line
up the footer all across the end if you
ever have so you want like a dead space
like maybe didn't want this to be
anything you can just put a dot there
and that will just leave it to be just a
regular old spot that you could use with
with the other methods that we've had
but in our case don't want to be put our
footer footer so it's kind of like you
can just like look at this and you could
see that you can visualize what it will
look like and some people also use tabs
so that it all nicely line itself up
that is totally doable as well just so
you can sort of visualize what's going
on here good now when I want to place my
items in these areas I don't have to
worry about line numbers or anything
like that I can just go ahead and grab
on to let's let's do the footer first
you say grid area footer and then we'll
just both size it and place it where we
want it to go we don't have to say how
big it is we don't have to say where
it's going to go we simply just say that
it is the footer and then it will go
there it'll span it across the entire
region so let's do the rest now so item
one was grid area whoa grid area that
was sidebar one good
then sigh item 2 was content and item 3
was sidebar - beautiful now it's all
perfectly and lining up where we want it
to go and now the cool thing about that
is we could start to involve some media
queries that would simply just switch up
what this would look like so if I were
to make a media query I can simply just
redefine the the template areas as we
need them so I'll select my container at
once we hit 700 pixels and I'm just
gonna say background red make sure this
media query is actually working let's
hit 700 pixels there we go it's kicking
in good I'm happy with that and I can
just redefine what my template areas are
so I'm gonna take this I'm going to
redefine it to be content content
content sidebar 1 sidebar 1 sidebar to
footer footer footer and now as I get it
smaller you'll see that the layout
totally jumps and it will then put the
content up top and I'm not totally doing
this justice because I've used pixels
here but if I was to use all fr units
maybe like 10 fr and then the rows would
each be the rows doesn't matter actually
there we go
as it gets smaller the content will jump
up top and the sidebar values go right
down below it and then the footer is
still exactly where I want it so
sometimes the only thing you need to do
in your media queries is simply just
redefine what the layout looks like and
everything will sort of snap - and in
this case I could also redefine more
columns so it were is if you wanted
sidebar 1 and sidebar two to both how
for I could use these values up here to
define even more so that is grid
template areas it's pretty neat not
everybody loves the the idea behind
making a ski but it sure is a lot nicer
having to remember exactly what the
columns are because if you were to ever
change the number of columns it doesn't
really matter in this case so we're in
really good shape other than that we've
got some other ways to place in size or
stuff and we'll get into that into the
next video
all right let's switch over to another
example and that is understanding that
when you create greedy areas you also
get line names for free which is pretty
neat so open up area line name start and
I've got a whole bunch of numbers here
and what I want to do is actually make a
grid without defining any columns or
rows we're simply just going to make the
grid with the grid we're simply just
going to make the grid with the grid
area so say grid template area and I'm
gonna go on the new line and in this
case I'm going to use an emoji poop whoa
two three four I'm gonna do yeah I'll do
four poops and four hamburgers two three
four hamburgers and then I'll just
duplicate that over four times good give
that a save and I spelt template wrong
and
something's wrong good template areas
with an S on the end good so if I turn
on my dev tools now you'll see that we
have emojis overlapping where all of the
actual areas go it's just pretty neat
and if you wanted to you could do
something like item three you can say
grid area poop and that will just cover
the entire poop re actually what is
interesting about this is you tell me
tell me what is happening here where we
just made eight across and four down and
we have not enough room because we've
got more items than we have space for so
what is happening here if I turn on the
black lines is that we have sort of the
explicit grid area for poop and explicit
grid area for hamburgers and then as we
are out of space what happens well it
automatically creates additional rows
which are implicit right I know I've
gone over that over and over but it's
really important that we we understand
that however I do not want to show you
how you can just place it in the poop
area what you want to show you how you
can actually get these named lines
rather than just the numbered lines so
previously we had did something done
something like this like grid column and
we did so like start at two and go to
until line five and that would span this
item here well what's neat about that is
we can actually use line names like poo
- start and we want to end it
where poop end and give that a save so
what's happening here is every time you
have a grid area named anything and
before it might be content or sidebar
one but in our case it's poop and emoji
poop and then we can tack on a - start
or a - end and these are lines and
unfortunately the dev tools doesn't show
us the names of these lines but there
are sort of lines that come for free in
the browser by tacking on a - start in a
- end into the grid area so in here what
I've done is I've said start where the
poop starts and end where the poop ends
right I could also do something like
this where a hamburger end and give that
a save and you could see it starts with
the poop area starts and ends where the
poop area ends and similarly if I went
to the grid row
I could just say grid row end if I only
want to end where the poop ends then
it's going to move it down why because
it is going to anchor it at the bottom
of our poop area and of course it will
spill into the hamburger area because of
how wide the actual columns have gone so
you don't always have to use line
numbers you can also use areas that you
have created in your grid template areas
by
using the sort of implicit lines that
come along for free by using - start and
- end tacked on to whatever you named
your grid template area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
