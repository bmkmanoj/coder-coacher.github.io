JavaScript array dot sort method and
we're going to be sorting this array of
band names but the kind of the catch
that we have here is that you need to
sort them without the and/or aah in
front of the actual band name because
those are articles and they don't go
into alphabetizing your actual name of
your band so go ahead and pause the
video I think that you can do this on
your own at least give it a good shot
and try to build this where you sort
this array first and then once you've
sorted the array without the N or ah
then put them into the actual HTML here
but notice how the and or ah still come
along for the ride they're just not
affecting the sort order so pause the
video and come back when you've given a
good shot welcome back so here I am I'm
going to first make a sorted bands
variable and we'll take the bands and we
are going to sort it now we know that
sort we'll take a function name that
gives us a and B and what is a a a is
going to be the first thing that it
passes us B is going to be the second
it's sort of like it gives you two
apples in either hand and you're like
which one is bigger and then the bigger
one you move to the top and the other
one you move to the bottom or the one
that is comes earlier in the alphabet
you move to the top and the other one
you put in the bottom and then you you
toss the bigger one and you get another
Apple in your hand and you've got that
the first Apple from the first bunch and
then the second Apple from the second
button who say which ones bigger and you
just keep doing that over and over and
over again until you have a sorted list
that's how this that's why I always
gives you two things so normally what we
do is we say if a is greater than B and
we can just do this even though they're
not numbers it's still going to work
with strings because they're
alphabetical so if a is bigger than B
then we will return one else we are
going to return negative one and let's
just console.log sorted bands let's see
what we've got here
so we've got our data and it is
alphabetizing it but it is basing it off
of ah and the so what we need to do is
go up here and create a new function I
like to call strip and it's going to
take in the band name and then from
there we are going to return the band
name but we are going to replace the
word the or or an so one way that we
could replace all three in one go is to
use a regular expression and we can say
when it starts with that's what the
caret is for and I'm by no means a
regular expression expert if you know
anything about regex you probably find a
better way to do this but the way that
I've done it is you can say ah the or an
and you want to make that insensitive so
it's going to match like an or n or a n
so there we go and I'm sure there's like
a flag you can pass that you don't need
that space in there or you could say
just match a whole word what I'm trying
to do is is make sure that we don't
catch this where somewhere like anywhere
starts with an but that's not actually
the article and so we are republishing
make sure you spell replace right and we
are going to be replacing that with
nothing and then we're just called trim
on the end there just in case we have
any spaces so if after it good then what
we could do let's let's see if that
works actually so if I call that strip
function from the console say an old dog
it returns you old dog if you have an
old dog kernel dog it won't do it the
old dog will give you a lot good so that
function is working now what we can do
is we simply just change our if
statement is a strip and strip and
notice how we are only using strip in
the if statement and we're not actually
going to be modifying this data so the
data that we use to decide where it goes
is not necessarily the data that is
going to be in the array so we're using
strip now let's see where right good
anywhere but here
the bled counterparts the devil wars
good so now it's totally ignoring it we
can like make this a lot easier here so
first of all what we could do we could
simply just make it return strip a it's
greater than strip B if that is true we
return 1 otherwise we return negative 1
so we're just using a ternary operator
there still works good we can make this
an arrow function good still works and
now you see my editors yelling at me
because it's if you if the only thing
you're doing in a function is returning
something you can use the implicit
return so I'm going to take off that
bracket in the semicolon I take off this
bracket and put it on its own on the
same line I'm gonna remove the return
keyword and that's doing the exact same
thing just in one hot line there we go
working good so we have the bands that
sort and now we will go ahead and grab
our bands which is here say document dot
query selector pound bands dot innerhtml
equals we'll take our search advanced
and we are going to loop over each of
them so we'll use map and from that map
we will return the band but the band in
a list item and then we will join it all
in one go so what does that do it takes
the element and sets the innerhtml
to be and we could put this on its own
line sorted bands but we want to map
over each of those and then that's going
to return an array so we want to join it
so we're right there we go anywhere over
here the blood we've got everything
being dumped into the dom there let me
show you real quick if I take that joint
off you'll notice that we get these
commas showing up here and that's
because what happens is we have this
sorted bands array which is everything
and if you were to call that to string
on it and that's exactly what the dom
will do when you try to set something to
inner HTML that is not a string like an
array then
we'll just call that to string on it and
by default is going to put a comma in
between each one so we need to put that
dot join on the end so that will join it
into one big string rather than a bunch
of strings with a comma in between so
let's double check that working great
hopefully you enjoyed that I will see
you tomorrow
