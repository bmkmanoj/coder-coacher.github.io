reducer here we need to be familiar with
what the data for our comments looks
like so I've just opened up our comments
stay right here and it's a big object
which each of the items is a key for
that associated post here and if you
open that up that is an array with all
of the different comments that live
inside of it now when we want to add a
comment we don't really need to update
the entire comment state we just need to
work on this one specific code or if
we're adding a comment to this one we
need to work on that specific code so
just as we split up our state into two
pieces
we had a big state like let's pretend
this object is our state we had posts
and we had comments and we sort of had a
reducer for each of them what we're
going to do is we're to create another
sub reducer that is going to handle the
updating of just one of these specific
pieces and that's what's called reducer
composition so if you ever are reading
the Redux documentation and I recommend
that you do because it's fantastic is
they put it really nicely they say now
to do app gives us just a slice of the
state so we only want a slice of the
state which is just one of these things
right here to update and to do knows how
to update just that slice this is called
a reducer composition and it is a
fundamental pattern of building Redux
apps which we've learned we we come
compose these two into one and now we're
going to go one step further and sort of
make a sub reducer inside of that so
let's get cracking on that and have one
function called comments which is going
to handle the entire comments state and
then we're going to create a secondary
function called post comments and that
will handle the updating of the
individual one so let's go into this
first one right here we're gonna still
going to export the comments one in
order to say if we just need to check
make sure that this reducer needs to run
so one way that we can do that is we
could have done the switch statement but
here we're just going to check if the
item is there the post item so say if
typeof action
post ID doesn't equal undefined then we
can go ahead and do what you want so
we're we're gonna leave this return
state in here because if if this reducer
gets called for something else we want
to just return State and we won't touch
it inside of this return the actual
state which is we're going to take
everything from state so what is that
doing right here we're going to take the
current state and then on top of that
we're going to overwrite this post with
a new one and the way that we do that is
normally we would say we take the key
like this and the key of that is going
to be the new array of comments like wow
and cool but we are going to shell that
work off of tacking the new comment onto
the array to this post comments one
right here as well as this needs to be
dynamic you can't hard code that like
that so we're going to use square
brackets so that the key of the object
can be a variable actually not post ID
and that is going to be set to post
comments which will send it state with
the action post ID and we also want to
pass along the entire action payload
here right because we want to pass it
this sub piece of state which is going
to be one of these arrays of comments
and we want to give it the entire action
and that is the reducer composition
where it's wiping its hands of it here
and it's just saying all right some
other function needs to take care of
updating that individual one all I'm
concerned with is returning the entire
comment state so we're done here
actually make sure that's a capital C
and we'll go up to return state here and
we'll do our regular switched on action
dot type we have two cases add a comment
and remove comment as well as our
default and I'm just going to return
state on default I'm going to do it on
remove comment for now we'll come back
and update that and then our add comment
is we need to return the existing state
plus the new comment turn so what is the
well it's going to be a ray and we're
going to take every item from the
existing state so we're just going to do
dot state and that will take every item
from the existing state and apply it
into this new array and then we will
tack on our new comment well what's our
new comment here and just on a new line
the username is going to be the action
dot author and the text is going to be
action comment and these user and text
these are just the two E's that are
required that's sort of the data as I
came off of Instagram for me give it a
refresh we're good and I say Wes cool
hit enter and immediately this has been
added what's cool you see it this is
still here let me try another one Kate
neat that works one little thing is like
we still have the actual text showing up
in here how can you get rid of that well
let's go back to our comments here and
remember when we called this the add
comment we can say this dot Refs
we gave our form a comment form anything
is called reset on it that's just a
regular JavaScript method that lives
inside of all forms call this once more
there we go it clears its actual self so
that's adding a comment and we also want
to be able to remove a comment so let's
say console.log removing a comment and
let's get this hooked up so we're going
to go back to our comments right here
and remember that when we rendered it
out this button give it a class name but
we did not hook it up so we can say
unclick equals this dot props
don't remove comment now remove comment
takes an argument if we go to our action
creators here it is it requires two
things of you it requires the post ID as
well as the index of that actual comment
so what post are you deleting it from
and which index which which comment is
it going to be the first comment or is
it going to be the fifth comment here is
we need to pass it an argument we will
use bind in this case just like we did
before we pass it no
then we can pass it this props params
dot post ID and then we also have that
index value which is I now if we go back
to this button here and click X beside
one of them refresh removing a comment
so it says removing a comment because
that is exactly what's running right
here but we are just returning the
regular state so we need to return
without the deleted comment so how do we
do that well you return an array again
and we simply just use our spread again
state slice will go from the beginning
to wherever the comment up into the the
comment so action I because that's if we
are deleting the fifth one it's going to
be everything up until five from the
start to the one we want to delete and
then we want to take state slice action
dot I plus one right because this is
going to be after the deleted one to the
end so let's visualize this so if we
have an array here that says Wow
neat cool nice and if we wanted to
delete the third one essentially what
would happen is we would first take Wow
and neat and then we would skip cool and
we were to return nice and we return
everything until the end of the array
and that's the last one there so that
would return it would take this array
and return the new state which is this
one right here so we've got that up and
running it's going to return a new array
we want one last thing we actually need
here is to delete this state because we
are returning a new state we don't need
that return state there refresh because
this is not a component but I think and
now if we click on the X you see that
it's immediately deleting all of the
items from that specific state so you
can kind of see what's going on here you
might have add comment remove comment
edit comment where you would return the
the modified state you would replace the
actual item with the new text you can
have all kinds of different actions that
happen here and your reducer isn't
charge of actually figuring out what to
update and returning that updated state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
