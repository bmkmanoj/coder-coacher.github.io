the last video we took a look at how we
could use flex direction to create
ourselves a row of content or either a a
column of content or we use flex
direction to reverse them entirely we
also looked at how we can use the border
property on each individual item to be
able to reorder it as you can see we
have one two through ten here but it's
not exactly so visually when we display
it here so today I want to take a look
at applying width and height to each of
our elements and seeing how flexbox is
able to work with us and not so I'm just
going to go ahead and delete all of
these orders that we've done here and
I'm going to set this back just to Rho
which is the default I'm going to
refresh you can see that our flex value
of one is proportionately giving the
space to each of these ten flex elements
right here so in order to kind of
simulate environment of being in a web
app or in a web page I wanted to set a
hard width and a hard height or a high
in a width on the wrapper that is around
here because most of times you're going
to be using flexbox to layout items that
are within your application so to do
that I'm going to say width equals let's
say 80% and then I need to a height of
600 pixels and I'm just going to put a
border of 10 pixels solid black just so
I can see where the the wrapper is
starting and ending I'm also going to do
a margin:0 auto just so i can Center in
the page so give that a refresh
everything's looking good we're now
constrained to 80% of our browser so you
can see as you resize this now we are
taking up 80% of the wrapper instead of
the browser
so what I wanted to look at now was this
each individual box so with Flex box
when you want your items to kind of
stack side-by-side or take up the room
that you need we need to apply a min
width in a min height so I'm going to
say min width of 25% in min height of
let's say hundred pixels for now
just see what we're at and the reason
we're using min here is because if the
content of these boxes is larger than
what it needs or than it is if it needs
more than what it is then they should be
able to expand in Flex box should be
able to accommodate the rest of them for
that so I'm going to pop this up here
and give it a refresh and well what
happened so what happened was the height
of everything stayed the same but these
got a lot bigger and now or scroll in
side to side everything kind of spilled
outside of the wrapper now if you're
used to normal floats in web design
you're probably thinking well we can
just float these suckers left and they
should break down underneath we should
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten underneath that flex box is a
little bit different in that regard in
that we need to set a wrap on the parent
so let's go back up to this wrapper here
I'm just going to move this down so we
keep our Flex properties together and
this new one is called flex - wrap and
we are going to say wrap there's a few
other options that we have here if you
are ever looking for a really good
reference for all of the available
options in flexbox CSS tricks has a
excellent excellent page here that just
dives into all the possible options for
flex box I definitely recommend keeping
that one bookmarked as it's a really
really handy reference and it seems to
be always up to date
so what we did is we said flex wrap wrap
and what's going to happen now when i
refresh is that now we are getting our
400 pixel div they we get to four
because they're 25% each and now it
wraps on to the next line because it's
no longer spilling out to the end and
this is a really really nice thing about
Flex boxes that we have 9 and 10 left
and they don't just kind of stop right
here they realize that they have the
rest of the room so they are going to by
default span all the way across now we
can totally change that if we wanted to
and flex box would be able to
accommodate for that we're going to look
into that and further videos what I
really want to show you now is the
difference between a row and column so
right now we're set as row flex
Direction row and the numbers go from
left to right and they break on to the
next one if I were to ship set that to
column give it a save look what's going
to happen here so we go 1 2 3 4 refresh
now we go in a column lies where we go 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 this layout wasn't
really possible before in CSS unless you
had two separate divs generally what
would happen is you would float them
left and you would get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 but now they stack on top of each
other when they run out of room we're
going to pop up to the next line here
and and everything looks good
the reason these are totally evenly
distributed is because I actually put a
height of 600 pixels if we took that
height off they would all stack
vertically because it's unlimited height
for them oftentimes when you're working
in a application though you want you
don't want to have users scrolling so
you're going to set a either pixel
height or 100% height or something like
that if I were to bump this up to maybe
something like maybe 750 and refresh
you'll see that because we have a min
height of 100 pixels we're able to fit
seven of them we have 700 pixels to work
with and the browser knows that hey we
got an extra 50 pixels here so it's
going to distribute evenly between all
of these guys here that's the beauty of
flexbox and then it takes the rest eight
nine and ten and distributes them evenly
between all of them
so that's wraps for now what we're going
to look at in the next video is looking
at when we resize or when there's extra
space available what does that look like
to allocate the size we're going to look
at something called the Flex basis which
is ideally what size it should be
and then look at two other items called
Flex grow in Flex rink is when you have
more room than you need and when you
have less room than you ideally need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
