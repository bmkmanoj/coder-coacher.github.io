about flex direction now all this video
is going to be very short and simple
it's actually really important that we
understand flex direction because it
sets with something called the axis when
we're doing flexbox so in Flex box we
can have both the main and the cross
access we'll learn about that in just a
second however when we go into the rest
of the features for flex box if we just
take a quick look at the CSS tricks for
the complete guide to flex box we're
gonna run into these things like justify
content where you can horizontally or
vertically Center your content and
things like align items and these don't
necessarily mean that they are left to
right or top to bottom they entirely
depend on something called the Flex
direction so with that in mind let's
jump into this one I've just gotten my
Flex Direction style that CSS on open
and if I say Flex - Direction row give
it a save and refresh nothing happens
because that is the default of any Flex
container remember that this one we did
display flex on it so what that means is
that they'll just go from they kind of
stack right beside each other and then
they will span vertically to hit the
height of whatever the container is
remember that we just did a quick height
100 VH on there so we could see that
it's actually spanning across even if we
didn't if we didn't have that let me
take that off real quickly it would just
take up the amount of content that it
needs so I'm actually going to change
that to min height just because if that
was ever higher than the height of our
our screen then we would actually need
that so there we go then the other one
is flex direction column give that a
save and refresh and you'll see what
that does is instead of putting them
side-by-side it will stack them
vertically on top of each other now
that may not seem very fundamental to
you that may seem pretty simple
however the main thing that we want to
take away from this is that when we
our defining things as flex direction ro
or flex direction column we have two
accesses we have the main access which
we are going to be using things in the
future like the justified content and
the aligned items so the main access
when it is ro is from left to right you
can imagine a big arrow going across the
screen from left to right here and then
what we call the cross access which is
the other one goes from top to bottom so
you can imagine a big arrow going from
top to bottom here now that's that's the
default and that's generally what you'll
be using however if you change this from
row 2 column what happens is that the
main access is no longer going to be
from left to right it's going to be from
top to bottom which is exactly why the
content is going from top to bottom
right again if we change it back to row
and give it a save content starts here
and goes to the right because that's the
way the access runs if we change it to
column and give it a save the access
changes from left to right and goes top
to bottom and you can see the content
sort of follow along with that similarly
we also have row - Reverse you can
imagine what that does instead of the
main access running from left to right
it runs from right to left content
starts at one and kind of goes on out
from there and that's going to be really
important when we start to work with all
these alignment ones in a future video
you probably can guess that we also have
column - reverse in which the content
will start at 10 and go all the way down
to 1 because where does the access start
at the top no it doesn't access actually
starts at the bottom and goes on up so
every time that you're working with
flexbox if you axe ask yourself where
are the main access and then the cross
access is always just the opposite that
you have there so anytime you're stuck
on flexbox if you can't answer the
question where is my accesses maybe step
back take a look at what you
set your flex direction to be if it's
not set to anything what is it
it's flex direction row because that is
the default you've probably never have
to set it to row unless you are
specifically I'm applying it for
whatever reason that you have so that's
flex direction pretty simple in the next
video we are going to be gearing up and
talking about flex wrap so when you
actually give some sort of width to
these things what happens when you run
out of space does it spell if the page
they wrap around etc etc some things
that you may be used to when working
with floats see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
