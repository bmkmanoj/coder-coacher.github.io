markdown
and that's just writing text so a
paragraph wes is cool give it a save
that is a paragraph element there and I
can go ahead and write wes is really
cool and I can go ahead and maybe put
some lorem ipsum in there and you'll
notice that each of those is its own
line however one little gotcha here is
if I were to write one two three or five
like if I was just writing a whole bunch
of paragraphs or maybe if I were to put
Wes as cool and wes is really cool on
the same line or on lines right next to
each other give it a save you'll notice
that they don't actually even though
they're visually on their own lines here
they're not on their own lines in here
and that's just because markdown needs a
full line space in between each one in
order to become a paragraph element
you'll remember that text needs to be
readable both in the markdown file as
well as when it gets parsed out to HTML
so we need to make sure that it doesn't
just run together we want it to be
extremely readable as markdown itself
now next up we have bold italic and
strikethrough there are two ways to do
bold and italic in markdown you'll
notice that if I select this line here
and I wrap those in a single set of
asterisks and give it a save you'll
notice that it is italic and if I put a
second set of asterisks around it and
give it a save you'll notice that it is
bold and that's because one set of
something in markdown in this case
asterisks will make it italic two sets
will make it bold we also have the
option of doing underscores around the
thing so two sets of underscores will
make a bold one set of underscore will
make it italic now I go this way I say I
love you I always use double asterisks
for bold and I really love you if I
wanted to make really I always use one
set of underscores so I use underscores
for italic in double asterisks for bold
just because I don't want to ever mess
it up I have some nice formatting and my
editor here but if I was ever looking at
that in text I don't want to have to
decipher the difference to go oh is that
two or one I
underscore means italic and bold means
double asterisks now next up you'll
notice that I was just selecting
something like I love you and I was just
selecting my elements and typing
asterisk there and notice how when I
type it in sublime text this happens in
most other editors as well it doesn't
replace it it actually wraps it with the
thing that I want so I wrap it with
double ones or a wrap it's a single one
next up we have strikethrough in what
you can do is just select the text that
you want and hit the tilde key and what
that will do is it will wrap it in
double sets of tilde and it will just
give you a strikethrough immediately one
set of strikethrough won't do anything
it'll just actually give you tilde so
don't do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
