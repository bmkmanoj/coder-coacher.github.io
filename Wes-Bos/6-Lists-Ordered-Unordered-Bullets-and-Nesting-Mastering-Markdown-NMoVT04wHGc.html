lists and ordered lists to make an
unordered list you can go ahead and
select lines that you want and put an
asterisk in front of each one and that
will give you a bullet however you can
also use a dash or a minus sign that
will give you the exact same thing and
the same goes for a plus it's just a
personal preference many people when
they're doing nested lists I'll show you
that in just a second we'll see what's
what switch between the two as they go
along next we have unordered lists that
which is here and that is where the
order does matter now I don't recommend
putting any sort of incremental number
in front of them I just recommend
putting a 1 in front of everyone why
because that actually doesn't matter
what you put in front of it is just
showing the parser that this is a number
by putting a number in front of it
you'll see that the browser is gonna
convert it to an ordered list and put
the proper numbers in front of it so it
doesn't matter what you put inside of
here so some people try to go 1 2 3 but
inevitably what happens is they go oh
shoot I've got another one here which is
too and lick the bowl mmm no now we've
got 1 2 2 3 you got to change this 1 2 3
and then this 1 2 4 and it starts to get
out of control especially when you try
to like reorder things as well so I
recommend just using 1 1 1 1 as well
with the period that comes on after it
one neat thing about using this in
sublime text or one of your editors when
you add a new item it will immediately
put a new bullet in here now this will
automatically increment it but if you're
using a bulleted one down here milk eggs
bread big in and it will automatically
add another one as you hit enter as you
enter if you enter again it will
backspace it and enter a third time
it'll give you a nice clean line now
let's talk about indenting things inside
of here because sometimes your lists
will be more than one so let's say we
have steps right here combined
ingredients but inside of that you want
to have some indentation so you can
indent one level and it doesn't matter
what form of indent and here I'm using a
hard tab but you may also like these two
spaces or 4 spaces
going here by default it's going to give
you a new number but you can delete that
in hit tab and give yourself an asterisk
or a number or plus or any of the other
ones that we just talked about and you
can say sift the flour if I've saved
you'll see it will indent it and
obviously that will go as long as
indented as you could possibly want and
you don't control what the bullets look
like that is done through your CSS of
your website or github or whatever
you're using so you can use whichever
ones you wish to indent it now one thing
that I always get tripped up on is how
do I put content inside of here often
I'm using an ordered list for like
complex steps on how to do something and
I need to add like a paragraph in the
image inside of that unordered list well
the way that it works is like let's say
I wanted a sub point to sift the flour
what I would do is underneath it give
yourself another tab and then say this
is in line give it a save and you see
that that is in line but if I were to
give yourself another break inside of
there it's going to give me a paragraph
nested inside of that one bullet
anything goes if I have an image here
and I've got a none splashing image and
give that a save you'll notice that it
goes right beside this is in line but if
I get myself a full space this is just a
paragraph like we're used to give it a
save and it's going to put it on inside
so that one can be really really handy
where you want to nest things inside of
it we're gonna learn about code blocks
you can even go ahead and put a code
block right inside of there of our x
equals a v' you can see that all of that
great stuff is going to be nested right
inside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
