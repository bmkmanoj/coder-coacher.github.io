boss here I tweeted out this quizzes
poll brainbuster stupid thing on Twitter
today and it's surprisingly not a lot of
people know what's going on so this is
just a bunch of es6 code and I've sort
of mashed a couple different things
together and this is probably something
you wouldn't write but if you understand
what's happening here you may be able to
learn like one or two things about how
es6 works so what I wanted to do is just
step through all the different pieces of
it and explain what exactly is happening
so we've got two variables here I've got
a dog variable and I've set that to
snickers which your television so I've
got a cat variable which I've set to
nothing now if I were just to stop right
there and what I like to do here is put
a debugger command at this start
debugger and when i refresh this i can
step through and see what the the
variables are going to be equal to so
I'm going to hit this little step into
so far variables are equal to nothing
step to the next line kay now our dog is
equal to Snickers and then the next line
cat is is defined or sorry it's not
defined it's undefined but we've created
the variable here now at this point this
is where we're not really sure what's
going on we say dog equals hugo cat
equals muff equals cat comma dog now
what's going on here well first of all
this is what is called d structuring in
es6 and what d structuring will allow
you to do is to define multiple
variables or to update in our case
multiple variables in one single line
and that's really cool now if I were
just to go open up a new tab and give
myself a console here I can show you
that I can create a first and a there we
go got it right there cons first comma
last equals West boss so I'm going to
take this array where the first thing is
my first name the second thing is my
last name like ours once a key
second thing is my last name
I will hit enter now I have two
variables first and last and I'd be
structured the first value into the
first and second value into second now
you can do that with objects as well
I've got all kinds of videos on that in
my es6 series which you can go ahead and
take a look at so that's what we're
doing right here is we are going to then
take the value of cat and put it into
dog and the value of dog and put it into
the cat variable so essentially what
we're doing here is we are switching our
variables around let me show you another
example here if I have a dog named
Snickers and I have a cat named Coco and
I have a dog variable and a cat variable
what if I wanted like switch their names
because it was some sort of crazy
switching name day what we can do is
take the dog and the cat and set them to
the cat and the dog and now the dog is
going to be Coco and the cat is going to
be Snickers this thing right here will
switch them from one to another this
part here is an array this part here is
destructuring
that array in the same go okay so so far
that makes sense but what is this if we
go back to the thing that we were
stepping through here if I step through
it now what's going on here if I step
through it okay now the dog is equal to
Hugo and the cat is equal to Snickers
what's going on here now first of all
you would never write this because
that's way too confusing no one would
ever be able to understand what's going
on but what is going on here is that cat
is going to be put into dog now what is
what is cat at this line right here cat
is undefined
so if cat is undefined like when we set
it into dog it will then do what's
called a default value because these
when you destructor something and you de
structure something that might possibly
be undefined it will fall back to
whatever value you've done here
so we're saying set cats a dog but if
cat is undefined then fall back to Hugo
and that is
why the variable dog is going to be Hugo
and then at this point again let's let's
go back here where my cursor is what is
dog equal to Snickers so dog here is
going to be put into cat now it's not
gonna fall back to muff why because we
don't necessarily need that there's
there's no one to find it is reset to
Snickers so it's gonna be put in that's
why when you log dog it's gonna be equal
to Hugo because that was done to find in
cat is going to be equal to Snickers
because this one jumps there so bit of a
brain buster don't worry if you don't
totally get that because that's not code
you would write but it's kind of
interesting to learn about a few
different things that's that's going on
in es6 if you're interested in learning
more head on over to es6 io i've got a
full series of 66 I think videos of
everything you could possibly want to
learn about es6 and I think I've got at
least five videos on destructuring alone
because you can do a lot more with
renaming accessing nested objects D
structuring objects all kinds of good
stuff hopefully you like that sorry
about Snickers drunk jumping in halfway
through he doesn't do that during my
these es6 videos thanks Sarah I'll talk
to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
