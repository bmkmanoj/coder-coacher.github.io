the final one in our little mini four
video series of alignment here and it's
called aligned self now we've been
looking at one two videos ago called a
line items and by default you'll
remember that the default is stretch if
you can spell stretch and refresh you'll
see that they're stretching from top to
bottom we other have had other ones like
flex start and that will start them at
the top we have flex and and that will
start them at the end you get the point
here what I want to do real quick just
so we can see is I'm gonna leave it at
flex start and I'm just gonna give like
top box to a height or maybe not a
height you'll say padding-bottom
200 box six padding-bottom zero top box
nine fatting bottom 50 so I just wanna
like give each one like a little bit
different so that we can see that there
this is kind of how they anchor
themselves again if we switch it to flex
and they're gonna anchor themselves in
the bottom and grow up from there so
that's great but like what if you want
it just like one of these to have some
sort of other attribute there and that's
where aligned self comes in so if I take
this box nine say a line self we can say
Flex end now flex n was going to just
overwrite the Flex start so by default
we just apply it right on the container
but we can apply it on an individual
item and we can say things like flex N
and that will just overwrite that
specific use case now we can use any of
our line items one so we could say
something like Center will pop it right
in the center we also have baseline
which is going to use the font so by
default you're not going to see anything
there and we have the stretch if you
want to bring it back to that and that
will stretch just that one on across so
that is
Lyonne self it's kind of handy is
exactly like a line item and stuff you
can apply it on a case-by-case basis on
the individual flex item rather than the
entire Flex container in the next video
we're going to be looking at how we can
use flex kind of units to be able to
size our items</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
