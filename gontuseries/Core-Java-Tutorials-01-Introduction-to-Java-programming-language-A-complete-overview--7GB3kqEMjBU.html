my name is Hamish Karev and I'll be
getting you to with kochava series of
tutorials job is a programming language
based on object-oriented concepts you
can use it to build web applications
desktop applications mobile applications
for game development and practically you
can use it to program any electronic
device like washing machine TV etc
etcetera
so if you know how to write programs
using java language you possess a big
skill that everyone demands in the IT
industry in this tutorial series I'm
gonna cover everything about Java with
concepts and some sessions with
real-life analog ease
the complete course is designed for
students having no experience or a
little experience of Java and for
professionals preparing for Java
certifications I've divided the
tutorials in seven different levels and
every level will have around eight to
ten tutorials in it in this introductory
tutorial I'm going to give you a brief
idea about all these levels which will
form a good foundation for learning Java
as a whole here we can learn everything
needed to start up with Java that is how
to install Java setting up its
development environment understanding
Javas architecture writing our first
Java program and most importantly
understanding why Java is so popular in
Java everything you write is in terms of
classes and objects that is a language
is completely based on object-oriented
fundamentals object-oriented principles
are derived from nature itself so the
beauty of Java is when you write
programs you can always correlate
everything written in it with real world
so the first level will form a good
foundation for you to understand
object-oriented programming skills and
therefore the java language when you
move into this level you will be
confident enough to visualize what is
java and what is object-oriented
programming now it's a time to
some language specific basic elements
like data types access modifiers access
specifiers arrays for loops while loops
etc etc this level talks about Java
language basic elements related to
syntax before moving into the next level
you will be well-acquainted with all
basic elements of Java programming
language which you're going to use to
write Java programs in the most
effective manner Java is based on
object-oriented fundamentals in this
level we'll explore everything about
object-oriented concepts like
inheritance polymorphism etc etcetera
and we'll learn how to utilize these
concepts using java programming language
this is the most important level where
I'll cover the power of java by relating
everything what we do in java with real
world with all concepts and demos in
this level you will be learning
something called exception handling
mechanism in java in simple words it
talks about what happens to your java
program when some error occurs in it I
give you a simple example while working
on your computer if some error occurs
like computer not able to connect to
internet all of a sudden your operating
system just pops up a decent message
saying about the error that it cannot
connect to internet because of some some
reasons but doesn't really shut down the
computer at the time of error or doesn't
do something nasty with your computer in
short it handles the errors or some kind
of exceptions from usual behavior in a
decent way this is called error or
exception handling same thing will learn
in Java how you handle all exceptions or
errors in your java programs so that you
can give best experience to your end
users or clients who are going to use
your software's written in Java
programming language this level is a
favorite topic for interviewers if you
know this completely or to a greater
extent you are much confident and
prepared for any Java certification exam
or interview
using collections and maps you will
learn how to store and process data
effectively in your Java programs using
its data storage and processing
mechanisms in this level you will
understand what is a trading environment
how Java supports threads and how it is
used to improve performance you run a
Java program and it performs one
activity or task at any given point of
time like adding two numbers now using
these concepts that is using threading
concepts you can instruct a Java program
to perform more than one task at any
given point of time meaning parallel
execution of tasks which means always a
great performance
so in this level you're going to learn
everything about threads in Java and
here is the last level that is level 7
here we can learn all of the topics
which we didn't learn so far like JDBC
Java generics garbage collection memory
management in Java etc etcetera
we'll also build a sample project
covering all Java topics in the next
tutorial we'll do the first thing in
Java that is installing Java in our
computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
