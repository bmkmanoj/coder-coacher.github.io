in the earlier tutorials we talked about
introduction to hibernate we created a
basic hibernate application using
Eclipse ID and went through HP m2 DDL
dot auto property in detail in this
tutorial we are going to talk about the
most common annotations that we use in a
hibernate application with explanation
and demo for each so let's start while
creating the basic hibernate application
we learnt about two basic annotations
entity and ID and also learnt about
table annotation at present if we run
this hibernate application hibernate
would create a table with the name
student underscore information with the
column name roll number and name by
default hibernate considers the model
class variables name to generate or
interact with the tables columns what if
you want some other name to be
considered as the column name in the
student underscore information table
while performing the database operations
you would use column annotation for
doing that it's usages same like table
annotation let's see how it works
give column annotation to the name
variable here you give any name of the
column that you want hibernate to
consider other than the default variable
name let's run the program
check the output yes
hibernate has created the table student
underscore information with column names
roll number and full underscore name so
using column annotation we force
hibernate to consider full underscore
name as the column name and not the name
for creating the table and saving a
record into it before if we go further
let's check the data type for all the
columns in the student underscore
information table which is created by
hibernate using the student under screen
for model class if you observe the data
types here by default hibernate creates
the table with nullable columns except
primary key column which we mentioned
using the ID annotation so when you save
the model object into the database you
may not mention the value of a
particular column if that is nullable
but what if you specifically want a
column to be not nullable which is
desirable in almost all the applications
you would use nullable equal to false in
the column annotation so let's do that
let's make name as a not nullable column
so now it is mandatory for you to
provide the value of this column while
saving the student underscore info
object into the database and if you
won't it will throw an odd nullable
exception for this column let's rerun
the program check the output yes now it
has created the name as a not null
column in the student underscore
information table there are cases when
you would want hibernate to ignore a
particular variable residing in the
model class completely while creating
the database table or while performing
any insert update operations and for
this you would use the transient
annotation if you mention transient
annotation for any column hibernate
would completely ignore that column
while interacting with the database
let's check it out let's give transient
to the name field from the application
check the output yes
hibernate has created and inserted a
record into the table while ignoring the
name field completely this is another
very important annotation that we use in
hibernate for managing the date columns
so let's first create fun variable with
data type as date
generate getters and setters for this
variable
give the students birthdate here in the
main program
front the program check the output if
you observe the results hibernate has
created the table with birthdate column
name and created its SQL data type as
date with timestamp is the default
behavior if you write date for any
variable in Java then hibernate would
map this Java data type to the date with
timestamp in the corresponding column in
the database table what if you want just
to store date and not timestamp
in your database table or maybe you just
want timestamp and not date in your
database table and for this you would
use temporal annotation let's use that
so temporal is the annotation and inside
that you will need to mention what you
want to be considered date time stamp
times etcetera let's give it the date
from the program check the output we can
see that now hibernate has created and
saved the student under screen for
object into the table
considering data type for birthday
column as date without timestamp in the
next tutorial we'll see how to make
hibernate generate the primary key
automatically for any row insertion in
the table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
