in the earlier tutorial we learn three
approaches to include life cycle methods
or callbacks in spring project now in
this tutorial we will learn an important
concept in spring and that is a beam
post processor a beam post processor as
its name indicates is simply a glass
which allows you to modify a beans
instance or perform any task once it is
created or initialized by spring
container in simple words you write a
certain piece of code in a beam post
processor and spring execute this piece
of code after initializing each and
every being provided in springs
configuration file say you have 10 beam
definitions in spring configuration file
and for 10 times thus common piece of
code will be executed by spring
framework and that's all about a beam
post processor now in what situations
you wish to provide a custom logic after
beans initialization and how is it
different from in it life cycle event of
a beam everything about a beam post
processor we will walk through with this
demo so this is what we performed in the
earlier tutorial while going through
life cycle events we wrote a test class
a restaurant glass and springs
configuration file in the restaurant
class we provided two methods in it and
destroy and here in Springs
configuration files with an it method
attribute and destroy a method attribute
we just let Spring Framework know that
we have written in it and destroy
methods in restaurant class which are to
be considered as lifecycle events or
callbacks now what we will do is we will
write a common code using a beam post
processor which will be called after
every beans initialization by string
container so for this what we need is
simply write a separate class
implementing a bean post processor
interface so let's do that go to
package and click on new class give a
name to this class demo beam
post-processor alright so this is the
class which eclipse has created for us
now we got to implement beam post
processor in this class beam post
processor alright so this is giving
error because we haven't yet implemented
the methods provided by this interface
let's do that so these are the two
methods which we have implemented from
the beam post processor interface this
method will be called after a beam is
initialized completely by spring as per
its definition in springs configuration
file but before in it lifecycle event
for that beam and this method will be
called just after init lifecycle even
for tapping if you observe here both
methods provide two arguments to us one
is the actual beam instance and the
other one is the beam name which means
the methods will provide you an access
to actual beam instance for which spring
has called these two methods so actual
beam instance is provided to you in
these two methods you do whatever you
wish to do with this beam instance like
modifying any of its property you
provided in its beam definition
instincts configuration file or simply
set any of its additional properties
with its setter methods or any other
tasks like loading of data from some
remote server or a JMS queue any task
which you wish to perform here with the
beam instance and in the end just return
this modified being instance back in
both functions so let's do that
so this is actually an instance so
replace the snow with the bean instance
practically you can write any piece of
code in these two functions one method
will be called before in it lifecycle
event and the other will be called after
in it lifecycle event of a bean instance
but the most recommended usage of a bean
post processor is to just extend or
override the definition of a bean
provided in the springs configuration
file by modifying the bean instances
let's provide SOPs in both the functions
call it so we have provided here so when
we would execute this program it will
print processing bean instance before
initialization which means after spring
instance bean and before any type cycle
event of the swing and here it will
print processing bean instance after
initialization that is this method will
get executed just after init lifecycle
event of the beam for which this method
is going to execute so what we in post
processor class is ready now let's put
its entry in the springs catification
file go to the springs configuration
file and put its entry with this syntax
so here with this entry
you are telling Spring Framework that
there is some class with an in spring
project it is implementing a bean post
processor and spring needs to execute
the function suite and in it after every
beans initialization so the demo for
bean post processor is ready let's go to
the test class and run the application
here the output clearly shows that
string called two methods which are
written in demo bean purse processor
class before and after in it
lifecycle event for the restaurant bean
now there is an important point you
should know about a bean post processor
you can write any number of bean post
processor classes in your spring project
and provide the order in which spring
executes all after every beans
initialization we will explore it in
depth in our next tutorial guys thanks
