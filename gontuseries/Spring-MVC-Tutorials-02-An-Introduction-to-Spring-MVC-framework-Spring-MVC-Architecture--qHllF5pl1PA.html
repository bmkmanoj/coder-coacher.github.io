welcome you to gone to series in the
earlier tutorial
I explained the concept of MSE along
with a real-life analogy in this
tutorial I'm going to tell what exactly
is a spring MVC framework and how it
makes developers write web applications
which are based on MVC guidelines in
short the overall workflow of a spring
MVC web application so let's start
spring MVC is a web application
development framework based on and we
see guidelines it's like any other
popular and we see frameworks available
till date like starts - and many others
but still sometimes it becomes
developers first choice over others
because of its support to a simple yet
the most powerful feature and that is
inversion of control or the dependency
injection if you don't know what is di
or inversion of control you can go
through first few tutorials of my series
on Spring Framework all right now let's
start up with looking at how an overall
web application developed using a spring
framework looks like say this is your
application which you have developed
using spring MVC framework in this you
have something called as a front
controller when an end-user request for
a web page by putting some URL say this
on the browser and hits enter the
request is received by the sky this is
the main guy who controls the complete
applications flow and has many helpers
around it to get the work done
each helper is going to do a certain
specific task and returns the result
back to it with the help of all its
helpers the front controllers job is to
prepare and send the response that is
HTML along with data back to the crime's
browser immediately after getting the
request it passes on they request to one
of its helper guy called as a handler
mapping it service total front
controller what this request is all
about it will simply scan the URL and
tell front controller the complete
address of the guy who can generate data
for the webpage which an end user has
requested for it's something similar to
the situation you are standing on the
roadside and someone comes to you and
ask sir can you please tell me the exact
address of the guy who sells gift items
in this area and you tell him the exact
address of the best gift item shop
located in that area based on the gift
item which he wants to purchase and
that's what the handler mapping does
based on the information provided by
handler mapping the front controller
just passes on the request to the
specific guy who is going to generate
the data for this specific webpage
request this guy just prepares the data
and typically creates a Java object to
hold this data it may contain some
business logic to generate data or it
may get data state away from the
database also it may call some other
Java classes to do this job
once it prepares the Java object holding
data it sends it back to the front
controller in addition to the Java
object
holding data it sends one more thing to
the front controller and that is the
name of the component which is going to
retrieve data from this Java object
along with mixing it with HTML to
prepare the actual response it's
something similar to the situation the
person who asked for the address of the
gift shop to you reaches to the shop as
per your guidance the shop guy gives him
the item but doesn't grab it using a
cave trap but while giving the item to
the person the sharp guy tells the name
of a person who can give trap this
particular item now again the person
doesn't have the exact address of the
guy who is going to give grab the item
but yes he knows the name of the cave
trapper in the same way the front
controller is having a Java object which
is to be consumed by some component
whose name is available but not the
actual address where it is located in
the application in order to frame the
response so it sends his name to another
helper guy called as a few resolver who
tells the exact address of the sky to
the front and Tora
now the front controller has a Java
object it is holding data and the exact
address of the guy who is going to
generate the actual response which is to
be sent to the clients browser by
putting up this data into an HTML code
so it sends the Java object to this guy
and this guy simply retrieves the data
from the Java object and puts it into
the HTML code in the desired fashion and
returns it to the front controller the
front controller now sends this as a
response to the clients browser and the
browser happily displays it this guy is
called as a view component the Java
object holding data is called as the
model component the guy who is returning
the model object along with the name of
the view is called as a controller the
front controller is also called as the
dispatcher servlet in a spring MVC
framework the view component is
typically a JSP page but you may use
some other popular technologies as well
instead of it say velocity free maker
etc this is the complete for flow
of a web application developed using
spring MVC framework in the next
tutorial we'll set up the development
environment for creating our first
spring MVC application guys I thank you
