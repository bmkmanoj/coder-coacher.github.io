welcome you to gone to series in the
last tutorial I explained you the
concept of transient persistence and the
that states of an object in hibernate
application the concept I explained was
very simple an object which is created
using a numerator is considered as a
transient object till the statement you
associate that object with the hibernate
session an object in a transient state
simply means that it is not yet
associated with any hibernate session
and the second most important thing is
there is no corresponding record present
in the database table for a transient
object once you associate a transient
object with the hibernate session as I'm
doing over here the state of a transient
object changes from transient to a new
state known as a post system state and
the object will remain in the persistent
state till the statement you close the
session and the good thing about an
object in a persistent state which you
saw very clearly in the earlier tutorial
was that whenever you make any
modification to a persistent object
hibernate would make sure to sync up all
that modification with a corresponding
record which is present in the database
table by firing an update query so this
is the most important property of a
persistent object when you close a
session the state of a persistent object
again changes from persists into a new
state known as a detach state an object
in a desired state simply means that
there is a corresponding record present
in the database table for it but is not
associated with any hibernate session so
in short an object in a transient state
is not having any corresponding record
present in the database table and is not
associated with a hibernate
an object in a persisting state is
having a corresponding record present in
the database table and is associated
with a hibernate session an object in
indeed at state is having a
corresponding record present in the
database table bird is not associated
with any hibernate session all right so
so far so good let's proceed further
here I showed you an example of all
these states using a save function that
is when you insert a recording to the
database table what about a case when
you would retrieve a record from the
database table using the gate function
let me quickly take off all these lines
from here and paste here these two
statements here a written code to
retrieve a student record which is
having student value ideas too from the
student table which means this record so
when I will run this - it application
hibernate would fetch the student record
which is having students are you ideas -
from the student table and you know all
that in detail because we covered all
database operations including gate
function in the previous tutorials but
the point to note over here is hibernate
says when you get an object using gate
function that object lives in a
persistent state and the object would
steal in persistent state then the point
you lose the session and you know the
best thing about persistent state once
an object is in a persistent state after
that if you make any modification to
that object hibernate would make sure to
sync up that modification with the
corresponding record present in the
database table by firing an update query
say for example if I paste this
statement here what will happen before
this hibernate application hibernate
would retrieve the student record which
is having students
new ideas - from the student table then
it will display the student name for the
waived student record then after seeing
this statement it will fire an update
query to modify the student name from
gone to one - modifying student name
having student ID values - because of
the persistent state of this student
object let me quickly run it and show
you this in the logs if you observe it
fired a select query for this cat
function then it displayed the student
name for the retrieved student object
then it fired an update query for this
statement let us check in the database
whether it has done things as per our
expectation or not cool it has modified
the name from gone to one - modifying
student name having student ID as - for
student ID - student record cool now one
last thing what will happen if I write
this statement here here I'm simply
deleting the student record which is
having student value ideas - from the
student table bypassing the student
object to the delete function the point
to note here is hibernate says if you
pass a persistent object to the delete
function then the state of that object
would change from persistent to the
transient State and this is very
important to know about in the next
tutorial I would cover the detach state
of a hibernate object in a little more
depth guys thank you for liking my
tutorials if you have any queries or
feedback please put them below the video
