learning Java in the previous tutorial
we installed JDK that is Java
development kit now we're going to
perform one more important step which
will complete the Java installation on
your computer and that is setting the
path environment variable on your
computer this step is not mandatory but
still we are doing it we will understand
its importance while running the Java
program in the immediate subsequent
tutorial alright so let's do it first
click on start button right click on my
computer and choose properties and then
go to advanced system settings and then
click on environment variables here
search for the variable with the name
path
double click on it and just append the
existing strength with the path where
you have installed Java on your computer
in the last tutorial I installed JDK on
this path I will add this path here in
the path environment variable to be more
precise I will add this path up to Bing
directory of Java installation
click on OK and you are done this
completes all steps for Java
installation the question is why we set
this path variable after installing Java
platform even when it is not mandatory
to set it for running a Java program
then why setting it I will give its
answer in the next tutorial that is
running a Java program guys please like
this video if it maybe help you and
don't forget to subscribe to my youtube
channel gone to series and I'm going to
catch you in my next tutorial that is
running a Java program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
