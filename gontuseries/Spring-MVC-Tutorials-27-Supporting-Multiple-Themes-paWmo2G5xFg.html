welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial we can learn how to support
multiple themes in a spring MVC web
application let me explain what exactly
is my requirement I wish to support two
themes for this web page write theme and
green theme red theme means to display
color of this text student admission
firm for engineering courses in red
color and green theme means to display
color of this same text in green color
and for this I would place two links on
top of this web page with the name of
red and green so the idea is when a user
request for this rapid by default this
text would be shown in green color means
using Queen theme and later user can
click on any of the links a red or green
to change its color from green to red or
vice versa
no big question is what does I need to
perform to make this happen nice to do
so I just need to perform these three
simple steps and I will be done first I
need to include these three beings in
the springs configuration file and then
I need to put red and green links along
with this statement in the admission
form dot JSP file and then I need to
include two properties files with their
related style shades for the two themes
which I wish to support for the
application means for writing and for
green theme so let me very quickly make
all these changes in the application and
later I'll explain every single step
mentioned here in detail so this is the
Sphynx configuration file and here and
then I'm going to add these two beans
theme source and theme resolver
and here on top of Springs configuration
file I have added third beam which is
basically an interceptor with an ink
clean change intercept er as per the
first step so here I have added theme
resolver theme source and on top of this
configuration file I have added theme
change interceptor being now in that
mission form torches B file I have here
added two links green and red and this
statement as per the second step and
here I have added two properties first
theme green dot properties theme red dot
properties and their related style
sheets style green and style red in that
application as per the third step so let
me show you this concept working on the
browser and later I'll explain all these
things which have just performed in the
application guys to reflect all these
changes which I've just made in the
application I got to restart the server
so stop it and restart it again so
server is started again now let's check
it on the browser now after making all
these changes let's see what happens
when I request for this same web page
cool it's displaying its color in green
color and also showing red and green
links on top of this web page now let's
see what happens when I click on a red
link cool it's displaying it in red
color and when I click on green it's
displaying its color in green now let's
understand what all things we performed
in the application in detail in the
inhibition form gorgeous be fair if you
observe we added green and red links and
with these two links
passing here a parameter side theme
equals green and side theme equals red
so when a user clicks on any of these
two links this vapid request for itself
and along with that request it sends a
parameter with a named side theme equals
red or green to the server now on the
server side before processing that a
quest this Interceptor which we added
extracts the value of site theme and
accordingly informs spring MVC
application to pick an appropriate theme
related properties file and it's
corresponding stylesheet and prepares
the response accordingly so when I click
on a red link this vapid sends a
parameter site theme equals red to the
server and here this interceptor
extracts its value and informs the
spring MVC application to pick this
properties file theme - red dot
properties and here this statement then
would start looking for stylesheet
placeholder in that chosen properties
file so what are value this placeholder
has this application will pick this
stylesheet placed at that location so
the application is going to pick this
stylesheet means that a dot CSS file
means this stylesheet style red dot CSS
and then sends this style sheet along
with the response object back to the
clients browser and as I said I see web
page which is displaying color of this
text in red color and same is the case
with green ring because in all this
explanation I didn't explain you the
meaning of these two beans which I added
theme source and theme solver because
the purpose of team source pain means
pursue
theme source is to load all properties
files placed in the project which have
theme - as perfect in their names now
what's the purpose of cookie theme is
all wrapping because it's masked to put
an entry of this being in the springs
configuration file otherwise theme
change interceptor beam
won't work now in addition to this
cookie thing resolver bean serves one
more purpose which I have put on the
screen try to understand it and if you
find any difficulty understanding it
please put all your queries in the
comment section below and I'll try to
resolve them as earliest as possible
alright
