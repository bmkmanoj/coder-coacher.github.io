in the earlier tutorials we talked about
on how to make a function in restful web
service accepts multiple parameters sent
by the client in the HTTP URL as a path
parameters in this tutorial we are going
to talk about on how restful web service
accepts multiple parameters sent by the
client in the HTTP URL as a query
parameters or a query string before we
go through this demo let us see what do
we mean by a query parameter in the HTTP
URL if a client mentions the parameters
in the HTTP URL in the format of a query
string then the parameters listed in the
URL are known as a query parameters for
example in this URL the client has
passed two parameters 23 and 45 if the
parameters are passed in the URL and are
listed in this particular fashion that
is all parameters appears in the end
after question mark symbol and one
parameter is separated from other using
the ampersand symbol then those
parameters are known as the query
parameters all right let's go to this
demo for clear understanding the client
would call a gate function
catch students info residing in the
University restful web service using
this HTTP URL these are the roll numbers
of the students which client would pass
to the restful web services function as
a query parameters or a query string and
then the restful web service would
receive these parameters and map them to
its functions parameters and send the
same roll numbers of the students back
to the grind as a response that said
this is the demo we saw a last tutorial
about how to accept multiple path
parameters from a HTTP URL sent by the
client using path param annotation I
would delete of this existing function
and would create the new one for this
demo just to save some time I already
have written the function let us go
through it fully declined would access
this function
using this URL this function would
extract these query parameters using 3d
param annotation and map them to the
strings student row number one and
student row number two the query param
annotation binds the value of a HTTP
query parameter to a resource method
parameter so function is ready let's run
it on the server and test this page
there you are in your browser and press
Enter
yes the restful web service has accepted
the multiple parameters sent by the
client in the HTTP URL as a query
parameters in the next tutorial we'll
talk about on how a restful web service
accepts multiple parameters sent by the
client in the HTTP URL as a matrix
parameter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
