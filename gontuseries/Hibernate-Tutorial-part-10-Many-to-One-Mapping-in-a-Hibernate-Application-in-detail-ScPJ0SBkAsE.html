welcome you to gone to series in the
early tutorials we learned the concept
of one-to-one mapping in detail nothing
to learn the concept of a magnitude 1
mapping in a hibernate application
before I go and hit demo let's see what
exactly is a many to one mapping between
two tables in a database table a is set
to have a many to one relationship with
table B if many records which are
present in table a can be linked to a
single record which is present in table
B and table B is said to have a
one-to-many relationship with table a if
a single record in table B is linked to
0 1 or many records which are present in
table a say you have two tables in the
database student and student address
clearly many records in the student
table are linked to a single record in
the student address table so student is
having a many to one relationship which
student address table and student
address is having a one-to-many
relationship with student table and this
is the map in column what it means is
just by looking at this column you are
able to figure out which record of
student table is linked to which record
of student address table so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to establish
the same relationship at Java code level
using a Manitou one mapping concept I've
already created these two tables in my
database so let's have a look at them
here student address table is having two
columns address ID and address detail
columns and student table is having
three columns student ID student name
and student address address ID columns
here this column will only accept the
values which are present in address ID
column of student
table so now I'm going to do is I'm
going to establish the exact
relationship which we just established
at the database level between student
and student address tables at the java
code level in the hibernate classes just
to save some time I've already created a
very simple demo doing it here I've
created a student class which is
representing the student table a student
address class which is representing the
student address table and a main class
will simply write code to test this
application so now I have two Java
classes which are representing two
database tables student and student
address now only one pending task here
is to specify that student class is
having a many to one mapping or a
relationship with student address class
and this we do with the help of a magnet
one annotation for this just add a
reference of a student address class
with it scatters and CETIS methods here
and on top of it
just mentioned a magnet on annotation
and yadda
so with this annotation what i am
telling hibernate is just include a
column with the name student address
address ID name in the student class
having a magnitude on mapping with
address ID column which is present in
the student address class let's test
this application just to save some time
I've already written a test class for it
here I'm first creating a student
address object then creating two student
objects and in two student objects I am
assigning the reference of student
address object and these are the magic
lines here I've just written code for
inserting two student objects into the
student table but when you run the
application hibernate will first insert
a student address object into the
student address table and then it will
insert
these two student objects into the
student table while inserting records
into the student table it will itself
take care of mapping the student records
with a linked student address a god that
is it will automatically use the value
of address high D which it generated for
the student address object while
inserting the record into the student
address table for the student address
address addict column of student objects
here hibernate is able to perform this
mapping task itself only because you
have told it to do so by establishing a
Manitou one mapping in the student class
let's run and check this
yes hibernate has inserted a record into
the student address table and also two
records into the student table in the
next tutorial we will learn the concept
of a bi-directional many-to-one
one-to-many mapping in hibernate
application guys a big thank you for
liking my tutorials on hibernate I
welcome all your queries comments and
feedback down the video or send me an
email on this ID your any sort of
interaction make me upload more and more
videos so keep them up to comments
emails or sharing the information across
like the video if you really liked it
and I'm going to catch you in my next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
