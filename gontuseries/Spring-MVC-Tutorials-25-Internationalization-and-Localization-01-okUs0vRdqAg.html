welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial we learn something called has
internationalization and localization
will be help of some of the concepts
which you have already learned in the
previous tutorials like an interceptor
concept spring massive source and some
more the process of creating or
developing a web application in such a
general manner that it can handle or
support more than one language is known
as an internationalization process in
such a general proper application when
you add a new language support you say
you are localizing your web application
for that language guys this is kind of
very abstract definition I have given
over here let me explain these terms in
a detailed way with the help of a very
simple requirement which I have in this
demo application so let's start at
prison
this whole damn application is hard
white in English means it's all in
English language
now what if 50% of visitors of this damn
application want to view this web page
in English and remaining 50% in French
so what I would do in such a situation
to tackle such a requirement what I do
I would simply support French as well in
this web application in addition to
English so whosoever wants to view this
vapid English I would show content of
this web page in English and whosoever
wants to view this web page in French
for them I would show its content in
French language not big question is what
does I need to perform to make this
application support one more language
and that is French that's most of the
things we have already done in the
previous tutorials to make this
application support multiple languages
you remember we included a properties
file with the name student messages dot
properties in the previous tutorials
after put
a message source beam here in the spangs
configuration file guys this is the only
concept or thing we would need to
fulfill the specific requirement which
we have in this demo in just a couple of
moments I will show you how guys
this is this JSP page for which we want
to support french as well as english
means two languages if you observe here
in this JSP file all labels are
hardwired in english so four stars that
i'm going to do here is I would put
placeholders for all these labels one by
one
and put the corresponding values in this
properties file that is student messages
dot properties so let's start placing
all labels with the corresponding
placeholders for this JSP file for
students named label I have here
replaced it with label dot student name
placeholder now let's put this
placeholders value here in this
properties file as well cool in the
similar manner let's replace other
labels too for the corresponding
placeholders because I've already done
it just to save some time so here I will
place all labels with the corresponding
placeholders now let's put these labels
matching values in this properties file
as well cool so here I am done with
replacing all hard white english labels
with their corresponding placeholders
and have put all matching placeholders
values and this properties file now
let's test it upon the browser cool
after this change server has sent me
this response for this URL but this time
all these labels values are actually not
coming from this JSP file
straightforward but are coming from this
properties file yes since this
properties file is containing all key
value pairs you know which is supporting
English language so I'm going to replace
its name with the
student messages underscore en dot
properties cool because after this
change now this application is able to
support multiple languages for this just
be file to support French language all I
need to do is include a new properties
file and this folder you know the way we
added student messages underscore en for
English we need to add a properties file
with the name student messages
underscore FR dot properties for french
language and that's it so let me do the
properties file here cool now let's copy
all these placeholders here now we go to
replace these placeholders English
values with the matching French values
so just to save some time I've already
done it cool so here I have replaced all
English values with a matching French
values so now we have two properties
file in this damn application one
student messages and ESCO en and other
one student messages under school fr is
after this change now this application
supports two languages and that is
French and English for this she has big
fire let's test this on the browser
let us every browser has a language
preference setting feature provided in
it for example in Chrome a user can
provide his preference about what
language he prefers over other languages
while viewing the web pages for example
in Chrome this setting has been provided
here
go to settings
and then go to languages and input
settings here if user has provided
French as the preferred language over
English then the content of the web page
would be shown in French and if he has
provided English as a preferred language
over French then the content of the page
would be shown in an English language so
in this tutorial we learned how to
support multiple languages in a spring
MVC web application for any GSP file in
the next tutorial we can learn some more
advanced features related to
internationalization and localization
guys a big thank you for learning spring
MVC with me if you have any feedback or
