welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial I will show how to support
eczema format
for the rest he is which we developed so
far in this spring MC project in these
two wear safety eyes then so far we have
been supporting only one format and that
is JSON for these restive guys and now
what we want we want to support one more
format and that is XML format in
addition to JSON format for this quest
api's so let's start because if you
remember when we supported JSON format
for these rest APIs what are steps we
performed well the only step which we
performed was to include these three
jars on to the class part of this
project means we included these features
under live folder of this spring MVC
project and we were done so after that
step spring MVC framework automatically
started supporting JSON format for these
REST API
now when we want to support XML format
exactly same kind of steps we need to
perform we got to go to the word we got
to download some charge and we got to
include here under live folder and then
after Spring Framework is going to you
know automatically the supporting XML
format for these rest api is so question
is which jar we got to download from web
which is will to support XML format for
these by Stieg case well the only jar
which we need is jackson data format xml
and that's all about it
so let's very quickly get discharge from
the web and thereafter i'll show how to
use that jar to support XML format for
these rest api so let's go to google and
type church Jackson
their format example it will take us to
the even depository for the same and
here if you observe it's showing us
radius versions of Jackson data format
xml jar in which are currently available
in the maven repository so which version
we are going to use well it depends on
which spring version you are using in
your spring MVC project because I'm here
using spring 42 release and the
compatible version for this thing you
know for Jackson data format XML is to 8
one so I'm going to make use of this
version for this jar and in your case of
choose an appropriate version you know
according to which spring version you
are using alright so let me click over
here and here we have reached to Jackson
data format xml to it one version so to
get this jar i just got to click on this
link and it will start downloading this
jar for me now an important point to
understand here is even after
downloading this charge and including on
to the glass part of this project still
the project is not going to support xml
format it will show some kind of errors
when you request it to you know send
response in XML format why the reason is
this char further depends on few other
charge for this charge to work properly
you have to download those jars as well
if these are the six jars on which this
charge depends so you got to download
these charge and set now if you look at
first teachers Jackson code Jackson
annotations and Jackson data fine
well these features we have already
present in our workspace
so these jars we included when we
supported JSON format for this spring
MVC project so we just got to include
these three jars which we do not have
correctly in our spring MVC project so I
would click here the link for the same
and here I would click on download
download download these features as well
cool so we have downloaded these four
jars so this chart we wanted to download
Jackson data format and because this
chart further depends on these features
so we downloaded these features hazard
now let's include these four jars onto
the classpath of this project copy so
these are the charge which we have just
downloaded let's copy them and paste it
here under live folder cool see data
format Jack's P annotations and then
Stags to and then wood stocks these are
the folds a switch we just downloaded
and we have kept under the live folder
so now we have all judge present in this
project onto the class pad which we need
to support XML for these Brazilians very
quickly start the server and test these
rest API is for XML support let's to
test these to restate case for XML
support I am going to make use of
postman tool which I showed you know how
to use in the last tutorial
soap launch postman let's go to Google
Chrome click on apps button and here
it's showing all the extensions of this
Chrome browser so from here from this
list I'm going to choose postman
extension and it's going to launch
postman for me and here it is here I
want to test this REST API
now this SJP I demand that I make get
requests on it so let me choose here get
option which happens to be the first
option now thing is when I'm going to
make a HTTP request on this REST API
what's going to happen the request is
going to be received by this REST API
controller method and now point is this
REST API controller method supports JSON
format as well as XML format so in what
format it's going to prepare and send
the response but when a REST API
controller method supports more than one
format then it's clients responsibility
to specify along with the request in
what format it wants to view the
response so here in this case client
need to specify here while making the
request in what format it wants server
to respond JSON format or XML format and
how it can send that information along
with the request but it has to attach a
header with a key except along with this
request to the server and how to do that
I have to go to the head is tab and here
you have to include a key with the name
except with its value as application
slash eczema now if you want to request
server case over please send me response
in XML format then you write your
application slash XML and here if you
want to request server to send response
in JSON format in that case right here
application slash JSON so because we
want to first test
excellent support so let's keep your
application slash eczema for exit key
and now let's make the request so when
I'm going to press ENTER it's going to
make HTTP GET request on this West APA
and along with this request it's going
to send a key and a value
you know except with its earliest
application slash eczema to this server
cool
so here server has sent us the response
in the XML format this
now this REST API supports XML in
addition to JSON format and this is
proof for the same
now let's request for the response in
JSON format a changing application slash
XML to application slash JSON see here
now this time server has sent response
in JSON format in the similar ways we
can test this second REST API as well
here let's type the mean in the end make
a get request we want a response in JSON
format so we've got response in JSON
format and when we type here XML instead
of JSON will get responsive XML format
so that's how we are able to get
response in the desired format from the
server it's in the next tutorial we will
learnabout a very important argument
known with the name produces which we
pass to request mapping annotation which
helps us restricting a particular REST
API controller method to support only
one format and not more than one format
all right there is a big thank you for
learning REST API concepts using spring
MVC framework with me if you have any
feedback or any constructive comment
please provide them below the video or
simply write to me using this with

I'm going to catch in the next part of
