in the last lesson we went to the
concepts of web services in general we
saw what exactly web services means to
us in this lesson we'll see web services
in little more depth we all learned that
client and server is the architecture
for web services client is a service
consumer and server is a service
provided by service provider we means
that Web Services is deployed in this
server and web services is having some
functions in it which it has open to
rest of the world on internet here for
example let's say there are four
functions 1 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 which this Web
Services has open to rest of the world
on internet for this climb to get access
to any of these functions lying in the
web services there are few things that
it needs to know beforehand it needs to
know the Machine address of the server
where we have deployed the web services
and it should know about some more basic
information about this web services for
example what all functions this Web
Services has to offer
what is the signature of each open
function what are the standards and
protocols used by this web services etc
etc we'll be talking about all these
details in our upcoming tutorials for
now we would just see the importance of
having this detail all these details
service provider captures in a file
which is XML file are known as a WSDL
file web services description language
and makes this file available to the
client and then with the help of this
file client will be able to access the
web services I would just reframe what
we have learned so far we saw that
client would need a file known as WSDL
file in
to access the web services
now there comes a question how client is
able to locate WSDL file on internet for
a particular service provider now there
are two answers to this one is if
service provider knows the crime then
service provider directly gives this
file to the crime and then client can
access the web services using this file
and second is there is an entity called
uddi on internet
it's a directory on internet we're all
service provider who wants to issue
their web services on internet would
first need to register the web services
with uddi using WSDL so here is how it
goes first of all all service providers
register their web services with uddi
using their WSDL files and then any
client who is looking for a particular
service would go and hit uddi
and would search for a particular
service that is looking for uddi would
return all service providers who offers
that service and then client will choose
one service provider in the list
provided and then we'll get W STL file
of that service provider form UDI and
then with the help of this file client
is able to access the web services to
derive the conclusion this is what we
saw service provider will provide the W
STL file to uddi the client will get
this file from uddi and then when the
help of w HL client is able to access
the web services
so so far we have learned that there are
two ways of accessing web services for a
client one is direct way which is
getting WSDL file directly from the
service provider and second is getting
WSDL file of a particular service
provider form you to di so so far we
have seen the concepts of web services
in general and now we are ready to get
our hands dirty with using Java
implementation for web services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
