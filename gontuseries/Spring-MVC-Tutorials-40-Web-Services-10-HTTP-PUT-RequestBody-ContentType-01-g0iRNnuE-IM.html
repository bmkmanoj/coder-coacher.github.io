guys my name is incacha Cara and I will
come in to gone to series so far in the
rest series we learnt about how to
develop those kind of rest api is which
demands clients to make HTTP GET type of
requests on them now in this tutorial we
are going to learn about how to develop
those kind of fresh KPIs which would
demand clients to make HTTP put kind of
requests on them and in addition to that
we are also going to talk about the use
of request body annotation and large the
content type request header so let's
start guys before I proceed further and
explain everything in this tutorial let
me ask you base equation in what
scenarios you want to develop rest api
is which demands get type of requests to
be made on them but you would want to
develop such kind of rustic-y a is for
only those kind of scenarios where you
want clients to read some data which is
available at the server side now same
question for put kind of request in what
scenarios you want to develop rest api
is which demands put type of request to
be made on them but you want to develop
such line of rest api is in only those
kind of scenarios where you want climes
to update certain information which is
kept at the server side let me explain
you this whole concept by taking a very
basic example from this damn application
which we have developed so far so here
what is my requirement is that Clyde
should be able to modify a specific
students record which is present at the
server means add this applications
so I want to basically develop this REST
API which I want to give to the clients
so that clients would make a put request
on this REST API and in this REST API
itself clients would need to specify the
name of the student which they want to
modify at the server side and along with
the request clients would also need to
specify the information maybe in the
JSON format or in the XML format which
they want to update you know which
corresponds to this particular student
at the server side so question is what
does I need to perform in the
application to develop this REST API
well the only task that I need to
perform to develop this recipe is to
include a new REST API controller method
in the student info REST API controller
dot Java class so let us do one thing
let me include this new REST API
controller method in the student info
REST API controller dot Java class and
it is I would explain every single
related concept in detail all right so
let's start so here I am done with
including this new REST API controller
method to develop this REST API so after
developing this REST API
you know after including this RSVP
controller method here now when a client
is going to make a put request on this
REST API and then it is going to send
some specific information you know in
the JSON or in the XML format along with
this request this application is going
to make a call to this STP controller
method because of this request Mapple
annotation so once this controller
method is called this part variable
annotation is simply going to extract
the value of name
from the REST API which client has used
to make the request and is going to
assign the same to the student variable
which is present after path variable
annotation and this is going to work in
on this overall concept of path variable
is going to work exactly the same way as
I explained you in the earlier tutorials
while explaining you things about this
rest api now what is this request body
annotation going over here this if you
notice for this request to be successful
clangs send some information either in
JSON format or in the XML format to the
server now what request body annotation
does if it finds that the information
has come in the JSON format then it
simply makes use of JSON related jars
which are present on the class part of
this project to convert JSON information
into its equivalent java object that is
this student object and if it finds that
the information has come in the XML
format then it simply makes use of XML
related jars which are present on the
class path of this budget to convert XML
message into its equivalent Java object
that is this student object so request
body annotation performs only one job
you know converting JSON format into
it's ignorant Java object or XML format
into its equivalent java object so in
whichever format data has come along
with this request request body
annotation is simply going to convert
into its equivalent job object that is
this student object this is what request
body performs now inside this what this
rusty page controller method is doing
well
here it's trying to find out the
matching student record using student
name from the database and once it has
been successfully able to find out the
matching student record from the
database it's going to simply update
that student record using this
information which client has sent along
with the request so if this controller
method is successfully able to update
the information into the database it's
simply going to return true otherwise
it's computer false so this is what this
overall REST API controller method is
performing the only thing panning here
is to test this REST API in the next
tutorial I will make use of postman tool
to test this rule II develop REST API
and in addition to that we are also
going to learn about content type
request header which client needs to
make use of while making the request for
this REST API
alright guys a big thank you for
learning REST API concepts using spring
MVC framework with me if you have any
feedback or any constructive comment
