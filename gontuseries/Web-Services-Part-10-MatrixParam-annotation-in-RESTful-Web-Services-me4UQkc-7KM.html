in the audio tutorials we talked about
on how to make a function in restful web
service accepts multiple parameters sent
by the client in the HTTP URL as a query
parameters and path parameters in this
tutorial we are going to talk about on
how restful web service would accept
multiple parameters sent by the client
in the HTTP URL as the matrix parameters
before we go to this demo let us see
what do we mean by a matrix parameter in
the HTTP URL matrix parameters are
another way of defining parameters to be
added to the actual path of the resource
this is an example of a matrix parameter
HTTP URL in this the client has passed
two parameters 23 and 45 if the
parameters are passed in the URL and are
listed in this particular fashion that
is one parameter is separated from other
parameter using semicolon symbol and
parameters may appear anywhere in the
path and are not limited to its end
then those parameters are known as the
matrix parameters these are a few more
examples of matrix parameters where the
parameters are appearing with the path
segments in the middle of the HTTP URI
and at the end of the path of the HTTP
URI so this was all about matrix
parameters definition in general but
till date the current implementation
specs of fresh full web services like
Jersey rest easy etcetera
do not talk much about matrix parameters
usage with the rest api is when they
appear in the middle and not at the end
of the URL so I would just ignore and
proceed without considering the suspect
further in the demo all right let's go
to this Jamo for
understanding the client would call a
gate function get student info assigning
the university restful web service using
this HTTP URL these are the roll numbers
of the students which client would pass
to the restful web services function as
the matrix parameters and then the
restful web service would receive these
parameters and map them to its function
parameters and send the same roll
numbers of the students back to the
client as the response that's at this is
the demo we saw in last tutorial about
how to accept multiple query parameters
from an HTTP URL sent by the client
using query param annotation I would
delete off this existing function and
would create the new one for this demo
just to save some time I already have
written this function let us go through
it fully the client would access this
function using this URL this function
would extract these matrix parameters
using matrix param annotation and map
them to the strings student roll number
one and student roll number two the
matrix param annotation binds the value
of a HTTP matrix parameter to a resource
method parameter so a function is ready
let's run it around the server and
destice paste a URL in your browser and
press Enter yes the restful web service
has accepted the multiple parameters
sent by the client in the HTTP URL as a
matrix parameters in the next tutorial
we'll talk about how a restful web
service accepts multiple parameters sent
by the client in the HTTP URL as a form
