welcome you to con 2 series in this
tutorial we are going to learn about an
annotation with a name rest controller
but helps us improving the readability
of a REST API spring MVC project so
let's start ok so far in the rest series
what we have learned we have learned how
to design and develop these to rest
api's for this first api we included
this REST API controller method in the
student admission controller dot Java
class and for this rest api we included
this REST API controller method in the
student admission controller dot Java
class so now when I make a get request
using this REST API the response is
going to be produced and sent by this
REST API controller method and when I
specify name of a specific student
within the REST API itself and make a
get request using you know such a REST
API the response is going to be produced
and send by this REST API controller
method and whatever I've just described
in a very brief manner I explained in
detail till the last tutorial now let's
proceed further and try to learn in this
tutorial how rest controller annotation
helps us improving the readability of a
spring embassy REST API project so it's
that case everything is perfect
with student ignition controller dot
java class except one point which is
bothering me a lot which is making me a
little uncomfortable as a developer and
the point is here we have mixed two kind
of controller methods in one controller
class one kind of controller methods
which are annotated with response body
annotation
means these controller methods are
associated with REST API concept and the
other kind of controller methods which
are non-response body
annotated controller methods means these
controller methods are not associated
with REST API concept so if you are
going to mix these kind of controller
methods in one controller class in a
single controller class then you are
going to create a lot of confusion for
developers who are going to work on such
kind of projects because for developers
it becomes very challenging you know
kind of become very difficult to manage
controller classes having mix of these
kind of controller methods it is always
advisable to separate them out in
separate controller classes so what you
should do you should maintain a separate
controller class for all response body
annotated controller methods and you
should maintain separate controller
classes which have non response body
connotated controller methods that way
you are definitely going to improve the
readability of the controller classes in
your spring MVC project so let's improve
the readability of this controller class
result by including or by moving these
two response body annotated controller
methods in a separate controller class
so here let me do the new controller
class with an Institute dent m4 REST API
controller because this is a controller
class so I would annotated it with the
controller annotation now let us move
these REST API controller methods from
student admission controller dot Java
class
to this newly created class student info
restate the controller
cool so with this change what have we
gained but nothing much we have just
improved the readability of this spring
embassy project so after this change now
when I'm going to make a get request
using this REST API the response is
going to be produced and sent by this
REST API controller method which earlier
was placed in student and mission
controller dot Java class and when I
make a get request using this REST API
the response is going to be produced and
sent by this West API controller method
which was earlier president student
admission control our thoughts our class
so what you have to do in your spring
MVC project you have to always think
that whatever REST API related
controller methods you have to write
always maintain separate controller
classes for the same and whatever non
REST API controller methods you have to
include in your spring MVC project for
them always try to maintain separate
controller classes that way you are
definitely going to improve the
readability aspect of your string a
music project now spring emissive he
mixes he developers if you have decided
that you are going to maintain a
separate controller class for all
response body annotated controller
methods then you can do one more thing
in this inserting controller class which
is further going to improve the
readability
so what Spring Framework suggests it
suggests for such kind of controller
class which are only going to contain
response body annotated controller
methods you
rest controller annotation instead of
controller annotation and what purpose
it serves to us let's try to learn but
before that let's mix change here
controller to rest controller annotation
now let's try to understand what
advantage it offers over controller
annotation case if you make use of first
controller annotation on top of any Java
graph it just indicates Spring Framework
that whatever methods you have included
inside such a controller class all such
controller methods are basically related
to rest api so for any of the methods
which you are going to include in such a
controller class you are not required to
explicitly specify response for the
annotation at the top so you can delete
response body annotation which we
earlier specified at the top of each
controller method and this controller
class so you have two choices you make
use of s controller and in that case you
can avoid writing response body
annotation at the top of each controller
method in such a controller class or you
can make use of controller annotation
but in that case you will need to
explicitly specify over each controller
method whether that is a related to rest
api concept or not it's one of the same
thing you make use of controller
annotation then specify response body
annotation you know individually you
know at the top of each controller
method residing in such a controller
class odd you make yourself rest
controller and avoid writing response
body annotation at the top of each
control
method at an individual level so this is
the purpose what rest controller
annotation serves get in this tutorial I
explained how to make use of rest
controller annotation to improve the
readability of a spring embassy REST API
project and you haven't understood any
new concept all of the box concept we
tend to understand any such concept is
just about readability and nothing more
than that
in the next tutorial we are going to
talk about postman which is a widely
accepted testing tool in to test West
api's all right there is a big thank you

spring MVC framework with me if you have
