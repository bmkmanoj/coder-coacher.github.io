welcome you to gone to series so far we
install JDK and then we set the path
environment variable on your computer
with Java installation part in this
tutorial we're going to learn how to run
a basic Java program my intention in
this tutorial is just to give you a
glimpse of how a Java program looks like
and how and where it generates output
and of course all the steps which are
needed to run a basic Java program let's
add open notepad and start writing Java
program on it just to save some time I
have already written a basic Java
program this program just prints a
message as the output HelloWorld this is
my first Java program shortly we'll see
all steps needed to run this Java
program and also where and how it
generates the output this line in the
program is printing a message as the
output HelloWorld this is my first Java
program and all of the things like class
public etc etcetera in the program will
learn in the subsequent tutorials
for now just concentrate on how a Java
program looks like and how to run it
later we'll learn everything about a
Java program so our hello world program
is ready now save the file with the name
HelloWorld dot Java this is an important
thing to know about the file containing
a Java program has to be saved with dot
Java file extension and that's what I
have done here with this tab I've seen
the program with the name HelloWorld
but with Java file extension in my local
D Drive no question is how to run it
there are a couple of steps we need to
follow to run this program first step is
you will need to compile this Java
program so what does compilation means
you write programs using Java language
but ultimately you want your computer to
run this Java program
and unfortunately your computer doesn't
understand Java so in this step you
translate the program from Java
programming language to a language which
your computer understands I am going to
talk more on this compilation process in
the immediate subsequent tutorials
that is java virtual machine and finally
in the second step we just run it so
let's go from the first step open
command prompt window and go to T Drive
now here type Java C HelloWorld dot Java
and press Enter this tab is going to
compile the program which is written in
HelloWorld dot Java file and it's going
to produce one more file with the same
name hello world but with a different
extension that is dot class in the same
directory so this tab will produce a
file for the name HelloWorld dot class
so first step is done that is compiling
the program now let's run the clip and
type Java and then filename hello world
and press Enter
so here it produces the output hello
world this is my first Java program let
me reiterate what we did in this demo we
created a program using notepad and we
saved it on a local drive with dot Java
extension and then we compiled it using
Java C come on and finally we ran it
using Java comma
now in previous tutorial we set path
environment variable on our computer
with Java installation path and I never
told you the reason for doing so now
after successfully running a Java
program you can easily understand what I
did so just now you saw I compiled and
ran HelloWorld program using java c and
java commands actually java c and java
are programs which are placed in bin
directory of Java installation which are
provided by Java people for compiling
and running a Java program now you have
two options for instructing computer to
compile and run a Java program using
these programs that is Java C and Java
first option is the way we just did in
this demo that is just provide name of
these programs and Jana that is Java C
file name dot Java for compiling a
program and Java and just filing for
running a Java program that is it and
second way is you provide full path of
these programs like this full path means
the exact path where these programs are
present on your computer I'm sure you
will say first option is better because
you do not need to write full path of
Java C and Java programs for compiling
and running a Java program you know it's
kind of convenient to use just Java C
and Java and not the full path as an
option second so if you are going with
first option you will need to perform
one-time activity before compiling and
running a Java program that is setting
up path environment variable with the
Java installation path up to bin
directory and thereafter you go on using
just Java C and Java without including
their full location in the commands for
compiling and running a Java program and
if you are not setting path environment
variable you will always need to compile
and run a Java program with the commands
including full location of Java C and
Java programs as an option second and
that's it this is the reason for setting
up path environment variable with Java
installation path up to plain directory
in the next tutorial we'll download and
install eclipse ID dice please like this
video if it really helped you and don't
forget to subscribe to my youtube
channel gone to series and I'm going to
catch you in my next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
