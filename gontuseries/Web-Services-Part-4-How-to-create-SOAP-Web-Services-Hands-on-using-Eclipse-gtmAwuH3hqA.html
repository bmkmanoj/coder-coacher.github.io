series in the last lessons of canto
series web services we talked about the
concepts of soap and restful web
services in this lesson I am going to
talk about how we can create soap web
services using Eclipse ID and most
importantly I would walk you to the code
that we use in creating web services
this is what I am going to do I am going
to create a calculator web services
client will give a call to this web
service by passing two numbers as
arguments web service would add up these
two numbers and send back the addition
to the client let's start go to the
project Explorer and choose the dynamic
web project give a name to this project
you will need a application server or a
web server to deploy this web services
application so choosing a new runtime
here you would find all the servers
supported by Eclipse IDE if you do not
find the one that you are looking for
then go to download additional sub
adapters and choose the one that you are
looking for to appear in the list in
this example I am going to use Oracle
WebLogic server 10.3 version so I'm
choosing the one provide the server's
home path here I have installed Oracle
WebLogic server in D Drive supervising
the part
and then click on finish' check at
project when he are doing next next and
finish this wizard would create the
required folder structures for creating
calculator web services now go to source
folder and create a package with the
name com.com to series dot calculator
click on finish right click in this
package name and go to other here in
other choose web logic web service give
a name to this verb logic web service
class core next and then finish this
wizard would create the default template
for calculator web services now let's
modify this to create our calculator web
services
or web service classes ready this web
services would accept to param
sparrowmon
and param 2 which are numbers from
clients and would add up these two and
send back to the client at the rate web
service annotation tells that this whole
class is a web service class and at the
rate web method tells that this method
is open for the correct which means that
client can access this function let us
give a name to this web service now your
web service is ready to build and deploy
go to calculator WS right click here go
to run as run on server good next if you
have already created the domain or
instance of the server that you are
using then provide it spot by clicking
on browse button or else you can create
a new domain or instance of the server
that you are using so I am creating a
new instance here so I am giving it a
name of soap WS and I want it to get
created in D Drive click on finish and
it will create the domain of the server
now click on finish and it will deploy
the calculator web service on the server
now calculator web service is up and
running any blind can access this web
service using its WSDL post-deployment
server would automatically create the
WSDL file of the calculator web service
in this location
in this approach we created the
calculator web service class first and
then server automatically generated W
STL file for us this approach is known
as the bottom-to-top approach there is
one other approach known as
top-to-bottom approach where the
developer would write the W STL file
first and server would automatically
generate the web service class out of it
you may write a client program and use
this w STL file in it
to test the calculator web service I am
going to task this web service using the
direct utility provided by Oracle
WebLogic server then its console mode go
to console provide username and password
go to deployments this is a deployed web
service go to calculator program this is
the name of the web service go to
testing expand calculator program go to
test client enter the two numbers call
the web service so we have past four and
two and the web services has returned
the addition of these two numbers that
is sex
in the next lesson I will be
demonstrating creating restful web
services using Eclipse IDE
