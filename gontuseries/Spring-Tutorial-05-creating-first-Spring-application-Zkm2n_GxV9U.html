so far in the spring series of tutorials
we went through springs introduction
dependency injection concept and
configured our Eclipse ID with all
necessary chars needed for writing a
basic spring application this is the
basic setup be performed in the earlier
tutorial we first created a project with
the name first spring project and then
edit all necessary Spring jars onto its
class path in this tutorial we'll learn
simple steps to create our first spring
application what we're going to do in
this demo is will first write a simple
Java class restaurant which just prints
a welcome message on the console will
then create a spring configuration file
which is basically an XML file Spring
Framework will read this XML file for
managing all Java objects our classes in
our Java project and then will write it
as class to test the application all
right we will understand more with this
demo let's first create the restaurant
class go to the source
new class given named restaurant your
package name or dot corn goose series
Rod's rancor click on finish just to
save some time I already have written
this class here in the restaurant class
we have just a function greet customer
which brings welcome to a restaurant
when caught now let's write springs
configuration file go to source
right-click choose other good XML and
then XML file click Next
I am giving it a name spring conflict
you may give it any name which you like
all right so this is the file which
eclipse wizard has created for us just
to save some time I have already used in
this class let us go through it so we
are going to use spring framework for
creating the restaurant object in our
test program I put an end to your
restaurant class over here in the XML
file in Springs world every object is
called a pin so do not think bean is
something new or entirely different
concept it is a Springs way of calling
out Java object so from now on I may
refer any Java object as being we have
to provide a name to every bean so I've
provided here a name add a string bean
you may give it any name which you like
nor spring application is ready now we
are going to write a test class to test
this spring application go to the
package new class write a test class
test spring project click on finish just
to save some time I have already written
this class let us understand it step by
step
this statement is going to find an load
spring config dot XML file from our
project into the application context now
what is application context it's simply
an interface provided by spring people
which simply reads the configuration of
your project from XML file and then by
calling different methods of it you
access different functionalities
provided by spring framework like
dependence ignition concept
aspect-oriented programming etc etcetera
are in simple words without any
complexity this is the basic interface
provided to you to access string
framework and that's it here we are
calling get pin method of application
context interface just to request spring
framework to create and return an object
with a bean name restaurant pin here
string framework will search for this
pin in the
figuration file and will implicitly
create and return an object for the
class mansion with a beam name
restaurant being and here we are simply
calling the greet customer method of
freshman beam or restaurant object to
print a welcome node on the console so
everything is said and our application
is ready let's run the application a
right click here and choose run as java
application yes it has printed welcome
to our restaurant so with this we have
just finished writing a first sprite
project in this time application we just
saw a brief overview of application
context this is one more interface
called bean factory provided by spring
people for the same purpose application
context does everything which we
infected us and a little more than that
it's like application context can do all
tasks which in fact it does plus some
motifs in the current spring release
spring as clearly mentioned that it has
bodied bean factory just for the
backward compatibility reasons so unless
and until you have a very strong reason
to use bean factory we should rely on
application context to use spring
framework such very important to
understand and know about application
context bean factory with a differences
in a little more depth I am going to
dedicate a separate tutorial on it so
that we can precisely decide upon when
to use application context and when to
use bean factory in the next tutorial
we'll modify the spring application to
see a demo on how to provide a value for
the property which is mentioned in the
restaurant class from the spring
configuration file guys thanks for
liking our tutorials and providing
feedback to us through emails and
comments believe me your comments and
feedback is very valuable to us do you
