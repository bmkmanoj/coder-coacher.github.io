to gone to serious tutorials in the last
tutorial we created a restaurant class
which has a great customer method which
reads a customer when we call this
method and then we put its entry in the
springs configuration file and provided
its name as restaurant bean and then we
wrote a test class where we requested
Spring Framework to get as restaurant
object this way and then we called greet
customer method which printed welcome
mode on the console now in this tutorial
we are going to show how to set a
property which is in the restaurant
class from the configuration file what
it means is we are going to write a
string property in the restaurant class
and then provide its value from this
bank's configuration file let's start go
to the restaurant class and include a
property welcome out what it set of
method I sometimes have a bad habit of
writing setter method by myself you can
use eclipse ie to generate a setter
method for any property that you write
in your classes like right click go to
source and then generate setters and
getters method alright so now we have
included one property welcome note in
the restaurant class we'll modify this
greet customer method so that it won't
use this hard-coded welcome note and use
this welcome note property to display a
hello node or welcome note on the
console
now what we want is we want to provide
its value from this spring's
configuration file so we have to modify
Springs quantification file as well just
to save some time I've already updated
this configuration file I have included
here this property with the name welcome
node and why did its value as welcome to
our restaurant
this property is exactly same as what we
have written here in the restaurant
class welcome note all right so all
changes are done at runtime when we
request Spring Framework to provide us
with a restaurant object in that test
class here Spring Framework will
implicitly create the restaurant object
and then set its welcome not property
with the value you have provided in the
spangs configuration file here using the
setter method of welcome not property
right so our application is ready let's
run and test it wait it has sprinted
welcome to a restaurant value on the
screen which is coming from the
configuration file in the next tutorial
we'll see a demo on dependency injection
concept using the constructor way by
modifying the same application guys
