Series in the last lessons we saw what
is hibernate and the configuration setup
needed an eclipse ID for building a
first hibernate java application we
created the project with the name first
hibernate project and then placed all
the required jars in the project's class
path in this lesson we are going to
write code for a first hibernate java
application i'm going to create a simple
application which would save students
information into the database using the
hibernate way and gradually i would
include more and more features of
hibernate in the same application in
further tutorials I've created three
parts which describes three important
steps for building a basic hibernate
java application the first part is to
create the hibernate configuration file
which contains properties like the
database information which is to be used
by the application and other
configurations needed for advanced
features of hibernate we'll talk all in
dáil about this and the second part is
to create the module object which you
want to store into the database using
the hibernate and the third part is to
write code to save this model object
into the database let's start the first
step is to include the hibernate
configuration file hibernate dot CFG dot
xml under the source folder the file
contains information like database
credentials and many other configuration
related information you would get the
sample configuration file from the
hibernate distribution zip which we
downloaded from the hibernate website
under the projects folder or
alternatively from my website go to the
link and download the sample hibernate
dot CFG dot XML file for hibernate I've
already downloaded the sample
configuration file so copy the file and
paste it under the source folder
open the file now let's understand what
our properties are there to configure
for building a forced hibernate project
you need to tell hibernate which
database you are going to use so you got
to provide here the JDBC database
configuration would ask why we need to
enter JDBC database configuration when
you are using hibernate the state
forward answer is every / M framework
till date
for Java is built on top of JDBC only no
matter which Orem framework you are
using you will need to provide the
database information to it I am going to
use MySQL database for this demo so I
have entered here all the values for
MySQL database which I have installed in
my local machine so I have placed here
MySQL connection driver class connection
URL I've created a database with the
name hibernate tutorials and is running
on the port 3 3:06 which is the default
port and then username and password of
the database which in my case is root
and empty string I am not laying stress
on which database you should use you can
use whichever database you like like
Oracle or squares derby or any other
database but whichever database it is
provide the relevant database
information like I provided for MySQL
database here and it would fork another
property called connection pool size for
now let's have its value as 1 and in
further tutorials we'll see what its
value should be for different purposes
the property called dialect for
hibernate to which you specify which
database you are going to use this is
needed because different databases
implement subtle differences in the SQL
they use things such as data types for
example vary across databases for
example in Oracle I might put an integer
value in a number field and in SQL
Server I use an int field so there could
be differences in the way the SQL
is written for different databases for
different purposes
in our case we are going to use
hibernate and hibernate is smart enough
to generate specific optimized query
automatically for the database that you
are going to mention here in the dialect
property since I am using MySQL database
are specified here the MySQL dialect
value you can refer the hibernate
documentation to know what is the
dialect property for different databases
or alternatively you can follow the link
on my website to know what is the
dialect value for the database that you
would use now there is another property
called cache a provider class this is
about second level cache a for hibernate
don't worry about this we'll see it in
the later tutorials let's look at the
show SQL property if its value is true
then hibernate would print out all the
generated SQL queries and efforts values
false then it would not HP bm2 TDL dot
auto property is one of the most
important properties which we use in
hibernate configuration you remember we
learned that if you are using hibernate
we do not really need to bother about
table creation or modifying any table
structure or any other database
modifications from back end in database
we can do all this from Java Zen so what
it means when you specify its values
Creator let's understand with an example
let's say you're running hibernate
application and what you want is to
store or persist a model object into the
database table so what you do for this
is you pass the model object to the
hibernate function to store or persist
into the database table then hibernate
looks at the database table and if it
does not find the database table where
model object needs to be stored then it
will create the new database table using
this model class I will provide more
information with a demo about this
property in the next tutorial when we
run our first hibernate
job application and would dedicate a
separate tutorial talking about just
this property this is another important
step here mention all the model classes
which you are going to write in your
hibernate application to store retrieve
or performing any other database
operation using the hibernate way in the
next tutorial we would write the model
class with an annotations which will
interact with the database for all the
crude operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
