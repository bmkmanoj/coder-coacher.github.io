in this series of video tutorials we'll
talk about Spring Framework in detail we
will talk about what exactly spring
offers and the reason why it's so
popular among developers and
organizations around the globe Spring
Framework is a free and open source java
application framework which was created
by computer expert rod Johnson in 2003
and the main aim for creating such a
framework was to enhance the developer's
productivity and make them understand
and use some of the best industry coding
practices rod Johnson created the
framework using a simple design pattern
inversion of control or the dependency
injection and later on the spring team
went on adding new features to the
framework as a separate modules or
project in it in the form of separate
jar or set of chars in the end of this
introductory video we'll take a look at
what are the advanced features spring
people provide which are built on top of
the Spring Framework for example Spring
web services spring batch etc etcetera
alright let's start with a complete
overview of Spring Framework which will
create a strong foundation for all
string concepts and hands on that you
are going to go through in the upcoming
series of spring tutorials the first
module in the spring framework is
inversion of control container or the
dependency injection engine this is the
core module in the Spring Framework what
it says is you should not be creating or
instantiating an object inside another
Java class but rely on this module for
creating the object for you which you
can use anywhere in the Java project or
classes you want for example here we are
creating an object of Class B inside
Class A which means plus a is
depending on class speed in future if a
developer is going to modify Class B for
some requirement purposes let's say he
modifies the number of parameters he
uses for the constructor of Class B he
may need to modify Class A as well and
if any developer writes a better version
of Class B which provides more
functionality with the name C and the
project team decides to replace Class B
with a new class C then you will need to
modify Class A as well for this you will
need to modify Class A wherever you are
creating object B with an object C I've
just talked about the problems using a
simple example but believe me in any big
projects having thousands of Java
classes or more if you have to make
changes in hundreds of other classes
because you just made a small change in
one class it's a real big pain all these
problems are just for one reason that
Class A is dependent on Class B so if we
can completely remove or at least reduce
this dependency of Class A on Class B we
can overcome all such problems and here
comes Springs dependency injection or
inversion of control containers
importance this module will help you in
overcoming all such problems using a
simple configuration file in a very
simple way this was just a brief and
fast overview of Springs inversion of
control container I will dedicate a
separate tutorial on what exactly is
dependency injection problems if you do
not use it its real benefits and most
importantly how it made Spring Framework
the most popular framework till today
the second module in the spring
framework is aspect-oriented programming
aspect-oriented programming is just
another concept as we have oops in the
programming world what it says is if
there is a certain thing you are using
in a project
which is not part of the main business
logic for example logging transaction
management etc then why including all
such things as part of your main
business logic for example in this
function our main functionality or
business logic is adding two numbers
that is a plus B then what these things
are doing in the same function here what
we are doing is we are mixing both
functional implementations that is
adding two numbers a plus B and non
functional implementation that is all
these logging statements at the same
place which in future may lead to a
greater difficulty in managing your Java
project this spring module provides you
with a simple mechanism of how you can
implement all such non-functional or non
business things as a separate entity
just like you have a separate class for
a separate responsibility in your
project such that you won't see any such
statements in your business functions so
it's like you would be able to see logs
in the log file or console but you do
not need to write log statements within
your functions isn't it great your
functions would only contain business
logic and nothing else and it's not just
logging there are many similar things
that you mix heavily with your business
functions in your project for example
caching transaction management etc I've
just given a brief overview of what this
module does for you later we'll see
every concept related to aspect oriented
programming and what spring offers
related to that and problems if you do
not use it or what goes wrong if you
make such non-functional implementations
with functional implementation with
hands-on sessions the third module is
data access integration this module has
five sub modules in it if you're using
spring JDBC then you are so relaxed when
it
to Java database interactions while
performing any database operation you
will not need to write a single
statement for opening and closing of
database connections you do not need to
write any exception handling code
preparer statements and execute
statements would be handled by spring
itself you do not need to manage result
sets at all because you get the
collection object of your choice having
desired object or objects from the
database itself for some reasons if you
do not want to use spring JDBC or plain
JDBC this or a module provides you the
full api support to integrate
third-party / and tools like hibernate i
batis JPA etc with spring framework
which the module provides you with a
full api support to use other
third-party exam frameworks within
Spring Framework for example Jax P
caster etc JMS module contains all
features for producing and consuming
messages from JMS queues if you are
using spring transaction module you
really are into safe hands because of
its well-defined and easier ways for
managing all simple and complex
transactions in your java application
the fourth module in the spring
framework is web MVC framework using
this you can build a complete web
application using MVC design pattern in
a very simple ways in the last spring
modulus test framework it provides you
with a complete support for testing
spring components with J unit or test ng
frameworks with a lot of ease this was
the complete overview of what spring
framework is I'm sorry if I was bit
faster but I am going to cover every
single concept in detail with hands-on
sessions in the upcoming tutorials in
this series using spring framework you
can build a complete java application
with a web or in non web
but spring provides a list of advanced
features which it calls as spring
projects as separate jar or set of chars
here is the complete list of what spring
offers in total apart from the regular
Spring Framework you may visit this link
to have more information on all of these
advanced features in the next tutorial
we'll see the concept of dependency
injection in detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
