welcome you to gone to series this
tutorial is in continuation with the
early one where we learned how to
support multiple languages with the help
of a fairly simple requirement and this
damn application so overall what we did
we wanted to support two languages
English and French for this GSP page and
to do so first we replaced all hardwired
English labels with their corresponding
placeholders in this JSP page and then
we put their respective English values
in this properties file and then we put
their respective French values in this
properties well so after making all
these changes now when the user provides
here French as his preferred language
over English the content of the web page
is shown in French language and if we
choose here English our friends the
content of the web page is shown in
English and all this we learned in
detail in the previous tutorial now
let's proceed further guys whatever
solution we provided in the previous
tutorial to support multiple languages
has a little problem associated with it
the problem is what if after getting
this vapid user again watch to change
the language without changing it to
language preference settings of the
browser the question is how to do that
to tackle such a requirement what I will
do I will place 2 links English and
French on top of this web page such that
after getting this web page if user
clicks on English link then the same
content of the web page is shown in
English language to him and if we click
some French then the same content would
be shown in French language to him now
big question is what does I need to
perform to make this happen
because to do so I just need to perform
these three simple steps and I'll be
done let me very quickly make all these
changes in the application and later I
will explain in detail what exactly
these three steps mean so first step is
to place English and French link on top
of admission form dot JSP page and
second changes in the Sphynx
configuration file register an
interceptor with a name locale change
interceptor means this one so here i've
included this and third changes to put
an entry of a bean with a name cookie
local resolver means this one good so
here i'm done with making all these
three changes in the application it is
one thing let us quickly test this on
the browser and later i would explain
everything in detail please to reflect
all the changes which we have just made
in the space convocation file if we got
to restart the server so lettuce we
started
cool so now server is restarted let us
see on the browser good
so here it's showing me two links
English infringe on top of this web page
let's see what happens when I click on
these links cool when I click on fringe
it's displaying whole content of this
web page in French language and when I
click on English it's displaying in
English language now let us understand
what exactly these three steps mean what
I performed in this lab application for
step which I performed here was to
include English and French links on top
of ignition form dot JSP page means
these two links if you observe here with
English link I am here passing a
parameter with the name site language
equals en and with French link and
passing site language equals fr now what
happens when I click on any of these two
links here when I click here any of
these two links this web page again
requests for itself and along with that
request it sends a parameter with the
name site language to the server and
here before processing the request this
local change interceptor you know
whatever registered here in the second
step extracts the value of this
parameter site language and accordingly
informs the application to pick an
appropriate properties file while
framing the response object so when I
click here French link I send a
parameter with the name site language
equals FR to the server and here local
change interceptor extracts the value of
site language as fr and informs the
application to pick student messages
underscore FR dot properties while
framing the response object for that
request and i scissored when i click
here you know on French
I get defecated french-language and same
is the case with English link because
I'm sure you're going to ask me a
question here to tackle this specific
requirement in the demo I just needed to
perform first two steps so what was the
need of performing third step means why
I put an entry of cooky local resolver
being here in the spain's catification
file and the concept is when you use
local change interceptor it's mandatory
to put an entry of cooky local resolver
being in the springs configuration file
otherwise it won't work
that's the concept there's in addition
to this this beam serves one more
purpose and that's what I have described
over here on the screen please go to it
and if you find any difficulty
understanding it please put all your
queries in the comment section below and
I'll try to resolve all those as early
as possible
alright guys a big thank you for
learning spring MVC with me if you have
any feedback or comments please provide
