welcome you to gone to series so far in
the rest series of tutorials I talked
about how to develop get and good kind
of REST API is - tutorial let's talk
about when and how to develop those kind
of REST API which would demand who's
kind of request to be made on them so
let's start this in general when do we
go on developing get type of REST API is
well in only those kind of cases when
certain resource is present at the
server and you want user to read that
resource and in the similar manner when
you want to develop put kind of REST API
as well in those kind of cases when
certain resource is present at the
server and you want user to make a
request to update that resource with
certain information what user is
supposed to be sending along with the
request in the similar manner same
question arises for post kind of REST
API so in what scenarios you want to
build post kind of STP is well the
simplest answer is you go for developing
post kind of a REST API only for those
kind of cases when you want user to make
a request to create a new resource at
the server that's all about it now what
does creating a new resource means but
it just only means that you want user to
send some new information to the server
which is not existing there so that
later on a request could be made by
using some other REST API to read that
information let me explain you this
overall concept with the help of a very
simple requirement in this demo
application so here my requirement is
are very simple all I want is user to
send new students information or record
to the application an application should
insert that Accord into the database so
that
later on this rest API can be used to
read that students record so efficient
is what all tars I need to be performing
here so as to fulfill this requirement
case here's what I would do however the
build this first API and provided to all
the users of this application so when a
user is going to make a post kind of a
request on this REST API with the
information of a new students record so
when that request is going to reach to
the application this application is
simply going to insert that new students
record into the database if it's
successfully able to insert it's going
to return true in the response otherwise
it's going to return false so what kind
of code I need to write to build this
REST API well that's very easy guys for
gate type of REST API so we included
this worst API controller method for put
kind of REST API we included this REST
API controller method in the similar
manner for this you know post kind of a
REST API we simply need to include a new
REST API controller method here in this
controller class and we will be done so
let us do one thing let us include that
here and later on I will explain all
related concepts in detail so here I am
done with including this REST API
controller method for the kind of REST
API we wanted to develop in this
tutorial so now after we have included
this controller method here when a user
is going to make a post request on this
REST API where the the new students
record when that request is going to
reach the application this application
is going to simply make a call to this
REST API controller method why because
of these three arguments the important
point for you to understand here that
this accepts only you
students can Commission here which has
come along to the request in the JSON
format only it doesn't accept any other
format because of this consumes ultimate
value what we have written over here
so after this method has been called by
the application for this request this
request body annotation is simply going
to map this new students JSON record
with this student Java object so how
it's going to work well it's going to
work exactly the way I explained you in
the earlier tutorial I'll explain you
this book kind of a REST API development
task
so once the new students information in
housing map to this student object this
controller method is going to insert
this record into the database and if
it's able to successfully do so it's
going to return to read status code has
200 okay otherwise it's going to return
false
now here I'm not I'm not writing the
exact you know code if there's kind of
clauses just to keep this tutorial a bit
simpler in your case you got to write
the actual logic based on your projects
requirement in your real time project
alright so after we have included this
controller method here in this Java
class now when I'm going to make a post
request on this REST API with the new
students record which I want application
to insert into the database let's say I
want application to insert this students
record whose name is d doc so this new
student has has a hobby
WWE one of the hobbies so when I'm going
to make a post request on this REST API
with this new students record for the
student whose name is the rock what
would happen well after inserting this
record successfully into the database
it's going to
- and status code as 200 okay let's
check whether that happens or not cool
so it's happening here I've got two as a
spawns body and 200 okay and status code
now important point for you to
understand here is for post kind of for
SDK controller method generally when
request is successfully processed by the
respective controller method developers
do not send status code as 200 okay so
instead of the stapler for sending some
other status code to zero one created so
now when I'm going to make a post
request with this new students
information to the application I would
receive here
2:01 created instead of 200 ok now you
would ask me a question Ankush what's
the difference between 200 ok and 2:01
created well it's not much difference
between the two two zero zero ok
signifies that whatever request client
has made to the server that request is
successfully processed there and two
zero one created signifies that whatever
resource client wanted to create at the
server that successfully created them so
this is not much difference between the
two it's just about the developers
preference you know to choose to 0 1
created over 200 ok for such a kind of a
REST API development now one last
concept let's try to understand what I
will do I will write a piece of code
over here and I would explain that piece
of code once after showing you which
output so keep observing what I am
writing here here I have included a key
value pair TS location and value has
this so let's cause
HTTP headers reference a second argument
to this so that whatever t-value care we
have added over here that should also be
sent along with the response now what
value we have added over here let us try
to understand that after seeing its
output so now after this change where
I'm going to make a post request on this
REST API with the intention to you know
make a request to create this resource
at the server what response I get let's
see so here I've got two L's response
body two zero one created as response
status and in addition to these two have
also got this key value pair in the
response as response header
now what's this case here with this
piece of code would have added this REST
API controller method is just telling to
the client that whatever resource it has
just created you know whatever students
record it has inserted into the database
that this source can be read by making a
get request on this REST API that's what
it means
so if we look at the value for it
this is what it's conveying so if you
make a get request on this REST API you
know by specifying the name of the
student at the end of the REST API this
one this application is going to return
the students information back as a
response so the overall concept of what
you have to know down here is and you
Delap post kind of a REST API controller
method when it's successfully able to
create the resource for that request
then it should be sending the REST API
which that client can make use of to
read that source and also 2:01 created
is the status code what generally
developers prefer to send in the
response
the corresponding controller method is
successfully able to process the request
or successfully able to create the
resource in the next tutorial I will
talk about how to develop those kind of
REST API is which will demand delete
kind of a request to be made on them
alright there's a big thank you for
learning REST API concepts using spring
MVC in work with me if you have any
feedback or any constructive comment or
you want me to upload a very specific
topic in this series or you want into
all together upload a brand new series
on this channel gone to series do post
me a comment below the video or write to
me on this email id for all of your
queries please like this video share
this video if this has proved useful to
you and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel gone to series and I'm going to
catch you in the next part of this
