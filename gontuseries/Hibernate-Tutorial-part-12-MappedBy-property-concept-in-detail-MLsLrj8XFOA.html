on b2 kondu series in the earlier
tutorial we learned the concept of a
bi-directional many-to-one one-to-many
mapping in hibernate application only
thing I miss telling you was the map by
property which we mentioned in the
student address class in this tutorial
I'm going to tell everything about a map
by property along with knowing the
concept of the awning and a non awning
side in hibernate application I'll take
help of a demo which we developed in the
previous tutorial here I established a
Manitou one relationship in the student
class and then I established a
one-to-many relationship in a student
address class but the point to note here
is when I already established a Magne to
one mapping of student class with a
student address class then what was the
need to establish the relationship in
the reverse order the only need was to
have a navigational access from student
address site - that is whenever you
perform some operation on a student
address subject then hibernate should
also perform some auto operation on the
related student objects - no I'm going
to tell a very important point to note
in a bi-directional mapping although
here in the demo we have established
many to one and one to many mapping in
two classes that is student and student
address classes but the mapping task is
actually owned by the student class all
right let me explain in detail what I am
really talking about with this statement
so now I'm putting here a statement
create in the hibernate configuration
file so now when I run the application
hibernate will first create the tables
from the hibernate classes in the
database and then it will insert records
on it
I have already deleted the student and
student address tables from the database
which I created myself in the previous
demo
now idly when I run the application
hibernate should itself create these two
tables in the database and then should
happily insert records in it let's run
the application yes it created the two
tables and happily inserted records in
both the tables in the database now I'll
simply remove the map by property in the
student address class and run the same
application
oops what hibernate has done this time
hibernate has produced all earlier
output but along with it it created a
third table also so what is this third
table which this time hibernate
generated when we removed mat by
property from student address class
actually this is the mapping table which
hibernate has generated and by looking
at this table you can tell how a record
present in student table is linked with
a required present in the student
address table
so now after running the application
without mapped by property in the
student address table and looking at the
output two questions come into the mind
when already - it is having a mapping
column in the student table which is
doing the mapping task then what is the
need of one more mapping thing in this
case this third table for conveying the
same information I hope you understood
the problem why to have two ways of
linking student records with student
address records in the same project
either use this column present in the
student table or use this third table to
do the mapping task and that shear the
map by property comes into the picture
when you have a bi-directional mapping
you will always need to specify which
side hibernate should consider for
mapping the two tables otherwise
hibernate will consider both sides for
it after reading the contents of student
class hibernate included a column
student address address ID in the
student class for mapping student
records with student address records and
after reading the contents of student
address class hibernate created a third
table for mapping student records with
student address records now if you want
hibernate to do the mapping task just
once and not twice then you explicitly
tell it to hibernate using the map by
p'tee if you mentioned Matt by property
in the student address class then
hibernate does the mapping task based on
the information in student class and
that's why when we're an application
with Matt buy property in the student
address class hibernate did not include
a third table for a mapping task and
just included the student address
address ID column for it guess with this
demo you now know what an awning side
and a non on inside means in hibernate
application in the case when you
establish a bi-directional mapping
between to hibernate classes you will
need to explicitly tell hibernate which
side it should consider for performing
the mapping tasks using a map pipe
property the site which you want to
consider for performing a mapping task
is in general known as an awning side
and the other side is known as a non on
inside the side where you mentioned map
by becomes the non on each side and
hibernate considers other side for
performing the mapping task guys there
are many concepts which may confuse you
like these for any of these things if
you have a little confusion which you
want me to clarify in any respect I will
come all of your queries feedback and
comments below the video or you can send
me an email on this ID please like the
video if it really helped you and don't
forget to subscribe to my youtube
channel Khan to series and I'm going to
catch you in my next tutorial that is a
magnet or mana mapping in a hibernate
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
