series in this lesson we are going to
talk about the restful web services web
services are mainly of two types so
based and rest based rest stands for
representational state transfer protocol
which was given by a computer scientist
rofling in 2000 rest is a set of
guidelines which talks about how a
client should interact with the server
so let's suppose that there is a client
and there is a server where we have
deployed the restful web services rest
guideline says that data and
functionality which client can access on
server is known as a resource and each
resource should be accessed using its
URI by all the claims this is much
similar to what you do on Internet in
order to access a particular website you
paste the address of a website on the
browser's address bar and gets some
representation as a response so this is
how it goes client would send a request
in order to access a particular resource
which his sights on the server and the
server would send back a response to the
client this response is the
representation of a resource which means
that a resource can be presented to the
client in multiple formats our source
can be presented in the form of HTML XML
plain text PDF jpg JSON and many other
formats which are available in restful
web services to the client I would just
reframe what we have learned so far
client would send a request to access
the resource residing on the server
using its URI and the server in response
would send back the representation of
that is sourced to the client there are
three main features of restful web
services in restful Web Services client
can directly access our source using its
URI which is a direct advantage of
restful web services over soap web
services where the client needs WSDL and
stubs of soap web services in order to
access anything on the server the
response message which client gets is
self descriptive in nature which means
that the message in itself would contain
the information of format in which the
client can read the response message
restful Web Services uses the concept of
uniform interfaces the concept is easy
to understand what would need a little
more attention of yours the
communication protocol which restful Web
Services uses is HTTP rest guidelines
talks about stateless communication
between client and server which means
every single request from client to the
server is created as a new request and
should be containing all information
needed to establish the communication
and since HTTP best describes stateless
communication protocol restful Web
Services uses this protocol however
there is no restriction specified in the
rest guidelines that restful Web
Services has to use HTTP and not any
other communication protocol restful Web
Services
uses four main HTTP methods get to
retrieve a resource post to create a
resource
put two up data resource and the lead to
delete a resource this means that when
you write restful Web Services you
implement all these four methods for
each source in your restful Web Services
program so if a client just want to
retrieve the resource he would invoke
the get method of that resource
similarly if he wants to create update
or delete a resource he would invoke the
respective HTTP methods residing on the
restful web services program restful Web
Services developer needs to take care of
the fact that in each of these four
methods he would write code which
adheres to the method meaning for
example he should not write code to
delete a resource in get method etc I
would just give him what we have learned
so far
rest specifies guidelines for client and
server interactions in this his sources
residing on the server are exposed to
the client using ura and client may
invoke any of the four HTTP methods to
access the resources depending upon
whether he wants to just retrieve that
his source or perform any other
operation on that resource I would be
covering how to create restful and soap
web services hands-on using Java
language in next lessons
