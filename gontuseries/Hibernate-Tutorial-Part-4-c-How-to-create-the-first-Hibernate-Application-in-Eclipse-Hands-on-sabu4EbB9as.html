series this tutorial is in continuation
to the earlier two parts for creation of
a basic hibernate java application in
the first part we created the hibernate
dot CFG dot XML file and went through
all the configurations needed for a
basic hibernate java application and in
the second part we created the annotated
model class student' underscore info
which we want to store or persist into
the database using the hibernate way in
this tutorial we are going to write code
for storing or persisting the student
under screenflow object into the
database table once you are through with
the understanding how to save you would
understand rest good operations like
delete update load in no time so let's
start go to the package com.com - series
dot hibernate right click and choose new
class give a name to the class main
click on finish what we want is to store
the student underscore info model object
into the database so let's quickly
create this model object in this main
class
Satnam has gone to
and set roll number as one
now our model object student unless coin
4 is ready now let's write code to save
it into the student underscore
information table just to save some time
I've already written the rest of the
code for saving the student under screen
for object now let's understand what all
these lines of code means the first step
is to create the session Factory object
this object will contain all the data
regarding the hibernate configuration
file so we can call session factory as a
heavyweight object the second step is to
create the session object session
factory produces the session object you
can get a session or open a session by
calling open session method in session
factory and what conceptually it means
is whenever session is open then
internally a database connection will be
opened the third step is to create a
logical transaction while working with
insert update delete operations from a
hibernate application on the database
hibernate would need a logical
transaction if you are just selecting an
object from the database then we do not
require any logical transaction but for
all other crude operations like delete
insert update hibernate would need it in
order to begin a logical transaction we
need to call a method begin transaction
given by the session interface like this
this session not save is the main code
which is inserting the record into the
database table we just need to pass the
model object student underscore info to
the same method in session and it will
save the record into the database table
student underscore information finally
we need to call comment in transaction
and then just close the session object
and session factory like this if we run
the program our intention is that it
will save the student underscore info
object into the student and the square
information table as you have clearly
mentioned in the student under square
for class that whenever we would perform
any operation with the student
underscoring for class consider the
student underscore information table if
we go and check the hibernate tutorials
database schema we won't find here any
tables so far this the newly created
schema by me for hibernate tutorials so
where the hibernate program would save
the student and the screen for object
into the database you remember we
learned while going to the hibernate
configuration file hibernate dot CFG dot
XML if hpm to DD l dot auto property is
set to create then hibernate would
create the new table with the table name
mentioned in the model class if it
doesn't find already existing table in
the schema let's execute the program
as soon as java application the program
is executed now let's check whether it
has created the new table student and
the screen permission with the record
map to the student and the screen for
object if we check the logs on the
console hibernate is very well saying
that it has created the student
underscore information table in the
database and it has inserted a record
into this table so let's check in the
database whether it has done so yes it
has created the student underscore
information in the hibernate tutorial
schema let's check whether it has
inserted the record or not yes it has
created a record gone to s name and roll
number as one which pause the values
given to the student and a screen for
model object we are done with creating
the basic - in java application for very
important thing to note over here is
what value this hpm to DDL dot auto
property should have it can hold four
values create of
did create drop and validate so we have
used here create but it can hold one of
any of these four values so what value
it should have in production environment
or in development environment I would
dedicate a separate tutorial on this
property and will explain all these
values fully in the upcoming tutorials
you can download the complete - a demo
from my website using this link with
this you can easily go through or
understand other database operation like
delete reading or updating the record
apart from sale which I just
demonstrated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
