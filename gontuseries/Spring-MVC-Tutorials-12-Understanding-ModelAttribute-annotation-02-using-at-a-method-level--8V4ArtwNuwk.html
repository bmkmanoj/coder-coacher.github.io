continuation with the earlier one where
we learned how to use model attribute
annotation on a method argument like
this on this tutorial I'm going to talk
about how to use the same annotation at
a method level along with looking at
some more fundamental concepts which are
related to this animation all right
let's start because before I start
explaining how to use this annotation at
a method level let me make a very small
change in this request handler method
and the corresponding JSP file and later
I'll explain everything to you in detail
all right so up done here I've added
this statement here in this JSP file on
top of the page and here I've added this
statement and this request handler
method now let's understand what I've
done here here I've added a string
object header message in this success
handler methods model and view object
having this value and in the
corresponding justbe file that is in
admission form dot JSP file I am simply
accessing this string objects value with
this code now with this modification if
a user would access this web page what
will happen nothing much user would see
this thing objects value printed on the
top of this web page along with this
code that is a value gone to college of
engineering India which is set here by
this equation method using this
statement let me show you this working
on the browser earlier when I was typing
this URL on the browser my application
was sending me this webpage now if I
type the same URL on the browser and
would hit enter after the modifications
which we just made my applique
has sent me this webpage as a response
with this additional text on top of this
webpage and this is because of the
modifications which I made in this
request angle method and in the
corresponding justify that is this
modification now after this modification
I would want you to observe a very
important point here in this controller
class here in this controller class I
have to request handler methods and both
request handler methods are putting same
kind of object in the respective model
and view object that is had a messaging
object now spring MVC says if you have a
requirement like this where all requests
to handler methods which are present in
the same controller class are putting or
adding same kind of object in the
respective model and view object then
this is the right way of doing things
and there is no doubt about it but how
about if I give you an option here for
writing less code and do more things
using model attribute annotation on a
method let me explain you this way
spring MVC says if you had a method like
this in your controller class which is
having model attribute annotation
present on its stop then whatever object
you would add to its model object spring
MVC would automatically add that object
to the model and view object for each
request handler method which is present
in this controller class in simple words
if I talk about after adding this method
here in this controller class and
putting head resisting object with this
value into this model object I'm simply
saying that I really do not need to
write this statement individually in all
request handler methods which are
present in this controller class so I
can simply remove the mouth from this
controller class from each request
handed method guys just now I showed you
using model
good annotation on a method and putting
header message string object having this
value into the model object for this
method I simply avoided adding had an
existing object individually in each
request handle method so here I can
achieve more things with less code using
this way so when you use model attribute
annotation on a method it's not giving
you some outstanding feature but it's
simply giving your way so that you would
write less code and do more things so if
you don't want to use model attribute
annotation on a method don't use that
but in that case you will need to write
more code as you saw before I included
this method here in this controller
class I delete with all these
modifications which I just performed in
this controller class my applications
behavior would not change and it would
behave in the same manner as it was
behaving before making all this
modifications let's check it on the
browser cool my application has sent me
a response in the same way as it was
sending me before I made all those
modifications in this control class
because here in this demo I showed you
an example where I added a string object
to this model object in the similar
manner you may add here any user-defined
object of your choice or any collection
object of your choice to this model
object as per your projects requirement
also I added here only one object to
this model in your project you may add
more objects to this model object by
simply adding more statements like this
in this method now you know something
like this you keep on adding more
statements like this and in each
statement you provide here the object
which you want to place here in this
model object alright
because there is an important point you
should note here when every controller
class is having a method like this that
is method having model attribute
animation present on its top then spring
MVC framework would always make a call
to that method first before making call
to any of its request handler methods I
hope you got the point there is a big
