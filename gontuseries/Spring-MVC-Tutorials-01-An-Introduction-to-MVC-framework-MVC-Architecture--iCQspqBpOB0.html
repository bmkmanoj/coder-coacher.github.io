welcome you to gone to series in this
series of video tutorials I will talk
about spring MVC framework in detail
right from the very foundation
explaining the meaning of MVC till all
its advanced level concepts along with
hands-on sessions so let's start MVC
stands for Model View controller
architecture it's simply a guideline
which says how should I write code for
developing an application having the UI
a typical web application developed
using a servlet technology looks like
this here the client requests for a web
page with application and then based on
the URL the request is mapped to a
particular servlet the servlet processes
the request and sends back HTML along
with data as a response to the clients
browser in the same way a typical web
application developed using a JSP
technology tells us assigning here also
the client request for a web page and
based on the URL a particular GSB page
prepares and sends a response to the
clients browser many people in IT
industry argued that the approach
developers follow in both ways is not so
good
a typical JSP page or a servlet which
developers write would have two things
or responsibilities mixed together that
is a code which actually renders UI on
the screen and the code which executes
some logic in order to provide data
which is to be displayed on the UI this
mixing of two makes a UI developer and
business logic developer difficult to
work independently as both sides in the
same file and as a result it takes more
time to develop such a web application
and in case if something needs to be
modified in an existing web application
at a later stages
it's a real big pain say for example you
are asked to change the UI layout of the
entire web application things will be a
little complex to modify if both are
mixed together and will require more
development and testing efforts MVC says
we can overcome all such problems to a
greater extent if we write an
application in such a way that UI code
is never mixed with the business logic
code as we do in a typical servlet or a
JSP page and provided a generic
guideline on how we can develop such
application it says an application
should always be divided into three
components called m-v-c Model View and
controller the model represents data the
view is the UI part the controller
manages the application flow makes a
call to some sort of service by using
model and then passes on the model to
the view so this is how the overall flow
works request comes to the application
the controller analyzes it and makes a
decision to call an appropriate business
service to get the model once it
receives the model from the business
service it passes on this model to the
view component in order to form the
final output or response which can be
sent back to the clients browser in case
you are developing a web application
using Java the model is typically a Java
object having some properties along with
getters and setters method and typically
the view is HTML code displaying data by
retrieving it from the model object and
these business services are also the
Java objects having some business logic
to produce a module object I show you in
a real life how this overall concept of
MVC was
see you on a cake shop and this is how
you have organized your shop you have
three rooms in the shop each room has a
different machine installed which has a
capability to prepare a specific type of
cake so the machine in first room
prepares a chocolate cake and the
machines in second and third room
prepares a vanilla and a strawberry cake
respectively you have two employees who
have a skill set of how to decorate a
cake in a specific way say one person
specializes in writing a greeting
message on the cake in English language
and can decorate it further with fruits
other can write a greeting message in
Hindi language and can decorate it
further with green now when some
customer comes to the shop you take the
request and depending on the type of
cake customer wants you delegate the
request to a specific cake maker room
and once the cake is ready and you
receive it you further pass on the cake
to a specific cake decorator as per
customer's choice once the cake is ready
along with desired decoration which
customer asked for you deliver it to the
customer customer is happy this is a
good example of how you see MVC concept
in a real-life situation here model can
be the cake you are the controller and
cake decorator can be the view there is
a little confusion in definition of MVC
different frameworks have implemented
MVC concept in different ways different
people have different perception of MVC
guidelines as there is no formal
definition available for MVC it's not a
question whether someone is right or
someone is wrong only concern is
business project and presentation should
be developed as a separate component
which is the main aim of MVC guidelines
I hope you got the concept of MVC in
general in the next tutorial I'll
introduce you to spring MVC framework
and we'll explain how an actual
application developed using MVC
guidelines look like guys a big thank
you for liking our tutorials I've just
started up with spring MVC series
because of a lot of requests coming to
me day in and day out in the form of
emails and comments if you want me to
upload a series on any specific topic do
post a comment or just an an email to me
I would seek for the most requested
topic and we'll bring it up please hit
the like button if you really like this
video and don't forget to subscribe to
my youtube channel Khan to series and
I'm going to catch you in my next
tutorial that is an introduction to
spring MVC framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
