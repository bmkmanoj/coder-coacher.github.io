earlier tutorial we talked about
lifecycle methods or callbacks in spring
framework using init method and destroy
method attributes in Springs and
vacations I'll in this tutorial we'll
see some other ways that is using
annotations and using initializing beam
and disposable meaning interfaces to do
the same task so what we did so far in
the earlier tutorial we created our
restroom class Springs configuration
file and a test class to test the
lifecycle methods in the restaurant
class we included two methods in it and
destroy and in the Sphynx configuration
file
we included init method attribute add
destroy method attribute just to let
Spring Framework know that we have
written in it and destroy methods in of
a restaurant class such that Spring
Framework needs to call init method
immediately after a restaurant beam is
created by it and it has to call this
destroy method just before it's going to
destroy restaurant being in Springs
container and here we wrote our des
class to test lexical application which
produce output like this we did this
lifecycle demo using init method
attribute and destroy method attributes
this was one approach now there are two
more ways of doing the same thing you
can use either annotations for
specifying lifecycle methods or you can
implement some of the interfaces using
which you can realize lifecycle methods
let's look at annotations way first what
we'll do we will remove this init method
attribute and destroy method attributes
from restaurant means definition instead
what we'll do we'll go to the restroom
class and on the top of the methods
we'll specify what we were doing using
init method attribute and destroy method
attributes in the springs configuration
file using annotations
so what we'll do right here at the post
construct annotation and here we'll
write pre destroy annotation so what we
have done here is using annotation post
construct and pre disorientation we are
doing the same task what we were doing
here in the restaurant beans definition
using init method attribute and destroy
a method attribute if you are using
these annotations in your beam classes
then you will need to declare a beam
post processor in spring's configuration
file so let's do it first and then we'll
understand later why we did it so here
we just need to declare a beam post
processor so if you see here we have
declared common annotation being post
processor in strings configuration file
know why we declared a beam with the
name common annotation in post processor
it's because it's actually being post
processor which reads these annotations
from your beam classes and then act
accordingly and by default these
annotations are not recognized by Spring
Framework in order to enable these
annotations you explicitly need to
declare this being in your strings
configuration file and that's what you
did it here for different set of
annotations there are different beans
you need to declare in springs
configuration file will come back on
this when going to other notations
supported or provided by spring
framework and in the next tutorial we'll
learn more about a beam post processor
concept and its ability demo all right
so for now just understand it in this
way that if you're using post construct
or to destroy annotation you will need
to declare a beam with a name common
annotation being post processor in the
Sphynx Convocation file if you notice
here I haven't provided any name or ID
to this beam why because I've just
provided this
in declaration just flat Spring
Framework know that it should enable
these annotations in it which are by
default not enabled in it and I'm not
going to reference this pin in any other
bean in this spring configuration all
right so now our project is ready we
have provided annotations we have
declared common annotation bean post
processor which is needed for these
annotations in configuration file and
our test class is ready now let's run it
and test it cool the output here is
clearly showing that Spring Framework
called init method immediately after
wrestling beans initialization and it
called destroy method just before
wrested beans destruction by spring
framework or in springs container so
which is saw a demo for lifecycle
methods or callbacks using these
annotations now we said in the beginning
of this tutorial that there is one more
way to do the same task and that is
using initializing being and disposable
being interfaces so we'll see its demo
as well here so what we'll do we'll
simply take these two methods out which
we wrote as init method and sy methods
and also we'll take out this means
declaration which we did for post
construct and we destroy annotations so
what we'll do we'll first implement
initializing bean interface and then we
will implement disposable bean interface
alright so let's do that implements
initializing being interface so if we
see here it's giving error and saying
that we have not implemented the method
which is initializing means so let's do
that add onion committed methods so this
is the method after properties set which
we have implemented
from initializing the interface this
method is exactly same as we have in it
method which we just saw
so while initializing restaurant being
Spring Framework it finds this method in
it it will call this method
immediately after s1 beans
initialization so what we'll do here is
we'll put one SOP which will print on
the console restaurant bean is going to
after property set method on the console
when we run this application now let's
implement a one more interface
disposable bean here
disposable green so against here it's
giving error that we have not
implemented one of the methods provided
by this interface let's implement this
all right so this is the method we have
implemented from disposable being
interface this method is exactly same as
we just saw using pre destroy notation
or destroy method attribute in springs
configuration file with a bean
definition all right so I am putting
here one SOP which simply prints
restaurant bean is destroying gnaw on
the console when we will run the
application so one will run this
application spring framework would call
this method
immediately after initializing a
restaurant bean and spring framework
would call this method
just before s1 beans destruction so
let's go to our test class and run this
application right it has done the same
thing spring framework called after
property set method which is there in
the rational class immediately after
restaurant beans initialization and it
called the destroy method which is again
in the restaurant beam just before s1
means destruction at the end of the main
method here so for lifecycle methods or
callbacks provided by spring framework
we saw three
oh geez one approach was in Springs
configuration file with a beam you
mentioned in it method attribute or
destroy method attribute and the second
approach is using annotations in our
restaurant beam class using post
construct or pedis - annotation and the
third one is using methods provided by
initializing beam interface and
disposable beam interface like this so
you may use any of these three
approaches to realize lifecycle methods
or callbacks provided by string
framework I would suggest always go with
init method attribute and destroy method
attribute provided by Spring Framework
with the beam definition wherever you
want to use life cycle methods and the
reason is if you put in it method or
destroy method attribute with any beam
here in the strings configuration file
then while going through this file
itself you would know what all beans you
have in your project which have life
cycle methods in it otherwise if you do
it using annotations then you will not
have any information of life cycle for
any bean in this file so you need to go
to individual classes to know about what
our classes you have where you have
defined life cycle methods so it's
always easy to use annotations but
recommended way I would suggest is this
init method attribute and destroy method
attribute in the next tutorial we'll see
an important concept in string and that
is being post processor guys thanks for
