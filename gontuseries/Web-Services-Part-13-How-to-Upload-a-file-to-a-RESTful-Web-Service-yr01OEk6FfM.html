in the earlier tutorial we saw a demo on
how to download a file from a restful
web service and in addition to that we
had a look at the response builder
object concept in general in this
tutorial we'll see a demo on how to send
or upload a file to a restful web
service this is what I'm going to do the
client would send a file using HTML form
to the upload student file function
lying in the university restful web
service and then this function would in
turn save it in a specified location on
the servers local disk and then sends a
confirmation message back to the client
that the file uploaded successfully on
the server let's first write the restful
web service program and then we will
write HTML form which can upload the
file to the restful web service let's
start this is the demo we saw on last
tutorial on how to download file from a
restful web service I would delete off
this existing function and create the
new one for this demo just to save some
time I already have written this
function let's go to it I have written
here two functions so what we are doing
in these two functions this first one is
to receive the file object from the
crime and the second one is to save this
file object into the local disk let's go
to this first you need to write the
consume annotation on top of this
function with value multi-part form data
now question is why by writing its value
as multi-part form data you tell to the
web service that this function is
capable of processing a multi-part form
data request or in simple plain English
this function is capable of accepting
the uploaded file from a client once the
client uploads the file
by submitting HTML form to the restful
web service function the file object is
received by the functions parameter
upload input stream as the input stream
object and some additional information
about the file like file name etc is
received by the functions parameter file
detail as the form data content
disposition object using the form data
param annotation so till this tab we
have two variables with us upload it
input stream and file again uploaded
input stream holds the file object and
the file detail holds the additional
information about the file like file
name once the file object and its
related detail is with us we just need
to store it in the local disk so here we
are calling a function saved to disk
let's see what we are doing in this
function first we are specifying where
to save this file so you mention here
the location where you want to save this
uploaded file and then using the
standard code snippet in Java we are
saving the file object into the
specified location using file or puts
team object all right now our code is
ready let's write the client that is
HTML file which can upload the file to
this function just to save some time I
already have written the HTML file let's
go to it this HTML file is having a form
with one label one file input type and
upload button input type file is used to
upload a file to the server when the
client uploads a file using this form
the file who
reach to the restful web services
function which we just wrote using this
action URL wait a crime to study and the
restful web service program is also
ready now let's run the web services
program on the server and test is the
service started let's open the HTML file
using your browser
click on browse and select any file from
your computer I am choosing this image
file here so click on upload
yes the restful web service has uploaded
the file on the server the location
which we gave in the program was the
upload so let's check manually there
where the restful web service has
uploaded the file there or not yes the
restful web service has accurately
uploaded the file at this desired
location in the next tutorial we'll see
demo on checks P integration with
restful web service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
