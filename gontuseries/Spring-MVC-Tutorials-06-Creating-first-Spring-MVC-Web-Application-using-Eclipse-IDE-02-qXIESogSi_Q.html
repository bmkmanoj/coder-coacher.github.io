commute Oh gone to series this part is
in continuation with the earlier part
where I computed writing code for a
basic spring MVC web application only
part remaining was to explain those
parts of the application which I wrote
but did not explain much and last but
not the least running the application on
the tomcat apache server and testing it
so let's add let's say the client
request for a web page using this URL
here this server technology would map
this URL request to something called as
dispatcher servlet provided by spring
MVC framework the dispatcher servlet
also called as front controller in
spring MVC framework would read a file
with the name spring dispatcher servlet
XML file and would further controlled
application based on what we have
written over here in simple words once a
control which is here the front
controllers job is to prepare and send
back response back to the clients
browser in the workflow Technium I
showed you that the front controller
first needs to find out which control
class to be called with the help of
handler mapping classes provided by a
spring MVC framework this is exactly
what is happening over here with the
help of this handler mapping class which
is provided by a spring MVC framework
the front controller makes a decision to
call the hello controller class which we
have written here in the project so
question is how it does it the handler
mapping class would match the incoming
requests you are a pattern with the
beans name of the controller classes
which you provide here in the spring
dispatches of the dot XML file and once
it finds any means named back run is
matching with the incoming class URL
pattern it just suggests the front
controller to make a call to that
controller class and that's what has
happened here
after knowing that incoming questioner
pattern is exactly matching with this
Dean's name which is for Hello
controller class the handler mapping
class just suggests front controller to
make a call to the hello controller
class there is one more important point
I would want to tell you for the handler
mapping classes there are many handler
mapping classes provided by a spring MVC
framework I'm here using the basic one
being named URL handler mapping class
each handler mapping class analyzes and
matches the incoming request URL pattern
using different approaches I am going to
talk much on all hinder mapping classes
their purpose and usage in the
subsequent tutorials alright so once the
control reaches here to the hello
controller class I'm here simply setting
the data which is to be displayed on the
clients browser in the response in the
welcome message variable and the view
name to the model and view object which
is provided by spring MVC framework and
in the end I am just returning back this
object to the front controller
the point to note over here is each
controller class has to be extended from
some base controller class Here I am
extending this controller class from
abstract controller class which is a
basic controller class provided by
spring MVC framework there are many base
controller classes provided by spring
MVC framework you pick any one of those
classes and overwrite any of their
required methods in the class I'm going
to tell more about the different base
controller classes provided by spring
MVC framework their purpose and usage
for different requirements in the
subsequent tutorials
alright so here I am returning back the
model and view object back to the front
controller in this workflow diagram once
the front controller receives the model
and view object returned by the
controller class it will need to find
out the exact location of
view present in the system using the
view resolver classes which are provided
by spring MVC female and that's what is
happening over here
this view is of the class will prepare
the exact location of the view which is
present in the project using this suffix
and prefix values which you mention here
using this mechanism or calculation so
based on this exact address provided by
this view resolver class the friend
controller makes a call to the hello
page or JSP file this one more point I
would want to make here there many view
result for classes provided by spring
MVC Here I am using the basic one that
is internal resource view resolver class
different views are for classes
serve different purpose and usage for
different requirements I'm going to talk
more on all these in my subsequent
tutorials alright so once the control
reaches to the hello pate process we
file here
I am simply retrieving the value of
welcome message variable which hello
controller class has set here and I'm
mixing the value of welcome message
variable along with a required HTML code
which is to be sent back to the clients
browser as a response so once this file
prepares the response it sends it back
to the front controller and the front
controller simply sends it back to the
clients browser as a response so this
completes our basic spring MVC web
application let's run it on the tomcat
apache server and test it right click go
to run as a nun server choose this click
Next
finish
so with this our application is running
successfully on the tomcat apache server
let's test it on the browser paste this
URL on your browser and click enter
so our web application has successfully
sent back the response to the browser in
the next tutorial we'll talk about how
to develop this whole application using
the concept of annotations guys thank
