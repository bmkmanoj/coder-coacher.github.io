welcome a dome called two series this
tutorial is in continuation with alley
one where we learned how to develop this
where they apply means every stage a
which demands climbs to make put kind of
request on it the clients were going to
make use of this API are also supposed
to be specifying the name of a specific
student whose record they want to modify
and in addition with that they are also
supposed to be sending the information
with which they want this record to be
modified at the server side so for this
kind of REST API in the previous
tutorial we included this first API
controller method and how this let's
take a controller method works well when
someone is going to make a request using
this St API the request is going to come
here at this rescue taken to the method
and this part variable annotation is
simply going to extract the value of
student mean from this REST API and
assign the same the student name and
this success body annotation is simply
going to perform the task of mapping
this information to the properties of
student object and the later part of
this API controller method is simply
performing the job of updating this
specific students record into the
database with this object values with
information you know which is come along
with the request and whatever I've just
described in a very brief manner an
exchange in detail in the last tutorial
now let's proceed further and try to
understand how to test this REST API and
also try to understand the meaning of
content-type
request header which client has to make
use of while making a request for this
kind of xjp i all right so let's stop
so to test this REST API lets go to
postman and here type the rest api which
is going to match with the pattern of
this request mapping annotation so here
i'm supposed to be making put kind of
request on it so let's choose here put
type and now here I'm supposed to be
also sending the information with which
I would want to modify this specific
students record and because this
application supports two kind of formats
you know JSON and XML so these are JSON
related jars and this is XML related jar
so because this application supports
JSON as well as XML format so here I
have a choice that while making this
request I will choose either of these
formats to specify the information with
which I would want to modify this record
at the server side so here for
specifying the information I would need
to go to this body tab and here I can
write information in JSON or XML let's
go with JSON first and later I will show
that XML also so this is how to write
JSON message so let's say I want to
modify student name of John with the
value John 1 and I also want to modify
the hop so right now let's say John has
a hobby you know WWE wrestling and I
want to change it to computer science
so here we have developed the whole
message in JSON from it now when I am
going to make put requests on this REST
API with this information what's going
to happen the request is going to reach
this REST API controller method but here
the problem is for a first body
annotation to work means to map this
information to the properties of student
object this needs to know in what format
that information has sent by the client
so for this to work properly client also
needs to send along with the request you
know the information about you know in
what form it it has specified this
information so because we have specified
this information in JSON format so here
I would need to include a header with
key as content type with its value as
application slash JSON
so if client is specifying here
information in JSON format then client
is going to choose value of content type
as application slash JSON and if by any
chance client is providing information
in XML format
in that case client is going to choose
your XML instead of JSON so let's choose
JSON as we have here this message in
JSON format so now our whole message is
ready so now what's going to happen when
I am going to make a put request on this
API with this information you know with
this metadata the request is going to
come here to this escape a controller
method and here path variable annotation
is simply going to extract this students
name means it's going to extract John
and it's going to assign the same to
student name and the first body
annotation would know from this content
type
types value that this message is
actually in the JSON format so what it's
going to do it's going to make use of
JSON related charge which we have
included on to the class part of this
budget to map values of this message to
the properties of this student object
and once it is done then this method is
simply going to update this students
record into the database with the values
of this protein toxic you with the
information which client has sent to
this REST API controller method so
that's how this whole REST API works so
let me very quickly show you how this is
going to work so here let me press the
same button cool so here I've got this
response because of this return value so
here we just understood how our FTP
works which demands crimes to make put
kind of request on it now let's change
here this geo spawn message to its
equivalent XML message so I'll do that
well this is how to write it some
equivalent of this message slash
shouldn't act right tag for this then
how to modify store the names I would
write a tag for that as well here
student underscore name here I'm
supposed to be specifying the name with
which I want Johnson's permission to be
modified at the server side so I want
John's name to be modified to John one
then let me write over here student
hobby student hobby and here let me
specify come to the size
so here I want John's hobby to change
from wrestling to computer science so
here and then now because this message
is now present in the XML format so here
I have to make a change for the value of
content type header I have to specify
here extra mode so now after this change
what is going to happen and I am going
to make a put it based on this rest api
with this information and this metadata
well this rest API controller method is
simply going to extract the value of
name from this rest api assign the same
customer name and the first body
annotation would know from content type
he that this message is in the XML
format so it's going to make use of XML
related jars to convert this message
into its equal Java object that is the
student object and rest it's simply
going to update this students record
with these values of student object so
here in this tutorial we learned how to
make use of content type header you know
to convey to the server that whatever
message you are sending along with the
request is actually present in which
format XML JSON or any other format and
accordingly the rest API controller
method is going to make use of that
message to proceed further because in
the next tutorial I will show you how to
make use of consumes argument with
request mapping annotation all right
