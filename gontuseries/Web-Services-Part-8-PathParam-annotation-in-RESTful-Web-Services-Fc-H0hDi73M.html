in the earlier tutorials we saw concept
and demo of soap and restful web
services and went to on how to test soap
and restful web services using soap UI
and rest client UI testing tools in this
tutorial we are going to talk about on
how to make a function in restful web
service accepts multiple parameters sent
by the client in the HTTP URL as the
path parameters before we go to this
demo let us see what do we mean by a
path parameter in the HTTP URL this is
an example of a path parameters HTTP URL
in this the client has passed two
parameters 23 and 45 if the parameters
are passed in the URL and are listed in
this particular fashion that is
parameters are separated by a forward
slash and all parameters would appear in
the end of the URL then those parameters
are known as the path parameters alright
let's go to this demo for Cle
understanding the client would call a
gate function get student info siding in
the university restful web service using
this HTTP URL these are the roll numbers
of the students which client would pass
to the restful web services function as
a path
parameters and then the restful web
service would receive these parameters
and map them to its function parameters
and send the same roll numbers of the
students back to the client as a
response that stat will use the
university restful application which we
created in an earlier tutorial for this
demo I would delete off all the existing
functions in it and would create the new
one for this demo just to save some time
I already have written the function
let's go through it fully the client
would access this function using this
URL this function would extract these
path parameters using path param
annotation and map them to the strings
student roll number one and student roll
number two the path param annotation
binds the value of HTTP path parameter
to a resource method parameter so our
function is ready let's run it on the
server and test this
paste the URL in your browser and press
Enter
yes the restful web service has accepted
the multiple parameters sent by the
client in the HTTP URL as the path
parameters in the next tutorial we'll
talk about on how restful web service
accepts multiple parameters sent by the
client in the HTTP URL as a query
parameters or a query string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
