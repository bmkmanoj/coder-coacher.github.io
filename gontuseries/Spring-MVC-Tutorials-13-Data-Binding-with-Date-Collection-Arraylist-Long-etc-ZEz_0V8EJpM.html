welcome you to on to series in the
previous tutorials I talked about how to
use model attribute annotation on a
method argument as well as how to use
model attribute annotation on a method
like this now in this tutorial I am
going to talk about some of the advanced
level data binding features which you
may make use of were using model
attribute annotation on a method
argument so let's start because in the
previous tutorial I explained very
clearly about the reason why I used
model attribute annotation on a method
argument like this that is on the
student object mainly I used it for two
reasons sake first reason is it will
automatically bind all request
parameters or form elements submitted by
the user with the corresponding
properties of the student object and the
second reason is in the corresponding
GSP file for this request handler method
that is an admission successor or JSP
file I can use this student object by
simply referring to this scheme like
this this is a kind of wonderful feature
which is provided by Spring embassy
along with this I also showed you very
clearly about what extra lines of code
you might have to write in this request
handler method if you would not prefer
using model attribute annotation on the
student object like thus all these
concepts which I am summarizing now in
short I covered in detail in the
previous tutorials while explaining how
to use model attribute annotation on a
method argument now the point to note
here is if you look at the admission
form dot CSV file it has got two form
elements student name and student hobby
which are of type text now when the user
enters values in both these form
elements and Summits this form on the
browser the request will reach to this
request handler
method and this model attribute
annotation would automatically bind the
values of both these form elements with
the corresponding properties of the
student object which is having string as
a data type now this is an important
thing to note here up till now I showed
you this auto data binding feature
working with the properties of the
student class
having string as a data type but Spring
Embassy has not restricted this auto
data binding feature with only string
type properties but has provided this
feature with any other data type which
you may provide here with the properties
like end 8 long decimal integer any
collection object like ArrayList set or
any user-defined type order let me
explain you what I'm really talking
about here
by including few more properties in this
student class and also making all
related changes and the admission form
Rogers V file and admission success
Torche SP file and later I'll explain
everything to you in detail
all right so here I am a chain is in all
three files that is in student dot Java
file it mentions success tortures
profile and admissions form got GSP file
now let me explain you in detail what I
freely added in all these three files in
the admission form gorgeous B file have
added these three form elements that is
student mobile student data birth and
student skills of which these two
elements are of type text and this third
element is of type multiple select box
in the student class I've added the
corresponding properties that is student
mobile student data birth and student
skills which are of type long date and
ArrayList along with the getters and
setters methods here and in the
admission success gorgeous.we file I've
added this code snippet so as to display
the user entered values for student
mobile student date of birth and student
skills with all other existing form
elements values on the admission
successful page post admission form
rapid submission on the browser by the
user guys let me show you this
application running on the browser and
consequently I'll explain more about the
changes which have just made in this
application now after all these
modifications and the user types this
you are on the prowl and hits enter my
application will send this form as a
response back to him he would fill all
required values say for name is entering
mr. 86 I said for hobby he is putting
music from mobile is putting this number
for date of birth is putting 2010 and 10
and in the slick box he can select any
required values so I'm selecting here
spring MVC and Spain code
now when the user submits
this form here on the browser the
request will reach to this request
handler method and here this model
attribute annotation on the student
object will automatically bind all these
form elements values with the
corresponding properties of the student
object without you bothering on how it
would bind the incoming form data with
any of the particular type of the
corresponding property it's a great
feature and then after this Auto data
binding task which is performed by this
model attribute annotation here spring
MVC would make a call to admission
success dodge as we filed for producing
the final response with this code all
right let me show you this on the
browser by submitting this form cool my
application sent back this webpage as a
response which is as expected by us guys
in this tutorial I showed you some of
the most fundamental auto data binding
features provided by Spain embassy by
including many properties in this
student class having different different
data types now if you don't want to use
this auto data binding feature by simply
not using this model attribute
annotation on the student object you
don't use it but in that case you would
have to write many extra lines of code
in this method and your this request
handler method would probably look like
this so if you are not using model
attribute annotation on the student
object like I showed you before then
probably you have to write all these
lines of code in the sequest handler
method manually so I would always
suggest you to go ahead with using model
attribute annotation on the student
object like this so as to use all
advanced level data binding features
provided by Spring embassy guys so far
in this demo I showed you this feature
of working with built-in data types like
long string date etc and a collection
object ArrayList
now in the next tutorial I'll show you
this feature working with a user-defined
type which is present in the student
class long we looking at the concept of
caching binding errors there is a big
