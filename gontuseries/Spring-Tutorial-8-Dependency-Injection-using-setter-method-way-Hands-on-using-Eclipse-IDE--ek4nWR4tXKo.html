the earlier tutorial we modified our
first spring project to see a demo on
dependency injection using constructor
way we will modify the same example to
talk about dependency injection using
the setup method way this is what we did
earlier we took an example of a
restaurant and T class we created
restaurant class T class and an
interface hotring and provided all our
budgets configuration in the springs
config dot XML file in this file we
simply instructed Spring Framework that
whenever in our test class we request
for a restaurant bean you first create
the key object or T bean and then inject
this object or being into the restaurant
class constructor by going through this
syntax now there's one more facility
spring as provided to us and that is we
can do the same task using a sector
method instead of a constructor in the
restaurant class so what we are going to
do is in the restaurant class I will
simply remove this restaurant
constructor and write a setter method
here and in the spring configuration
file I'll simply change this statement
with some of the statement just to
instruct Spring Framework to use the
setter method in the restaurant class
instead of its constructor to inject tea
bean into the restaurant class all right
so let's make the changes in the
restaurant class just remove this
constructor and add a setter method here
so what we'll do is you'll just modify
this constructor to its setter method
pub like white set hot drink
so in the restaurant class we just have
a hot drink property which is basically
an interface and a setter method which
Spring Framework would use at one time
to set its value with the T object all
right so let's modify spring
configuration file as well just to save
some time I've already made the changes
so let's go through it so here I am
simply instructing Spring Framework that
at runtime it should just find out the
hot drink property in the restaurant
class and using its setter method it
should provide this value to it and we
know this value is nothing but a tea
bean or a tea object all right so our
program is ready let's go and run our
program so with this demo we saw how to
use Spring Framework for providing
dependencies of an object using the
setter method wave in the next tutorial
we'll go through some of the important
configurations which we can set in the
spring configuration file which are very
very important to learn guys thanks for

feedback to us through emails and

feedback is very valuable to us do you
