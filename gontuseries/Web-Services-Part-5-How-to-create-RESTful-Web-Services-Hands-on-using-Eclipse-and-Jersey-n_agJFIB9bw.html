series in the last lessons of canto
series web services we talked about the
concepts of soap and restful web
services we saw a demo of how to create
soap web services using Eclipse IDE in
this lesson we are going to talk about
how we can create restful Web Services
in Eclipse IDE this is what I am going
to do I will write a university restful
web service client will access it using
its you are a client can request
University information in different
formats for example HTML plain text
etcetera and restful web service will
send the response in the requested
format to the client let's start go to
project Explorer right click new and
choose dynamic web project give a name
to the project you will need a
application server or a web server to
deploy restful web services so choosing
the new runtime if you do not find the
one that you are looking for then go to
download additional server adapters to
choose the one and appear in the list in
this example I'm going to use Oracle
WebLogic server 10.3 choosing the one
indexed providing the home part of the
server
finish
click on add project to an ER go to next
next and finish
this result will create the required
folder structures for restful Web
Services we are creating restful web
services using Jersey so we will need
chassis jars go to the website Jersey
dot java.net
hit download click on zip of Jersey and
this will download the required jazzy
jazz after extracting the Jersey zip you
will find the folder structures like
this go to the lip and copy all the
chassis jars and include it in the
project
now create a university resource right
click choose class give a package name
give a name to the class
finish and done let's modify the default
template class include at the rate part
annotation this annotation specifies
that this restful web service is
exposing a university resource which can
be accessed by the client using this URI
exporting the required jars
I will explain the already written
University class just to save some time
I will turn here to get methods and one
put method if a client wants the
response message in HTML format then
this method will get executed and if the
client wants the response in plain text
then this method will get executed at
the rate produces annotation tells that
this method will produce the response
only in this specified format if a
client wants to update the student
information present in the university
restful web services he can do so by
calling the put method of the university
resource Klein can pass some students
specific information to the server using
this URI in this case client is passing
students role number to the method and
the method would retire meter using at
the rate path annotation just before the
method and update university info method
would retrieve this student role number
from the URI using this syntax then you
can use student role number to update
that students specific information in
the database and then you can return
back the success message to the client
now a university resource is ready
client can access to get methods and one
put method in this University resource
let's modify the default web dot eczema
created by eclipse wizard
this is the default web dot XML created
by eclipse Azad just replace the
contents of this file with this one your
restful web services is now ready to
build and deploy go to the project
choose run as one on server choose the
server click on next if you have already
created the domain of the server then
provide the path here in this example I
am going to create a new instance of the
server that I am using
providing the name and location of the
server where we want its domain to be
created click on finish and this will
create the domain of the server click on
finish and this will deploy the restful
web services on the server
now your restful Web Services is up and
running you can test restful web
services directly on the browser by
default this way the browser calls up
the get method of the university restful
web services and requests for the HTML
representation of the resource you may
use jax-rs api is to write a class and
tests or as full web services or you can
test it using standard tools like rest
client UI etcetera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
