welcome you to gone to cities so far in
the rest series of tutorials I talked
about how to develop get put and post
kind of rest api s-- now in this
tutorial let's try to understand how to
build those kind of rest api is which
would demand delete kind of a request to
be made on them so that's that get in
general we go for developing such kind
of rest api is you know in those kind of
scenarios where we want user to make a
request to the application to request it
delete a certain resource which is
present there now what does deleting the
resource means let's try to understand
this overall concept of deleting
resource using a very simple requirement
in this demo application so your my
requirement is very simple things all I
want is user to make a request to this
application to delete a specific
students record that's all about it so
what task I would perform here to
fulfill the sick one well I'm going to
simply provide the users this REST API
so when a user is going to make a delete
request on this REST API you know by
specifying the name of the student
within the REST API itself in at the end
you know whose record user want to
basically delete from the application
when that adverse is going to reach this
application this application is simply
going to delete that students record if
it's successfully able to delete it then
it's going to return true and if it's
not able to delete it successfully it's
going to return false in the response
body to the client
now question is what could I got to
write in this controller class so as to
fulfill this requirement so as to build
this specific REST API is for get put
and the post kind of rest api is which
we developed in the earlier tutorial
whenever we were developing a new REST
API we were basically including a new
REST API controller method you know in
the controller class so here also we are
not going to do something you know extra
this is what is required for building
this REST API all I need to do is to
include a new REST API controller method
in this Java class and albita so let's
do one thing let me include the required
REST API controller method for this REST
API and later I will explain all related
concepts to you in detail so here I am
done with including they required REST
API controller method for the REST API
which we wanted to develop in this
tutorial now let us understand this step
by step guys now when a user is going to
make a delete request on this REST API
and when that request is going to reach
this application you know this REST API
controller method is going to be called
why because of this pattern and this
argument request method dot delete so
once this controller method is called
this part variable annotation is simply
going to extract the name of the student
from the REST API which client has used
to make the request and is going to
assign the same to this student name and
after that this method is just trying to
delete this students record from the
database so it's successfully able to
delete it then it is going to return
true otherwise it's going to return
false to the fly here I haven't written
the exact logic you know all those
if-else kind of clauses just to keep
this tutorial a bit simpler but in your
actual project you are supposed to be
writing you know the logic based
your project requirement right so after
including this rest EK controller method
now if I go to the postman and let's I
want to delete the D students record you
know whose name is a d-roc so in that
case what I would do I would specify the
name of the student at the end of this
rest api that's what is this URL pattern
and then I would make a delete request
on this so choose delete now I'm not
supposed to be sending any information
along with it and when I'm not sending
any information I'm not required to even
you know send any headers along with the
request so I will delete this off now if
you want the response of this you know
in the XML format then you may specify
this header except because when you
specify accepts value as application
slash XML in that case or whatever
response this application is going to
generate you know that has to be XML so
if it can generate in XML it's only then
this is going to send a response is
going to process the request otherwise
it's simply going to you know tell to
the client that it cannot process the
request because it's response cannot be
generated by it in XML format because
this application can generate in XML
format so if we specify her accepts
value as application slash XML so it's
going to work properly now after this if
I make a delete request on this REST API
what's going to happen well I expect
true in the response body and status
code as 200 okay it's if this happens or
not cool so here I've got two as
response body and status as 200 okay and
I have here gotta you know this response
body in XML format file because of this
accepts value application slash
XML
now if I delete this and then I make a
request then it's up to the application
to decide in what format it has to send
the response now this application
supports XML as well as JSON formats so
it will decide you know on its own in
what format it has to prepare and send
the response now it's not a compulsion
for this application to prepare the
response in XML and send the same to the
client so now if I make a request here
I've got the response in XML format now
here I've got XML not because it was
mandatory for this application to send
you know the response in XML it just
that out of JSON and XML it chose XML by
default that's all about it
but if we would have written here
accepts value as application slash XML
in that case ablation you know what I
have to send the response in XML only
and if it's not capable of sending in
XML then it wouldn't have process the
request itself it would have a raised
some kind of exception of error all
right now one more important concept you
have to understand him here we give user
kind of the flexibility to request you
know for deleting a specific students
records so this REST API is going to
help user to achieve the same now what
if we want to give user you know kind of
flexibility to make a request to delete
all student records from this
application so how you would do that
let's also very easy guys all we need to
do is to create a new arrest API
controller method and here if I delete
all students let's change the comments
deleting all student records and here
now we don't want user to specify you
know a specific students name at the end
of the rest api we want it to make a
request to you know delete all students
record is
DK is going to you know help with such a
requirement now we don't need this part
variable because user is not specifying
any students name within the rest API
this I'm going to delete off from here
and here let's change the comment delete
all student quads from the database same
thing if it's successfully able to
delete all records it's going to return
true and status code as a 200 ok
otherwise false with an Apple bit status
code now here again I won't return the
complete logic you know all those if
else kind of clauses in your actual
project you are supposed to be writing
you know all that real logic based on
your specific projects requirement so
now if I make a request you know by
making use of this tax one and delete
request yeah it's already delete what I
expect I expect it to return me true
which status code as 200 okay let's see
if that happens or not cool so here I've
got that body is true status code as
tunak okay it means application
successfully deleted all student records
from its database so in this application
I tried extending you how to design and
develop those kind of rest api is which
would demand delete kind of a request to
be made on them so we tried
understanding how to delete or you know
a specific students record we build the
rest api for the same and then we build
another rest api you know to give user
kind of flexibility to be able to
request for deleting all student records
from the database in the next tutorial i
would talk about how to use spring
client to access these rest api is what
we have developed so far so far we have
using postman tool to test these REST
API s to access these resting-place from
the next tutorial onwards we would learn
how to use spring framework itself to
write java code to test you know and
access these West eight days guys a big
thank you for learning REST API concepts
using spring MVC seen worked with me if
you have any feedback or any
constructive comment do post me a
comment below the video or simply write
to me on this email id for all of your
queries please like this video share
this video if this video has proved
useful to you and don't forget to
subscribe to my youtube channel gone to
series to get regular updates on what
all tutorials we upload you know to our
