welcome you to gone to series in the
last tutorial we learned the concept of
a magnet or mapping in hibernate
application now in this tutorial we'll
proceed a little further and we'll
understand the concept of a
bi-directional many-to-one one-to-many
mapping in hibernate application so
let's start I showed you two tables at
the start of earlier tutorial and said
that this student table is having a
magnitude 1 relationship or a mapping
with the student address table and then
I showed you how to establish the same
relationship or a mapping at the java
code level in hibernate classes if you
look over main class Here I am just
inserting two student objects into the
student table
but what hibernated when I ran the
application it not just inserted these
two student objects into the student
table but also inserted the related
student address object into the student
address table to the ideas if you have
this relationship defined in a student
class then hibernate will automatically
perform an action on the student address
object if required when an action is
performed on the student object this
auto casket feature you can control
using the casket type property of
many-to-one
annotation in the student class this is
a kind of one direction order feature
you just achieved now if you want this
feature in other direction too that is
whenever you perform an operation on the
student address object hibernate should
perform an operation on the related
student objects too then you will need
to write some extra code in the student
address class here just add a collection
set of student class along with it
scatters and setters method and on top
of it just mention I want too many
annotation with a casket
and not by properties and you're done
let's understand what we just did if a
student class is having a money to one
relationship with a student address
class then it's but obvious that the
student address class will have a
one-to-many relationship with the
student class and because of that a
student address class will always refer
to a collection of student objects and
not just a single student object and
that's a reason I created here a
reference of a collection set of student
class with the annotation one-to-many on
it and I put here the caste type all
which means that for every operation I
perform on a student address object
hibernate is automatically going to
perform an action on the related
collection set of student objects I am
going to dedicate a full tutorial on
this map by concept in the next tutorial
so for now just ignore it
let's it running here in the main class
earlier I inserted records into the
student table and hibernate
automatically inserted a record into the
student address table without me writing
a save statement to do so now with all
these changes I am going to the reverse
I will insert a record into the student
address table and hibernate will
automatically insert the related student
records into the student table here I'll
do one more thing I will assign the
student object references to the
collection set property of student
address objects now I'm gonna save only
student address object and what I am
expecting with the additional code I
have written in the student address
class hibernate should not just insert a
record into the student address table
but also should insert all the student
objects which are linked to the student
address objects let's run and assess
yes hibernate has inserted a record into
the student address table and also two
records into the student table in the
next tutorial we will learn the concept
of a map by property along with knowing
the concept of owning and known on
insights in hibernate application in
case of a bi-directional mapping guys a
big thank you for liking my tutorials on
hibernate I welcome all your queries
comments and feedback down the video or
send me an email on this ID your any
sort of interaction make me upload more
and more videos so keep them up to
comments emails or sharing the
information across like the video if you
really liked it and I'm going to catch
you in my next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
