welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial we are going to learn about an
important annotation with the name
response status so what happens when we
request for a web page using HTTP
protocol on some browser let's say this
HTTP website on a Google Chrome browser
so when I press ENTER I get this rapid
as a response from the server now an
important point to notice with every
HTTP response server sends one more
important information and that's called
status code so let's first check the
value of status code which server has
sent along with this HTTP response and
later we will learn in detail what
exactly it means to check value of
status code I have here installed a
Google Chrome extension with the name
HTTP headers if you don't know how to
install it please follow these simple
steps and you will be able to do so so
when I click on it here it's showing 200
ok as a status code value which server
has sent for this HTTP response because
when your browser gets 200 ok as a
status code value with any HTTP response
it just indicates that the server has a
processed they request successfully
without any exception error or trouble
now let me try to access some web page
which I know for sure doesn't exist on
this websites server so for this request
server has send this customized error
web page saying page not phone with
status code as for not for not phone
case when a browser gets for not for not
phone as a status code value with any
HTTP response it just indicates that the
requested backplate is actually
not found on the server and the return
response is actually an error webpage on
the screen I have listed a couple of
important status codes with their
description for the complete list of
codes these go through the blue t dot
washi website so the important point to
note over here is with every edge to TP
response serve the sends an appropriate
value of status code which describes it
correctly now let's look at our demo
application for this application when I
request for an admission form using this
URL this controller method is a gonna
through an automatic exception and
because of that Spring Framework
is going to make a call to this generic
exception handler method and is going to
return this customized aerovac page back
to me like this now let's check what
status code application has sent along
with this customized error web page so
here it's showing 200 ok now that seems
like a big problem guys
200 ok server sends only for the cases
where it fulfills the request
successfully without any trouble but
here actually it's not the case I
requested for an admission firm and
server returned with this customized
error web page because while processing
this request it encountered some
unexpected condition for all such cases
where server encounters an unexpected
condition and returns an error vapid
instead of the desired web page server
should send 500 internal server error as
status code with that HTTP response and
not 200 ok so question is what task I
should perform in this application so
that when Spring Framework makes a call
to this exception handler method it
returns 500 internal server error
a status code value with customized
adapted and not 200 okay there's to do
so spring MVC framework says hey
developers just put an annotation with
the name response status on top of this
exception handler method and do it just
pass the status code which you want to
return with HTTP response so here after
this change when Spring Framework is
going to make a call to this exception
handler method it's going to send this
HTTP status means internal server error
500 status code with this customized and
rapid let's check it on the browser cool
so here I have received this customized
error web page and here status code as
500 internal server error which
describes this web page correctly so
with the help of response status and
edition we can actually instruct spring
MVC framework to send an appropriate
status code along with customized Arabic
page
when it makes a call to a specific
exception handler method like in this
case we saw alright in the next tutorial
we can learn about spring MVC web
services concept guys a big thank you
