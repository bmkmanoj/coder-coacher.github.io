this is a quick tutorial to talk about
how to quickly install MySQL database in
your local machine and how to access it
using a graphical user interface for any
database related operations this
tutorial I have specially provided in
the hibernate series of tutorials for
all who have not yet installed any other
database and want to quickly install
MySQL and use that that two ways of
installing MySQL database first ways go
to the My School website download and
install the MySQL database and then
again download and install the GUI tools
like SQL wave - ql workbench etcetera
separately to access it for all the
database related operations and the
second way is install the vamps server
which is an installer that would install
both MySQL database and the great tool
to interact with the database for all
crude operations I am going to the
second way that is installing the vamps
server because it is a trickiest way to
install both MySQL and the GUI tool in
just one go let's start go to the
website web server and download
devappserver exe for your local machine
vamp server Exe will download three
things for you apache server mysql
database and PHP in this PHP myadmin is
a great tool to interact with MySQL for
all the database operations you would
see here download for 32-bit computer
and 64-bit computer so if you have a
64-bit computer choose the 64-bit Ram
server and if you have a 32-bit computer
choose the 32-bit Pam server if you are
not sure which system you have go to the
start computer right-click and choose
properties and here you would find
system type
we shall talk about what system you have
it is 64-bit or 32-bit since my system
is 64-bit I have chosen 64-bit download
once the download is done click the exe
to run it simply go with all the
recommended options and you are done
click on run say yes click on next
accept the agreement it's asking for
where to install vamp server you can
choose the default one which is at C
Drive or you can give your own so for me
I am giving D Drive as a location of the
vamp click on next create desktop icon
for the vamp server click on next and
then click on install so this will
install MySQL database Apache server and
the gwee tool to access the database
click on open go with the default
options click on next click on finish so
this has installed vamp server in your
local machine now go to your desktop and
you would find here ramp server icon
just click on it click on yes and
immediately that you would find a vamp
server icon over here just click on it
and click on start all services this
would start MySQL database Apache server
and the PHP my admin which is the GUI
tool to access the database now your
server is started go to the PHP myadmin
so this is the GUI tool which you would
use to access the MySQL database go to
the database you would find here lot of
database which are already there which
have come along with the MySQL
installation you can create your own new
database for example for all my
hibernate tutorials I am going to use
hibernate tutorials database so let's
create that click on create and this
would create hibernate tutorials a new
database in MySQL you can create new
tables using this create table option or
you can view records in any table by
clicking on the tables name or you can
write and execute queries in this SQL
tab in the next tutorial we'll start
writing our first hibernate java
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
