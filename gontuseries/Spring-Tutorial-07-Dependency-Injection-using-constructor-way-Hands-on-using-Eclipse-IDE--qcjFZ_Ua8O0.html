tutorials so far in the tutorials what
we did was we created a restaurant class
which has a greet customer method which
greets a customer when we call this
method it has a property welcome note
along with a set of method the value of
this property is coming from the
configuration file here we have provided
the value of this property and then we
wrote a test class where we invested
Spring Framework to provide us with the
restaurant object and when we executed
this spring application it printed
welcome to a restaurant node on the
console which is coming from strings
configuration file in simple words we
saw how to use spring framework for
creating a Java object without you doing
it programmatically now let's modify
this example to see a demo on dependency
injection concept using the constructor
way what we will do is you will write a
T class with just a function for pure T
the restaurant class will use T class to
prepare T and for doing this we will use
the concept of an interface and take
help off Springs framework to provide T
object to the restaurant class to its
constructor argument at runtime let's
create an interface hot drink and go to
the package new and then interface write
a name to this interface hovering just
as if some time I have already written
this interface let's go through it it
has just a declared function prepare hot
drink which T class is going to
implement so let's create the T class go
to the package new class give a name T
to this class and since this class is
going to implement the hotting interface
provide the hot drink interface here
or drink select it click on okay and
then finish so the clips result has
created the tea class which is
implementing hotring interface and here
is the method which it has implemented
from hot drink interface let's write a
system dot out dot println message here
which just prints dear customer we are
preparing tea for you on the console
when we call this prepare hot drink
function from restaurant class now let's
modify the restaurant class we'll take
out all these earlier contents just to
save some time I've already it in this
class let's go through it
the restaurant is having just a function
prepare hot drink it is using hot drink
interface to call a method prepare hot
drink which is written in the tea class
if you observe here I am NOT
initializing hot during interface value
with the tea object anywhere instead
what I am doing here is I have written
here the restaurant constructor at
runtime Spring Framework will create the
tea object first and then call the
restaurant constructor to pass the value
of tea object here as the argument and
then here a restaurant class will
initialize the value of hard drink with
the tea object now in order to tell
Spring Framework that at runtime it has
to create the tea object and pass it to
this constructor will need to modify the
springs configuration file as well let's
go to the springs configuration file
just to save some time I've already
modified this configuration file let's
go through it here I am creating tea
bean and here I am instructing Spring
Framework to inject tea
object into the restaurant class
constructor using this syntax not
runtime when we request Spring Framework
to get as the restaurant object in our
test class it will check this
constructors tag and then inject the
reference being into the restaurant
class constructor all right so our
application is ready let's cool
in our test class and modify it to use
the prepare hotting function let's run
our application grid it's displaying
gear customer we are preparing tea for
you we just find a more on dependency
injection concept using the constructor
way in the next tutorial we'll modify
the same demo to showcase dependency
injection using this set of method way
