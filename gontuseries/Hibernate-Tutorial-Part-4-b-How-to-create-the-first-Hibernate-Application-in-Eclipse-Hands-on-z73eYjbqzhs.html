series this tutorial is in continuation
to the previous tutorial where we went
to hibernate configuration file we went
to hibernate dot CFG dot XML file and
talked about all the essential
properties which are needed for creation
of a basic hibernate java application in
this tutorial we'll create a model class
student info which we want to store or
persist into the database let's start go
to source right-click and create a new
class with the name student info give a
name to the package
click on finish' let us have just two
variables in the class roll number and
name of the student which we would be
storing or persisting into the roll
number and name column of the students
information table in the database
let's generate the Gators and setters
I'm done
they're two ways using which you can use
this model class to interact with the
database using the hi penetrate first is
using the annotations and the second is
using the xml's in this demo I will be
using annotations and we'll look at
using xml's in the later tutorials if
you are using annotations there are two
mandatory annotations which we need to
include in this class the first
annotation is a trait entity and the
second one is at the right idea notation
let's include at the rate entity
annotation let's include the import for
adroit entity annotation the edge weight
entity annotation tells hibernate that
the class is an entity that is a class
written to persist or hold data into or
from the database let's include the
second mandatory annotation at the rate
ID
let's include the import for this
a droid ID annotation is to specify the
primary key and since ol number is a
unique number to every student I have
applied a great idea notation to the
roll number field in this model class we
are done with the model class creation
there are many more annotations in
hibernate use language you can use more
or advanced features of hibernate and
very important thing to note over here
is when you would pass this model class
object to the hibernate functions for
storing or persisting the object into
the database table it would save in the
student underscore info table by default
that is in the table with the same name
as the class name if you want to save
this model class object to a database
table with some other name you can
mention that using the add great table
annotation so let's apply that this
annotation lies at the class level
let's include the import for this
control-shift
Oh choose the Java X persistence table
now after writing this annotation are
told hibernate whenever I pass this
object for saving or deleting the record
or performing any other database
operation just consider this student
underscore information table now the
only step remaining is to specify the
name of this annotated model class in
the hibernate configuration file so
let's quickly do it go to the hibernate
dot CFG dot XML file and write this
model class name along with the package
information here
in you hibernate project you can create
as many model classes as you want but
you need to mention the name of all such
model classes here in the hibernate
configuration file like this we are done
with the model class creation in the
next tutorial we'll look at writing code
to persist or store this model class
into the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
