welcome you to gone to series in the
earlier tutorial we went through the
complete introduction of Java
programming language now we will start
setting up develop an environment for
writing programs using Java so let's
install Java first and then we'll go on
proceeding with other steps in it go to
the record website and download Java
platform that is JDK JDK means Java
development kit it includes everything
that is complete kit which is needed to
develop and run Java programs
technically JDK includes Java Runtime
environment along with other tools which
are needed to write develop and monitor
Java programs we're going to look at
each tool which is included in JDK
further in our tutorials but for now
important thing is JRE Gerry stands for
Java runtime in one it is basically the
java virtual machine where your Java
programs run on in simple plain English
when you only care about running Java
programs on your browser or computer you
will only install GRE it's all unit on
the other hand if you are planning to do
some Java programming which we're going
to do we will need complete Java
development kit that is GRE along with
other tools for writing running
debugging and monitoring our Java
applications and that's what I am
installing here complete Java
development kit all right so let's
proceed further click on it this will
get you to download java development kit
page here depending on the operating
system you work on you choose Java
installer type if you work on Linux
download JDK for Linux if you work on
Mac download JDK for Mac since I work on
Windows operating system I'm going to
choose JDK for Windows there are two
options for downloading JDK for Windows
operating system windows x86 and Windows
X
Steve for it depends on the type of
operating system you have you have
32-bit operating system or you have
64-bit operating system so if you have
32-bit then you download windows x86 and
if you have 64-bit operating system
you download Windows x64 now how you
know which one is yours just click on
start button off your computer right
click on my computer and choose
properties here in the system type you
will know whether your system is 64-bit
or 32-bit and since my operating system
is 64-bit I'm going to choose JDK
installer for windows 64-bit operating
system that is Windows x64 you'll need
to accept the license agreement for
downloading JDK installer accept it and
click on download link once it is
downloaded click on it and just proceed
with all options it asks for installing
JDK on your machine here click on Next
and choose development tools this is the
default part here this wizard is going
to install Java on your machine you may
choose any other by clicking on this
change click on next and this will start
installing Java on your machine so it's
displaying message Java successfully
installed on your computer now click on
close so here we finished downloading
and installing Java platform on our
computer guys please like this video if
it really helped you and I'm going to
catch you in my next tutorial that is
understanding and installing Eclipse IDE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
