series in the last lesson we talked
about what is hibernate and why we need
hibernate for a java application in this
lesson we'll talk about the setup needed
in the Eclipse workspace to use
hibernate the first step to use
hibernate is to download the hibernate
related jars and include them in the
classpath go to the download section of
the hibernates website and click on the
release bundles click on the latest
repository and then download the release
app by clicking here this will start
downloading once the download gets
successful extract the contents of the
zip on to your local machines Drive and
the contents would look like this go to
the Lib directory you would find a lot
of directories over here which contains
the hibernate related jars the required
folder contains all the necessities
which you need for creating a basic java
application hibernate core is the main
jar of hibernate which contains all the
hibernate related api's and rest all
these jars are dependencies of hibernate
so apart from including hibernate core
in your class path you would also need
to include all these dependencies in
your class path because hibernate uses
them if we go back we would find a lot
of deities other than the required
directory which contains the hibernate
related jars all these directories
contains the jars which are therefore
some advanced features of hibernate like
secondary level caches and many other
features we will talk about all those
advanced features in our upcoming
tutorials now let's switch to the
Eclipse workspace and start configuring
our first hibernate project go to the
package Explorer right-click and choose
a new Java project give a name to the
project
click on finish we will need to add all
hibernate related jars to the classpath
of our first hibernate project so go to
the project's name click on properties
go to the Java build path libraries and
click on add libraries double click on
user library click on user libraries
click on new and give a name to this
user define library make sure that you
will not select system library as this
is the user defined library which we are
going to create for hibernate related
just click on ok.now at all hibernate
related jars in the newly created
hibernate library select all click on
open so this would add all hibernate
related jars which are required for
hibernate project in this newly created
hibernate library click on ok finish and
ok so we can see that we have just added
a user-defined library with the name
hibernate library which contains all
these jars which are required for
creating a basic hibernate java
application we are done with the first
step and the second step is to include
the java database driver in the projects
class part for the relational database
that you want to use for all my
hibernate tutorials I am going to use
MySQL database I have already installed
this database on my machine so whichever
relational database that you want to use
it could be a record
Postgres derby or any other relational
database first install the database in
your machine and download the java
database driver of that database from
its website and include that in the
projects class path I have already
downloaded the database driver for MySQL
in my machine so let's include that in
the
classpath go to the project's name right
click and choose properties go to the
Java build path libraries and add
external jars I have already downloaded
the jar for Java database connectivity
this is the jar MySQL connector Java
click on open and click on OK we can see
that we have added Java database driver
in the projects class path in this
tutorial we configured Eclipse workspace
for all hibernate related tasks in the
next tutorial we would start writing our
first hibernate java application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
