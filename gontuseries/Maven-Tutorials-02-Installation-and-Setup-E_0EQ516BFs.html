welcome you to come to series in the
previous tutorial we learned what
exactly is this even tool all about now
this tutorial I'll show you how to
install and set up movin on your
computer so let's start let's order
these are the only steps we need to
follow to install it but wait a moment
before we start following these simple
steps we need to make sure that of a
computer has 1.6 or later version of JDK
installed on it along with this we also
need to make sure that the environment
variable Java underscore home is set
with the value of JDK installation path
and also the path environment variable
is set with the value of JDK
installation location up to bin
directory these are the only
prerequisites for maven installation
guys please make sure that you have all
these presets running on your computer
before you head towards maven
installation I have jdk 1.7 installed on
my computer and both environment
variables that is Java underscore home
and part are set with appropriate values
so I am going to start following these
simple steps to install mirror alright
go to the patch a maven project website
and download the latest available
version of maven distribution archive by
clicking here this would start
downloading maven distribution archive
on your computer once it is downloaded
fully simply unzip it to the degree
where you should install Niemann on your
computer cool
but this maven distribution archive is
successfully downloaded on my computer
click on it click on extract to
I'm going to unzip it and my D Drive
under maven folder click on ok cool so
this has extracted all the contents in
my D Drive under maven folder now the
only pending task here is to set a
couple of environment variables on my
computer for that go to start right
click on computer click on properties
click on advanced system settings click
on environment variables click on new
the first environment variable here we
would add is M to underscore home
because its value would be the path
where we have just extracted maven that
is this value copied and simply paste it
here click on OK this is one more
environment variable we need to set here
and that is the path environment
variable double click on it and simply
attend its value with the location where
we have extracted maven upto bin
directory means this path copied and
simply paste it here and click on OK
that is with this we have successfully
installed Nieman on this computer the
quickest way to check whether we have
installed all things correctly or not is
to go to the start button and type here
CMD in the command prompt window type MV
n version like this and press Enter
it's saying I have Apache maven 3.2 dot
3 installed on this computer if it won't
get this it means there's some mistake
you have made while installing even on
your computer in the next tutorial I'll
show you how to create a Java project
with the help of Niemann with all
related concepts in detail guys a big
