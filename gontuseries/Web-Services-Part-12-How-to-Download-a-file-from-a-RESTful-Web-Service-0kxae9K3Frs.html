in the earlier tutorial we saw a demo on
how a restful web service accepts forum
parameters sent by the client by
submitting the HTML form in this
tutorial we'll see demo on how you can
download a file from a restful web
service or in simple words the client
would send a request to the get student
file function lying in the University's
restful web service and then this
function would send a file as a response
to the client the client would be bobbed
up with an option to save or open the
file so client can either save the file
in his local disk or just open it let's
start this is the demo we saw in last
tutorial about how a restful web service
accepts multiple form parameters sent by
the client by submitting the HTML form
using form param annotation I will
delete off this existing function and
would create the new one for this demo
just to save some time I already have
written this function so let's go to it
fully the client would access this
function using this URL this function
can send text file as a response if you
want any other file type to be sent to
the client as a response just change the
produces annotation to an appropriate
value and you are done for example for
sending PDF file as a response change
the value of produces annotation to
application slash PDF this statement
would frame the file object to be sent
to the client from the file stored at
this location now there are two ways to
send the response from a restful web
service to the client first ways just
send the requested object directly like
this that is return the file object
directly to the
as a response and the second ways wrap
the requested object into the response
builder object first and then send the
response object to the client so what's
the difference in the tool sometimes you
would want to send some extra
information to the client other than the
requested object alone as a response for
example you want to send status code say
200 okay explicitly along with the
requested object or you would want to
explicitly tell the client about some
information about the response object
let's take our example what we want is
when we send the file to the client
client should be popped up with an
option to save or just open the file and
to do so explicitly you will need to
tell the browser to show the pop-up when
it gets the response from the server and
this requirement we achieve using the
response builder object let's see what
we are doing in the code for this we are
first wrapping the requested file object
to the response builder object and then
explicitly telling the browser to show
the popup message by setting the
response header values as content
deposition meaning instructing the
browser to show a pop-up when the
response from the server reaches the
point if you want to present this file
with some of the name other than its
original name to the client you can
mention that as well to the response
header using this value attachment file
name property you can see here that I
have mentioned here the name of the file
as display name demo file dot txt so
this is the name client would see for
the file when it gets a response from
the web services server let's save a txt
file with some data with the name demo
file dot txt at this location for this
demo
you
you
let's run the web service on the server
and test this page the URL in your
browser and press Enter
this is the response from the restful
web service you may open or save the
file let's open the file yes the
residual web service has sent the file
as a response to the client in the next
tutorial we'll see a demo on how to
upload a file for example PDF image text
or any other file type to a restful web
service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
