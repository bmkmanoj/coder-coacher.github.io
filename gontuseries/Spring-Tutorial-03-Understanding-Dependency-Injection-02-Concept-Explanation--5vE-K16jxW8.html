this is in continuation to the part 1
where we saw all the problems which may
arise if you are creating an object
inside another class using the new
operator with the help of a restaurant
and T class example we clearly
understood how bad is your class is
design when you create a direct
dependency of one class over other now
we understood the problem but what's the
solution how the restaurant class use
the T class for preparing tea without
creating T object inside the restaurant
class and here comes the dependency
injection principle into the picture it
will solve the problem the restaurant
class will use the T class without
creating the object inside it using such
a principle simply and hence the code
readability your code would be better
manageable the Spring Framework is the
most popular and used implementation of
dependency injection principle across
the globe in this tutorial we will
understand the DI concept using the same
restaurant and T class example and in
subsequent tutorials
we will see demos on how Spring
Framework has implemented the concept in
detail the little meaning of dependency
injection is to inject dependency of an
object from outside all right let's
understand the concept with a real life
analogue if you want to have a cup of
coffee and you know this depends on many
other objects or has many dependencies
like coffee beans milk sugar a clean mug
electric kettle to boil the milk and any
other ingredients which you like and
coffee you have two choices you can
prepare the coffee object by resolving
every single dependencies of it by
yourself
from start till end or you just order
someone who is an expert for preparing
coffee
you will get the end product that is cup
of coffee without worrying about any of
its dependencies the coffee expert will
first gather all its dependencies and
then inject it into the coffee object
before giving it to you so it's like you
want to have coffee why to bother about
its dependencies same concept applies in
coding also for example here why are you
creating dependencies of restaurant
class yourself you need restaurant
object then by taking care of creating
its dependencies yourself in the class
outsource this task to some expert which
could be a program written by you or
pre-existing ones like Spring Framework
which does the job of creating and
providing the dependencies of the
requested object at runtime from non
will call this expert as some
third-party program so the idea is when
the restaurant object is created all its
dependencies would be created and
provided to it from outside by such a
third-party program in order to use such
a third-party program you will need to
change the class's design also by
introducing an interface in your project
you will use an interface which will
mind the restaurant and D class let's
write an interface hot drink the
restaurant class will use this interface
instead of tea object and the tea class
will implement this interface in the
restaurant class you will write a
constructor or a setter method using
which the third party program will
initialize the value of hotting
interface with the tee object I have
written here constructor method you may
change it with a setter method like this
all depends on your choice so you have
made all the design changes now you
simply instruct this third-party program
which supports TI that at runtime when
the restaurant object is created it
should create and inject the tee object
into the restaurant class through the
constructor argument if you using spring
framework this instruction you provide
in a configuration file provided by
spring and if you are using some other
third-party program you provide the
instruction the way that program accepts
it that's all about dependency injection
spring framework provides two ways of
dependency injection using the
constructor way and the setter method
way it's difficult to understand the
concept without a proper demo even if
you didn't understand the concept fully
don't worry as of now I will cover
everything in depth related to it in the
subsequent hands-on tutorials in the
next tutorial we will see the
installation and setup needed for Spring
Framework using an Eclipse IDE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
