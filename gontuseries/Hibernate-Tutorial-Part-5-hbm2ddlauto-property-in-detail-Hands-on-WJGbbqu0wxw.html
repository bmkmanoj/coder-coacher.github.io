series in the previous tutorials we
talked about how to create a basic
hibernate application and went to all
the steps needed to do that
we first created the hibernate dot CFG
dot XML file to configure the hibernate
application and then created the model
class student' underscore info that we
wanted to store or persist into the
database and finally we wrote the code
which would save the model object
student underscore info into the
database in this tutorial we are going
to talk about one of the most important
properties which we use in the hibernate
configuration file HBM
to DD l dot auto property this property
can hold one of the four values create
create drop update and validate but
before that let us have a quick look at
our database hibernate tutorials which
we used in the hibernate application i
have already deleted all the tables from
this database completely so consider
this database as a fresh database with
no tables in it so what we'll do is for
the same application that is saving the
student underscore info object into the
student underscore information table in
the database we'll see the demo and
explanation for each property one by one
so let's start let's give its value as
creator
run the application check the output it
created the table student underscore
information with data as roll number one
and name as gone to one now let's change
the roll number as two and name as gone
to two
application let's check the output oops
what it has done where is the earlier
required that we inserted last time that
is Sol number one and name has gone to
one and here lies the point hibernate
says if you keep its value as create
every time you run your hibernate
application it will drop off the
existing schema like tables and other
database entities along with the data if
present in the database and recreate the
schema based on the model classes in
your hibernate application so every time
you run your application you get a new
schema but you lose all your previous
data so technically what it means is
hibernate would drop off the existing
schema from the database that is all
tables and other DB entities at the time
of creating the session factory object
when you run the program now our
database is having a record with roll
number as two and name as gone to do
let's change the value to create drop
and change the roll number and name as
three and gone to three read on the
application let's check the output oops
what it has done it has done exactly the
same thing as in case of property value
as create that is dropping off the
existing schema along with deleting the
previous records and then recreating the
schema now let's do one more thing in
the program close the session factory
explicitly
and change the value of roll number as
for and name as gone to 4 and breed on
the application let's say God put oops
what it has done there is no table at
all in the database with the name
student underscore information it has
deleted it along with all the previous
data and here is the point - it says if
you keep its value as create drop
everything else would remain the same as
in create the only additional task it
does is when you explicitly close the
session factory object in the program
hibernate would drop off the schema and
all data and if you are not closing the
session factory explicitly in the
program create drop would just behave as
a create it provide the value as update
heibon and documentation says every time
you run your application hibernate would
just update the schema for example if it
is n change the column name for a
certain table or any other update it
will do that update but your data would
be safe sounds create but while working
with the value update I canna found vir
results many times even hibernate
documentation says they introduced this
value just for the experimental purpose
as of now and it should not be used in
production servers anytime so my
suggestion is do not use this value in
production finally if you provide its
values validate every time you run your
application it will just validate the
existing database schema with the one
which can be generated using the
annotated model classes and would not
update or make any changes to the
database if there are no differences it
will execute the program normally but if
there are differences it will - an
exception at one time it varies from
developer to developer about which
property value they would like to go
with if we go to the current hibernate
documentation they have only provided
the definition of all these values and
have not talked much on the usage in
development or in production
environments I would suggest that all
these values are meant for development
environments only and when you give your
application to the client that is for
the production environment it's always
good to write a user-defined SQL
file for creation or modification of
database tables or any other database
objects and do not let hibernate create
modify or validate your database schema
in production and for this I recommend
for production environment do not set
hibernate dot hpm to TDL dot auto
property itself in the configuration
file and the default would be not to
make any changes to the database in the
next tutorial we'll talk about some
commonly used hibernate annotations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
