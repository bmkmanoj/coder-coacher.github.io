welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial we're going to talk about web
service fundamentals so what's a web
service in simple words it's all about
developing a software application in
such a way that it can allow other
software applications to make a call to
its methods so this is a web service
application which has exposed these two
methods to the outer world then any
other software application developed
using any language can make a call to
these methods an application which makes
a call to the methods of your web
service application is in general known
as a client application and web service
application itself is in general known
as a service provider an important point
to note over here is client and service
provider may or may not be developed
using same programming language so it
may happen a service provider is
developed using Java and its client is
developed using C C sharp or any other
programming language another important
point to note over here is client and
service provider me or may not be
present on the same machine a both are
present on different machines say m1 and
m2 then there has to be some network
connecting them for example a land of an
and internet or some other network
because every software is developed by
following certain standard rules in the
similar manner a web service application
- is developed by following certain
standard rules if a developer follows
all rules as specified in so protocol
while developing a web service
application then that application will
be called as a soap based web service
application and if he follows all rules
as specified in Grasse guidelines then
that application will be
as a rest-based web service application
let's first understand the working of a
soap based web service application with
the help of real-life analogy and later
in the immediate next tutorial we're
going to talk about rest based web
service concepts in detail all right
because in real world what a basic
information a person needs for ordering
a pizza at home firstly he would need to
know about the phone number of the pizza
store guy secondly he would need to know
about all visa options available with
their prices and some more related
information here the person ordering the
pizza is a client and the pizza store is
the service provider usually client gets
all such information through the PISA
store's website or brochure so once he
has all the details he can happily make
a phone call to the pizza store guy and
place an order the important point to
note over here is without all such basic
information client cannot utilize the
service offered by the PISA store in the
similar manner in the programming world
to client has to know about certain
basic information about the web service
application without which it cannot make
a call to any of its methods basic
information like the exact location of
it you know the IP address and port
number where that web service
application is running the exact
signature of the methods which that web
service application has opened for other
applications and other related
information some big question is how
does a client get this information guys
the idea is a developer puts all such
basic information of his web service
application in a file in an XML format
and provides it to all users who want
their application to utilize services
offered by his web service application
so once the client has this file it can
happen
we make a call to the methods of that
web service application this file you
know which contains all basic
information of a specific web service
application is very popularly known with
the name of WSDL web service description
language because in this real-life
analogy both client and possessed or guy
make sure when they communicate over
phone they both speak in a language in a
format which both can understand let's
say here both agree to communicate in
English language using English grammar
format in the similar manner when a
client here makes a call to the method
of a web service application and web
service application in turn sends a
response back to the client both
communicate to each other using soup
format also called as so protocol you
know it's like the way here client and
pizza store guy use a English grammar
format to communicate with each other
here client and service provider use SU
protocol to communicate with each other
so protocol basically says communication
between two software's should happen in
an XML format by following certain rules
which I'll talk about in detail while
showing a demo on how to create a web
service application and its client for
now an important point to note over here
is client and service provider both
communicate to each other using so
protocol and as a result this web
service application is termed as a soap
based web service application and its
client is termed as a slow-paced cried
guests let me tell you one more
important point before I wind up this
tutorial a soap based web service
application and its client most commonly
use HTTP as the protocol while sending
messages to each other over a network in
the next tutorial we're going to talk
about rest web service concepts in
detail
