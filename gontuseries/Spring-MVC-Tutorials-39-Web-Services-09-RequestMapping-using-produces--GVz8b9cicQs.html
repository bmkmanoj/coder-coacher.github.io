welcome you to gone to series in the
previous tutorial we learnt how to
support XML format for these rest api s
so after that change
now these rest api is support two
formats json format as well as xml
format so now many client is going to
make a request to get response from
either of these rest api is its clients
responsibility to specify within the
request it says what format server has
to use to produce the response json or
xml so here when i make a get request on
this edge tapi means for this false rest
api i got to specify here using a key
accept and its value has application
slash XML if I want to get response in
XML and if I want to get response in
JSON then I have to use its value as
application slash choose one like this
is whatever I've just described in a
very brief manner I explained in detail
to the last tutorial now let's proceed
further and try to learn in this
tutorial how to restrict a specific REST
API controller method to support only
one format so it could be the case that
your application is supporting more than
one formats you know like here in this
application we are supporting XML and we
are also supporting JSON but what if we
want a specific REST API controller
method to support only one format not
more than one format so how to achieve
that but that can be achieved by making
use of produces argument to request
mapping annotation so all we need to do
is write here produce
with its value as a media type dot
application underscore XML underscore
value so if I keep produces value as we
get type dot application underscore XML
underscore value then I'm here
forcing spring MVC framework that this
rest ap controller method must support
only one format and that format is XML
if I change its value from XML to JSON
in that case it's going to support only
JSON so let's keep its value as JSON and
see what happens when we now make a get
request on this REST API so I'm making
here a get request on this REST API with
the value of accept as application slash
JSON and that is what this let's take a
controller method supports so I expect
that it is going to send me that is once
properly and that's what has happened
now if I change this value from JSON XML
what is going to happen and so so what
we expect what we expect is as this
method doesn't support XML because of
this argument so now I should not get a
valid response from the server in this
case so let's test this out cool so here
we haven't received a valid response
from the server if in the logs I check
it says unknown exception occurred could
not find acceptable representation it
means when we requested for XML format
from this REST API it simply said no to
us it said I do not support this format
and if I choose here eczema instead of
JSON well now we will get a valid
response for eczema and invalid response
for jisan let's check that very quickly
so for XML now I should be getting a
proper response cool so here I've got
the response in XML format but now if I
hear requests for JSON format which is
not supported by this Sapa I must here
get an invalid response let's check that
out good I haven't got a valid response
instead of that I've got an exception
instead of a valid response and if I
check the logs I get here a warning
which states that whatever response
format you request it for well that is
not supported by this let's take a is
the way I explain things for this REST
API controller method same way you can
test out things for this another REST
API controller method you can make it
support only one format by making use of
produces argument with request mapping
annotation the way I showed you over
here by keeping its value either as a
you know media type dot application XML
value or media type dot application JSON
or value the way I described here for
this escaping control method in the next
tutorial we will learn the use of
response entity annotation and in
addition to that we are also going to
understand how to support HTTP put kind
of requests with a REST API in a spring
MVC framework all right okay the big
thank you for learning rest AP concepts
