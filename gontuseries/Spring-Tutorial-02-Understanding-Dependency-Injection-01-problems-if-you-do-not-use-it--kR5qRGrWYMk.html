in the first tutorial we went through
the complete overview of Spring
Framework which is very much needed to
start of its spring in this you will
understand the term dependency injection
in detail I have divided the tutorial in
two parts in part 1 we will understand
the problems if we do not use a
technique like dependency injection and
in part 2 we will understand what is
spring steai framework and the different
ways of using it let's start with what
problems we face which forces to use the
springs dependency injection framework
we will consider an example of a
restaurant class which needs a tea class
for preparing a hot drink
programmatically the classes look great
and perform great calling prepare
hotting function of the restaurant class
will prepare tea using tea object but
such a design may make future
maintenance quite problematic for you
and that's only because you are creating
or instant shading tea object inside a
restaurant class using a new operator
and because of this the restaurant class
has a direct dependency on the tea class
or is so much tightly coupled with the
tea class that it will attract a lot of
troubles to you in future maintenance of
the project let's look at three major
problems you may face using such a
design what if you decide to replace tea
class in the project with its better
version class that is extra steam and
for this you will need to replace tea
object with an extra steel in the
restaurant class so in general the
problem is if you are going to replace a
class with some other class in your
project you will need to modify all
classes in the project which have a
direct or strong dependency on this
class in big software projects you
really cannot
word making a lot of changes in many
classes just because you are going to
replace one class with its better
version class it will cost a lot of
development time and more than that
enormous testing of words similarly if
you are just modifying T class in the
project I had nothing else you may need
to modify the restaurant class as well
for example if you are going to
parameterize the constructor of the T
class you will surely need to modify the
restaurant class testing of individual
classes is like a nightmare using such a
design you cannot test restful glass
without including the D class so in
general the problem is you cannot test a
class in your project without including
its dependencies in simple words testing
of such projects using J unit or similar
frameworks is a very big pain problems
are only for one reason a restaurant
class has a direct dependency on the T
class you are creating an object inside
another class using new operator and
consequently making restaurant class so
much tightly coupled with the T class if
there is some technique or a design
suggestion with which a restaurant class
just uses 3d object without mentioning T
object anywhere in it we would surely
remove the direct dependency and
overcome all such problems yes you heard
it right you will not mention T object
inside the restaurant class and still
the restaurant class will use the object
to prepare T and the framework which
helps you in making this possible is the
dependency injection framework it says
never create an object inside another
Java class using a new operator I will
create all objects along with the
dependencies in your application and you
just use them the framework is so
excellent that you really overcome all
such problems using it with less code
more readable code
and more maintainable code in the next
part we will understand the springs
dependency injection framework and then
how to use it by improving the
restaurant and T classes design using it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
