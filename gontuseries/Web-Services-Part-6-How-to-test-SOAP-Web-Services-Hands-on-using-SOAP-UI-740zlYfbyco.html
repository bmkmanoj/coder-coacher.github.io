series in the last lessons of canto
series web services we talked about the
concepts and demo of soap and restful
web services in this lesson we are going
to talk about how we can test soap web
services using one of the widely
accepted tools soap UI soap UI is a free
and open source testing tool for testing
soap and restful web services with an
easy-to-use graphical interface in
addition to functional testing there are
many other features of this tool you can
perform security testing load testing
creating a test suit having n number of
test cases and executing them all in one
go by click off button and many other
advanced features before you use this
tool download the latest version from
soap you i.org install it with all the
recommended options and once installed
run it you would see a graphical
interface like this in order to test our
soap up service you would just need the
WSDL of the web services to be tested in
this demo I am going to test the
calculator web service in calculator web
service there is only one open method
edition which accepts two integers as a
parameter from the client and return
back the addition of these two numbers
as a response let's start go to projects
right click and choose new soap UI
project give a name to the project
provide the WSDL part of calculator web
service here go with all the default
options and choose ok here this will
list on all the open methods which are
there in calculator web service in this
there is only one addition method in
this web service expand it and click on
request one this is the request form if
you observe this form it's asking for
two arguments where it has placed
question marks so we need to fill these
question marks with the actual
parameters for which we want addition
let's enter 2 &amp;amp; 4 so 2 &amp;amp; 4 are the
numbers for which we want web service to
give us addition back let's submit this
request and we could observe that web
service has sent back the response as 6
which is addition of 4 &amp;amp; 2 you have just
executed a test case by a manual
interaction you can create hundreds and
thousands of such cases and execute them
all in one go by click off button using
the test suit option and in the end
check for the report to know which ones
passed and which ones failed to go with
all the advanced features of soap UI
testing tool like testing suit and many
other features visit the feature page of
soap UI website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
