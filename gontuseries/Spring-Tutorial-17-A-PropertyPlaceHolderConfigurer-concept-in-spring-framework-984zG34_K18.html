in the earlier tutorial we saw a simple
demo explaining the concept of a bean
factory post processor in Springs
framework I simply wrote a custom bean
factory post processor and in the end of
the tutorial I said that spring offers
some ready-made bean factory post
processors and this tutorial is all
about understanding a property
placeholder configure a property
placeholder configure allows you to
provide a property's value mansion in
the springs configuration file from an
external properties file for example if
you observe here I have defined a
property with the name welcome node and
provided its value here only in the
springs configuration file so the value
of alchemy node is high and welcome to
our restaurant now the same task you can
perform in a little different way so
using the concept of property
placeholder configure what you can do is
you can provide this value in an
external properties file so how this
concept works in real-life projects and
everything related to this let us
understand using this simple demo this
demo I've used in almost all of my
previous spring series of tutorials so
what I've done here is I've created a
restaurant class a Springs configuration
file and a test class in the rest room
class there is a property welcome note
and a set a method to it and there is a
great customer function which just
prints the value of welcome node
property on the console when we call
this function and value of welcome node
property is coming from here from
Springs configuration file and this is
simply the test class where we are just
calling this grid customer function
which is there in the restaurant class
now to use the concept of property pays
for the configure what we'll do we'll
provide this value of Val call node in a
separate properties file so let's create
an external properties file go to the
source new file provide here
I've given it a name spend or properties
you may give any name which you like so
I have provided here spindle properties
you may give any name say ABC dot
properties or any good name so what I
will do now is I will provide this value
in spring dot properties file so I will
do that first let me remove this value
so I've removed its value and instead of
that I have provided a string using this
index non spindle properties I will
provide the value for this string so let
me do that so here I provided the value
for welcome note here this value is
coming from spin dot properties file so
at runtime what spring will do it will
just replace this strings value from
spring dot properties before
initializing any being from this spring
configuration file so I have done my
task I provided the value of welcome
note property in spring not properties
now this one important task which is
remaining I will need to convey Spring
Framework that I have included a
properties file in spring project and I
am going to provide some of my
properties value there for that what I
need to do is I need to include a being
with the name property placeholder
configure in strings configuration file
and in it I will need to provide the
part for springboard properties so in
short what I have done here is I have
included a spend or properties provided
the value of welcome note here I have
included this beam and provided in it
the location of springboard properties
from my project now everything is set
and ready let's run this application
right so this has displayed the value of
welcome node which is coming from spring
dot properties this value is coming from
springboard properties file so using
such a concept of property placeholder
configure what you do is you just
externalize the property values
from your springs configuration file in
your beam definitions in a separate
external properties file in real-life
applications this concept may prove very
handy and useful for example this will
enable the person deploying an
application to customize environment
specific properties such as database
URLs and passwords without the
complexity or risk of modifying the main
XML definition file or any other files
for the string container now feel free
to ask questions or provide your
feedback comments below this video
or you simply email me your queries on
this email I'll try to answer them as
soon as possible please like this video
if it really helped you and I'll catch
you in my next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
