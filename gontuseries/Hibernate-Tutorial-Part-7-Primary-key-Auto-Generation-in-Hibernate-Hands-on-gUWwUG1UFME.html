series in the earlier tutorials we
talked about some of the most common
annotations that we use in hibernate
application in this tutorial we are
going to talk about how to make
hibernate generate the value of a
primary key column automatically in a
database table let's understand the
problem first and then we'll talk about
its solution if you have a database
table which is having a primary key
column in it for example
student underscore information is having
row number as the primary key now there
are two ways to insert a record into
such a cable from your hibernate
application first ways you provide the
value of roll number and name of the
student yourself in the main program and
then call the same method of hibernate
to persist student record into the
database and the second ways he just
provide the name of the student in the
main program and hibernate would
automatically generate some unique
number and assign that to the roll
number field while persisting the
student record into the database
generally first way people go with when
the primary key holds some business
value in it for example if the primary
key field is a mobile number in the same
student and ask information table and
not the roll number in such a case you
cannot generate the mobile number
automatically in your program and you
have to use the exact mobile number
information for a given student record
while inserting the student record into
the student underscore information table
and the second way people go with when
the primary key column is not so well
defined and doesn't contain any business
information in it if the primary key
field is a serial number in the same
student underscore information table and
the serial number would just talk about
whose information we inserted first into
the database table so this serial number
would just be a sequence of numbers
starting from one and for every new row
insertion into the database table you
would just want to increment the value
of serial number column by one and
provide it as the primary key value for
the table so for all such cases you may
not want to provide the
yourself in the program and won't
hibernate to generate a unique number
that is primary key for every row
insertion into the database table now
question is how to generate the value of
a primary key column for a table
automatically in hibernate application
you do this using the generated value
annotation this is the hibernate mo
example we built in the early hibernate
series of tutorials and what we want in
this demo is hibernate should
automatically generate the value of roll
number for us while saving the student
record into the database table let's
apply the generated value annotation to
the roll number field so what we have
done here is we are trying to save a
student record having two columns name
and roll number we will provide the
value of name in the main program and
let hibernate Auto generate the roll
number value for the student record go
to the main program and delete the row
number setters also save one more
student record into the database
you
excellent the application
let's check the output grid hibernate
has generated the value automatically
for roll number for both the records now
there are different options available
for the generated value annotation let's
check them out
there are four strategies or ways using
which hibernate can auto generate the
primary key value depending on the
database in use auto identity sequence
table you have to choose one out of
these and if you do not choose any
strategies like we just saw in the demo
hibernate would consider it has the auto
strategy if you are selecting Auto
strategy hibernate doc says hibernate
would pick up the appropriate strategy
for the database in use automatically
that is for auto hibernate would pick up
any one of the strategies out of
identity sequence or table depending
upon the database in use for example if
you are using oracle hibernate would
choose sequence since it doesn't support
identity same way if you are using mysql
hibernate would choose identity since it
does not support sequence as of now now
what are these identity and sequence
data geez
if you choose identity strategy and your
database supports that then hibernate
would generate the primary key value
using the identity column feature of the
database in use now what is identity
column it's just a feature provided in
certain databases like MySQL SQL Server
Sybase etcetera to auto-generate
the unique value for the given column
for every set of a record if you choose
sequence strategy hibernate would
generate the primary key value using the
sequence objects of the database now the
sequence object feature is provided in
certain databases like Oracle db2
etcetera so what hibernate does is it
creates the sequence object in the
database and every time a record is
inserted into the database table
hibernate would use that sequence object
to generate the next incremented value
and purchase the same into the primary
key column the table generation type
allocates a separate database table to
keep track of the generation of unique
values so if you are not sure about the
strategy your database supports it's
always good
rely on hibernates Auto strategy feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
