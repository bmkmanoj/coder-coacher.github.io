earlier tutorial we talked about lazy
loading versus pre loading in Spring
Framework thereby understanding one of
the major differences between an
application context and a being Factory
in this tutorial we'll understand the
life cycle methods who are being
provided by Spring Framework this is the
basic spring application demo we saw in
almost all of my previous tutorials to
understand spring concepts let's take
the same example to know more about life
cycle methods in Spring Framework so
what I've done here in this demo is
Avatar restaurant class Springs
configuration file and a test class to
test this demo in the restaurant class
I've written a great customer function
which just prints this string on the
console that is welcome to your customer
this is the life cycle time and in the
springs configuration file I have just
put an end to your freshman beam which
will initialize the restaurant class
when we will request it to do so in our
test class in the test class here I am
requesting Spring Framework to get us
the restaurant bean which I am calling
as restaurant update one and then I'm
calling its grade customer function
which just prints this string on the
console so in short spring instantiates
as well as destroys Veen for us in our
applications so we do not need to bother
about how it does so it's like when we
need a bean it should provide us and
when we are done with it it should
destroy it but sometimes you may wish to
perform certain actions immediately
after spring instantiates any bean in
the application or just before a beans
destruction by spring framework and
that's what we're going to see in this
demo how we can do that so these are
called lifecycle methods provided by
spring framework what spring says is you
may write two additional methods in your
bean class one method will get executed
immediately after being is instantiated
by spring framework and the other method
will get executed
just before spring is about to destroy
that beam so how to do this just write
two methods in every beam class and
convey spring which one to call after
its initialization and which one to call
before its destruction in Springs
configuration file you will understand
more with this demo so what I will do is
in the restaurant class I would include
these two additional methods this method
will get executed immediately after
spring in sunshades the restaurant beam
and spring is going to call this method
just before it's going to destroy the
restaurant beam so we have written here
two methods now we have to tell Spring
Framework for their purposes and you can
do it using init methods and destroy
methods in the springs configuration
file with every beam so go to the
strings configuration file and add the
two attributes init methods and destroy
methods so I've done here so with this
being I've provided here init method
attribute and destroy method attribute
so here I am telling spring framework
that whenever it's going to instantiate
Crestron beam it should call a method
with the name in it written in the
restroom class immediately after
restaurant means initialization and here
I am instructing spring to call a method
with the name destroy which is written
in the restaurant class just before
restaurant means destruction can you
beam classes you may give any name to
these lifecycle methods for example here
in the restaurant green I provided in it
and destroy as names you may provide any
name which you wish to have for these
two methods it's only you need to convey
spring framework using init method
attribute and destroy method attribute
that these are the two methods you need
to include as lifecycle methods not only
one task is remaining let's go to the
test class if you observe here we are
just initializing application context
using this
and acts and here we are getting
restaurant be using it's caffeine method
but nowhere in this application we are
closing the application context so what
it means is if we explicitly close the
application context in spring
application spring will close or destroy
all beans present in it before the end
of this main method and you can close
application context explicitly using
this statement so what this statement
means this is abstract application
context this is one of the classes which
has implemented application context and
it has a method called register shutdown
hook so if you call register shutdown
hook from your spring application spring
will destroy all beans in it when the
main method ends here all right so we
have provided all configurations in the
springs configuration file provided in
it and destroy method in the restaurant
class and registered shutdown hook here
now let's run it and test our
application cool the output clearly
shows that spring or init method and
destroy method
immediately after restaurant beans
initialization and before beans
destruction this one more important
thing that you should know about life
cycle methods that is in it and destroy
methods if you go to the springs
configuration file you would observe
that I have provided init method and
destroy methods with an individual being
here so if you have too many beans
having initialization and destroy
methods with the same name you don't
need to declare init method and destroy
method on each individual bean as I have
done here instead framework provides the
flexibility to configure such situation
using default init method and default
destroy method attributes on the top of
this Springs configuration file like
this
so I have provided here default init
method and default destroy method it is
applicable for all beams present in this
Spain's configuration file so let's
delete these init method and destroy
method as I provided here the default
init method and default destroy method
on top of this configuration file so if
you run this application now output will
still remain the same as in case of
defining init method and destroy method
with individual beam in the next
tutorial we will talk about post
construct and pre destroy notations in
