welcome you to gone to series in the
early tutorial I talked about some of
the basic database operations that we
can perform using hibernate provided
functions like save cat update and
delete now in this tutorial I'm going to
talk about one of the most important
concepts supported by hibernate
framework and that is the concept of
transient persistent and detached states
of a hyper net object-- in a hibernate
application so that's that you will
understand more with this simple demo
which I have already created here here
I've created a student class which is
representing student table which I've
already created in the database having
two columns student ID and student name
and here is the main class where I am
going to write code to demonstrate you
this simple concept because if you
remember in the earlier tutorial I
explained you the concept of save
function what I did was I created a
student object and then I passed that
object to the save function and when I
ran the application hibernate happily
inserted an move student record into the
student table if I run this hibernate
application for one more time what
hibernate will do it will simply insert
one more student record into the student
table let me run it and show you how
this thing works so it inserted a new
student record into the student table as
per their expectation what it means is
every time I run this piece of code
hibernate we'll simply insert a new
student record into the student table
now I'm going to make a very small
change over here I'll add this statement
just before save function now if I run
this hibernate application what it will
do it will save a new student record
with a name gone to one modified before
save function or with an A
gone to one let Sun and check this out
so it has inserted a new record with the
name on to one modified before save
function and that's the usual behavior i
modified student object just before save
function so when I pass that student
object it considered the last modified
value for student name for the student
object all right everything is clear so
far now I make a very small change again
in the code I'll put this statement
right after save function so now when I
run this hibernate application what it
will do it will insert a new student
record with the student bean gone to and
modified before save function R with the
student name gone to and modified after
save function let Sun and check this out
if we see the logs here - it has fired
two queries one insert and other one is
update now question is why hibernate
fired and update query when there is no
update function written over here I
simply wrote a save function and there
is no update function over here
so why hibernate fired this update query
let's check in the database what it has
inserted into the student table oops
it has inserted a new student record
with the name Kanto and modified after
say function which means it considered
this student name value for inserting a
new student record into the student
table so something unusual - it is doing
when I'm running this piece of code let
me first tell what exactly hibernate did
behind the scenes when I ran this
hibernate application and then I will
explain in detail the reason for doing
so here with this code hibernate first
inserted a student record with the name
gone - and modified before save function
here and then when it found this
statement in the code after save
function
it immediately fired an update query to
modify the name of student from gone to
unmodified before say function to gone
to one modified after save function so
in the end when - it completed running
the application you found a new student
record with a name gone - unmodified
after save function now question is why
hibernate fired and update query after
finding this statement here after save
function and the simple reason is the
concept of hibernate object states guys
this is very important and simple
concept in a hibernate framework but I
would need a little more attention of
yours to understand that this concept
says you create an object and then you
pass that object to the save function
it says till the point you pass this
object to the save function the object
is set to live in a state known as a
transient State
once you pass this object to the save
function right after that till the point
you close the session the object is set
to live in a state known as a persistent
state and what's good thing about
persistent state is once an object is
into a persistent state after that if
you make any modification to that object
then hibernate would make sure that it
would fire an update query in order to
sync that modification with the database
record and that's what happened here in
this case I passed the student object to
the save function and according to this
concept it's state could change from
transient to persistent and as a result
when it saw this statement while
executing this application it fired an
update query to sync the student object
modification with already persisted or
inserted student record that is very
simple once you provide an object to the
hibernate sessions
save function then hibernate will
persist or insert that object into the
database table and after that till the
point you close the session hibernate
will make sure to sync any modification
made to that object with the database
table for the already inserted record by
firing an update query alright so for
all things are clear now one last
concept if an object is in a persistent
state the way student object is in a
persistent state over here when you
close a session it goes again into a new
state known as a detach state what it
means is if I write this statement right
after session dot close what will happen
when I run this - it application what
hibernate for loop it will insert a new
student record with a student name onto
one modified after save function R with
the student name onto unmodified post
session dot close statement hybl it says
when an object is in a persistent state
and you make modification to that object
right after session dot close then in
that case hibernate would not sink that
modification with the already existing
record in the database so what it means
is because I have modified this student
object right after session not closed
when I run this hibernate application
hibernate will insert a new student
record with a student name gone too and
modified after save function and not
with gone to and modified post session
dot closed statement guys in this
tutorial my main aim was to introduce
you with all these three states of a
hibernate object we can look at all
these concepts in detail in my
subsequent tutorials in this series guys
