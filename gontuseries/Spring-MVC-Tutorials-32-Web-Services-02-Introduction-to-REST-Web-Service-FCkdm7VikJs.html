welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial we are going to talk about
restful web service concepts so what's a
restful api are simply a restful web
service if a software application
exposes its data to other software
applications and while doing so if it
follows all guidelines as specified in
rest then that application is known as a
restful web service application or
simply a rest-based application because
whatever API is are you our eyes a
rest-based application provides using
which other applications can access or
modify its data are informally known as
rest a BIS so the big question is how do
we develop such an application which
gives other applications an ability to
access or modify its data in a super
easy and effective manner and here comes
the rest guidelines into the picture red
stands for representation state transfer
it's basically a set of guidelines which
describes the overall architecture of
such an application so let me very
quickly introduce all rest guidelines to
you and later in the immediate next
tutorial we're going to use the same
guidelines to develop a fully fucking
restful web service application alright
let's start
ress is in a client and a server
architecture whatever data or
functionality is kept at the server
application which a client can access or
modify is known as a resource so they
can be one to hundreds thousands or any
number of resources present at the
server application with a client has an
access to a client can access or modify
any of the resources present at the
server application using its you are
ready so here is how it works
client sends a request to the server to
access resource using its URI as
provided by the server and server sends
a response back to the client the
response which the client receives is
actually the representation of the
requested resource means it's actually
the copy of the requested resource in
any of the specific formats like XML
JSON HTML CSV PDF etc etc as requested
by the crane in addition to the
representation of requested resource the
response also contains some additional
information which describes every basic
characteristic of this representation
like its format its size or any other
similar information so upon receiving
the response just by analyzing this
additional information client will come
to know about all basic information
which it may require while processing
the representation of requested resource
received in that response because
according to res guidelines once a
client receives the response you know
the representation of requested resource
as well as the additional information
which describes it with all this
information in that response client
should be able to modify or even delete
the corresponding resource which is
present at the server if it wants to
between client and server any number of
intermediaries can be installed which
may help to address concerns like
response caching server security load
balancing etc etc for example a machine
can be installed near server with a
firewall software so every client
requests to the
is supposed to pass through this machine
and this machine's responsibility is to
stop every insecure or malicious request
reaching the server in the similar ways
a caching server can be installed near
client whose job is to save every
response sent to the client before the
response which is the client so that
next time when the client requests for
the same resource for which the
responses already save in the caching
server the request will be served from
this caching server only and not from
the actual server application so this
way the requests need not to travel all
through till this server to fetch the
response this is a lot of time and
network resources because rest says
every request made by the client should
be treated as a new request and should
carry all information with it which is
required by the server to send the
desired response because one last
important guideline before I wind up
this tutorial in every resource
representation which is sent to the
client server application should include
the URIs are links of all relevant
resources which a client may be required
to visit after he goes to that
representation case this is one of the
most important guidelines as shared in
brest if you have been concerned
regarding this don't hesitate to bring
all those to me through emails or
through the comments alright in the next
tutorial we will learn how to develop a
fully working restful web service
application using all the guidelines as
learned in this tutorial guys a big
