welcome you to gone to series in this
series of tutorials I'm going to talk
everything about servlets and jsps
technology step by step so before we get
started let's first try to understand
what this technology for because in a
day to day life we come across to
millions and billions of websites like
Google Calm contour G amazon.com
flipkart.com etc now if you are a
developer and you want to develop a kind
of similar website what I just specified
then definitely you were born to check
out what all different languages and
frameworks available in the market which
can make is off to do so if I go and
check out market for the same I would
find out that there are hundreds of for
such languages and frameworks available
like java python ruby keeler small dog
javascript Django framework asp.net Zen
framework etc so you have endless
options available which you can make use
of to develop stunning websites now out
of all these options if you have decided
that you want elite use of Java
programming language to develop over
tried then in other words you have
decided to learn servlets and jsps
technology let me explain what exactly I
mean by this
this servlets and jsps technology allows
a developer to develop a website using
java programming language that's all
about it it does not solve any other
purpose other than this so if your goal
is to develop a website using Java then
servlets and JSP is what you have to
learn this is a misconception currently
I can see in the market among students
and the professionals what they feel is
it's no longer needed to learn so grits
and jsps to develop
sike using java and what the feel is
it's good to learn frameworks like
Spring Framework stretch frameworks
stripes framework or you know any single
kind of framework to develop you know
other site using Java but they may not
be 100 percent right and the reason is
internally all these frameworks what I
just mentioned make use of servlets and
jsps technology only so you cannot
master these framework unless and until
you have mastered servlets and jsps
technology itself so with all this
without any further delay let's get
started
with servlets and jsps by first setting
up our development environment which we
will need to develop our first servlets
application alright there's a big
tangent for learning servlets and jsps
technology with me if you have any
feedback or any constructive comment or
you want me to upload any specific topic
and this is or you want me to upload all
together new series on our channel gone
