every one of you for liking all video
tutorials which I uploaded so far in the
spring series of tutorials if you have
covered or previous tutorials in this
series it means you know Spring
Framework with this much of knowledge
you can easily work on any spring
related project without any trouble
alright so now let's move ahead in this
tutorial if you're going to look at some
of the important configurations which
you can set in the springs configuration
file for a bean scope before we see the
demo let's look at the concept first so
what is a being scope while defining a
bean in the springs configuration file
spring gives you an option to declare
its scope value using the scope
attribute using this attributes value as
prototype you can force spring to
produce a new beam instance each time
one is needed or just opposite to it
that is using this attributes value as
single term you can force spring to
return the same bean instance each time
one is needed all right
you will understand more with this demo
here I have created a restaurant class
Springs configuration file and a test
class to test this demo in the
restaurant class I provided here a
string property welcome note and a
setter method to it and there is a
method read customer which just prints
in the value of this welcome not
property and in the springs
configuration file I have just put an
entry of a restaurant bean which would
initialize the restaurant class at
runtime when requested and I provided
here it scope as prototype and in the
test class here I am simply requesting
Spring Framework to get a restaurant
bean and Here I am setting the value of
welcome
ah Purdy with this string value objects
one is setting welcome non-property and
Here I am calling its grid customer
function and Here I am again requesting
Spring Framework to get me a restaurant
bean and I am calling it restaurant
object two and calling its grid customer
function without setting its welcome not
property as we did in case of restaurant
object one all right so let's run the
application and check this if we check
the output for object one feed customer
function it printed object one is
setting welcome not property and for
object to wait customer function it
printed null and that is simply because
we did not set the value of welcome your
property for object two as we did in
case of object one so it just went it
not what this output means is for a bean
if we define bean scope as prototype as
we did here in springs configuration
file for this be spring creates a new
bean instance or a new object whenever
it's needed so in this example
restaurant bean scope is defined as
prototype and we needed the restaurant
being twice in the desk class and
therefore spring created a new
restaurant bean instance or restaurant
object for both getting requests now
let's modify the scope to singleton and
run the same application go to the
string configuration file and change it
to singleton s ing le T one singleton
save it go to the test class your
application will remain the same just
you have modified score value from
prototype to single gel if you check the
output for restaurant object one greet
customer function it printed object one
is setting welcome not property and for
object to read customer function it
again printed object one is setting
welcome not property why white printed
value of welcome
property for object to which we did not
set for it in simple words we did not
set for common property for object to
then why it's creat customer function
printed the value of welcome not
property which we set for restaurant
object one the reason is it's beam scope
that is scope definition for a beam if
we define scope as singleton
spring creates only one mean instance or
an object and provides the same instance
whenever it is needed so in this example
restaurant means scope is to find a
single term and we needed the restaurant
mean twice in the desc class here and
here for first get mean request spring
provided a restaurant being an object
one set its work of not property and for
second beam request spring provided the
same beam instance which it provided for
the first cat beam request that is here
and that's a reason it printed the value
of alcaman property which was last
modified by object one so in this
tutorial we clearly understood a beam
scope along with a demo in the next
tutorial we'll cover an important
concept on beam scopes with respect to
application context and bean factory
interfaces in spring framework guys
