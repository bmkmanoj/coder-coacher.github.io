were coming to gone to series in this
tutorial I'm going to talk about some of
the basic database operations like save
update the lead or selecting a record
using hibernate I have already created a
student table in the database and I'm
going to perform all these basic
database operations on this table using
hibernate provided functions here in the
application I have created a student
class which is representing the student
table which is present in the database
and here is the main class well write
code to show you how to perform the
basic database of patients using
hibernate provided functions on the
student table so let's start I'll start
up with save or insert operation Here I
am creating the student object with the
name gone to one and now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to save this object
into the student table so how would I do
that
for this simply put this statement here
and you are done Here I am simply
passing this student object to the save
function which is provided by hibernate
and what hybrid knit is going to do when
you run the application it will simply
insert this object into the student
table and while doing so it will
generate the value of student ID
automatically according to the generated
scheme you have provided here on top of
it let me quickly run the application
and show you how it works
yes hibernate has inserted a record into
the student table let us see in the
database yes it has inserted a record
with student ID 1 and gone to 1 as the
name so with the same method I just
inserted a student record into the
student table now question is how to
retrieve or fetch this student record
into the hibernate application and the
answer is
using the get method which is provided
by hibernate for this you simply write
these statements here and you are done
I am doing here is I am passing two
arguments to the get method the first
argument is the name of the class which
is mapped to the student table whose
record I want to retrieve and the second
argument is the primary key or the
identifier value for that record this
one so the idea is using the get method
I would simply get the desired record
from the student table this way and Here
I am simply printing out the value of
student name for this retrieved student
object let me quickly run it and show
you how it works
cool so using the get method we have
just received the desired record from
the student table into the hibernate
application this is one very important
point I want to tell you over here for
this method the get method will return
the student record for the primary key
value which you mentioned here but say
if you are providing here a primary key
which doesn't exist in the student table
in that case this function is going to
return null so you need to have a proper
exception handling can ism of here so
just to keep this tutorial simple I'm
not doing all that alright soon after
get and say methods question is how
would I update this already existing
student record in the student table say
I want to change the name from gone to 1
2 gone to 1 updated how to do that
and the answer is using the update
method which is provided by hibernate
here you simply write these two
statements and you're done
Here I am simply modifying the value of
student objects that is modifying the
name from gone to one to gone to one
updated for the student record which I
am retrieving using the get method here
and passing the student object to the
update function let me quickly run it
and show you how it works
yes hibernate has changed the name from
gone to one two gone to one modified as
per the code that we have written over
here so the update method has just
updated the already existing student
record in the student table now off the
save get and update methods there is one
thing left and that is how to delete
this already existing student record
from the student table and the answer is
using the delete method which is
provided by hibernate framework for this
you simply write this statement what I
am doing over here is I am retrieving
the student object using the get method
and I'm passing this student object to
the delete function so this delete
function would simply delete this record
from the student table that is quickly
run it and see whether it performs this
action or not cool it has performed the
delete operation cool so now there is no
record in the student table it means it
has deleted the already existing student
record from the student table because
I've just covered save update get and
delete methods which are the basic
methods provided by having it there are
many more methods which are provided by
hibernate like persist load refresh
flush etc etc I am going to cover all
these methods in the subsequent
tutorials
in the next tutorial I'm going to talk
about one of the most important topics
in a hibernate framework and that is the
concept of transient persistent
and detached states of an object guy is
