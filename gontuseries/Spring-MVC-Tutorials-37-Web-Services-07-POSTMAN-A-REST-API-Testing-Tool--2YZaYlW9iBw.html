welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial we are going to learn about a
very important REST API testing tool
very popularly known for the name
postman let's add get so far in the rest
series I've showed how to design and
develop these two simple REST API is and
which tool will be used in all earlier
tutorials to test these simple rest heat
gains
well are very on Google Chrome browser a
standard browser as a testing tool so
how a standard browser allows you to
test a REST API well it has got an
address bar using type the SDK which you
want to test like this and then how it
works when you press ENTER case when you
press Enter by default a standard
browser makes a HTTP GET type of
reference on the REST API which you type
in the address part of it so when I
press Enter the browser is going to make
a HTTP GET type of request on that goes
to API and this is how it has fished the
desired response from the server now how
to test is second REST API
well this second REST API also demands
clients to make a HTTP GET type of
request on it so as to fetch the desired
response from the server so i would need
to follow the same procedure to test the
second resistor kay you know as what i
followed for testing before stress state
game so i would type the rest api and
when i am going to press enter the
browser has made a HTTP GET type of
request on it to fetch the desired
response from the server
let's try to understand in the
subsequent tutorials
I would talk and discuss about how to
design and develop more complex REST API
you know kind of REST API is which
demands climbs to make HTTP put kind of
requests on them or HTTP POST kind of
requests on them or HTTP delete kind of
requests on on them or any other HTTP
kind of repressed other than extending
gate type of request on them so question
is how to test such complex REST API
race well we cannot test such complex
rest areas using a standard browser tool
because a standard browser tool would
only allow you to test you know those
rest a case which demands clients to
only make get type of request on them
see when I write here a REST API and
when I press Enter it's going to make a
HTTP GET type of address on the REST API
which I type here so what about post I
graphicness what about put type of
request what about other type of HTTP
requests other than standard get type of
regress but for that we need some kind
of a sophisticated REST API testing tool
in the market there are none of such
sophisticated REST API testing pools
available like so py rest let client
postman etcetera but it's so very
difficult to comment on which tool is
better over other one because every to
have got some feature in it which
distinguish it from you know its
counterparts but still I suggest to go
in it with postman maybe because it's
show server in comparison to others for
carrying out with the testing tasks for
development of REST API so let's do one
thing
let's install postman first in our
computer a later we'll learn how
to make use of it to test our STP is so
to install it go to google and type help
postman official website so this is the
official that side of postman REST API
tools this postman REST API testing tool
app is available for almost all
important operating operating systems
like Mac Windows Linux but if you are
using google chrome you know as a
browser to browse through internet or
web then I suggest you to click on this
option because it's going to add Google
it's going to add postman app as an
extension to your existing Google Chrome
browser so let's choose this option
here it has taken us to Chrome that
store and here we are required to click
on this Add to Chrome button so once you
click on an app what it's going to do
it's going to add postman app to your
existing Google Chrome browser as an
extension to it cool it has added
postman app as an extension to our
existing Google Chrome browser now let's
launch this app to use it to do so I
just need to click on this button launch
app and it's going to launch postman
REST API testing tool for us to use it
you may sign up with your existing
Google account or if you don't want to
sign up you can straight go to that by
choosing this option take me straight to
the app and here it is the postman REST
API testing tool which we were waiting
for so long this if you look at the
postman REST API testing tool you'd find
that it's smaller less similar to that
of our standard browser you know accept
the point that in a standard browser you
have only an address bar but here you
have lot of other options available like
from this top down you can select what
type of HTTP request you want to make on
a specific REST API which you are going
to type here in the address part of it
get power sport on whatever and in
addition to that you have lot more other
options available kind of advanced
options available so if you want to
attach any headers you know along with
the request by adding kind of key value
pairs with that or you want to add an
authorization details with the request
or you want to create a pre request
crypt or you want to you know see
it kind of test suite so the lot of
advanced features available in postman
please understand that up in this
tutorial my main aim is to introduce you
to postman and not talk about all these
advanced kind of features like headers
authorization please request script test
etcetera so let's do one thing let's
keep this tutorial short and crispy so
here I'm not going to describe all
advanced features what I'm pointing at
right now but I would use postman to
only test the recipients which we
developed in earlier tutorials only
means these two last eight years and in
the subsequent tutorials when I am going
to design and develop more complex SDKs
that time I'm going to show how to make
use of these advanced features of
postman to carrying on with the testing
tasks for those kind of SDKs
so to test this REST API I simply need
to paste the rest API here and because
this I state their demands
clines to make HTTP GET type of freak
face on it so I need to choose here get
option which happens to be the first
choice and then make a request so for
that I have to click on this send button
as soon as I click on send button it's
going to make HTTP cat across all this
rest api and it's going to then contact
the server and it's going to fetch the
design response cool it has worked as
you know what we were expecting because
here if you observe in the response
method this is the response message you
would find here lot of other options
like in in addition to body you can see
cookies headers and you know a lot of
options are available here which
definitely I'm not going to talk about
right now which I am going to take up in
the subsequent tutorials but in this
tutorial let's concentrate on how to
make is of postman to test these
to rest it is this simple escapees okay
now let's test another REST API for that
I have to type the list API over here
and this also demands to make HTTP GET
type of request on it so I will choose
get option from this list which happens
to be the first choice and I'm going to
click on send button so it has made HTTP
GET request on it and has got this
desired response from the seller okay in
this tutorial my main aim was to just
introduce postman REST API testing tool
and all its advanced features I'm going
to talk about while designing and
developing it was rest a page in the
subsequent tutorials all right there's a
big thank you for learning REST API
concepts using spring MVC framework with
me if you have any feedback or any
constructive comment please provide them
