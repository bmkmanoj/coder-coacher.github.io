welcome you to gone to series in this
tutorial we are going to learn how to
create a simple restful api or a simple
restful web service by making use of all
rest concepts we learnt in the previous
tutorial so what exactly we want to
achieve here today I want this time
application to expose a list of students
who have submitted the application form
to it in the JSON format to all other
software applications by providing this
URI
so the idea is very simple any other
software application running on the same
network where this term application is
unknown should be able to view this list
of students you know which is present in
this term application in the JSON format
by making use of this URI so question is
how to achieve this case just to keep
this tutorial simple I am just going to
show how other applications can only
view this list but in the subsequent
tutorials I will also show how they can
make use of this senior I to also create
modify or even delete any entry from
this list so question is what all
development tasks we are required to
perform so as to provide such a URI
which is going to enable other
applications to view the students list
in the JSON format all right let's start
because in order to achieve this I just
need to perform these two simple steps
and I'll be done for Slee I got to
include this controller method in the
student admission controller class and
secondly I just got to include these
three jars onto this demo applications
class path and that's all about it so
let me perform these two steps one by
one and while I do so
I'll keep explaining all related
concepts in detail so here is the
student admission controller class now
let me perform the first step over here
so here I have included this controller
method with this request mapping
annotation this request mapping
annotation is used to map an incoming
HTTP request with the specific
controller method so here when any
client is going to make a get request
using this HTTP you are a Spring
Framework is going to make a call to
this controller method because of this
request mapping annotation which we have
included on top of this controller
method now let us include the Java code
which is going to prepare the list of
students who have submitted the
application form to it code so here with
this piece of code I'm here preparing
the list of students who have submitted
the application form to it and returning
the same from this method case now what
exactly we want Spring Framework to do
when a client is going to make a get
request using this HTTP URI we want this
application to simply return this list
of students in the JSON text format but
here if you observe this method is
returning the list of students in the
Java object format so here what we got
to perform next we want sound way to
convert this Java object into its equal
JSON text format and then return the
same back to the client as a response so
question is what we got to do here in
this application to achieve this case to
achieve this I just got to include a
response body annotation on top of this
method as well as these three jars on to
the class path of this damn
application and that's all about it so
let me perform these things over here
and then I would explain in detail what
exactly is the purpose of response party
annotation and the three charts which we
are going to include on to the class
path of this dam application so here I'm
done with including response body on top
of this method as well as these three
jars on to the class path of this demo
application now let us understand what
exactly I've done over here is every
controller method which handles the HTTP
requests which are made by the clients
is supposed to specify the view name
which Spring Framework later uses to
prepare the response which is sent to
the client and the response for example
if we see here in this controller method
which receives the HTTP request on this
URL pattern you know this is specifying
admission success view name which later
Spring Framework uses to prepare the
actual response which is to be sent to
the client so here is the view admission
success story SB which for this request
Spring Framework is going to make use of
to prepare the final response now here
in this controller method what we want
we don't want Spring Framework to make
use of any view to prepare the final
response instead we want it to directly
send the return value of this method to
decline by simply performing the
conversion you know from Java object to
it's equal in JSON text format and
that's all putted now if you want that
will happen we have to specify a
response body annotation on top of this
method get the purpose of including
response body annotation on top of a
controller method is to simply instruct
spring MVC fever he is being a BC
framework for that controller method
please do not look for any view
technology to prepare the final response
instead whatever that controller method
is returning simply convert that
to the desired format and send that
directly to the client now here we have
included response party annotation on
top of this controller method so here
for this controller method spring MVC
framework is not going to make use of
any view to prepare the final response
instead is going to return this value
directly to the client by just
performing the conversion tasks in
between now what conversion we want it
to perform you want it to convert this
Java object into its equal JSON text
format yeah so for that to happen we are
required to include these three jars on
to the class path of this pallet you
know JSON related charge on with this
class path so here concept is when this
method is going to return this Java
object if spring MVC framework is going
to find these features onto the class
path of this project it's going to
convert that Java object includes
egrants on text format and then is going
to return the same back to the client as
a response alright so here we are done
with all the development tasks which
were required to provide this URI to
other applications
now let's very quickly test this using a
browser so here I have pasted this URI
now what I'm going to press Enter the
processor is going to make a get request
using this URI and what I am expecting
I'm expecting to receive here this list
of students in the Geo Sun format let's
see whether is goes as per our
expectations or not cool so it's working
as per our expectations case in the next
tutorial I'll also show how this time
application can support one more format
for this list of students and that is an
XML format so the idea is very simple
when a client is going to make a request
it's going to specify in what format it
wants to view the list in the JSON
format or in the XML format and
accordingly the dama application is
going to prepare
and return the response back to the
client and in addition to that I'm going
to look at some more REST API concepts
all right guys a big thank you for
learning REST API concepts using spring
MVC framework with me if you have any
feedback or comments please provide them
