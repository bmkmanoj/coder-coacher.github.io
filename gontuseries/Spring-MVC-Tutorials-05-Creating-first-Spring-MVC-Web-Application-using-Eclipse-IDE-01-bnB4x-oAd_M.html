welcome you to corn two series so far in
the spring MVC series of tutorials we
went through spring MVC's introduction
and configured eclipse ID with all
necessary chars this is the basic setup
we performed in the earlier tutorial we
created a project with a named first
spring MVC project and then added all
spring and we see unity jars on to its
class path along with integrating the
tomcat apache server with it we are not
all set to create our first spring MVC
web application all right let's start my
idea is I will create an ultra simple
web application using spring MVC exactly
according to this workflow which I
explained in the earlier tutorial a
later in the subsequent tutorials I will
gradually make this demo more and more
complex by including more and more
spring features in it this is what I am
going to create the user will type a URL
like this on the browser and hits enter
and my spring web application will send
a response back to the clients browser
the response will be simple web page
displaying a greeting message the user
welcome to our first spring MVC web
application and while developing this
application I will cover everything from
front controller handler mapping
controller to view resolver and the
actual view which you are seeing here in
the first row
technically I just need to follow these
four simple steps to create a basic web
application using spring MVC the first
step here is to modify the zap dot XML
file of your project which eclipse ID
has already generated by default in the
web-inf folder of your dynamic web
project here in any web project
you develop using cellular technology
you will always need to place a file
called web dot XML under web-inf folder
of your web project the main purpose of
the file is to just map the input URL
request to an appropriate servlet which
can serve the request you'll ask here
why am I telling you all this as you're
not going to use server technology and
we'll be using spring MVC for developing
this web application and the answer is
spring MVC framework is actually using
servlet technology as its space so you'd
always need to put the fab dot XML file
in the web project developed using
spring MVC framework and because you
don't want to write servlets and want to
your spring MVC framework you will need
to put up this code in the fab dot XML
file this code is simply telling solar
technology that all URL requests to the
web application should be map to spring
MVC framework for further processing
here you're specifically telling us of
the technology that once you receive any
URL request just map the URL request to
something called as a front controller
also called as dispatch a servlet in
spring MVC framework and after that the
front controller will take the complete
responsibility of processing the URL
requests and sending back the response
to the clients browser with the help of
all its helpers around it and that's
what I showed you in the diagram here in
order to make front controller work and
take charge of controlling the overall
application we will need to provide all
relevant information to it in a file
called as spring dispatches servlet dot
XML the file to resides inside web-inf
folder and this is nothing but a second
step that is creating the
spring dispatches Soviet dot XML file in
the project so let's do that here
right-click choose new file and give it
a name spring dispatcher sublet I will
quickly provide all relevant information
in this file which the front controller
would need to manage this overall
application and later I'll explain the
code you are seeing here three sections
each section is conveying a specific
information to the front controller this
section tells front controller which
handler mapping to use whose job is to
just scan the input URL and tell the
front controller which data generate a
class to be called for further
processing then request this section is
telling which view resolver to use whose
job is to just tell the exact location
of the view present in their project and
this section is the controller or the
data generator class which you are
seeing here in the diagram before we
further go on explaining individually
about all these sections one by one
completely let me write code for third
and fourth step to that is creating the
hello controller dot Java class along
with the view that is hello page dot JSP
and later I'll explain it in detail with
this I am done with writing complete
code for the application using spring
MVC framework in the next part of the
tutorial we learn what exactly are
written in the second third and fourth
steps along with running the application
on the Tomcat Apache server now I thank
