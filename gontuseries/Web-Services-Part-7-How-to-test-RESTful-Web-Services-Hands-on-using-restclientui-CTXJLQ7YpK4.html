hey guys and welcome to the gone -
series in the earlier tutorials we
talked about concepts and demo of soap
and restful web services and went to a
tutorial on how to test soft web
services using soap UI in this tutorial
we are going to talk about how to test a
restful web services using rest client
UI rest blank UI
is one of the very popular tools that we
use to test restful web services in the
development environment before you use
this tool download it from this website
after downloading double-click on the
jar to run it and then you will see a
graphical interface like this the UI for
the tool is very simple to use it is
divided into two sections the top
portion has the HTTP request details and
the bottom portion has the HTTP response
details in this demo I am going to test
the university restful web services that
we developed in the demo for restful web
services University restful Web Services
has to get methods and one put method
first get method is to get response in
the HTML format and the second get
method is to get the response in the
plain text if put method is called then
web services will update the students
information for the students roll number
passed by the client as a parameter in
the URL so let's start this is the HTTP
URL to test for restful web services put
the URL here and let's call the get
method first which sends back the
response in the HTML format since we are
going to call get method choose get from
here and go to the header tab and add a
key value pair except equals text HTML
this would make sure that we are calling
the get method which sends back the
response in the HTML format run the
request from the tool we got the
response back from the restful web
services and clearly we can see that the
response is in the HTML format
similarly if you would want to get
response in plain text just delete this
key value pair and add another key value
pair except equals text plane
and this we'll call the get method which
sends back the response in the plain
text format
in the next lesson we'll see how to
create a method in the restful Web
Services which accepts multiple
parameters in the HTTP URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
