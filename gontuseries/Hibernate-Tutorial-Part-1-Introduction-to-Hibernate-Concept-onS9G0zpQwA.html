series in this lesson we are going to
talk about what is hibernate and why we
need hibernate in our applications
hibernate by definition is an ORM tool
which means that it is used to map plain
java objects to the tables of a
relational database and vice versa
so is the name object relational mapping
this is what definitions is all about
let's see in detail what exactly is
hibernate
let's say you have a java application
which connects to a relational database
for example mysql let's say you have a
student class which contains member
variables in it name roll number address
mobile which represents student
information and you have created a
student object out of this class now the
task is you have to store or persist
students information which is there in
your student object into the student
info table if you are not using any ORM
framework like hibernate you will do
this task using JDBC and typically your
code would look like this in this if you
observe we are passing student object to
the function insert student info and
then manually mapping the member
variables to the columns of the table
using an SQL query and here lies the
major problem hibernate says as a Java
programmer why are you writing the SQL
queries in the java application just
leave that job to me just pass a java
object which you want to store or
persist and implicitly i will generate
an optimized query and store the data
into the table so if you are using
hibernate the same code would look like
this isn't it great you are relieved
from writing the SQL queries in your
java application and have reduced almost
80% of the number of lines of code which
means a better
readability similarly if you want to
retrieve records from the student info
table in java application you first get
the result set and then you frame a java
object typically a collection object for
example a list out of the result set
like this hibernate says this is an
overhead in the application why you got
to write additional code to frame a java
object from result set leave that job to
me and I will directly give you a
collection object or a Java object so if
you are using hibernate the same code
would look like this
isn't it great you do not need to manage
the result set at all rather than
getting result set you get a Java object
directly containing the DB records apart
from these important features hibernate
has more to offer which sometimes make
it more than a traditional ORM tool
whenever we are loading any object from
the database hibernate first verifies
whether that object is available in the
cache in memory or not if yes it will
load the object from the cache a
otherwise it will load it from the
database so this caching mechanism would
reduce the DB hits significantly and
would enhance the applications speed
that different ways in which you can use
this caching mechanism in hibernate I
will talk in detail about this in
hands-on session for hibernate caching
mechanism using JDBC you write code to
open and close connections and it's my
observation that a lot of Java
applications face memory leak problems
and that may be because the developer
forgets to keep the closing connection
code in the finally block or maybe
because of some other small mistake in
the code if you use in hibernate you do
not need to even think about it
it will manage the connection implicitly
for you what if you want to support more
than one database for your java
application if you are using JD
you would have handwritten queries which
may not be optimized or supported by
another database vendor so a lot of
modifications and testing effort is
needed for supporting more than one
database hibernate supports a lot of
relational databases almost all your
application will work with the database
of your choice absolutely fine with just
a change of a property value in one of
the files what if you are changing the
database column name or adding a new
column in any of the tables in the
database let's say there is a table
student info and you have renamed the
column mobile with phone number then
using JDBC you tend to rename this
column everywhere in the code wherever
you have used is column with a new name
think of a situation when there are 20
different places for making this
modification somewhere you might have
used this column for retrieval of
records and somewhere for update
insertion or deletion purposes hibernate
says if you are using me do not bother
about such things for any of such
database changes just make a change at
only one place typically an XML file or
an annotation in the Java's model object
and you are done no further change is
required in your java application
although we saw hibernate as an
advantage over traditional way of
writing code with JDBC but it's very
important to know that it's just an Oran
framework which is developed on top of
JDBC only just to hide some of the
complexities which lies in JDBC I would
just reiterate what we have learned so
far
so using hibernate you can tremendously
reduce the number of lines of code
almost 80% code reduction better code
readability no need of writing SQL
queries hibernate would generate
optimized query automatically for the
java application a real good caching
mechanism support for faster data
retrieval from the database
do not need to write code for opening
and closing of DB connections your
application would support almost all
relational databases for any change or
modification in the database a little
modification would do the thing in your
java application in the next lesson I
would talk about the setup needed in
Eclipse ID to use hibernate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
