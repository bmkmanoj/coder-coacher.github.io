welcome you to gone dude series in the
previous tutorial I talked about
requests
Parham annotation along with showing you
the various ways of using it in a
controller class I also talked about how
to create and handle HTML forms in a
spring MVC web application now in this
tutorial I will talk about one more
important annotation which is provided
by spring MVC and that is model
attribute annotation on a whole if I
talk about you can use this annotation
on a method as well as on a method
argument I will govern everything but
before that let's check upon some of the
fundamental concepts which are needed to
understand this concept guys to explain
all these new concepts to you I'll use
this demo which I developed step by step
along with you in the previous tutorial
all right so let's start here in this
demo I want you to observe a very
important point in this request handler
method I am setting the string object
message with this value and the point to
notice in the corresponding JSP file
that is admission success-story SP file
I am retrieving this value by simply
referring to its name this is the
wonderful feature which is provided by
spring embassy so the idea is very clear
if I'm creating some object in this
request handler method and I want to
access that object in the JSP file then
what I need to do I would simply need to
add that object to the model and view
object using its add object method if I
do that then I can simply access that
object in the JSP file by simply a
reference to its name here I showed you
this feature using a string object let
me quickly show you this feature working
with a user-defined object student and
consequently
would explain everything about the model
attribute annotation and it's working
alright so what I will do I will first
include a student class in the project
just to save some time I have already
included this class in the project the
student class is having two properties
in it student name and student hobby
along with other getters and setters
methods let me make all those required
changes in the request handler method in
this controller class and the
corresponding just be file that is
admission success dot JSP file and then
I'll explain all those modifications and
related concepts to you alright so here
I've modified the request handler method
with this code now let's modify the
admission success for JSP file also cool
so now all modifications I have made
here now let's understand what I've done
in this JSP file and the corresponding
request handler method here it's a very
simple change which I have made here in
this request handler method let's go
through it here I'm force creating the
student object with values name and
hobby which I am retrieving from the
form which user would summit and then
I'm adding this student object to the
model and view object with this
statement there is one more object I am
adding to the model and view that is the
value of header message string object
with this value that is gone to college
of engineering India and in the
corresponding admission successor
audience we file I am simply retrieving
both these objects that is header
message string object and student object
how using this HTML code I am forced
retrieving the value of header message
and then I am retrieve the value of
student object with this code all right
now let's check this application running
on
browser with all these modifications and
then I'll talk about the most important
concept for which I'm laying all these
foundations enter this URL on the
browser click enter my application has
sent this form fill up the form with the
values submit the form
cool my application has sent this as a
response back gone to college of
engineering India is the value of header
message string object and mr. ABC XYZ
and music are the values of student
object which I set here in the request
handler method and accessed in the
admission success rod CSV file guys now
I'm going to talk about a very important
concept and I would need a little more
attention of yours to understanding here
in this request handler method I'm doing
two important things first is I am
writing code for binding the request
parameters values with the corresponding
properties of the user-defined object
student with this code and the second
important thing which I am doing here is
I am adding the user-defined object that
is student object to the model and view
object using modern views add object
method like this spring MVC says this is
a right way of doing things for a
requirement like this but I give you an
option for writing less code and do more
things with the help of model attribute
annotation all right let me tell you
what exactly I am talking about here
Here I am force extracting request
parameters using request panel
annotation then I am creating student
object then unbinding request parameters
values with the corresponding properties
of the student object and then I am
including student object into the model
and view object using its add object
method
large steps I'm doing here spring MZ
says if you replace this line with
simple this line that is I would use
model attribute foundation on the method
argument like this on student object
this way then I really don't need to
write code for creating the student
object I don't need to write code for
binding individual request parameters
values with the corresponding properties
of student object also I don't need to
write this last line where I'm adding
student object to the model and view
object isn't it good feature which
spring MSE provides you just write code
like this that is you just use model
attribute annotation on a student object
and then you really don't need to write
explicitly code for binding request
parameters with the corresponding
properties of student object and also
you really don't need to write code
explicitly for putting student object to
the model and view object so using model
attribute annotation on a method
argument like this I'm going to doing
more things with less code if you don't
want to use model attribute annotation
for a requirement like this then you
have to explicitly write code yourself
like I showed you before using model
attribute annotation idly with this
change my application behavior would not
change if I run this application on the
browser it would behave in the same way
as it was behaving before including
model attribute annotation let's see it
running on the prowl
all right pull all the values click on
submit button cool my application
responded in the same way as it was
behaving before including model
attribute annotation guys I would want
to make a very important point here when
you use model attribute annotation on a
method argument like this when a use
model attribute annotation on student
object then what's my expectation my
expectation is very clear I would want
Spring Embassy to extract all request
parameters and then bind all request
parameters with the corresponding
properties of student object
now when I say corresponding property of
request parameter in the student object
what do I really mean I simply mean
spring embassy would map student name
request parameter with student name
property of student object spring
embassy would map student hobby request
parameter with the corresponding
property of student that is student
hobby you have to be little careful
while giving names to the properties of
student object whatever name you give
here for the student object properties
you have to have same name listed in the
form that is for request parameters I
hope you got the point guys in this
tutorial my main aim was to introduce
you with the model attribute annotation
by showing you why and how we use it on
a method argument in the next tutorial
we learn how to use it at a method level
and also we will talk about more
advanced concepts related to this
annotation there as a big thank you for
