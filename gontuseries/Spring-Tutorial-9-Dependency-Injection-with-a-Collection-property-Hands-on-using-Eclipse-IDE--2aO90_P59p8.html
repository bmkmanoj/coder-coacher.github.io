in the last tutorial we covered
dependency injection demo using the
setter method wave so overall we covered
how to inject a user-defined object into
another object using a constructor or a
setter method wave with Springs
dependency injection now in this
tutorial we're gonna see how to provide
value of a Java collection used in a
Java class from the springs
configuration file or in other words how
Spring Framework initialize a Java
collection used in a Java class with the
values you provide in the springs
configuration file so what it means is
Java provides three core collection
interfaces and that is a set a list and
a map and this is what you do normally
you declare any of this collection
interfaces in your java class say a list
collection and to initialize this
collection you write extra code and then
provide all values in your Java class
this is what we do normally to
initialize and provide values to a Java
collection now when you use Spring
Framework you have an option to do it in
a little different way so what you do is
in your Java class you just declare a
Java collection along with its setter
method and simply provide all values of
this collection in the spring's
configuration file and at runtime
while initializing the class bean spring
will initialize the collection with the
values mentioned in the spring config
dot xml file alright you will understand
more with this demo which just displays
all waiters name who are working in the
restaurant on the console just a small
or guys whatever demos I am using for
Spring Framework or demos you can
download from my website download link
all right now let's look at this demo
I've created a very simple demo to
explain it what I've done here is I have
created a restroom class
Springs configuration file and a test
class just to test this demo in the
restroom class I have provided here a
list restaurant waiters list and a
setter method to it and a display
waiters names function which just
displays the value of this list that is
restaurant waiters list now if you
observe here I am NOT providing value of
this list anywhere in the restaurant
class instead what I want is in the
springs configuration file I have put an
entry of a restaurant mean which would
initialize the restaurant class and what
I have done here is I have provided here
the property tag and its name is
restaurant waiters list it's exactly
same as we have the list property here
that is Estrin waiters list and I've
provided here the value of this list
using the syntax list value and all
these values I have provided here now at
runtime in our test class when we
request spring to get a celestron beam
it will simply check if there is any
property with the name restaurant
waiters list present in the restaurant
class and if it is present then using
its setter method it would provide the
value of the list property in the
restaurant class now in the test class
we are simply requesting spring to get
as a restaurant bean and then we are
calling its display waiters name which
would display the value of restaurant
waiters list which we have provided here
using this syntax let's uncheck this and
as java application cool string
framework just displayed all values of
the list collection which is coming from
the springs configuration file here i
just showed the demo for the list
collection in the similar ways you may
provide other java collections that is a
set and a map in the restaurant class
and provide their values
from the springs configuration file a
grated in case of a list collection in
the next tutorial we'll cover a very
important concept in Spring Framework
and that is a bean scope guys thanks for
