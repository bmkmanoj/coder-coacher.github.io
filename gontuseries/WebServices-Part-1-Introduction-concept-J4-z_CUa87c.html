this lesson we are going to learn about
the basics of web services a web service
is a way of calling a function which is
inside a software from some other
software so let's say that to software
software 1 and software - and software 1
gives a call to function which is inside
software - this is a typical scenario of
a web service the software which gives a
call to a web service is called a client
and the software which gives service to
the request is called a server these two
softwares need not to be written in the
same language so this can be written in
Java and software - can written in.net
or any other language these two
software's need not to be on the same
machine so software one can be on
machine 1 and software two can be on
Machine 2 but there should be a network
connecting these two software's let's
see a real-time analog e for web
services
let's say there are two actors
at two one and actor to actor one gives
a coil director two and say says a hi
how you actor to receive this call and
gives a response back saying hi I am
very good
in this communication if you observe
there are few things which are very very
essential to establish this
communication one is the medium which is
used to establish this communication
which in this case is a telephone
network and second thing is the format
of input/output messages this is a input
message and this is the output message
so if you observe this message the
format is English grammar format for
input and output messages
which is English grammar
so we have observed that to establish
communication between actor 1 and actor
2 there are two things which are very
very much essential one is the medium
and other is the format for input and
output messages now we'll try to fit in
this real-time and nagi into web
services if you see this example this is
software 1 and this is software two now
software 1 is going to give a call to
software 2 so as to use the
functionality some functionality which
is inside this software so here also to
establish communication between the two
we need the same two things one is the
medium which in this case is a LAN
internet using HTTP hypertext Transfer
Protocol this is just a set of rules
HTTP we are going to see about HTTP and
few other protocols in our upcoming
tutorials and other thing is the format
of input and output messages which in
this case is s so it be simple object
access protocol we are going to see a
HTTP and SOA P in details in our
upcoming tutorials so for now I would
just reframe the definition of web
services a web service is a way of
establishing communication between two
software's which is language
interoperable
