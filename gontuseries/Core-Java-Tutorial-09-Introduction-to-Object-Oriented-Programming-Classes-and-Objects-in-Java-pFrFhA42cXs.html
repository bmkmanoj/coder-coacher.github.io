come you to gone to series so far in the
core Java series we went to Java
concepts in general now in this tutorial
we will learn the concept of a class and
an object in a Java program or in other
words we will go through an introduction
to object-oriented programming concepts
which will form a real big foundation
for a rest of tutorials in core Java
series so let's start Java is an object
oriented programming language means the
programs you write using Java always
follow the object-oriented concepts or
guidelines a program is nothing more
than a set of instructions which does
some tasks say sending an email to your
friend or addition of two numbers etc
etc in real life projects you will be
asked to write a software which may
involve many functionalities in a single
software like a gmail application a
single Gmail application is capable of
sending an email to any of your friends
receiving an email from your friends
maintaining a list of your known
contacts chat program which you use to
send an instant message to your friend
etcetera etcetera there can be many
approaches for writing a program where a
program can be as big as a program like
Gmail or a simple program performing
just addition of two numbers an
object-oriented is one of such
approaches what it says is a software
system should always be looked or
written as a combination of many
individual small programs called as
objects which will interact with each
other to form a bigger software or a
program the idea is simple the way in
real life things happen or work will do
programming in the same way in real life
if someone asks you to build a kitchen
for his house what you'll do you'll
bring individual objects from market say
microwave spoons knife refrigerator
and some of the useful utensils etc to
form a kitchen in your kitchen in
addition to having objects of different
types you also have some objects which
are of same type for example many spoons
objects here the point to notice each
object in your kitchen is capable of
performing some task represents a state
and has a real time existence in your
kitchen one object may use another
object for carrying out a certain task
for example in order to prepare a
vegetable dish a person object uses a
knife object for cutting purpose and
then uses a bowel object along with a
microwave object for cooking it and in
the end uses many plate and spoon
objects for serving purpose to conclude
here I would say an object in a real
life has the capability to perform a
certain task represents a state and has
a real time existence in a much similar
way a program or a software that you
write is made up of many small programs
where each such small program is called
as an object you may have many different
or same type of objects in your
application and just like an object in
real life behaves each object in terms
of a program to represents some state
has a real time existence and is capable
of performing a certain task when you
run the application one or many objects
in your application together will
perform a certain task
all right non important thing coming up
in real life from where object comes and
the answer is someone creates them but
before creating any object you always
need to write a blueprint for the actual
object for example for creating a spoon
object in a factory you will first need
to write the blueprint or a complete
description of the required spoon object
and it's only then by reading through
this disk
Christian a factory guy would
manufacture the actual spoon object it
is a one-time activity writing the
blueprint of what you want in an actual
object and later on you may go on
creating any number of physical objects
of that type here the point to note is
the blueprint is just a complete
description of an object but not the
actual object similarly in a software
application we will need to write a
blueprint of how a specific object looks
like and what task it is capable of
performing in a program this blueprint
is called as a class once a class is
ready you go on creating any number of
objects of that type by reading to the
class description in this tutorial I
just cried showing you the approach for
acting a program based on
object-oriented programming concepts
which is exactly similar in the way how
real world works but I did not show you
anything yet in terms of a program like
horn object looks like how to write a
blueprint or a class of an object in
short nothing I showed you up till now
except the philosophy of what classes
and objects mean in an object-oriented
fold in the next tutorial we'll write a
basic calculator program to understand
what a class and an object mean in terms
of a Java program there is a big thank
you for learning Java with me I welcome
