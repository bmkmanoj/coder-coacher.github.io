I'm going to focus in detail on those
people with the personality types that
are considered action seekers action
seekers are people that trust past
experiences and facts but prefer to
adapt to all situations that is
predominantly what sets them apart from
the other different seeker types which I
talked about in the other presentations
again if you haven't taken the
questionnaire a link to it is provided
on this page and if you're here to find
out more information on the adventurers
friends calculators and compassionate
s---based off the codes you have here on
the left side of the screen right here
you're in the right place now I'll go
over adventurers they love being with
people that share their love of
adventure they're charming but can be
blunt and assertive as well they have an
endless supply of energy and are
constantly on the go they enjoy living
on the edge and often become unaware of
consequences they thrive on the pressure
of pulling things together at the last
minute they are very motivated by
deadlines and very cool under pressure
figure out how to solve problems very
quickly very good at pulling conflicting
people together as well they are very
competitive very stubbornly will back
their beliefs they love being considered
a rebel play by the rules if they help
them get what they want can easily
juggle multiple projects at a time and
are persuasive and can promote
themselves and their ideas easily
friends or as I kind of like to refer to
them as friend gatherers because these
are people that like to gather friends
are people that value friends that add
to the fun and adventure they seek most
in life they give all they can to show
appreciation of others expecting nothing
in return they delight in everything
they do
while charming others through their
humor they thrive on change in all areas
of life love working with friendly
energetic people they handle conflict
with ease while fostering cooperation in
groups want to resolve issues quickly
without excessively looking at possible
solutions are very good at motivating
people toward action extremely
enthusiastic about their beliefs
relationships and everything have
trouble figuring out how long it takes
to get things done however sometimes and
often wait until the last minute to get
low priority things done they are the
natural creators of teamwork and great
at can
educating two groups then you have your
calculators there mysterious people that
are often hard to understand because
while curious they often keep their
distance they don't often act
conventionally and are very independent
they are very action-oriented risk
takers that value their ability to meet
challenges they are often very
analytical and at times may seem
dispassionate work well alone or with
someone with equal ability they work
quickly because they don't waste time on
unnecessary issues they dislike
listening to unnecessary details because
they want to get to the point they solve
problems in a systematic logical and
efficient way
they ignore rules and regulations if
they get in the way of results tend to
resist against Authority they see no
reason for them really are bored by work
that isn't challenging extremely skilled
at using tools to get the job done can
accurately retain an amazing amount of
information and have a tendency to
remain calm during crisis and finally in
the action seekers you have the
compassionate they're very easygoing
types that live with the attitude of
live-and-let-live their quietness and
modesty doesn't draw attention to them
in appreciating the little things they
often put others needs ahead of their
own they are drawn to harmonious
relationships filled with loyalty and
gentleness to others they bring true
compassion to emergencies have high
standards of perfection are very loyal
and cooperative in groups motivated by
contributing to causes they believe in
are very flexible and adaptable have no
desire to control or compete against
others deal with the needs of the moment
enjoy helping others by passing on their
knowledge and skills and can be trusted
not to take advantage of kindness
however they are often taken advantage
of and they value their honor and their
word so there you have the action
seekers if you'd like a more detailed
