of my um l2 video tutorial today we're
going to talk about class and object
diagrams now part of this is going to be
a review for a lot of you guys but I
just want to go through and talk about
everything in this tutorial like I've
mentioned numerous other times in the
past classes just describe the types of
objects that your program is going to
use and class diagrams are going to
describe those classes and how they
relate and each object that is created
from a class or a blueprint which a
class is all often referred to as is
known as an instance or just simply an
object of that class in a class as you
can see right here with this class
diagram we have is just made up of
States which is on the top and behaviors
which are on the bottom the States are
also known as attributes fields or
variables like up here and the behaviors
represent what an object can do or what
can be done to that object and behaviors
are also known as methods or functions
however in the object oriented world
these guys up here are normally known as
fields while these guys down here are
known as methods and we get into
abstraction what you have to understand
is in the process of creating objects
you want to eliminate as many details as
possible until you have a blueprint that
applies to all objects of a certain
class so if we're creating animals we
don't want to put any information in
here that is only going to apply to a
very few animal type objects so we
wouldn't for example talk about an
animal that has a certain scratch on its
one toe it just doesn't make sense
however we do know that every animal
that we define more than likely is going
to have a name height weight more than
likely favorite food speed and should be
able to eat and move and do other things
like we have diagrams right here on our
screen and then we can see here an
example of encapsulation which is
another big word but it's not really
that complicated what we're going to do
whenever we encapsulate our fields as we
have up here is to protect them and not
allow outside sources to for example
give our animal object a name that is
just a whole bunch of integers which
wouldn't make any sense because most
animals are a
string which is a name that you can
pronounce so down here where we have set
name for example we would make sure that
we have a string coming in and we would
then verify that before we would give
our animal object a name as we would
define up here and that is encapsulation
and the reason why we have to do that is
all of these fields are marked using the
visibility symbol of private and they
are accessible because down here we use
the visibility field of public and I'm
going to get more into what exactly that
means but you can see here whenever
you're defining an attribute inside of a
class diagram you're going to show its
visibility which means who can access it
its name and then its data type and then
down here in the methods section also
visibility its name then you can inside
of brackets either put in different
parameters in those situations you would
put its name and its data type followed
by a colon and the return type and you
can see that laid out here again with a
basic method diagram again visibility
followed by the name followed by
parameters either way you have to put
these brackets inside of here then a
colon and a return type and down here
you can see an example where we do pass
parameters to this method now onto UML
class item visibility and what exactly
that means first you have public and
basically what public means is it's
accessible by any of your other classes
and then we move on to protected and if
an item or a field is protected this
means that it can be accessed by methods
in the same class and as well subclasses
that are created from that class so if
we jump back to animal when we create a
more specific subclass of the superclass
animal called dog if any of these fields
up here were marked protected which is a
hash symbol instead of a negative which
stands for private that means that dog
objects would have access to these
fields however since the private you
cannot access them with subclasses and
then you have package visibility which
means basically anything set as a
package or a default sometimes it's
referred to as default can be called by
any other class that is within the same
package and then of course we move on to
private and private items are only
access
two other items in the same class and
just so you know attributes whenever you
create them or fields whatever you want
to call them should always be there
listed as private or protected in most
any situation and more than likely
private unless you want subclasses to be
able to access them in that situation
they should have a visibility listed as
protected now on to multiplicity and
multiplicity allows you to declare
certain rules for attributes that are
going to represent a group of objects
you can see a whole bunch of examples
here so let's say that we want to list
between one to ten different types of
favorite food for each animal well you
would just put one dot dot ten inside of
brackets and that is exactly the role he
would set there let's say that we also
would like to have a group of friends
for every animal however we have no idea
how many friends this animal might have
in that situation we put a star inside
of there and it wouldn't make any sense
to have friends listed more than once so
in that situation inside of curly
brackets we would put unique and of
course you could put not unique and in
those situations like you can see down
here you would put not in lowercase
letters followed by unique with an
uppercase u then again you can see here
if each animal object is going to have a
whole bunch of owners however we have no
idea how many and we'd like to list them
in the order of ownership we would put
this as an ordered grouping and if we
would like to list a favorite number and
then say that animal object can never
change it in that situation we would
list that number as read-only which just
simply means once it's set it cannot be
changed and the final thing we'll talk
about in regards to class attributes is
the use of static attributes if you ever
want to define a static attribute which
will be shared between all of the class
objects that are going to be created
from type animal in that situation let's
say we wanted to keep a tally of the
number of dogs for every object and that
situation it wouldn't make much sense to
have this be a class attribute we would
simply underline it and anyone who sees
your class diagram would know that the
attribute number of dogs is a static
attribute then we move on to something
people like to argue Bob
a lot and that is probably because it's
not used all so much and it can be kind
of confusing however I don't like to
argue about it so I'm going to briefly
just give you a rundown of what goes on
here with dependence dependence comes
down to the fact that whenever you are
going to be designing classes you want
to avoid creating classes that are what
we call it tightly coupled and by
tightly coupled what we mean is we don't
want classes in which a change to one
class is going to force all kinds of
other changes in another class or many
additional classes if that occurs this
is called tightly coupled classes we
want to instead have loosely coupled
classes and dependence is an example of
class dependence that is very loosely
coupled these guys I have almost nothing
to do with each other so let's go into a
dependency dependence relationship
between classes here we have an example
where we have a dog object that can be
passed to a method of the class wash
animal in this situation is just simply
passed in as an attribute and then let's
say maybe we print something out to
screen that has the dog's name or
what-have-you and then wash animal is
done with dog and has no other
relationships with dog in absolutely any
way it is just simply used on a local
level inside of a method and then
discard it this is but one example of a
dependency relationship between two
classes and just so you know this is how
you would show that relationship between
these classes but also know that
whenever people are creating class
diagrams this is often not shown if it
was shown you would have arrows all over
the place when you're creating class
diagrams so now you know what it looks
like but more than likely it's best to
not use it whenever you're creating your
own class diagrams then we move on to
the Association dependence between
classes with an association and again
this is something that's not often shown
inside of class diagrams I just want you
to know what it is if you have classes
that have a direct relationship with
each other but don't necessarily have
attributes attributed to each other like
we have in this example this is known as
and association dependents so for
example we have teacher classes and we
have student classes and we might have
schools down here in which teachers are
directly related to students and we know
that teachers have students and they
wouldn't be teachers without students
they are however the way we have this
structure right here not directly
dependent upon each other even though
they are related in one way or another
inside of the school class this is known
as an association relationship they are
connected inside of another class
however they do not directly dependent
if that's at all confusing don't really
worry about it in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to get more into this
stuff and clear everything up that is
but just one example of an association
dependence then we get into another
level of dependence and this is known as
aggregation versus composition and in
most situations aggregation and
composition relationships are going to
occur between two objects at the same
time so in this example breed has an
aggregate relationship to towards dog
every dog is going to have a breed of
some sort or another and then to look at
this further as an aggregation dog is
the aggregate of many other objects that
describe it like breed does breed may be
used in many different composite
instances just to make this a little bit
more understandable it is possible for
many other different dog classes to all
have a breed and maybe have the same
breed however be completely different
objects on their own so each dog is
going to have a breed however those
breeds may be different from each other
that's the aggregation and again this is
not often shown this is a filled-in
little diamond composition however is
often shown in class diagrams and what
that shows is dog has a breed as you can
see here breed which would just be a
simple string word is listed as an
attribute inside of the dog class and
that is known as a composition
relationship because breed makes up
every dog class that we are going
to define hopefully that makes sense
we've talked about composition in the
past so that shouldn't be that big of a
deal and then finally the last level of
dependence is inherent and with
inherence we have example of a very
tightly coupled relationship and this is
when we have a subclass that is created
from another class here we have a
subclass named dog that is created from
the animal superclass and whenever we
create any subclasses all fields and
methods are shared between these guys
if those fields and methods are marked
as public protected or default now let's
move on to constraints constraints are
used inside of class diagrams to define
rules for parts of your classes so let's
say down here we absolutely positively
want to make sure that every single dog
has a name well we would just simply
draw a dashed line and then put self dot
name and mark this as not empty however
we do have other constraints to get much
more deeply into this rule set here are
pre and post condition constraints
preconditions must be true before a
method is executed and as you can see
here is an example and this is exactly
how it would be drawn up in a class
diagram we're going to first list it as
pre and say that balance must be either
greater than or equal to zero before the
method over here set balance is executed
and that just means that we're not going
to leave the balance or price or money
owed on a dog that is purchased to ever
be a negative value because it doesn't
make any sense and then we also have
post conditions let's say that we are
never going to sell a dog that weighs
more than $100 in that situation we want
to make sure that the balance never has
a value that is greater than $100 and
that's exactly how you would define it
there and you could also define all of
these rules using just basic notation
which I'm going to get a little bit more
into here in a second between curly
braces or use them or display them as a
note like I have over here on the right
side so now let's get into how to define
these constraints they are often defined
easier either using basic programming
nomenclature the way that you would
normally describe things or through
something called object can
Geraint language or ocl whenever you're
using ocl you would define you all of
your data types is either bolding an
integer real or string and by real I
mean numbers that have decimal places
and here are a list of the most common
forms of arithmetic that you would use
whenever you're defining certain
constraints and this guy right here
represents modulus which is a reference
to the remainder that is available after
a division an absolute minimum and Max
if you want to compare everything less
than greater than less than or equal to
greater than or equal to equal to or not
equal to
and then finally boolean czar compared
with and or XOR or not I trust you know
what those mean then we get into
abstract class diagrams and like I've
talked about many times before whenever
you're creating abstract classes some of
those methods are going to be defined so
that subclasses have to implement all of
the code and if you have an abstract
method defined inside of an abstract
class you can see here the abstract
class has to be listed as italic and the
abstract method also must be shown in
italics that's how you define that they
are abstract
however non abstract methods would not
have to be listed as italic and that is
the basic way you would display those
and here you can see a subclass that is
implementing all of the code that is
needed to make these abstract classes
work and make them happy and here you
can see that we use the basic arrow type
that is used whenever we are showing
that one subclass is inheriting certain
methods from a certain superclass
then we get into interfaces and they
contain only abstract methods and all of
the attributes are either going to be
static or constant and you can define
interfaces inside of class diagrams
either using ball notation as you see
here on the left side of the screen with
the name of the interface underlined or
you can use a stereo type which is this
guy right here that lists this as an
interface and the interfaces name and in
this situation you do not list those
methods which are all going to be
abstract in italics
whoever if you did I don't think anybody
would kill you and then finally all on
one frame I'm going to explain the
basics of object diagrams object
diagrams are very simple and they
are just basically used to describe how
objects are going to work together you
can see here we are going to define four
different types of objects so here we
have game board and you wouldn't have to
put the class name in here but if you
did you would put it second after the :
and this is the name of the object that
would be defined you could also put
notation inside of here that shows that
game board is going to display an enemy
ship for making some sort of video game
you could also use the keyword contains
to state that the enemy ship is going to
contain an engine and then up here this
weird looking thing this is an example
of an anonymous object which of course
would not have a name at anonymous and
in this situation we're just documenting
an action listener which is a guy that's
just going to grab certain events
whenever they occur on the game board in
that situation it's common to actually
document the method that exists inside
of this anonymous object so that you can
see certain actions are performed an
event is passed over and then things
happen so that is a basic rundown of
class and object diagrams leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
