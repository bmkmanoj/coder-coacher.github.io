2 of my wordpress shopping cart tutorial
in the previous tutorial which I provide
a link to above I showed you how to
build or put together the theme and
install the shopping cart system as well
as how to style it and mess around with
it and we're using WP e-commerce and
this part of the tutorial I'm going to
take you through the whole process of
setting up your shopping cart now here
we're inside a wordpress so I'm just
going to take you to the dashboard right
now and this is after WP e-commerce has
been installed and this is just a dummy
site right now and otherwise there would
be sales and orders and all kinds of
financial information all provided for
you here right on the dashboard then for
the store part if you want to access
that go under settings and just click on
store on the Left sidebar and you see
all your different information here now
when we're in the general tab and I'm
going to take you through all the tabs
and tell you everything that's going on
here you basically are going to want to
put in your base country I'm in the
United States so I put that in there
then you want to go into the target
markets area and right here you would
check off all the different countries
that you would want to be able to buy
from your site now if you don't check
them off they're not going to be able to
buy from you just to understand that but
you also understand that you don't want
to check every single one of them
because that's going to make your
customers have to go through this joy
going to list right here just to find a
country so I just chose in this
situation just to put United States
inside of there then underneath a here
you're going to decide how long you want
to keep anything that a customer like
let's say they go on your website and
they click that they want to buy
something and then they leave it in
their cart and they don't purchase it
here you're going to find how many days
it's more than likely going to stay
stored in the browser so that if they
come back or will still be there in
their cart here you see hierarchy rural
product category what this is going to
do is it's going to make really smart
URLs that are going to break all your
pages down into all the different
categories that you have your products
inside up that's often a good idea to
use for search engines so more than
likely you're going to want to put yes
inside of there down here under currency
settings you're going to define what
type of currency you are using and your
amusing US dollar and then you define
exactly how you want your doll and
routes to be used or displayed on your
screen and then of course after you make
all these changes you want to hit update
so now let's move in the presentation
tab and we briefly touched on this
before whenever we move to all the theme
files over into our WordPress theme that
we create it
if you look down here you can see this
is where we move those template files
after we select enough and I just
selected them all whether i was using
them or not you can of course decide to
choose less or use more whatever you
want to do with it down here you see
exactly what it says this will allow you
to backup your wordpress theme prior to
installing all of these other different
pages and all the other additional
information that's needed along with
that and then down here there's a lot of
questions regarding so what does it mean
by flush theme cash well if you move
your theme files around manually using
FTP software you may have to flush your
theme catch to update the location for
all of your theme files once you update
them using like FTP or what have you and
we come back up inside of here over here
we see button type normally you're going
to want to have this be add to cart
which is going to slowly build up all
the different products in the shopping
cart hopefully they'll buy more than one
product that way otherwise if you have
paypal set up this is the only way this
works you can put by now and in this
situation of the way you'd really want
to do this is if you have one product or
very small number of products for sale
meaning that more than likely somebody
is only going to buy one product in that
situation you would put by now and then
if you are not selling any products
inside of here but maybe offering
services and so forth or just looking
for general interest you would hide the
add to cart button also this is also
never going to be checked yes so that's
the way that goes then right here we see
show product ratings what that means is
if somebody comes in here and this is
how everything's set up and they click
on your products page for your shopping
cart and you see different products that
are all set up inside of here good CD as
we scroll down here average customer
ratings and your rating this allows
people to come in here and put different
star ratings on products if you have
that checked yes so that's what that
means show stock availability would show
your inventory if you choose to do that
and of course you want to do that you'd
also want to set up inventory inside of
this guy display fancy purchase
notifications what that means if
somebody comes in here and goes add to
cart see this little thing right here
well that is a fancy notification we're
just gonna hit continue shopping and you
may have noticed that over here in the
shopping cart on the right side of the
screen because i put the shopping cart
widget over here it automatically
through that inside of there then you
can decide if you want to display per
item shipping on the screen or choose
not to display that and wait until the
person checks out to show them how much
you're going
charge shipping I have that set for yes
here disabled Lincoln title what that
means is if the person would go here to
the products page and click on this
that's going to allow them to go to that
specific products page as you see right
here that's all that means a lot of the
stuff sounds complicated it's really not
then also add quantity field to each
product description well of course I
think that if there's any situation
which person might buy more than one of
your product you're definitely going to
provide them the opportunity to buy more
than one of your products and we scroll
down through here and if you're just
using the default free version of WP
e-commerce which I am here you don't
really have the option to use these
other fancy things for your product
pages so I'm just going to go through
the default view and then of course if
you decide to buy it you can go into the
grid view settings which is only going
to be used if you purchase the gold cart
which is a very reasonably priced if you
want to get it definitely I would say
get it but I'm just going to stick with
the free version in this tutorial and
then of course show list of categories
it just provides all kinds of other
different things in regards to how
products are displayed so if the person
clicks on your product tab like a have
up here right here where it says
products page you can define exactly
what products you want to show you want
to show all your products or you just
want to show products in certain
categories again this is something where
I can't imagine somebody not choosing
show all products and you can also
define how those products are displayed
well they're going to be based off of
the last products you uploaded drag and
drop price and name dragging drops not
going to work unless you buy the gold
cart show breadcrumbs what that is if
you have that set for yes these are
bread crumbs right here across the
screen if you can't see this you can
view it full screen this is a high
definition video it just allows people
to click backwards through all the
different things based off of how you
categorized all your products and again
these are all kinds of other different
options I had just have all of these set
for yes except I have the featured
product thing here shut off or set to
know because I have that fancy featured
product slider that I showed you before
then again i have my shopping cart where
it's located as you saw before I have it
in my widget section if we scroll here
there it is there's my shopping cart and
I find that's also the best way to use
this and also do you want to splay
postage and tax I just have no I just
present them with that information
whenever they get to the shopping part
and they're ready to check out this
situation I always have all the product
category settings always set to know
because some of them don't work with the
free version of this
then I see rolling no reason go into
that then down into thumbnail settings
you can define what the default size is
for all of your thumbnails will be both
being the default product thumbnail size
group thumbnail which isn't going to
work for English you have the gold card
and single product image size and that's
the size of the product on the
individual product pages then you have
to define if you want to crop your
thumbnails ice to always choose no in
this because sometimes it gets kind of
sloppy with that and I just have all my
thumbnails be a default size and I make
sure I upload them properly here you
define if you want to show your
thumbnails and then here you define if
you want to use a lightbox effect
doesn't really work with what I got here
but I could have it set up i do have it
set up for the lightbox you can see it's
showing a much larger version of my
product on the screen and there's a
smaller version for the thumbnail so if
you have that on that works and i always
use thickbox use pagination this allows
the person to go through if that set to
yes to sort through all of your
different products see this is
pagination down here allows them to
shoot through all the different pages
that are available to them so it's all
pretty nice and then this shows do you
want these pages to be at the top the
bottom or both and I have both chosen
and I think that's a default as well and
an intense debate is a way for people to
leave comments you can either have that
yes or no I choose to have it not sup to
you then hit update again and we come to
the admin's section this mainly focuses
in on whenever you provide products that
a person could download like ebooks or
music or whatever and this here you
define exactly how many times the person
can download your product if they want
to and here you define if you want to
lock down the downloads based off the IP
address and it will automatically figure
out what IP address downloaded it and
won't allow downloads to anything but
that fixed IP address in this situation
I can't imagine any situation where you
do not want check mimetypes set for yes
because if it's not set it exposes your
site to potential problems so I don't
really understand why that's even there
but either way always make sure that
says yes and then right here what you're
going to define is what email addresses
are going to be sent information
whenever a new purchase is made and you
can have multiple you can put a calm in
there if you want have a whole bunch of
email addresses go in there the reply
address that is going to be in the email
whenever a email is sent to you that
says basically hey somebody ordered some
stuff this is where they live this is
where you need Senate and so on so on
here you would also type in your terms
and conditions this is going to pop up
right before they make the purchase so
for example if you have minimum orders
or whatever you will not accept a
purchase and less sites of fifty dollars
or more you would of course put that
information in there and also maybe
return policies or whatever that all
kind of goes to a lawyer down here
purchaser seat this is going to be the
message that the person receives after
they make a purchase from you shop name
is going to be the name that you make
for your actual website and it's also
going to list out all the different
products that they purchased as well as
shipping costs and the total price taxes
also if that it's applicable and then
admin report and this is the information
that is sent to whoever you put up here
as the recipient and it's going to tell
you basically hey this person ordered a
whole bunch of things and you need to
check in on that and then down here in
the track and trace settings this is
only applicable if you are using a
shipping service that tracks packages in
most situations I don't use this let's
move on to taxes and basically I say
that everything on here is totally going
to be based off of where you live and
going to pretty much leave it at that
you see down here and tax rates I
defined that if anybody in Pennsylvania
buys anything off this website that's
where I live that they are going to be
charged seven percent in regards to
taxes and I could just as easily come in
here all of a sudden set that to zero or
delete this all together and you can of
course put different information and
rare depending upon what country you
live in or what state you live in it's
all going to be different so I'm not
really going to go into it and it's
pretty much self-explanatory if you
understand all the taxes work the only
thing it kind of trips people up here is
the product specific tax i will go over
that basically what this is asking is if
some of your products are taxed at a
different amount based off of what types
of products they are so sometimes food
is taxed at zero percent tax rate
sometimes it's the same as any other
product sometimes clothings discounted
edit add it up so again it's going to
depend off where you live let's get in
shipping and here of course you can
check on know if you're not going to
charge people shipping but most
definitely I do and then we have here a
base city which really isn't that
important but we put it in there anyway
the zip code is very important though
you'd want to put in whatever your zip
code is or whatever type of postal code
that is used if you're outside the
United States and there's a ship wire
settings which I don't use you can also
decide if you want to enable free
shipping if you click on yes it's going
to say what's the minimum order
before the person gets a free shipping
and if you click on yes you can say like
a hundred dollars and everything after
that's free shipping or do whatever you
want there then we have our different
shipping modules and I'm just leo
through these real quick basically that
whenever you want to edit these you just
come in here and check that off hit edit
over here and basically what table rate
means is it's going to calculate
shipping based on the price of the order
so if we come in here and say if the
price is fifty dollars and above you're
going to charge them ten dollars for
shipping okay so that's how that works
and then the other type of shipping is
wait rate here we come into wait rate
and if I click on that it's going to
allow me to say okay well based off of
if the weight is 50 pounds and above I'm
going to charge them a certain amount of
rate and then you hit update and you
keep adding additional weights and also
pay attention to and above so you're
going to want to make sure that you have
all those set properly and I'm just
going to delete that again and then of
course you have flat rate and this is
just whenever you have a fixed shipping
rate and you would of course hit edit
and change that and then down here we
see FedEx UPS Australia Post and united
states postal service you've click on
any of these different things what it's
going to allow you to do is enter your
user ID and any other information you
have in regards to how you have shipping
set up inside of your shopping cart
system they're all going to be different
but at the same time very very similar
and you can see here i use fedex and
fedex actually is an add-on product you
have to pay for i'll jump over into
payments and this is very simple most of
the time you're going to use paypal
that's what almost everybody uses and if
you would want to set up paypal
basically you're going to come in here
again and you're going to hit edit this
is so easy to do and you're going to put
display name which is going to be the
name your name or the name of your
company and then username is going to be
your paypal email so really really
simple your user ID with paypal and in
the person is going to be able to go
through here and buy things directly
through paypal which is really awesome
you're almost always going to want to
have be notified whenever payment goes
through so click yes and you're almost
never going to want any information
regards to shipping details or address
override I would never change address or
overwrite is in you're messing around
with how paypal works and nobody wants
to mess around with that stuff that's
cool then we get to check out
down in here I always have my users
register before they can buy anything
off the site and the reason why that's
important is you want to make sure that
you capture all of the user information
which we're going to get into down here
so you make sure everything gets shipped
to the right location you have all the
right information if you want to get a
hold of this person and then I also
don't force people to use secure socket
layer because all my payments are going
to go through paypal and I would suggest
that that's the way you do it as well
then you won't have to worry about all
these security issues and all these
other different things i also have
enable shipping same as billing option
to know because I let paypal handle all
those different problems then we come
down into form fields and since i have
this check to yes that's going to
require the person before they buy
anything off to me to enter all of this
information which is real simple
information just first last name address
city state country and postal code and
that's it that's check out and you get
into marketing and this is really cool
stuff ok so if you have display cross
sales what this is going to do is it's
going to display similar items to the
current products that they are looking
at so that's going to kind of help the
potential customer along to actually buy
a product or find the product that they
ultimately want to purchase off you so I
see no reason for that not always to be
checked and of course any opportunity to
get people to share your information on
social networks why not and it provides
that option right here it also provides
them the option to like your shopping
cart system using Facebook and here I
almost never have this how did you find
us this is a survey that pops up and
kind of waste people time you can either
have a checked or not I almost always
leave it unchecked down here you have
our SS address if person chooses to sign
up for your SS feed they'll be notified
every single time you change any
products on your website so if they sign
up for that that's awesome then you have
the Google Merchant Center and this is
really really awesome and it's pretty
much self-explanatory you would just
click on Google Merchant Center you have
to set up an account with Google and
whenever you do that they're going to
ask you for this specific link do you
just copy that go into Google Merchant
Center and paste that in there and all
of a sudden why that's really cool is
let's say you sell valves like you see
here on the screen this is the Google
Product Search and if somebody goes to
actually search for one of your products
you're going to be in here with the
likes of amazon and sears and all these
other different other people bigwig
people that sell
and this is going to really really
really boost your sales so there's
nothing negative about that it's totally
totally awesome definitely do it and
then we come down to the final part we
click on the import tab and what this
allows you to do is create a CSV file
its going to have descriptions
additional descriptions product names
price sku codes which is like an ID code
for all your products wait wait unit
stock quantity and whether this product
is a limited quantity or not and if you
throw all those into a CSV file you'll
be able to upload them and all of your
products will automatically go directly
into your shopping cart system so really
cool absolutely amazing that all this
stuff is free and there's a link
underneath of this video that links
directly to the theme that I use which
is right here real fancy nancy and you
can of course change any of your images
and it's all free leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
