show you how to make one of my favorite
dishes I love it it tastes amazing and
it's extremely easy to make it's farfel
Inoue Dalls if you don't know what a
fork Lanoue de Liz it's a bowtie pasta
some people call it that's what it looks
like so basically what you need to do is
boil that I bought mine for 13 minutes
but you can boil it as long as you want
for the al dente and then basically what
we got I got fresh thyme that I have but
you can use regular time out of a keep
out of a little container like I got
here this is meant real easier to
remember basically we're gonna have a
tablespoon of mint
this is dried two tablespoons of thyme
or 1 tablespoon if it's dried like the
mint tablespoon of lemon juice I just
use regular lemon juice I don't squeeze
it
tablespoon of garlic which I also just
take right out of a container 15 ounces
of canned artichokes and I use the juice
as well don't need to throw that out 5
ounces of shredded Parmesan cheese which
is sitting here in a cup or 250
milliliters of heavy cream and that is
all we're gonna need and as I go through
I'm gonna go over the measurements all
over again okay to get this done in 15
minutes I just throw everything on high
real simple
then I'm gonna take some olive oil and
this is about 2 tablespoons of olive oil
doesn't really matter you don't need to
get picky about that then what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna take a little piece of
time and I'm just gonna throw it inside
of there and wait until that starts to
bubble then I know I'm ready to start
cooking while I'm waiting for that to
get hot fish out the artichokes because
I don't want to throw them in their hole
and the reason why I really love this is
it tastes totally different than just
about anything and one way to get people
to think you're a really good cook is to
give them something that not only tastes
good but tastes different than what
they're used to it seems like that's
where people get the opinion that
somebody is a good cook and let me tell
you this is gonna have a different taste
so I just chop these off kind of loosely
okay that's good and there's my pan you
can maybe see the time starting to
bubble I'm gonna throw the rest of the
time inside of there again that's two
tablespoons of fresh thyme 1 tablespoon
if you're using dry it's not gonna
really matter though and then you want
to throw the artichokes in there first
turn out again this is on
I cuz I want to cook this as fast as
possible and then right it's a point in
which it starts to feel like it's
sticking just a little bit there's a
little bit of drag whenever you're
pushing the artichokes around that's
whenever I like to take all of the
juices from the can you don't need this
if you don't have it you just have plain
artichoke so that's perfectly fine and
that takes Stein for about a minute and
a half I don't want to keep on stirring
this for right around another minute and
a half then I'm gonna take a tablespoon
of garlic or a little bit over that cuz
I really like garlic and right after
about a minute and a half
turn that around put in like a
tablespoon of lemon juice and then stir
that around for right about a minute
you're gonna see it starts to get real
nice and creamy looking and then a
minute in gonna put a teaspoon of the
crushed mint in here and again stir that
in soon as you have it all stirred in
there you don't see clumps of mint
floating around anymore you want to hit
it with a heavy cream then after you put
the heavy cream in just stir everything
in here a little bit then we want to
take our five ounces of Parmesan cheese
that's shredded and just throw it in
there I turn the heat off altogether and
I just put everything in all at one time
right right now we got five minutes
until the noodles are all done now I'm
just stirring this to go and as you're
doing this if you find that your cheese
is not melting what the heck off the
high again then after all the cheese is
melting just set it aside off the burner
of course you don't burn the cheese in
about eleven minutes in for flow noodles
all done just dump them all in there and
stir everything up and there you go
that's far flow noodles with artichoke
harbajan and heavy cream it tastes
absolutely amazing but this is
definitely not dieting food leave any
questions or comments below and
otherwise til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
