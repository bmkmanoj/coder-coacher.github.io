scallop video tutorial in this one to
Toro I'm going to teach you pretty much
everything you would learn from a
standard 200 page book on Scala I'm
going to teach you how to install
everything and we're going to work in
the terminal and we're also going to
work with compiled Scala code as well
and you may ask yourself oh why would I
care to learn Scala well Scala is the
perfect choice if you want to explore
the world of functional programming
without completely disregarding
object-oriented programming it has both
and on top of that what's awesome is
Skylar runs on the jell of a virtual
machine which means that it's going to
have a ton of libraries ready for you to
use there's anyone to bring up I answer
every comment that I get down below the
only situation which I cannot physically
answer your comment is if you do not
have a Google+ account so if I don't
answer your comment that is the reason
why I just wanted to bring that up
because it's come up a lot lately
alright let's jump over and I'm going to
show you how to install it on both a Mac
as well as on a Windows computer ok so
if you're on Windows or you're on Mac
you're on Linux or whatever you're going
to need the java virtual machine so
you're gonna want to go to Java comm /en
or maybe not just download the java
virtual machine click on free Java
download data and do all that stuff and
get that installed because that is
required if you are on a Mac it's pretty
easy to install what you're going to
want to do is to go to brew dot SH and
install homebrew and then inside of your
terminal on your Macintosh computer
you're just going to type in brew
install Scalla that's it hit enter that
everything's going to install for you
might need to update it and that's it so
that's all you need to do to install on
a Mac now I'm going to show you how to
install on Windows now of course you're
going to need the java virtual machine
just like before but you're also going
to need to go to Scala - Lang org and
then download and then all windows
you're going to click on this guy right
here it's going to pop up a little
message at the bottom make sure you want
to save it click on save and then it's
going to start installing everything for
you and this is just basically going to
be a whole bunch of next clicking so
click on next
and then it's going to have this click
right there and then click on next
everything here is fine click on next
and then click on install it's going to
take a little bit of time to install and
you just have to wait for that to happen
and then what you're going to
want to do is you want to type in en vir
environment variables whatever and then
you're going to click on edit the system
environment variables the reason why
we're doing this is we need to put Scala
in your path so you're going to want to
click on environment variables this guy
is going to pop up you're going to want
to click on path and you're going to
click on edit then and then you're going
to want to copy and paste the location
for the bin folder for skala on your
Windows machine and click on OK and then
after you do all that you're going to be
able to go into your command line and
then just type in the location for Scala
and it's going to be ready to go so the
only difference between what I'm doing
here is I'm going to be using a
Macintosh but aside from that everything
will be precisely the same and for
anybody that wonders I use notepad plus
plus on Windows and I use sublime text
on a Macintosh so enough talking about
installation let's start writing some
code ok so right now I'm in the terminal
and if I want to I'm going to do some
work inside of what's called the repo or
the read evaluates print loop and then
I'm also going to work with compiled
Scala code to give you an example of
using both of them so you can see I'm
logged into this and I can just simply
come in here and do some addition and of
course all of the code I use here is
available in a link in the description
there you can say I went and just threw
in a whole bunch of calculations and
automatically popped back not only this
solution but it also assigned it to this
variable right here once again I'm
inside of the terminal where the command
line if you're on Windows you're also
going to be able to come in here and do
things like your answer and then plus
and then use 0 which is this guy right
here and you're going to see that it
pops back that information you're only
going to use semicolons in Scala if you
have multiple statements per line but if
you feel comfortable using semicolons
everywhere to end all your statements
feel free to do that as well you're also
going to be able to come in here and do
things like create different variables
and it's automatically going to decipher
the data type based off of whatever data
you store inside of it so this is a
string as it says right there and you
can see right there it says this is an
integer now whenever you define a
variable with var that means this value
is going to be able to change however if
you go and define a variable with Val
and my
h40 that is going to be a constant and
this value is not going to be able to
change so var is able to change and vow
is not you can just think of it like a
variables value can change well a value
itself can never change
now there's numerous different data
types available in Scalla and you can
see here how to comment just two forward
slashes and if you want to do a
multi-line comment you can just do
multi-line like that and then another
star to close that off whoops
put it like this there you go that's a
multi-line that's a single line comment
just like Java you can see here your
byte certain how the minimum size and
the maximum size are going to lay out
there's boolean is true or false you can
see here they are lowercase character is
going to have an unsigned maximum value
of 65 535 and you can also see all of
the other different data types and how
extremely large they are it's also
important to note that you can create
doubles inside of here however they are
only going to have 15 digits of
precision so it's very important to
remember that after that your floats are
going to lose precision and of course
that's true for all data types in all
different programming languages however
we will be able to create what are
called big integers so let's say we come
in here and we create a large prime
number how we would do this is we would
go equals to and then we would say a big
int and then you can put your quotes
then you could throw in a really really
large number inside of there and then
you're going to close that off and that
is how we would be able to create a big
integer and it's going to hold that size
and it's going to make sure that it
works so now of course we could come in
here and do something like large prime
plus 1 and it's automatically going to
go in there and add that in you can know
that that's going to be true we also
have what are called big decimals and
let's just go and create a big decimal
let's say pi 250 digits and we're going
to define this with a decimal like this
paste in that big number
close the quote at the end and there we
go now we created a $2 decimal that's
going to hold its precision then we'd be
able to come in here and go and add one
to that value and you can see that if
you go and look at these values all the
way down here this ends with 7 5 1 and
this ends with 7 5 1 1
so it's pretty impressive we're able to
use numbers that large other things kind
of neat let's say we come in here and go
Rand integer and then let's just throw
100,000 inside of it this is inside the
terminal will then be able to come in
here and go Rand int and then dot and if
you click on tab it's automatically
going to show you a whole bunch of
different methods you're going to have
available here and all these different
data types that I've talked about they
are all objects inside of Scylla
so they all have built-in methods that
are very useful your of course also
going to be able to come in here and do
all the common types of arithmetic that
you'd like to do and five plus four
right like this and you can see that
that's going to add itself course we're
going to be able to do the same thing
five minus four and you can see we can
also do subtraction we can do
multiplication we can do division and
here I try to do modulus but I mess that
up let's just come in here and do this
and there you can see we can also get
modulus which is going to give you the
remainder of a division so all the
common different math types that you've
probably well aware of also going to
have shorthand notation however if we
had random int Scylla does not allow you
to do plus plus like that or minus - or
whatever like that however what you can
do is just add one to a value so you can
go in there and do that and equally we
would be able to come in here and go
random int and subtract 1 and then
reassign it back to the value for random
integer so you could put that in there
like that you could also do a
multiplication like that and of course
you don't have to use one and you could
also do a division like that so put a
four inside of there like this now if
you want to import a library directly
inside of the repo or the inside of the
terminal all you would do is just go
import Scala dot math and then dot and
then an underscore and that's going to
import all the different libraries that
are available to you and then we'd be
able to come in here and do things like
get the absolute value get the cube root
of a value also be able to come in here
and get the ceiling so it's something
like that
we would be able to round a value see
exactly how that rounds floor is going
to get you the bottom or it's going to
round down come in and get you
number raised to whatever power just put
one inside of there to get Euler's
number we could do power or two soon
every our square root and we could do
something like power of two two plus
power that you can see you can combine
all kinds of different things inside of
here be able to get the hypotenuse there
you go that's exactly the same as the
calculation I just performed log to the
power 10 there we go you could get the
natural logarithm to the base of e just
like that of course we have minimum and
maximum and of course sure you know that
works out and also you can come in and
calculate random values so let's say we
wanted to do something all we need to do
is go random like that and then you can
put in 11 minus 1 what this is going to
do is give you a random number between 1
and 10 and if you want to convert this
into an integer just go to int right
like that you can see right there give
us a marianum value and come in and just
do this all day and night there's a
whole bunch of random values and then
finally we could come in do something
like the radians and finally we could
come in and get their degrees so there's
a whole bunch of different math
functions that are available to you with
Scala and of course I'm going to show
you how to do this in a compiled way
here in a minute now let's go over and
take a look at conditionals now your
conditional operators that are going to
be available to you are going to be
equal to not equal to greater than less
than greater than or equal to less than
or equal to and that's pretty much
everything and then your logical
operators are also going to be familiar
if you're used to using Java and or and
not let's go and create a couple
examples here so let's create an age and
have that be equal to 18
now if statements inside of scholar are
going to be similar to Java except
they're going to return a value kind of
like we're used to with the ternary
operator inside of Java so let's go and
let's just give a demonstration this
will say can vote and we could say if
and then we'll say age is greater than
or equal to 18 and we would say
something like yes else no you can see
how the results work out there you might
as well give a demonstration of when
we'll use curly brackets and when we
won't so inside of the terminal that
we're using here like this we're going
to have to use curly brackets however
and normally you do not need to use them
inside of your code let's just go and
age is less than or equal to 6 so here
we're going to use curly brackets cause
the terminal needs to know you know to
allow you to continue typing in code and
we could do something like print line
this is how we print out to the screen
there's a whole bunch of different ways
to pronounce of the screen and Gordon
like that close that off then we'll
close off the first if statement then
we'll go else if this is how we would
check multiple different conditions and
we can come in here and say age is
greater than 6 and age is less than or
equal to 7 it's doing a simple
calculation to figure out exactly what
grade a student would go to and then
under this situation we could do print
line print line of course is going to
print out everything that you put in
between quotes and then it's going to
add a new line to your screen and then
we'll close that off and it will say
else and then in the last situation
we'll go print line go to grade and then
of course we're going to be able to use
plus and then inside of here we can
throw in any type of calculation we'd
like to use and of course there's
numerous ways to do that there's that
and then after you hit that it's going
to tell you what grade you need to go to
which was 13 and the reason why is we
had this stuff for 18 here at subtracted
5 from that that's how we get grade 13
and of course we could come in and do
some boolean calculations so true or
false basically it's going to come back
true if either one of those is true and
that's a rough overview of how we can
use conditionals inside of Scala now I
want to jump over and start writing some
real code ok if you want to exit out of
the Scala terminal you just type in
colon and Q and that's going to exit you
out of there and now let's start writing
some regular old code what we're going
to
here is we're going to type in object
and then this is called skala tutorial
with the scala exemption at the end
there and call this gala tutorial right
like this put some curly brackets and
then inside of main is where we're going
to be writing our program code and
there's arguments that can be accepted
inside of this guy right here all going
to be considered a string and we'll get
more into arrays later on let's just
write some code here so we'll go
variable now I'm going to go over
looping here just to start off I'm going
to create a variable that's value can
change see it says bear and if you
wanted to create a while loop in here
we'll just go I less than or equal to
ten like I said you can use curly
brackets if you'd like to I'm a hardcore
Java guy so I like to use the brackets
but of course you don't need them and
then we can use the shortcut to
increment the value of I know to compile
this guy you can either go in here and
go skala C like this and then type out
Scala tutorial dot scanner like that or
you could just go Scala Scala tutorials
gala and get exactly the same thing
right there and you can see that it went
and it looped through values between 0
and 10 with our while loop
there's also do-while loops of course
and you're going to use do-while
whenever you want to guarantee that
you're going to go through the loop at
least once and we'll just do a print
line I you can see there I'm like
putting the semicolons at the end even
though I'd really like to because I'm
not a Java guy and in this situation
you're going to put the while condition
at the end so you're going to say we're
going to continue looping through this
as long as I is less than or equal to 20
you can see we execute that it's going
to cycle through and print out 0 through
20
we're also going to have for loops
inside of Scala and here I'm going to
show you a couple of them if you want to
cycle between 1 and 10 we're going to go
I put that little carrot symbol there
and we'll go 1 to 10 and just to show
you that we can do it without the
brackets we can go print line I and you
can see I printed that out perfectly fun
and of course all this code here is
available in the link underneath the
video we could also go
letters like this and I can throw all
the different letters in the alphabet
and here we're going to use a different
type of or loop that we're going to use
until here this is very commonly used
whenever we want to loop through strings
or arrays so we'll go 0 until and we
could say random letters and if we want
to get the total length for that so it's
going to cycle through there as long as
the letters are available for us to
print out and then if we want to come in
here and print out specific letters from
this string we just go random letters
and then inside of there
instead of our square brackets we put
those inside of parentheses that's a
common error so just pointing that out
and you can see there it went through
all the different letters and printed
those out on our screen so that's how
we'd use until you can also use a for
loop to iterate through a list so let's
go and create ourselves a list and this
is how easy it is to create a list just
go list like that and there we go 1
through 5 for our list and then we can
just go for I temporary holding cell for
each item in our list a list and then of
course we could go and print out those
list items and a plus sign at the end to
concatenate those together and it tried
to print out that list but mess that up
so let's go in here and do that and
again put AA inside of there and now you
can see it printed all the list items
out so there's a bunch of different ways
we can use for loops other things kind
of neat is we can throw an if statement
inside here so let's say we wanted to
cycle through a list and only store the
even numbers well we could go the
article and say something like even list
is equal to 4 and then inside of this
we'll go I 1 to 20 so let's say we
wanted to go through all the different
list items from 1 to 20 we get then
inside of this guy say if I and the
modulus of 2 so anytime we would check
for the modulus of 2 and it would be
equal to 0 we know that we have an even
number and then down here after we close
off that curly brace we go yield I and
the value of I after it cycles through
this list is then going to be stored in
the even list like that and then if we
wanted to print out this new even list
of course we could just go for I and
even list and print line and I and there
you can see it printed out all those
different list items
that's just a different way to filter
through a list and there are many other
different ways to use filters inside a
scale and of course we'll take a look at
those as well we're also going to be
able to assign or increment through
multiple different variables with our
four loops so let's say we wanted to
iterate through I and that's going to go
from one to five like this here we'll
put a semicolon because we need that
because we have more than one statement
then we're also going to iterate through
using the variable J between the numbers
of 6 and 10 and basically what this loop
is going to do right here is it's going
to cycle through the first value in I
and then it's going to print out all the
different values in J and then increment
I and then proceed to work with J over
and over again probably makes more sense
if I just go in here and show you how it
works so I'll just go print line I print
the value of I there and then we'll do
exactly the same thing what J just
change this to J and there you can see
exactly what it did so when I printed
out the value of I which is the first
increment and then it printed out 6 7 8
and 9 and then it incremented the value
of I and printed out 6 7 8 and 9 and so
forth and so on and whenever we take a
look at multi-dimensional arrays later
on you're going to see how useful that
can be the thing it's important to know
is that there are no breaks or continues
inside of Scylla however you can kind of
knock that off and now we're going to do
that is we're actually going to create a
function here and I'm going to call this
print primes and that's how we create
functions we've typed in d EF inside of
this I'm going to create our Prime list
create a list like this and then we can
say something like 1 2 3 5 7 and 11 we
could then cycle through all these
different guys by going prime lists and
then if you wanted to implement
something that would work like a break
statement we could say something like if
I is equal to 11 in that situation we
want to jump out of this function all
together so you can just type in return
and that's exactly what that's going to
do so that's a way you can implement
break inside of Scala if you're really
missing it and then we could also
basically knock off a continue statement
we'll do I just throwing in an if
statement here so we can say something
like a 1 is not a prime well we could
say if
is not equal to one then we're going to
print the value of I otherwise we're
going to end this and jump back to the
beginning of this loop and then you can
see if we get completely out of here
exactly how we would call for this
function to execute we just go print
primes like that that's how easy it is
to execute a function and you can see
there print it out all the prime numbers
that's not only how we define functions
but also how we cycle through lists and
also how we can implement break and
continue even though they're not pre
built inside of Scala
now let's go take a look at how we can
handle input and output so let's create
a variable and let's call this number
guess and just give it a value of zero
here you're going to see a situation
what you do while is going to make a lot
of sense because we definitely want to
loop through it at least once and we're
going to say print if you don't put
print line at the end there it isn't
going to issue a newline we could say
guess a number if we want to get input
from the console we could just go number
guess and then we'll go read line if we
want to read in the data as if it's a
string which is probably a good idea
then if we want to convert it into an
integer we would just go to int and if
you're wondering you could also come in
here and go read int read double read
byte read short read long okay so if you
wanted to or you were absolutely
positive you're going to be reading in
those different data types you could do
that otherwise you could just always
read in strings and convert them to your
chosen data type which is what I
normally do and then at the end here
after we cycle through this at least one
time we can say wow number guess is not
equal to 15 we're going to continue
asking them for numbers and of course
after this we could say print half
another way of outputting to the screen
you could say you guessed the secret
number if we want to throw an integer
inside of here just put a percent sign
and AD and you're going to need a new
line there because printf doesn't allow
you to get a new line any other way and
then we could vote 15 right there and
this guy right here is going to
juxtapose directly inside of there and
I'm going to show you more about printf
and a whole bunch of other different
things and I got a little bit of an
error here about deprecation let's go
and fix that so let's jump up here and
we're going to create an import let's
import a couple
is actually when I import libraries you
just type in import and I'm going to get
Scala dot IO dot standard in like this
and if I want to specifically just get
two different functions here I can go
read line which is what that little
warning is complaining about I could
also do read in do whatever I had my
math library I showed you how to import
that inside of the terminal you do it
pretty much the same way inside of the
compiled version of Scala here then I'm
also going to import a library for using
ray buffers which we'll see later and
print writer and source which is going
to allow us to print to a file and then
read from a file which we're going to
see here in a moment and then we'll come
in here and execute this and now you can
see we didn't get the deprecation
warning so that one away
hey see if we type in all these
different numbers it's going to continue
asking us until we get the right number
so that's exactly how we would import
data or get data from the console a
couple different ways we can print out
information now let's go in here and
cover a couple other different ways to
output data let's create a couple
different variables there's my name age
weight and I'll show you how we can use
some styling using print line could also
come in here and type in s like that and
we'd be able to go hello
followed with whatever the variable is
that you'd like to print out there on
the screen and that's going to work well
we're also going to be able to go print
line and put an F in front of it like
that and you'll be able to say something
like I am and a dollar son and you can
put age you perform calculations
directly inside of here if you'd like
and way and I could go wait and let's
say that I wanted my weight or my double
here in this situation only so two
decimal places that's exactly how you do
that then you put an F at the end of it
like that and of course you're going to
want to make sure to put an equal sign
inside of there and you can see here
hello Derek prints out and it also
prints out I am 40 and weigh 175 point
five so some other interesting ways
which we can output information and
basically the styling characters are
going to use like right here we have F
with the doubles and all those other
different things you're going to use a %
C for your characters % D for any
different integer types that you want to
use
of course for any floating-point numbers
and then s for any strings a couple
other things we can do here
we could go print F which we're going to
use a lot and let's just talk about
justification how that's going to work
for us if we wanted to have this right
justify let's say with a total of five
spaces like that and I'll put another
quote inside of here just so we can see
the de justifications taking place could
do it that way we could also do left
justification by putting a minus sign
inside of there and you can see how it's
justified see it's right justified there
with five spaces left justified there
with five spaces could also come in do a
couple other weird things like let's say
we wanted to do zero fill you throw a
zero right there inside of there and say
threw in those four zeros to fill up
that space you've seen this before but
let's say we wanted to come in and do
five decimal places and we do something
like 3.14 and then since this is a
floating point number throw it up inside
of there you can see it went and threw
in those decimal places you could also
do left justification using strings so
this isn't only tied to using numbers
say five and then an S and then we'll
just sort of something like hi inside of
here say hi
now that's justified of course you can
write justify as well and the other
difference this guy right here is a
newline the other different special
characters you're going to use a lot B
for backspace like that there if you
want to use a backslash and then maybe a
if you want to do an alert sound or
something like that but for the most
part you're not going to use any other
special characters and I'll get more
into in putting an outputting data here
in a minute but let's jump over and take
a look at strings okay so we already
created strings here in the past so no
use and going over that just throw them
between double quotes and there you go
you got a string now if you'd want to
print out let's say a specific index
like the third index where your string
of course we would just come in here and
go random sentence that's what I'm
saying there and throw in three inside
of that and you get a out of that which
is going to be this guy because it
starts at zero one two three so that's
the third index inside of there
at zero of course we'd also be able to
come in here and get the string length
which is very useful if we're sorting
through a string by just going random
sentence and then typing in length like
that and you can see it printed out 21
we'd also be able to come in here and
concatenate strings or combine strings
if you want to use a less fancy term and
we can just go random sentence concat
like that and explode or something like
that random and there you say it combine
those for us we're also going to be able
to come in here and compare strings say
something like our strings equal and
then we can just go I saw a dragon and
then go equals and then go random
sentence and we execute that you can see
that comes back it's false
of course there should be our strings
equal that we kept put either way we
could also go through our string here
and find a match so let's say we wanted
to find where dragon shows up inside of
the string we could say a dragon starts
at index and of course we could go and
put this down at the bottom here keep
this a little bit neater and then to
find it we go random sentence index of
and then we'll put inside of here the
string that we're looking for inside of
that string and you can see that it pops
back the index starts at eight another
thing that's useful is we can take our
string here and convert it to an array
so we go Val random sentence array is
equal to random sentence and then just
go to array like that and then of course
after we do that we could cycle through
it we can cycle through the string I
already showed you how to cycle through
strings before random sentence and we'll
get more into arrays here in a second
and print line V and you can see it
printed out all that along with all the
different spaces on separate lines and
that's most of what we're going to talk
about strings here get more into them a
little bit later now let's take a look
at functions now your basic function is
going to start off with de F like that
and then whatever your function name is
then you're going to have your
parameters and they're going to have a
colon followed by whatever that
parameters data type is that's going to
continue as long as you have more and
more parameters this is then going to be
followed by another
: and the return type and then there's
different ways of using equals to and
curly brackets which I'm going to show
you here through examples in a function
body and then you're going to have your
value whatever you want to return and
you can either use return or not use
return as you're going to see here in a
couple of these different examples so
let's create a whole bunch of functions
let's create one called get some and
it's going to have a parameter called
number one and we're going to have this
be an integer define it as an integer if
you wanted to come in here and give it a
fault value you of course give it a
default value we could then go number
two also an INT has a default value of
one and the return type for this
function is going to be integer then we
could say equal to and a curly bracket
and then we could either put return
inside of here or not
so this situation I'm going to put
return inside of here I'm going to add
those two guys up right like that now
we're going to be able to come in here
and say print line say something like
five plus four is equal to and then call
our function buddy going get some five
plus four or five and four and you can
see that printed that out on the screen
we're also going to be able to come in
here and get rid of this return all
together and get exactly the same
results so sometimes use return mainly
use it just if you're used to other
languages that use return but other than
that Scala doesn't require it because it
automatically outputs the value based
off of the last line of code inside of
your functions another thing we're going
to be able to do is we could call this
function but let's say we wanted this in
this situation it's not going to matter
but let's say that we wanted to use
named arguments inside of here so that
num2 gets five and then num1 is going to
get four we can do it that way and of
course you're going to get exactly the
same results then we have functions that
do not return values and these are
referred to as procedures inside of
Scala and they're defined in the same
exact way we could say say hi see
there's no parameters inside of there in
a situation which you're not returning
anything you're going to put unit inside
of there and then you just throw a
simple print line inside of there and
then this function of course can be
called just by going say hi don't need
to do anything else you can see how to
prints out there on the screen as well
could also come in here and receive a
variable number of arguments so we could
do something like another version to get
some here we'll go args and this is
going to receive a bunch of integers so
we're going to put a star there at the
end of there so then going to return an
integer after it performs its
calculations sadha here we could create
something called some integer give it an
initial value of zero and then create a
for loop num and then we could refer to
our cycle through all the different
arguments that were passed in sum plus
equal to whatever the number is
currently inside of there and then we
can put some right there with no return
value and it's going to automatically
send that back to us whatever the value
of sum is and if we wanted to print out
these value we could come in here and go
get some like that get rid of this extra
one and you can see if we execute that
that's going to print out 21 just make
sure you don't have I had a little extra
column there I got rid of that so that's
how you can receive a variable number of
arguments and perform those or work with
those by cycling through them with a for
loop let's take a look at recursion
which is something that confuses some
people here we're going to do the normal
example that's used with factorials to
explain how recursion works this is
going to receive a number and let's make
it a big int because these guys can get
big just to show you exactly how we
would receive and then return a big
integer and a function and we'll go if
num is less than or equal to 1 we're
going to return 1 from that else num
times and then factorial this is the
recursion part where it's calling a
function is calling itself and I'll give
you an example of exactly how this is
going to work when we go in here and
actually run it first call the factorial
pass in a for inside of it execute it
and then we'll go through exactly how it
works so you can see right there comes
back with a final value of 24 well how
exactly does that work well let's walk
you by step by step what it's going to
do in its first pass through this is num
of course is going to have a value of 4
that's going to be multiplied times
factorial of 3 whatever the value of
that is second time through num is going
to have a V
you of three why because say we're
calling factorial again so we get to
this point then we're going to be
multiplying that times whatever the
factorial of 3 minus 1 is which is going
to be equal to 2 and then the third time
through factorial now is going to be 2
which comes from right there goes right
there and then we're going to call
factorial 1 what do we say here if num
is ever less than or equal to 1 we're
going to give it a value of 1 so
factorial 1 what we have right here is
also equal to 2 times 1 so what's the
value of that well that's going to be
equal to 2
so that's going to come up here and
replace this so what does that give you
that gives you 3 times 2 which is going
to be equal to 6 this of course is equal
to 2 so where is this 6 go what goes
right here and that gives you the final
calculation that gives you your final
factorial which is 4 times 6 which is
equal to 24 so that's exactly how we
would work with recursion inside of
Scala and exactly how it works in
regards to calculating factorials now
let's jump over and take a look at a
raise now when it comes to should I use
an array or an array buffer it's
basically going to come down to one
thing you're going to use arrays
whenever the size of the array or the
number of pieces of data are going to be
fixed you're going to use on a rape
offer whenever you're going to have a
variable number of data stored inside of
an array type structure if you want to
create I'm going to cover both array
buffers and arrays of course so let's go
in let's create an array called favorite
numbers we're just going to go new array
like that we have to define exactly what
the data type for our array is going to
be and then we have to define this size
for an array could also come in and
define an array and also initialize it
all in one line Bob and Tom are my
friends in my friend array you can also
be able to come in and change the value
and right just by pointing at index 0
which is going to be Bob in this
situation change that to su and we could
come in here and print this of course by
going best friends and then friends and
let's just say 0 inside of there for the
first index you see best friends su pops
by
and this is versus working with an array
buffer array buffer let's just go and
create a salsa call this let's call its
friends to array buffer is also going to
require us to come in and define what
type of data type we want inside of it
which is going to be a string and there
we go but you can see I left the length
part out because that's not going to
matter when the rate buffer because an
array buffer size can change see we
could also come in here and go friends
then and insert into the zero index I
could throw fill I can also come in and
add an item to the next available slot
just by going friends to plus equal to
and let's say we went to throw mark
inside of there that's going to work for
us we could also come in and add
multiple different values just by going
plus plus equal to and we could just
structure this like an array and it's
automatically going to fit right into
our array buffer so let's say we got
Suzy and Paul we could also add items
starting at the second slot so we can go
friends to dot insert and second slot in
this situation is going to be one and we
go Mike
Mary and Sue you see we can add a whole
bunch of values all at one time it also
come in and remove an item so we could
say remove two elements starting at the
second index well the second index is
going to be one and there's the two
items we want to remove and then we
could come in here and cycle through
these guys so let's just say friend
let's create a string equal to give an
initial value of nothing and then if we
want to cycle through them of course
temporarily store them in the friend
variable friends too so what we're going
to be cycling through and then go print
line friend and you can say it went
print it out fill Sam Mary Sue mark Suzy
and Paul that's how we can insert remove
and do all kinds of other different
things with ray buffers let's go and use
the favorite numbers array up here just
to show you how we can fill an array and
other different ways let's try using a
loop here because that's kind of easy
let's go j and then we'll go 0-2 and
then if we want to get the length of our
array like that minus one that's going
to give us all the different values
inside of our array or that we're going
to be cycling through we could then go
favourite numbers and the J index is
equal to the value of J which we're
going to be storing inside of that array
and then we could just print this out on
a screen just to show you what that
looks like
favorite gnomes and throw J inside of
there there you can see it printed out 0
through 20 or through 0 through 19 in
that situation out on the screen
another thing is kind of cool is now
that we created this favorite numbers
where we store data inside of here we'd
actually be able to cycle through these
and perform multiple different
calculations on them using yield like we
used yield before as a way to format
data so you say favorite numbers times 2
is equal to we do this all in one line
we could get a for num holding sale for
favorite numbers array which is what
we're going to be cycling through and
then we could say yield and 2 times num
which is the value there don't need to
do anything else with that and that's
all going to create another array force
in which all those different value is
going to be multiplied times 2 the thing
it's cool is we can now take this guy
favorite numbers times two and another
way that we could print out those is
just by going for each and then throw
print line inside of there it's going to
multiply all those different values
times 2 as you can see it did right
there on the screen
another thing you could do which is neat
is we'd also be able to store values
that match conditions
so we'll say favorite nums divided by 4
equal to say 4 this is more of the
functional part of scala what you're
seeing here so you say favorite numbers
and then throw a condition inside of
here
if number modulus 4 so this is going to
tell us if what this is multiple for or
not is equal to 0 and here we can use
yield again there's yield here we're not
going to perform any calculations on it
we'll just have that be number just like
that and then let's use our favorite
numbers divisible by 4 and we'll use our
little for each trick here like we used
before and you can see right there it's
only printing out all those values that
are evenly divisible by 4 so that's
pretty cool we could also come in and of
course and create multi-dimensional
arrays and we'll vote
malt let's create a multiplication table
here and with multi-dimensional array
you need to go array dot of dim and then
you're going to define the datatype
that's stored inside of it then you need
to decide or define the size of the
multi-dimensional reg to make this 10 by
10 we then go for I cycle through 0
through 9 for this guy use curly
brackets in this situation because I
feel that it makes it look a little bit
better make a little bit more sense and
it will cycle through 0 to 9 again for
the second part of this guy and then
inside of here we can go multi table
value for I value for J and then let's
make those equal to I times J and then
to print them out you're basically going
to do exactly the same thing so let's
just copy this for loop except in this
situation we're going to print those
values out so let's use printf in this
situation just to demonstrate using
printf so we can say the first integer
and the second one is equal to or the
indexes whatever you want to think of
the mass and we'll throw in a newline
and we'll throw I and J and then if you
want to get the value from the
multi-dimensional right just throw the
eye part in there and the J part in
there as well and there you can see it
printed all those different
multiplication tables out there on our
screen that's how we can use
multi-dimensional arrays I think is kind
of neat is we could also come in here
there's a whole bunch of different
functions that are available to us so
let's say we wanted to sum all the
values in an array of for us we can do
that with some what you can say say
favorite numbers and you can play around
with this in a terminal and just type in
that value followed by dot and it's
going to show you all the different
functions that are available to you and
you're going to be able to do there's a
whole bunch of functions I'll just cover
a couple of them here we'd also be able
to come in
and get the minimum value inside of that
array with men we'd also be able to get
the maximum value inside of there with
max there you can see the sum of all
those values the minimum and the maximum
do some other cool things here with
arrays we could also sort them so we
could say sorted nums is equal to
favorite nums
and we could sort them ascending or
descending so you can say sort with and
you'd put an underscore there greater
than sign and another underscore there
and this is going to give us a sorting
of descending if you wanted ascending
you'd put it this way
descending this way and then another
little trick is we can return an index
sequence and convert it into a string
with commas so I'll show you how that
works what's just use print line here
and we go sorted numbers deep make
string like that and then if we want to
separate it with commas we just put it
in there like that and if we execute it
you can say it did say it automatically
because of this guy right here put it in
descending order and then with this guy
right here convert it into a string we
could print out and also through
comments inside of there there's a whole
bunch of really cool things we can do
with arrays and array buffers and all
the other different things we covered
here now let's take a look at maps now a
map is a collection type just like
arrays and arrays buffers except they're
going to store what are called key
valued pairs and to create a map let's
go and create one for employees spell
employees right there we go and to
create a map we just go map and then
this is going to be the key so this
manager followed by a dash like a little
arrow and we could say Bob Smith is the
manager we can put as many of these in
here as we would like this map in this
situation is going to be immutable which
just means the values can't be changed
after they're created I'll show you how
to create mutable ones as well and
secretary and then let's have sue Browne
be the secretary we could then
get the value from this employees map
and we say contains we can check to make
sure that employees black you've spelled
employees wrong there we go don't really
like being an employee can't spell it
right all right so let's check that the
map actually contains a manager key
first before we ask for it and that's
how we would do that and then in the
situation which we find that let's use
printf this time we could say manager
there we go
and then if we want to get manager or
the value for the key manager inside of
our map we just go like this and you can
see Bob Smith pops right back there like
I said we can also create mutable or
changeable Maps so let's create another
one called customers how we would do
that is we would go collection dot
mutable and then map and then we come in
and let's just say the key in this
situation is going to be 100 and have
that be Paul Smith and then the next one
let's have that be 101 these all have to
be different their keys that's important
and Sally Smith and there we go we just
created a customer map it's mutable
changeable whatever we could then go
prune out and we say we want it customer
one and to get it of course we're just
going to throw in the first key inside
of there and you can see Paul Smith pops
back as the first customer in our list
we could also change the value using our
keys so let's say we just reference
customers which is the map 100 and let's
say we want this to be Tom Marx and said
now it's dawn marks could also add an
item because this is a mutable map so
customers can't do this if it's
immutable and we could have this be
Meghan Swift and then if we wanted to
output both the keys as well as the
values we could use a for loop for that
say I've told you I was going to cover a
lot more with for loops like this and
the map we want to work with which is
customers and then we could say print
out and we could get the key so we're
going to use D there of course because
it's an integer and
and that's a string right there throw in
a new line and now we can just get the
key throw it where it needs to go and be
value and throw it where it needs to go
and if we do that you can see it prints
out the keys and the values for
everything in the map and that's the
vast majority of what we need to know
about maps and now let's go and take a
look at tuples now tuples are going to
hold values of numerous different types
but they're normally immutable so let's
go and create a tuple so we'll just call
this tuple Marg is equal to and let's
have the speed let's say it's an ID of
103 Marge Simpson and let's say that she
owes us a balance of ten dollars and 25
cents we would then be able to come in
here and print information out here so
it's a string owes us and we could say
how much is this let's say we only want
well let's throw a dollar sign inside of
there first you know two decimal places
and there we are and now if we wanted to
get the values inside of there we would
go to pull Marge this is a little bit
weird underscore two so we want Marge
Simpson so this guy right here the
second this would be the first this will
be the second this will be the balance
and then we would also go to pull Marge
like that to get the actual balance
that's owed and you can see Marge
Simpson's owes us ten dollars and twenty
five cents pops back if we wanted to
iterate through a tuple we could use a
product iterator so let's go to pull
Marge product iterator and then call for
each and then go and get all those
different values and print them out on
the screen and there you can say print
it all those out on the screen all in
separate lines and if you'd want to
convert a to Bowl to a string all you
would do let's just go into it inside of
a print line we could say tuple Marge
and call to string on it two strings
available for a lot of different things
inside of Scylla and you can see it
printed out all that information for
that tuple that's a rough overview of
how we're going to use tuples now let's
take a look at classes okay like any
other object oriented programming
language classes are going to be used as
blueprints to create real world
chuck's and those objects are going to
define attributes which are called
fields and object oriented world and
capabilities of those objects which are
called methods and we're going to define
them outside of main I often like to
figure out or print out little comments
here or exactly where the different
parts of my language or my program
begins and ends just helps me guide my
way through here and now we're going to
create a class let's create a class
called an animal and you're actually
here going to define the default
constructor and the different fields
you're going to use right here right
after we define class and whatever the
class name is so this class is going to
have a string it's also going to have a
sound you can see I'm using var here
because I plan on these changing or
basically I'm deciding that they may
change and there we go so first thing I
want to do here is also before anything
else happens this is also part of the
default constructor which is going to be
the function in the code that's in
execute first whenever a new object of
type animal is going to be created it's
a little bit weird so what I want to do
here is I want to call this this animal
I'm going to call a function I'm going
to create here in a second called set
name because I'm going to have some of
this data be protected so that we will
be able to verify or only allow certain
names to be assigned to certain animals
so this in essence right here is a
constructor where we are going to be
accepting a name we're going to be
accepting a sound and we're specifically
going to allow them to set the name how
we define them to allow it to occur
another thing is a little bit odd with
Scala is that there are not static
variables and static methods like in
Java for example and we're actually
going to create one of those here in a
second and how I'm going to do that is
I'm going to give every animal an ID and
it is going to call a type of static
function that I'm going to call new ID
number which will create that in a
second just give me a moment to
structure everything out here I could
however if I didn't define the name and
sound and things
like that up here I could come in and do
something like protected variable name
is equal to no name but I'm not doing
that in this situation I'm going to have
everything done up here in the primary
constructor area and there's also
protected and private and public inside
of Scala just like there is inside of
Java protected just means that the field
can only be accessed directly by methods
defined inside of the class or by
subclasses classes that are going to
inherit from this animal class right
here will see inheritance here in a
second as well this is marked private
fields can't be accessed by subclasses
or classes that inherit from animals and
if it's public gets basically going to
be data that can be accessed from
anything but like I said I'm not going
to use that here because I'm defining
all those different types up here inside
of my primary constructor which is what
Scala calls it I'm now going to come in
here and define getters and setters that
are going to be used to protect our data
now the get name part isn't really going
to protect anything it's just going to
return values and you can see that it's
going to work just like any other
function that we've come across here so
far it's just going to go and get the
name that store inside of here and
output it you can also see we're going
to do exactly the same thing for get
sounds except in this situation of
course it's going to return whatever the
value for sound is now let's come in
here and create the set name part for us
so that we'll be able to see exactly
what's going on there with that guy
so a set name whenever it's called is
going to receive a name which is going
to be a string datatype and let's say
that I do not want them to be able to
have numbers inside of the name that
they pass for the animal okay I'm just
throwing this out here just as an
example of how we would like to protect
our data and we could say if not and
then we could say name and this is where
we have regular expressions right here
I'm not going to get too much into
regular expressions I have other
tutorials on regular expressions but
basically what I'm saying here is I'm
looking for a match in which I have any
decimals any numbers inside of this
string and I'm saying if the name that
they passed in here does not contain any
dust
most any numbers well then I want to
work with it and under that situation if
I want to refer to this animal objects
specific name and assign a value to it
I'm going to type into this name is
equal to name
however in situations in which they did
pass in a name that contain numbers in
that situation I'm going to say this dot
name and I'm going to protect that data
that's why I'm using getters and setters
and I'm going to give it a default name
of no name to show that it was not set
we can also come in here and do the same
thing with that sound except in this
situation I'm just going to let this be
perfectly fine allowing them to directly
go in there and change the sound for my
animal and once again if I want to
change the specific sound I just hear
this sound and pass it in sound so you
may say to yourself well what happens if
they try to create an animal object but
you do not have a name or a string or
whatever remember this is the default
constructor that's going to be called to
create new animal objects well we can
also have a whole bunch of other
constructors so let's create one how you
create other constructors as you call
define this this is a constructor inside
of Scalla
and in situations in which they only
pass in a name in that situation I'm
going to call the primary constructor
and I'm going to say no name is going to
be the name I assigned for my name and
no sound is going to be assigned for the
sound see they didn't pass in a sound so
I am NOT going to have one to pass up
here to this guy to assign so I'm just
going to let be the default right there
however they did pass a name so I'm
going to go this set name like that and
then call this guy up here to verify if
it's a valid set name or a valid name
and if it isn't give it the value of no
name so that's how we would handle if
they passed in a name let's also cover
if they do not pass in a name or a sound
well we're going to go define this once
again not going to put any parameters
inside of there because we don't have
any and in this situation we'll just go
this and then we'll go no name and we'll
set those values for us no
okay so those are the constructors and
they work very much like they work in
other object-oriented languages you can
also override methods so one method that
is available in Scala with every object
you create is called two string if I
want to override any method whether it's
pre built-in or I want to override a
method whenever I inherit from it I just
type in override to string and then I
can define exactly what I wanted to do
this one's going to return a string and
then if I want to format a string I
could do something like return and throw
in a string there with the ID I'm going
to show you here in a moment how to get
that ID part there D says s like that
and then I could call dot format like
this and then go this name dot this dot
ID and this thought sounds and that is
how we can format a string that we're
going to be returning from a function or
method as well that's how to override
and that's out a formatted string and
that's how to do a bunch of different
things I'm going to run this in a second
so you can see everything exactly how it
works first thing I wanted to do however
was to get back to this ID part remember
up here I said I called a function and
we're going to have to do new different
ways of creating static methods or
static functions inside a scallop versus
what we would have inside of other
languages like Java what I'm going to do
and make sure I'm outside of this class
area and we'll come down here right
afterwards and I'm going to create a
companion object for my class which is
where we would be able to find static
class variables and functions and how
it's created is you go object and give
it exactly the same name as your class
so it's going to be animal in this
situation and you want to create a
static I mean that's what it's called in
Java
field you would go ID number is equal to
zero like this and private and we could
create a static function new ID number
is equal to and inside of here we can
perform some operation like we can take
this number and just increment it so
that we will know that each animal
object is going to have a unique ID and
then after
does that calculation it's going to
return the ID number so that's how we
would create static fields and Static
functions inside of Scala as well and
that of course is what this is referring
to see new ID number and if we come down
here a new ID number this is a function
so now let's go and create some objects
using this class come back up inside of
main I'm going to create one I'm going
to call it R over and I could just go
new animal like that I could then come
in and go R over dot set name and pass
in Rover like that just make sure I
don't put a number inside of there
otherwise it's not going to like it
set sound and I could just say wolf like
this and then I could print out some
information on the screen and how I'm
going to be able to get this data just
by calling Rover get named Rover get
sound come down inside of here see a get
name get sound those functions right
there exactly what I'm calling and you
can see right there Rover says wolf
sound pretty simple and you can also say
that this is going to work whether I
pass in a name and sound or I do not
because I set up all those different
constructors we had there likewise I
could also come in and create a cat type
of vibe note item here new animal and in
this situation I am going to pass in the
name and so forth whenever I first
created a meow and why don't I show you
another different way that we can work
with objects using print lines so we
could do like this I could also come in
if I put that little s inside of there
put dollar sign like that let's close
that off so it stops flipping out and I
would then go whiskers like this get
name and that's going to work with ID
and I could go and get my ID that was a
sign to whiskers ID says and then I
could also put another dollar sign as
out of there and go whiskers sound like
that and of course close that off the
curly braces and why don't I also come
in at the same time and go whiskers and
let's also call that two string function
well let's also throw this inside of a
print line because to string returns a
string doesn't print a string and you
could say whiskers with ID to says meow
whiskers with the ID to says me out they
both do exactly the same thing just
show you a different way about putting
that information inside of print line
now let's talk about inheritance and how
that's going to work so I'm going to
scroll down here pass my animal class
and this animal object we have right
here and basically a class that inherits
from another is going to of course gain
all of the class that it's inherited
from all the fields and methods to find
an animal in this situation and the only
way that can't happen is if this guy up
here is declared with final so if you do
not want a class to be inherited from
declare it as final and you won't be
able to do that so let's come in here
and let's create a new class called dog
it's also going to receive a string a
sound however because it is a dog it's
also going to have a growl now if you
want to inherit from the animal class
we're just going to go extends and then
you're going to define name and sound
which is going to be passed over to that
class and then put curly brackets guys
remember animal receives a name and a
sound whenever all the animal objects
are created we can stretch this out here
so you can see all that on screen at one
time then inside of this guy we're not
going to create all the constructors
we're going to need so the fault
constructor here is going to be this
going to receive name it's also going to
receive remember this is the default
constructor up here it's expecting a
name a sound and a growl if it doesn't
get a growl in this situation we need to
handle that so in those situations we're
going to say this and go no name we can
pass in sound because we got that and
we're going to pass in no growl because
we didn't receive a growl and then just
like before we're going to do some
checking on the name to make sure the
name is a valid name by calling set name
on that and this is going to be able to
call the set name whoops make sure it's
the same set name there set name here
upper case make sure those are exactly
the same otherwise this will not work so
that's a constructor we'll use if we
only get two of the value
passed over and then we'll go and define
what's going to happen if only a name is
passed over and here we'll go this and
we'll say no name no sound and no growl
because in this situation we only
received a name and then we're going to
verify again that the name is okay
bypassing name inside of there and then
the final situation constructor wise as
we'll go define this and we'll have to
handle if they don't pass anything
inside of it and under that situation
we'll just go name a sound no growl we
can also of course override any methods
that are defined in our superclass in
exactly the same way
override define to string it's going to
return a string just like the last guy
did and let's just copy this because
it's very similar paste that in there
and we'll just say says s or throw in
our growl right there and then at the
very end of this just change this to
growl like that and now that we have
that safe we can jump back up inside of
main once again and we'll work with our
dogs that we created so let's create a
dog called spike is equal to new dog and
then we'll just go and define everything
inside of here just keep this simple
so his name is his spike he says wolf
and he says her there's that new object
we could come in and go spike dot set
name call that directly right afterwards
make sure that's uppercase and we'll
just leave his name spike as well we
could throw in spike one just to see
what happens on your end print line and
then go to spike to string and there you
can see it says spike with the id3 as
you can see it automatically kept this
object here and automatically kept
generating ID numbers says wolf order so
that's how we can work with inherited
values now let's take a look at abstract
classes now an abstract class can't be
instantiated and it's made up
instantiated means create an object from
it okay and it's going to be made up of
both abstract as well as non abstract
methods and how you create one now I'm
going to show you what those look like
abstract class that's how you do it
and let's stick on it with what we did
before let's say mammal and let's say
it's going to get a name string just
like before and this is what we call an
abstract field movespeed it's just going
to be a field that does not have a value
assigned to it
so movespeed an abstract method likewise
is only going to define the parameters
it gets which just doesn't get any and
it's going to have return type so
there's no method body to it what you
can do however with this is create
another class and let's call this wolf
and it is going to have a name and a
string and then we can say extends
mammal which gets a name and then inside
of this we can define our movespeed so
movespeed defaults going to be 30 5.0
and then we could do something like
define a function called move and it's
just going to print out the name of the
animal as well as the move speed for
that animal you can see exactly how
that's all structured now what we're
going to be able to do is go back up
inside of main we can get rid of all
this stuff and let's create a wolf type
that is called Fang and go new wolf and
we'll pass in the name then we can say
call the move speed for us and set that
the 36.0 and then if we want to print
out the move information on Fang we can
do that very easily and you can see that
wolf Fang runs 36 miles per hour and
that's basically all you got with a
abstract classes now let's take a look
at traits now a trait is more like a
Java interface in that a class can
extend more than one then for example we
couldn't have we couldn't extend
multiple classes and we couldn't extend
multiple abstract classes so we are
going to be able to extend multiple
traits the only difference is is unlike
Java interfaces traits can provide
concrete methods and fields and how
we're going to create one is we'll say
something like trait flyable and we can
define fly this is a method we could
then come in and also create another
trait let's say we're going to do
something with
the superheroes will say that our
superheroes can fly and maybe they're
bulletproof
will define hit by bullet
what's going to happen if our superhero
gets hit by a bullet and then like I
said we're also going to be able to
define concrete classes which is
different than we can do with Java so we
could do something like calculate the
speed of a bullet after it hits our hero
and it's going to receive a double and
return a string so how is the bullet
going to ricochet or what's going to
happen when the bullet ricochets and
here we'll basically just say that the
bullet is going to ricochet off of the
character and we're going to decrease
the speed of the bullet by 75% just to
keep it nice and simple now we're going
to be able to use these traits to create
another class let's call this superhero
and it's going to have a name which is a
string let's just have it be that and
let's have it extend multiple traits so
it's going to have flyable and if you
want to have any further after that you
have to put width down and then you
would follow this up with all of the
other possible traits that you'd like it
to have we'd then be able to come in and
define what happens or define the fly
method so you could say flies through
the air and then format and then this
name and then we could also define the
hit by bullet function and we could just
say the bullet bounces off of an input
our character's name their format this
name and then up inside of main again we
can create a superhero
so we'll go Val and we'll just create
Superman in this situation new superhero
and we'll pass in Superman because
that's his name and then we could do
some print lines Superman fly what's
going to happen in that situation and
we'll do all these other ones too and
we'll say hit by bullets Superman hit by
bullet and then we can also call the
other function which is going to handle
ricochets and we can pass in twenty five
hundred as the speed of the bullet and
whenever we execute that you can see
Superman flies through the air the
bullet bounces off of Superman and
bullet ricochets at a speed of 1875 feet
per second so there's an example of
traits and how they can be used now
let's take a look at higher-order
functions now functions can be passed
just like any other variable and let's
just give you an example so let's say I
want to do the log 10 function is equal
to well if I want to copy this function
and what it does I just put log 10
that's the function I want to copy and
store and log 10 function however you're
going to need to put this underscore
here after the function to state that
you meant the function and not another
variable or whatever which would cause
an error and then we can just come in
here and go print line log 10 function
like this and then throw a thousand in
there and you're going to see that
whenever we execute that that that is
going to print on our answer there so
nice to know that we can store those
functions now let's do something a
little bit more interesting you're also
going to be able to apply a function to
all items it was a list for example so
let's say 1000 just to keep this simple
10,000 maybe and how you're going to be
able to do that is with a nifty function
called map so we can go log 10 function
like this and then call for each which
is going to print everything out on the
screen for us and you can see that's
exactly what it does prints out the 3
and the 4 which is the log of this
function so that's something interesting
we can do with math another interesting
function is well let's show you another
example of map because I haven't done
much with it
say we want to go 2 3 4 and 5 could also
go map and we can't accept the value of
x which is going to be an integer and
then have it perform certain
calculations on everything in that list
by just going x times let's say 1
multiply everything times 50 for example
we could then go for each and print line
and you can see it went and performed
those calculations on each of the list
items we have there let's take a look at
filter filter is going to allow us to
pass only values that meet a certain
condition so we'll just create that guy
and
go filter and let's say that we want to
only get even numbers so we can just put
an underscore there for every item in
that list and divisible by two and see
if that equals zero and then for each
again and print line and you're going to
see that it only prints out the even
numbers from those lists that's some
cool stuff we can do with maps as well
as filter now let's cover how we can
pass different functions to different
functions or different functions into a
function so let's go times three and
what this guy is going to do is it's
going to receive an integer named num
and it's going to return whatever that
is times three and then let's get
another one and let's have this one just
B times four instead and it's going to
return four times whatever
okay so just define two functions we're
going to pass into a function now we can
define another function and it's point
is that it's going to receive a function
and how we define that we're going to be
receiving a function and you don't have
to type in func that's just the name I'm
giving to the function passed in well
make sure you put parentheses around
this and then your put integer just
going to receive an integer and it's
going to return a double that's what
that function is going to do and this
function being malt it's or multiply it
is also going to receive a number so
it's going to receive a function right
here that's going to receive an integer
and return a double and it's also going
to receive another integer well now what
we can do is take any function that's
passed inside of it and perform
different calculations based off of
whatever was passed into it and then on
top of that we could come in let's say
we 103 times 100 is equal to and let's
have this view one decimal place and
throw a newline inside of there outside
of this we could go malt it and then we
can pass in the times three function
that we want to perform for us and you
can see if we execute this we're going
to get three times that and if we change
this to four you're going to see that
just that easily we're going to be able
to just pass in any function we want and
perform different calculations in that
situation a closure is going to be a
function that depends on a variable
declared outside of that function and
it's very simple let's just go Val and
divisor value is equal to five and then
we could go Val divisor five is equal to
and here we go numb so you're going to
be receiving a double and then it's
going to take Nome and divide it by the
divisor value that was created outside
of it all on one line pretty useful and
we can say print line and then do five
divided by five I don't know not
terribly interesting there but whatever
and then we could say divisor value and
pass in 5.0 oops got a little bit of an
error there this needs to be changed to
a divisor five of course typed in
divisor value and there you can see how
that works out
okay so there's an example of a closure
pretty simple just basically this is
going to pend on a value that is stored
outside of it and there's an example of
how we can use that why don't we also
talk about file IO now if we want to
write to a file first off we're going to
need to get this guy right here and this
guy right here if we want to be able to
read and write from files and to write
to a file let's just create writer is
equal to print writer and then you're
going to provide whatever you want the
name of the file to be I'm just going to
call this test text and then I can call
writer and write and it'll write out
whatever I want at the right to it so I
could say something like just some
random text and throw in a newline
inside of there and then say some more
random text just anything close at all
and then after we write to it we of
course when we're done with it we want
to say close and that will close that
connection with our file if we want to
read from it we say Val and text from
file is equal to and this is where we
use source and specifically from file
and you're going to pass inside here
file you want to read from and then
you're going to pass in utf-8 and then
you're going to go in and iterate over
all the different lines of text that are
inside of that file so file and we can
say line
Reiter is equal to text from file that
guy right there get lines is going to
get me all those lines I want to iterate
through and I can say for line like this
line iterator and then quite simply just
say print line line like that and then
after we get all that done we want to
text from file like this and then close
that connection to that file and if we
do that you can see that if we execute
whoops little bug slipped in there I
have to make sure we put new inside of
there execute and there you can see it
printed out all that so that's how we
write as well as read from files now
let's take a look at exception handling
all right so let's just keep this really
simple let's say we wanted to handle a
division by zero error how exactly would
we do that so we'll say divide nums and
this is going to receive a number which
is going to be an integer and num2 which
is also going to be an integer well if
we wanted to potentially catch an error
we're going to say try and then inside
of it we could say num 1 divided by num2
we know that potentially num 2 could be
a zero and that could cause all kinds of
problems so we're going to say catch and
then inside of it we can say case e^x
and we we're going to say Java dot
language dot arithmetic and you can look
up all these different exceptions that
are available to you exception and then
we need to define what we want to print
out we can say something like can't
divide by 0 and then after we have all
of that done we could do a finally block
and inside of here we can do some
cleanup after exception whatever you
wanted to do inside of there and this is
going to protect us if we would come in
here and say print line and exception is
just going to keep our whole entire
program from completely collapsing if an
error should occur in this situation
we'll just go divide nomes and then
we'll pass in 3 and 0 and if we execute
you're going to see there is our error
message we print it out so there you go
guys there is a heck of a lot of
information about Scala hopefully I
answered a lot of your questions and
this will move you very
very quickly onwards to learning the
rest of the language and as always
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
