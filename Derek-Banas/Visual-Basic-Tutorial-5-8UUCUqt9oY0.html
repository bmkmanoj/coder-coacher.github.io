5 of my visual basic tutorial series and
this part of the tutorial series I'm
going to cover a whole bunch of
different things I missed previously I
talked about shared property shared
methods saving files opening files
message box Open File dialog save file
dialog and the font dialog with a whole
bunch other different things like always
all the code is available along with a
transcript in the description underneath
this video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it all right just like
previously I have a basic form here with
a text box inside of it with multi-line
scroll bars turned on and then I have a
button down here this is set to 18 font
if you wanted to know and this is also
set to 18 and this is called button
update and I'm going to double click on
that and here we'll we'll be able to go
in and add in different things that are
going to occur whenever the update
button is clicked on what I want to do
first though is come over here on the
right side of the screen and right-click
on this guy and come down here to add
and then I'm going to come down here and
click on class here I'm going to talk
about shared properties as well as
shared methods you can see I have class
selected here and I'm just going to call
this animal VB and click on add and
inside of this class file I'm going to
set up some different things alright so
what are we going to do here very first
thing I want to go public and name as
string and this is where I'm going to
save the name for our animals that we
create and sometimes we want to be able
to define properties that have the same
value for every object and these are
called shared properties so for example
let's say we wanted to keep track of the
number of animal objects that are
created how we would do so is we would
go public and then shared and then we
could call this num of animals and as
integer and let's give it a default
starting value of 0 and let's spell
integer correctly all right so whenever
this value changes for one object it's
going to change for every single one of
them and it's very common to have
properties as shared in situations in
which it would not make sense for an
animal for example to
that attributes so since animals can't
by nature count then likewise they would
not be able to keep track of the number
of animals that are created so I'm going
to come in here now and I'm going to
create our constructor and I'm going to
say that it is optional that they pass
in a name and if they do not I'm going
to define the name by default as unknown
if I were ever they do pass it in I'm
going to save that in there and now
since I created a new animal object I
also want to come in and increment or
increase the value of num of animals and
I can do that like that alright and each
time this increases it will increase for
every single object now you are going to
be able to access other shared functions
and shared properties with shared
methods or functions whatever you want
to call them so what we're going to do
here is we are going to create a shared
function so I'm going to go public and
once again you just throw shared inside
of there and this is a function that's
going to return a value and here what
I'm going to have this do is actually
it's going to create animal objects
which is something that's very common to
do so I'm going to say that I want to
make an animal and it is going to be
passed a string let's go and give this a
default let's go optional could do that
like that and then come in here likewise
and define unknown if you'd like to do
that like this and then what this is
going to do is create a new animal
object so we'll go dim we'll call this
new animal as new animal with and then
we will define our name inside of here
dot name is equal to n and then after we
do that we can now return this new
animal that was created so we'll go
animal and save that all right so that's
all we're going to do in animal v-b now
I'm going to jump over into form one dot
b v and play around creating these guys
alright so we're going to first off come
in here and create our text output that
we're going to put inside of our text
box just like we have done before output
and as string and give it a default
value nothing because that's what it
should be and of course we do not want
to forget to come in here and attach
that to the textbox so we'll say a
textbox one dot text is equal to
whatever the final text output is and
now inside of here we can go and create
an object so I'm going to go dim I'm
going to call the object spot as new
animal with and I'm going to define a
name of course it's going to be spot
just as I had to find there and then
I'll show you how to make an animal here
in a moment as well so to do that I
would go dim fluffy is equal to and this
allows you to access that shared method
or shared function so I'll just call
make animal like this and then I will
pass fluffy inside of there so that's
going to work just as well and that's
very common to have classes generate
objects exactly as we had done right
there so now we can come in and access
to the shared property that they both
have so we'll go to text output to
output this information on the screen
and here we'll say something like gnome
of animals and then to access that
shared property it's going to be the
same for both fluffy as well as spot you
could try them both out if you'd like
and I'm going to go numb of animals and
that's going to be able to access that I
go and and I'll throw in a new line and
if we run that and click on update
you're going to see that nom of animals
comes back s2 and that's going to be the
same for every single one of those so
they're shared properties as well as
shared methods and now I'm going to show
you how to go and save text to a file
now if you want to work with text files
or saving files in general you're going
to have to come in here and import some
modules here so I'm going to go import
system and I'm also going to go imports
system IO for input/output jump down
inside of here now what I'm going to do
is create a string array with some lines
of text that I want to write to my file
so I'm going to go dim and lines as
string is equal to
and then I'm going to throw in some
information so I'm going to say this is
some random text and then I'll throw in
another one saved to a file like that
and I'm going to write those lines of
text to a file now the very first thing
I need to do is targets where I want
this to go and I want this to go into my
My Documents path so I'm going to say my
doc path as string is equal to and then
how we do that is we go environment get
folder path and then once again we will
go environment and special folder and
then my documents and you can target any
of those other different files that come
in right there and now what I need to do
is write the strings to the file and to
do that you use using and what using
does is acquires the system resource
called stream writer that's going to
allow us to write to the file so I'm
going to call this output file as new
stream writer pass inside here my
document path and and I'm going to say
convert and to string and then inside of
here I'm going to reference the file
that I want to save this to so that's
going to be a file called random text
now inside of here I can just cycle
through each of these lines of text up
here and save them to the file so I'm
going to just go for each line as string
in lines and then to actually write the
file you go output file and then write
line and then each individual line of
text as many as you have and if you do
that that is going to save to those
files and we'll get into actually
proving that that works but what I want
to do here first is show you also how to
append which means to add on to the end
of a file and to do that I'm going to
use the exactly the same file I'm going
to use using here again and I'm going to
go output file as new stream writer just
like we use previously again just like
we did before I'm going to go my dock
path and and then reference the actual
file that we want to write to so to
string once again this is going to be
random
or random text this guy right here will
just copy it paste that inside of there
and then I'll throw a true inside of
here
meaning that I want to append this come
over here and go and using and then to
actually output file I'm going to go
output file dot write line and then I'll
say here is more info and now to prove
that all of that actually did something
I'm going to read text out of a file
pretty easy to do as well here however
you might get an error so we're going to
use a try block and here instead we are
going to use stream reader to read
information from a file that we define
so I'm going to go as new stream reader
once again we're going to do the same
thing my dock path and convert to string
once again we're going to go and target
the random text file to prove that we
actually pulled information out of that
guy and you have to surround that with
double quotes like that and then I'm
going to create the line of text or
where I'm going to hold each individual
line of text that's pulled from that and
then I'm going to cycle through and read
the from the stream and save that to a
string and then likewise we'll save that
to the text box so we'll go line is
equal to SR and here I'm going to say
read to end which means I want to read
the entire file and save it there as a
string and then if I do that I can just
go and throw that in my text output and
that's going to be the line and then
after that of course we're going to be
able to throw in a new line down inside
of here if an exception is raised we can
go and throw a message box that's going
to say something about this being wrong
so we'll go show and we'll say something
like I couldn't read file just to keep
it simple and error just to keep it
simpler and now we can run this and see
that it worked all right so let's run
this guy come over inside of here and
click on update and you can say not only
did it write that information to the
file it also appended this additional
information and then early also was able
to
that information from the file and
display it in the text box all right so
there we go that is how to write
information append information and then
read information and files using Visual
Basic now I want to jump over and talk
more about what we can do with message
boxes now message boxes can be a lot
more complicated than just displaying a
simple message with a little title there
are multiple different icons you're
going to be able to use there's
asterisks error exclamation hand
information question stop warning and
none and also there are multiple
different buttons we can use you can see
all of those right there and you're also
going to be able to set the default
highlighted button just by passing in
button one button two or button three so
I'm going to go and I'm going to create
a pretty complicated message box and
you're also of course going to be able
to get to the results of whatever button
they clicked on so there's a whole bunch
of things I haven't covered yet now to
get the button they clicked on you're
going to have to go if and then put in
message box like that and we will then
call for Show of course just like always
you're going to have a message so I'm
just going to call this message to show
and just like previously you're going to
have a title in the top of the message
box and then you're going to be able to
define the buttons that are going to be
used so I'm going to go message box and
then buttons and I can pull from that
list that I just showed you on the
screen let's use something a little bit
more complicated let's use abort retry
or ignore let's then define the icon we
want to use so I'm going to go message
box icon and I'm going to say that I'm
going to use the exclamation mark and
then let's also define the default
button that's going to be selected so
let's go and select that guy and here
I'm going to say that that's going to be
button one and that's going to closed
off and then I'm going to go and check
what the button was that they clicked on
so to do that you're going to say equals
two and then here to figure this out I'm
going to go system windows forms dialog
result and then abort and if that is
going to match up then in that situation
I'm just going to output whatever they
click
on the screen so we'll go text output of
course you could do pretty much anything
you'd like but we'll just say abort was
clicked and then throw in a new line and
then to keep this rather simple I'm just
going to say else and then else if they
click on anything else I'm going to go
text output and I'll just say something
else was clicked or whatever you'd like
and then throw in the new line all right
that's all we need to do and we can run
that to test that it worked and there it
is here we'll hit update and there you
can see message or so there is the
exclamation mark there is the title and
if I click on abort you're going to see
that abort was clicked shows up over
here in the text box all right so
there's message boxes now let's take a
look at how we can open an open file
dialog box now I showed you previously
how to go and open up a file but it's a
lot classier if you use an Open File
dialog to you know to get the file name
that they want so what we're going to do
here is go open file dialog and I'm
going to call this e X as and then new
Open File dialog and then we will define
some parameters for this first I'm going
to say the type of files that I want to
look for so I'm going to say that I want
text documents to show up inside of here
so we'll say txt like that and then you
need to put or and then star txt or I
also want to show all of the other files
that are showing up so we'll go files
and then we'll just put a star dot star
and then we'll go or and star dot star
and close that off another thing we
could do is go filter index and this is
going to select which of these we're
going to use by default I want to use
all files by default so in that
situation I'm going to put two right
there and also you can go and put a
title inside of there and there's other
things you can do but these are the most
common things you're going to do so I'm
just going to leave it at this open
important file and now we have to come
in here and figure out what file they
clicked on so we'll be able to open that
file using the techniques that I showed
you earlier so here I'm going to
fine wear the name of the file selected
is going to be stored so I'm just going
to call this file selected as string and
then find out what they got we're going
to go if open file dialog e X show
dialog is equal to and then we're going
to check if they clicked on the ok
buttons will say system windows forms
dialog results dot okay so if they
clicked on the ok button that means they
selected a file and then we're going to
try because there is a potential for an
error here and we're going to see if we
can get the file that was selected and
to do so we're going to go open a file
dialog e X once again and get the file
name that was selected inside of that
dialog box and then in this situation
we're just going to throw that
information on the screen so we'll go to
file selected for your homework you can
go in there and actually try to open up
the file I know you can so here we go
environment and throw in a new line
again just put it on the screen then
down inside of the catch block we can
just go and throw in a message box and
show and we'll go ever getting file just
to keep it simple and then we'll just go
air and I think you got all that right
so let's test it out and see if it works
oops just notice that I forgot to
actually put the file inside of there so
I'm going to go file selected that would
have been silly without that and we'll
save it and we'll run it and we can come
in here and click on update and a open
dialog is going to open up there we can
just find some random thing click on
that and there you can see it got the
file name alright so that guy works as
well and now we're going to take a look
at the save file dialog and it is
actually going to be very very similar
so I'm not going to change that many
things I'm going to come in here and go
file to save give it that name instead
and this is going to be save file dialog
so we'll just change this from open to
save like that jump up here change this
to save file dialog there's going to be
a couple other different options and
save file dialog we're still going to
have the filter inside of it still
have filter index as well as title I
however I'm also don't forget to put the
commas inside of there that'll cause an
error I'm also going to come in and put
the default extension that we want to
use so I'm going to say default
extension and I'm going to have that be
text I'm going to go in and put filename
and have that be file to save which
means might have to get this guy right
here copy that out of there and throw it
up here let's make sure that this all
lines up and let's go and throw in some
nothing inside of the quotes and then
here I'm going to define that if they
try to overwrite a file that already
exists that I want an error to pop up so
that they know that so we'll say true
with that all right so now we'll come
down here and we will actually test to
make sure it works once again we're
going to check that they clicked on the
ok button if they did we're going to
scull save file dialog check out what's
going on here with file dialog let's
also come up here and go dim and then
that's going to be file selected file
selected as string and that error should
go away and it does and then we'll
change this to file saved and then we'll
change this to error saving file and I
think it did everything right let's run
it check it out click on update
there is our save file and we come down
here and I'm going to go random text and
save you can see right here it warns me
that I'm trying to replace it because I
put that true in the overwrite and I'm
going to say yes and it's going to jump
back and give me the filename
okay so cool stuff and the final thing
I'm going to do is show you how to get
information regards to font changes and
font color changes and a whole bunch of
other things now the font dialog is
going to allow the user to select the
font font style size color whether it's
going to have strikeout or underline and
just going to cover the basics here I'm
going to go font dialogue e.x
as new font dialog and then you have to
define if you want the color for the
text to show up inside here which I do
so I'm going to define that so I'm going
to say show color and mark that as true
and that's all I'm going to do for
defining that off
and here I'm going to check what they
selected so I'm going to go font dialog
and this is going to return an array I'm
just going to output the array you could
search through the array get the
information because you know how to work
with arrays so I'll just keep this
simple and here I'm just going to check
once again that they clicked on okay so
I'm going to go a system and windows and
forms and dialog results and then okay
just like we did previously and so if
that comes back as true then I'm going
to output the information so I'll go
text outputs and we can call font dialog
and like I said I'm just going to put
the font information which is actually
an array I'm going to just put it on the
screen here by converting it into a
string and new line and then I'm going
to do the same thing once again with the
color that they selected so throw that
inside of there and to get the color
we're going to go color instead and I
think I got everything in there oh you
have to change this to e^x don't want to
forget that save it and start it and
click update again that's going to open
up the font window there you can see
it's right there I'm going to leave
everything just set as default where I
can change this into purple whatever
click on OK and you're going to see all
of the font information pops back right
there as well as the color for the text
alright so there is a whole bunch of
things that I missed in the previous
parts of the tutorial hope you guys
found that useful and like always please
leave your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
