video tutorial on sabermetrics if you do
not know sabermetrics is an analysis of
baseball statistics to measure player
performance in game percentages and
numerous other different things and in
this tutorial to provide you with all
the tools required to analyze baseball
like a pro for free all in one place
this tutorial is also going to be a
great way for you to play around and
learn more about my SQL as well as a
great addition to my job a tutorial that
I'm working on currently if that doesn't
make any sense to you don't worry about
it let's just get into saving metrics
now the first thing you need to do is
get all of your tools now if you're
going a Mac or a Linux machine chances
are you already have mysql pre-installed
however if you're on a PC in which
nothing useful is ever pre-installed
you're gonna need to go to mysql comm
and you're going to need to download -
well it's free of course click on
products and then click on download - ql
Community Edition then you don't need to
scroll down here and click on Microsoft
Windows then you're probably going to
use one of these auto installers it's
either the first one or the second one
just click on download and install
everything and just remember it's very
important remember the user ID you
create as well as the password well now
that you have your database you need to
go to Sean layman comm and click on
download database and all of the links
that I talked about in this tutorial are
available underneath the video so just
click on that you're able to get all
that as well as all the scripts that I
use in this tutorial
and you want to scroll down here where
you see SQL version right now it's
version five point nine point one and
you're going to want to download this
it's a zipped archive and you want to
close that guy then you're going to need
to load all of your numbers and
statistics into your database so how do
you do that
well you're going to have to open up a
terminal window and then you're gonna
have to type in my SQL 5 - you my SQL
admin but this is going to be whatever
your user ID is followed by - B you have
this little bracket that's pointing to
the left side of the screen and in my
situation I'm gonna go locate the SQL
file say this is the zip that I
downloaded I have to uncompress it and
here it is I'm just going to drag it up
here drop it in there and then I'm going
to be able to load all that information
really easy
it's called layman followed by three
numbers like you see right here dot SQL
that's all your statistics and
going to hit enter and you're gonna have
to type in whatever your overpass where
it is you might have to sit here for a
minute as everything is loaded into your
database before you're able to start
playing around with it so be patient
okay whenever the prompt returns back to
your screen you know that you are ready
to go so we're just going to open up my
school by typing in - ql5 - you whatever
your username is - P and then your
password again there you are you're into
MySQL now I'm gonna get rid of all that
information and I'm going to check to
see if my database that I just loaded is
indeed in here so to do that you just
type in show databases semicolon and
there you can see all the different
databases that are available I of course
have many more than you do and then here
is the lame in five nine one database we
know that everything loaded in there now
if we want to use that database guess
what you type use the name of the
database semicolon oh there you are
database changed now you were using the
database and all the statistics that we
need scroll that back again now
something you're probably going to need
eventually you're going to use something
called a query there's just a question a
query is a question for your database
you say hey database I want this certain
types of information can you please give
it to me well if you ever ask the
database for information that is too
complicated or convoluted or requires
way too many calculations it's going to
in essence lock up what you're going to
need to do in that situation is create a
new shell and you're going to have to
log back into MySQL five again same
things you've been typing in here hey ba
ba ba name of your password log in here
and then what you're going to want to do
is type in show process list put a
semicolon and it is going to show you
all of the different things that are
currently going on inside of mine SQL
there we are cleaned that up now chances
are this is going to be the line that
has your crashed question for MySQL so
you're going to want to kill it and you
kill it by telling mice QL the ID of the
thing you want to kill you just type in
kill Cory and then in this situation I
would type in 55 put a semicolon and it
would kill this guy right here
but in my situation I don't need to do
that and I'm going to quit my SQL or at
least this version of it and you do that
just by typing quit and hitting Enter
I'm going to close that guy and jump
back
here so remember we define that we want
to use our database so what types of
information are in the database well you
can find that out just by typing in show
tables and you can be upper case lower
case whatever you want now you can see
all the different types of statistics
that are available inside of this
database pretty much anything you could
ever imagine it's statistics from 1871
to 2011 so it's pretty much everything
you can imagine and then this part of
the tutorial I'm going to specifically
focus in on a table called salaries
which is just going to have a whole
bunch of information in regards to
salaries for these teams and players
because what I want to do in this part
of the tutorial is show proof that
sabermetrics helped the Oakland
Athletics get one and three wins in a
season while paying less than just about
every other team in the lake so remember
salaries and teams are my tables of data
that I want to pull information from now
if I want to see exactly what is in say
the salaries I just type in describe
followed by salaries Anna :
and it's going to show me that the year
team league player and salary
information is available in the salaries
tables so that's great so now I want to
use that information to be able to pull
in my information to prove that
sabermetrics works so how am I going to
do that well there is a command in my
school called select and it basically
just says that you would like to select
certain types of information that's
stored in the database what types of
information would we like to get access
to we would like to get access to salary
year information because we want to
focus in on 2002 so we're going to type
in s for salary followed by year ID
we're also going to want to get team
names from the salary table so we're
going to type in s dot team ID then
we're going to hit enter to go to the
next line no problem just as long as we
keep everything separated by commas and
then we're going to say that we want to
get the sum the total salaries for each
team well we're going to have to type in
some in that situation and then we're
going to say we want it from the
salaries table and then we specifically
want salary which is this guy right here
put a semicolon but before we do that
let's also say that we want to give it a
nice name we don't want this to show up
as the name for our results because
everything is going to show up as rows
and
columns just like we have up here
instead let's say we want to have this
have a name of sound lorry bulb right of
course so now all that information is
going to show up and this is called an
alias and put another column in there
and we're also going to say that we want
to get the number of wins what wins is
not available in the salary's table
however it is available in the teams
table so we're going to type in TW and
we're going to say that we want to give
that a nice name of wins like that then
we're going to put another column in
there and then I'm going to say that I
want to divide the salary for all the
players on each individual team so I'm
going to type in salary and I want to
divide that by the total wins for that
team I want to give that a nice name of
CP W which is going to be cost per win
hopefully that makes sense well now I
need to tell minus QL where to pull this
information from because I didn't tell
it which specific tables that I want to
pull it from well you do that by typing
in from and then I'm going to type in
salaries and then I'm going to put an S
in here and the reason why I put an S in
here is because I have an S right here
without this s I would have to type in
salaries every single time that's a
little shortcut way for you to keep from
typing and I also want to pull
information from the team's table I'm
going to put a t right there and go to
the next line this is saying select
followed by all the information I want
and then from I'm going to define from
which tables I'd like to pull that
information from and then I have to
define some constraints because what I'm
doing is I am merging these two separate
tables whenever you do that you need to
say that you want certain rules to be
applied you define those rules by typing
in where now remember we just want
information from the year 2002 we don't
worry about anything else
so I'm going to say salary dot here ID
is going to be equal to 2,000 to
constrain my results for and you just
type in and if you want to define some
more rules you want to also make sure
that the teams are the same for both the
data pulled from the salaries table as
well as from the teams table so we're
just going to type in s team ID t team
ID we want those
be equal I know we can go on to the next
line again and then type in and we want
to make sure that the years are the same
for both of the tables as well that's it
and then all that is fine well then what
do we want to do well we want to define
how this information is grouped and it's
going to make a lot of sense to have
everything grouped by team that way we
don't get individual information about
players because we don't care about
players we care about teams if you want
to group things you just type in group
by and in this situation we're going to
type in s dot team ID and that's going
to group everything for our teams I'm
going to hit enter and it will also be
nice if this information was organized
in some manner if you want to organize
something in my school you type in order
by and I want to order everything by the
salary and that's exactly what it's
going to do then I need to define that I
want it to be in descending or from
highest to lowest in salary and then to
finish off this query or this big
question for our database we put a
semicolon and we're going to hit enter
and there you see there are our results
here is the salary part let's scroll up
here so you can see it so what are we
doing here I said I want the year
information well that's where this is
coming from I also want the team well
that's where that's coming from
salary that's where that's from wins and
cost per win and that is all that
information and I pulled it from the
salaries in the team's table where and
there's all our different rules that we
defined I want to group by s team ID
that's this guy right here and I want to
organize everything based off the salary
in descending order you can also see
that here as well in 2002 the New York
Yankees paid 125 million and a whole
bunch of other dollars to get 103 wins
that equaled out to six thousand three
hundred and ten dollars and 67 cents per
win that they paid for and then if you
scroll down you can see here is old
Oakland they also got unearned three
wins but they did it paying only 40
million I know it's a ridiculous amount
of money still but either way they were
able to cut their cost per win to 2281
dollars instead of 6310
even though they got the same exact
number of wins and then you could also
see down here this is the Los Angeles
Dodgers they actually paid considerably
more per win so there is what is
considered proof that sabermetrics wins
I wanted to just keep this somewhat
light I know it's kind of a crazy
tutorial leave any questions or comments
you have below in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to get more into some
of the other statistics play more around
with MySQL if you enjoyed this till next
