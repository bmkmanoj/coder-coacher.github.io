show you exactly how to find out how
good of a website you actually have and
we're going to start off right here at
web site called website greater calm and
what you do is just simply type in your
domain name i'm using the lamont
restaurant as an example I live in
Pittsburgh the Lamont restaurant is an
extremely expensive and extremely fancy
restaurant and they've had a website for
over eight years so you would think they
would do quite well well if you thought
that you'd be wrong want to type in your
info if you want to compare it to
competing websites you can type those in
if you want to receive reports you type
in email and I checked to not send me
updates and then yeah here it is you see
you got a website grade of 65 you should
not be happy with a website that gets
less than an 85 and I'm going to go
through exactly what this tells you
basically this what this number would be
extremely great deal lower if it wasn't
for the fact that this website has been
around for a considerable period of time
first off no blog whoops Dougal likes
blogs so it you most definitely should
have a blog on your website that's big
negative obviously a blog grade
obviously no blog articles there are
only 24 pages indexed my personal
website has only been in existence for
about two months and I have over 500
this number should be considerably
larger readability level this is
horrendous the page does not contain
enough text for amino meaningful
analysis you want this to say person
requires high school education to be
able to understand or something in in
that area that's normally what's listed
here this is a big no-no metadata
talking about titles and descriptions
every single page you have should have a
title and a description of what's on the
webpage
very big no-no that the descriptions
missing altogether and the page title
tells you nothing this should be
keywords this should be keywords on
words headings if you don't know what
hTML is you probably won't understand
this but it's basically a heading as a
way to emphasize important information
such as titles within your content you
must definitely have as many headings as
possible because Google likes hands
there's no headings image summary one
that is also a big no-no on my personal
website I normally get a bad score here
only in reason why is I use half these a
number of images it's not gaudy loaf
usefulness aight interio interior page
analysis 0 pages processed that means
that there aren't this zero keyword
usage across this entire website and
more than likely because we saw up here
the page does not contain enough text
for meaningful analysis this website is
set up using only images and no text
horrendous here's the reason why this
doesn't have a score of about 30 it's
been in existence for seven years Google
likes and all search engines like
websites have been around for a long
time also time to expiration most
websites will penalize you search
engines and directories if this is not
over one year so you want to make sure
to domain name is registered for at
least one year Moz rank this is in
actuality the same as the google PR or
pagerank last crawl date februari 26
right now it is March the 11th that
means that Google does not consider this
site worthy enough to visit on a regular
basis my own personal website again only
in existence for two months is it is
visited by Google at least twice a day
this is also no no inbound links 297
that's pretty good the only reason
though is because it's been around for
forever
yahoo directory able to decide if you
want to be listed in the this is the
paid for yahoo directory gone to the
inexpensive or free yahoo directory by
the way delicious bookmarks delicious is
a website basically when i post your
bookmarks you have access them at all
times there are none listed there that's
a negative twitter not set up for this
website so obviously no twitter grade
RSS feed you even know what that means
you don't either way you should have one
conversion forms this is basically just
referring to the fact that whether a
person that visits your website has any
way of contacting you mainly or is their
form information on it you can see here
the traffic ranking based off of alexa
is 7.9 again it's because they've
existed for forever and because it's a
very popular restaurant so you see
average grade 65 now this is probably
enough information for anybody
definitely it's a very quick way to find
out if your website is any good but
let's run another Twitter this is is my
blog working let's check obviously this
is on a blog so it's not going to work
at all but just for your own information
I'll go over some of this information
for you here okay again feeds are
important robots.txt file extremely
important i did a video on how to set
one up earlier your blog is indexed with
google your blog is indexed with bing
these are positives your blog
application does doesn't support gzip
compression what this basically means is
they send information compressed to web
browsers you should have it set up so
that it does that why speed RSS feed
know these are also feeds page gzip feed
gzip this goes back to this again is the
information compressed know that means
you're gonna have to wait for forever
robot a text file no this talks about
all of the information in regard speed
content ratio that means the amount of
words versus images so forth and so on
you can validate the HTML to see if it's
up to standards about a feed da da da da
da so there's another tool it's my blog
working this one's real dynamite and
what I'm going to do here specifically
is if you go to rank quest com this is
specifically really like links of you
click on app and enter your website
address click spider and what this will
actually do is show you exactly what
search engines see whenever they go to
your website and here you can say if a
search engine goes to this website this
is all they're going to find content on
this page requires a newer version of
adobe this does you absolutely no good
this is really the only valuable content
on the entire website soar in this so
you want to this should be full of text
absolutely overflowing so that's a
dynamite ole now rather than demonstrate
I'm just going to show you time reasons
you can do speed test to see how fast
your website loads this right here will
check your entire website to see if you
have any broken links there's another
HTML validator there's different tools
to that will look and analyze your bro
meta data be they keywords meta tags
descriptions and so forth also text
ratio it'll do an analysis much like the
previous website text versus with your
overall content there are just tons of
really nice little tools available here
at request and on this website load
impact com with a large number of
virtual visitors to see if your website
can stand up to a large number of people
going to it just type in the domain
and run the test and after a
considerable amount of time you can see
here the server held up pretty well hit
it with 10 clients 20 clients 30 clients
40 clients 50 clients and it only went
from taking about two and a half seconds
to load to about 30 seconds so on a
pretty good server and that is most of
the information you need to Nick and
that's pretty much everything right
there that is pretty much every single
way you can tense the website asides
from having good content till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
