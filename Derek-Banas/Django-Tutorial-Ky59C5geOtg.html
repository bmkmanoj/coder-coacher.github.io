django tutorial in this part of the
tutorial i'm going to show you how to
install as well as how to get a django
server up and running and this is going
to be a multi-part tutorial because
there's going to be a lot to cover and
i'm going to cover a lot now if you
don't know what django is it is a Python
based web framework that's going to
allow you to quickly create web
applications without all of the
installation or dependency problems that
you normally will find with other
frameworks some of the positives to it
it is very easy to switch databases it
has a built-in admin interface forms are
very easy to work with it is a fully
functional framework that requires
nothing else however if you would like
additional functionality there are
thousands of additional packages
available to you and it is very scalable
in the description underneath the video
I have step by step how to install
Django in Windows as well as on
Macintosh and now I'm going to show you
how to install it on Windows if you're
on Mac instead just look in the
description and you can click to skip
ahead to the part of the video where I
show that installation so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it alright so
this is Windows 10 that I have here and
of course you're going to need Python so
if you want to check to see if you have
Python hopefully you've been watching my
learn to program series which this is a
continuation of and in that situation
you have Python installed but if you
want to check anyway what you want to do
is you want to open up your command
prompt this guy over here and you want
to type in python with a space dash dash
version and hopefully you'll see Python
3.4 and it's probably best to keep
Python 3.4 specifically on windows
because there are zero problems if you
use 3.4 but you can get 3.5 a chance it
should work as well as well as any other
later versions of Python if however you
do not have Python installed you're
going to want to go to python.org and
forward slash get it forward slash
windows and you're going to want to
click on the x86 MSI installer and
whenever you do that it's going to
install and you're going to click on
next all a bunch of times and agree to a
whole bunch of things and then python
will be installed for you specifically
python will
more than likely be in your main si
directory and it should be in a
directory called Python 3 4 like you see
right here and then what you want to
want to do is there's an option to
automatically have Python added to your
path but sometimes that doesn't take for
some reason so what you want to do is go
over into your little start window and
type in control panel and then click on
control panel whenever you do control
panel is going to open up and you're
gonna want to click on system and
security then after that you're going to
want to click on system then after that
come over to advanced system settings
and click on that this guy is going to
pop up you're going to come down here to
environment variables and click on that
and then you are going to come to your
path right here and click on edit and
whenever you do if it properly installed
to your path when you install python
you're going to see this guy right here
if it did not you're going to want to
come in here and say edit and then put
that option in and then hit OK and save
it and everything should be working fine
now so we're going to close all of that
stuff up and then what you want to do is
you want to install pip so you're just
going to go into your command prompt
again and type in Python - M space pip
install space - uppercase u space pip
right like that and if it doesn't come
up and say that it's already installed
it is going to install it for you and
you will have pip all ready to go after
you have that all set up what we're
going to do is create a Python virtual
environment so we don't have to worry
about changing dependencies that your
system may not want edited so inside of
your command prompt again you're going
to type in pip install virtual
environment just like that and all of
that will be all set up for you now
you're going to want to come in here and
create the virtual environment for your
site in your command prompt and to do
that again you're going to type in
virtual environment with a space and it
normally starts off with env some people
just type in env but I normally type in
env with a space and then whatever I
want my site to be called and just to
keep this simple I typed in site 1 and
then you hit enter and that will be set
up for it now you're going to want to
activate the end
environment in your command prompt and
to do that you're going to want to
change to your env underscore site or
whatever you called it into that
specific directory and then I hit dir
and you're going to see all of these
different guys right here and scripts is
where we're going to be going to next so
you're going to want to change directory
to scripts and then inside of the
scripts directory you're going to type
in activate and hit enter and you're
going to see now we are in a virtual
environment that's what this guy rave
means right here now what we want to do
is go and install django and your
command prompt again and to do so you're
just going to type in pip with a space
install django and everything is going
to set up for you and then you're going
to want to test that it works and to
test that it works you're just going to
type in python and hit enter and then
inside of here whenever these little
dashes pop up you're going to want to
type in import space django and then
django dot get underscore version and
don't forget the parentheses and
whenever you do that you should see 1.1
0.2 or a number higher than that and if
you do that you're going to know that
django has been installed so then you
can just type in quit with two
parentheses just like you see right here
to exit out of the python console now
what we're going to do is to create a
sample site so i'm just going to jump
backwards in our directory so i'm going
to type in CD with two dashes write that
and you're going to type in a django -
admin start project and then whatever
you want your site to be called and if
you come down here you're going to see
sample site has been created right there
we're then going to change into the
sample site directory and if you hit dir
inside of there you're going to see all
this stuff pop up inside of here now
sample site which is going to be another
directory inside of the sample site
directory is going to be where your
project is going to be living manage dot
py is actually going to allow you to
interact with your project we're going
to start the server here in a second
with that and you're going to see
exactly how that works and then if we go
into that sample site directory you're
going to see a couple other additional
files will get more specifically into
these files later on but basically this
guy right here this init is just going
to tell Python that this is a Python
package and settings which is this guy
up here has all the settings for your
Django project URLs py is sort of a
table contents for your project and then
WSGI dot py is going to serve your
project and we'll get into all of these
guys in detail pretty much in the next
tutorial so now all you need to do after
you have all that setup is to start your
server so you're going to want to jump
backwards into the sample site directory
we have right here and specifically
you're looking for manage py and to
start the server you're going to type in
Python manage py and then run server and
if nothing goes wrong don't worry about
any of these migration things and all
that stuff right here we're just
checking to make sure everything is all
set up and if you do so it's going to
tell you the localhost this is localhost
127.0.0.1 that is localhost on every
single computer and then you're just
swimming to want to open up your browser
to this specific address or you could
just type in localhost colon 8080
thousand all right so that is how to set
up a django on windows and in the next
part of the tutorial we'll start
creating web applications but now I'm
going to jump over and show you how to
set up django on a macintosh alright so
if you are on a macintosh chances are
you're going to have numerous different
versions of Python running on side of
this guy so what we are going to do here
is we are going to check our Python
version so you're just going to type in
Python - - version just like before
you're going to see here that I have
Python 2.7 pops up inside of there and
if you have Python 3 installed you're
instead going to type in Python 3 - -
version and if that shows up all
perfectly fun then you don't need to
install python otherwise you're going to
have to jump over to the python site and
install it and you're going to need at
least Python 3.4 or Python 5 now to be
safe I can I know for a fact I can use
Python 3.5 on
I can touch without any problem you can
use three point four or three point five
doesn't really matter but you have to
use one or the other and you're just
going to come over here and click on
download and then you are going to hit
next a whole bunch of times and agree to
all kinds of different things and after
you do that Python will be installed and
you're going to go back into your
terminal and you're going to check if
pip has been installed or not and to do
so you're going to type in pip and
version right like this and you're going
to see that it has been installed in
your all ships should look to see that
it is installed with your Python 3.5
which is what we're going to use in this
situation or three point four depends on
whatever you chose to do if pip is not
installed or you get an error message
what you're going to want to do is
install it and it's very easy to install
you're just going to type in sudo easy
install pip and you're going to hit
enter a whole bunch of times and that's
going to install I can just do this
right here you're going to enter your
password da-da-da-da-da and tada so
there you go pip it has been installed
so let's clear that out now what you're
going to want to do is type in your
terminal to install Django and again
you're gonna get sued Oh pip install and
this is going to be capital D and Django
like this da-da-da-dah is that I don't
worry about any of this stuff because it
says the requirement already has been
satisfied if it hasn't been you're going
to get a completely different message
and it's going to say that Django has
been installed so now what we need to do
is just check that Django has been
installed so remember I'm going to be
using Python 3 so I'm going to type in
Python 3 like this I'm going to say
import and I'm going to import Django
like that and then I'm going to type in
Django get version and you're going to
see that it pops back and everything is
fine alright so you're going to want to
look for a number that's like 1 point 10
or higher ok and to get out of the
interactive console you just type in
quit like that and you know that
everything has been set up properly now
I am going to come in here and create a
sample site so let's
with directory I'm in and there that all
looks perfectly fun so let's say that I
want to install in this specific
directory you're going to have to change
the whatever directory you want to
install to and I want to create a sample
site here so I'm going to go Jango -
admin start project and I'll call this
sample site now I can go LS and you're
now going to see the sample site right
there so I'm going to change into the
sample site type LS you're going to see
manage py you're also going to see the
main directory right here I can change
into my sample site directory and take a
look at everything they have right here
once again I talked about this in the
Windows part of the tutorial but you
didn't see that what this is going to do
is tell Python that this is a Python
package this guy right here is going to
have all the settings for our Django
project we'll get more into that later
on this guy is going to be a sort of
table of contents for a project which
you will see and this guy is going to
sort of our project up for us now what I
want to do is jump backwards into the
previous directory and I want to go in
here and start my server and to do so
I'm just going to type in Python 3
manage py which is that guy right there
and run server and whenever I do I'm
gonna have a whole bunch of things here
don't worry about that everything should
be working fine I'm going to copy this
which is my localhost open up a browser
paste this inside of here and run it and
you can see right there
it worked congratulations on your first
django a powered page okay so that is
how to install on windows as well as on
macintosh and how to get a server up and
running as the tutorial continues of
course we will cover much more than that
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
