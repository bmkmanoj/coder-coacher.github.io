5 the final metaprogramming tutorial
video here I'm going to go over
specifically what we value how we see
ourselves as well again if you did not
watch the previous tutorial you should
definitely watch that otherwise you're
gonna be completely confused like all
the previous tutorials I tell you what
my meta program is for each specific
style I tell you how I make decisions
then I go over all the other different
ways of making decisions remember
there's no really wrong way to make
decision and then I go over the
questions to ask to find out how you
personally make decisions or people that
you're questioning the value style
they're either survival security
affection belonging self-esteem or
achievement I value personal achievement
above all else followed closely by
survival obviously everyone will value
security and survival otherwise you
wouldn't exist or you would have an
insufferable life saying that I still
value achievement because I'm of the
belief that a life simply lived isn't
worth much I don't mean that in a mean
way just a personal opinion not a
judgment remember I'm forcing myself to
be completely honest to you here I'm
telling you exactly how I work whether
it's positive or negative all the other
values are self-explanatory these are
the values that drive a person through
life some people wake up and think today
I'm going to do whatever I need to to
find someone to give me affection others
change their presentation so that they
can feel a stronger sense of self-esteem
or belonging to find this style asked
what do you value most in life or name
the most significant moment in your life
and then apply them to the above and you
come to how people relate to others
meaning either that they are resistant
or compliant I used to be compliant to
orders but now I find myself quite
resistant to them the reason is that at
some point I realized that my beliefs
were just as important as everyone else
on earth and also it's my personal
belief that nobody is superior to anyone
else
on all subjects this is how a resistant
mind works by the way there are no
incorrect styles just people that follow
a certain style because of past life
experiences the compliant person
believes that the person in charge
probably has good advice or they
wouldn't hold a higher position than
themselves
hence it is in their best interest to
follow what the boss says because he or
she is probably right to find the style
just ask how do you think and feel when
you are told to do something by your
boss
and we come to self-esteem meaning
either high or low I've previously
covered a lot about this because
self-esteem is extremely important I
have high self-esteem by self-esteem I
mean how a person values themselves do
we see ourselves as being skillful
intelligent worthwhile and having
abilities that make us feel special and
important self-esteem can be
dramatically affected by whether we
perform an immoral act thankfully I've
been given the opportunity to act as a
moral person throughout my life a person
with a low self-esteem is not aware of
their competencies they don't think
there is anything specifically important
about themselves and if you would like
to change this belief one needs to
diligently search for those abilities
that make them important and if they
build a large enough list they will
reach a point in which their self-esteem
improves this is just how simple it is
to improve self-esteem to find the style
just ask do you see yourself as an
important person if they blow you off or
place a conditional statement in their
response they probably have low
self-esteem they also will have a hard
time looking you in the eye and you have
confidence and skill type being either
low or high I have a high level of
confidence in my overall skill set I
have come to grips with the fact that
unlike many people I'm not very worldly
but instead I'm very good at a few
things most people are aware of a little
about a ton of things here I'm
definitely the opposite but I'm
comfortable with that
remember no style is superior others
will have low confidence in their skills
in much the same way as those who have
low vision of themselves or low
self-esteem these people are unaware of
their special skills they can increase
their confidence by making a list just
as we previously talked about and to
find the style ask if you were to list
those skills you do well would the list
be long or short and you have the
identifying styles meaning either
fainter feelers body i've spirited or
job type people I definitely see myself
as a thinker when you ask someone to
describe themselves they will identify
their style and instantly I would
describe myself as a professional book
report writer just to be quite simple
others may say they help people care for
kids or that they are a mother these are
the feeler types body people will
describe what they look like and talk
about exercise spiritual types will talk
about the power of religion and finally
others will state that they are
secretaries carpenters or bankers to
find the style just simply ask a person
to describe their self to me and you
find out how that person sees themselves
this is really powerful information by
the way then you have integrity style
being either congruent or incongruent we
all want to be good people and have
values and a definition of what it means
to have integrity I have a concurrent
integrity style in that I luckily have
never been pushed to act against my word
or to harm my own personal integrity
others have been forced to act outside
of their own personal beliefs they
struggle staying congruent with these
beliefs and will have other issues in a
life that they are unaware of and also
are unaware that were caused by the fact
that they ignored their own personal
values and beliefs to find out what type
of person you're dealing with ask them
do you have an issue with living up to
your own personal values and you have
time Styles being neither past present
or future I live in the present I made a
personal choice to never get too high on
the good things or too low with the bad
I also keep myself so busy I don't have
much time to remember what happened or
what may occur in the future
others find great comfort and
remembering past experiences they value
history and the lessons learned they
strive to help people make the right
decisions and avoid mistake they are
often also of the feeling persuasion the
future thinkers are always dreaming
about the future and what is coming
their dreams are extremely important in
them and their major motivating factor
they may however have trouble finding
that ideal future if they can't find
times to plan for it today to find the
style ask what do you think most about
the past present or future then we come
to how a person perceives the passage of
time meaning either around or through
themselves I see time is occurring
around me I sort everything in order of
procedures recipes book systems and
being on time others see the past as
behind them and the future in front
they're stuck in the now and may not pay
attention or have trouble with
organization they're comfortable with
randomness creativity and new things to
find the style ask
think an event that occurred in the past
today and in the future now point in the
direction of your future you can do this
right now as you're listening to this if
you point to the side or up you are of
the around style if you point instead
forward you are of the through style
then we come to how people still
memories meaning whether they are either
random or sequenced I can access all of
my memories randomly without a timeline
I just bounce around in my head real
quickly I compare events that occurred
at different times to each other others
move through their memories in a highly
structured manner they may have trouble
accessing memories because they have to
jump back and relive the entire event in
order and then if they jump to the wrong
event repeat the process all over again
to find the style pay attention when you
ask the previous question that I covered
whenever we were talking about the
passage of time if when you ask somebody
this it seems that it takes them a while
to answer and that they don't give you
an instant result they store memories
more than likely sequentially and we
come to how people deal with difficulty
meaning though they remain stable or
unstable I have a stable relationship
with difficulties I know if I think back
on past life events that I've had some
events occur to me that seemed
unbearable especially at the time and
even though they were unbearable I made
it through and now never think of them
at all today for that reason I think
that process will continue in the future
other people live completely in the
moment they are greatly excited by good
things and unstable when approached by a
bad event at best these unstable people
will feel insecure at worse they will
feel depressed throw tantrums or lash
out at others to find the style ass
think about a future distressing
situation or problem what comes to mind
if they talk about how they'll solve the
problem you're dealing with a stable
person if they talk about feelings and
distress they may be unstable then you
come to the guilt style being whether a
person is a rule follower or a rule
bender I follow the rules and have a
strong sense of right and wrong even
when I have nobody watching me I find it
nearly impossible to goof off or avoid
getting work done if taken too far this
style could produce a workaholic or a
hermit that that won't do anything a
rule bender may act without regard to
moral standards they will avoid rules
ethics and obligation at worst a rule
bender may become a sociopath that
creates criminal acts and loses complete
regard for what is right to find the
style asked when you think about
breaking the rules in the past what
thoughts and feeling
did you have once you've realized you
broke the rules if they don't seem to
care then you know you're dealing with a
real bender how people see cause and
effect I think people have a tendency to
simplify cause and effect I believe to
find a solution you must deeply study
that which is immediately known but also
look for the unknown I follow the many
cause style some people think that life
is random and that there is no real
reason why anything happens it just
happens on the other end of the spectrum
you have those who believe there is a
way to quantify all causes and effects
these are the scientist types those with
the responsibility style will have a
difficult time thinking about anything
without inserting themselves into the
formula they will use statements such as
well when I was in school on the other
hand others feel as if they play no role
in society they think that there are odd
powers at work and may give power to
causes that have little to do with the
final effects if those who think they
play no role become more disassociated
they may start to think forces not of
this world control everything they will
grow very superstitious and even develop
obsessive compulsion
finally many other people just distrust
any proof of the existence of cause and
effect they feel that others are
misleading them and should never just
trust that something occurred because of
some other event to find the style ass
when you think about why you have the
job that you do explain that and then
apply to the types above well if you
survive through the entire thing you
know every single thing there is to know
about me or at least stop my brain
process is an information and I hope you
find this tutorial useful if you have
