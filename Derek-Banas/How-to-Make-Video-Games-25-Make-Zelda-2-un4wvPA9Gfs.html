25 of my how to make videogames tutorial
series in this part we're gonna continue
making zelda and i'm gonna completely
set up all the game assets and create
the entire board using all of the
sprites that we made in the previous
tutorial this is gonna be rather tedious
so if you want all of everything that i
create in this tutorial i'll provide a
link so you can download the entire
project and that will be in the
description underneath the video and i
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so the very first thing we're gonna
need to do here of course is open up
unity and click on new and i'm of course
going to change the name to zelda and
this is a 2d project of course click on
this guy here and we're going to go into
unity on my unity folder where i've been
storing everything and everything works
the same on windows as well as on
macintosh of course and i'm gonna click
on new folder and here i'm going to call
this zelda you can see my zelda assets
down here well i actually already have a
zelda folder alright so that works and
so we're gonna select that folder and
i'm gonna click on create project and
unity is gonna open up and then inside
of my assets folder just like I always
do I'm gonna go in here and I'm going to
create a whole bunch of different
folders so I'm gonna have animations and
I am also going to have prefabs and we
are going to have scenes and scripts and
sounds and finally sprites and for our
sprite folder I'm going to open up the
artwork that I went and created it is
called sixteen by sixteen sprites and
it's a ping file and I drag that over
into my sprites folder and I can close
that and then I click on my sprites
folder and you're gonna see everything
right here I have to set up all of these
sprites of course so to do that I'm
going to set my pixels per unit to 16
because everything is sixteen by sixteen
and of course the filter mode is going
to be points since we were working with
pixel art my compression is going to be
high quality my sprite mode is
going to be multiple instead of single
and then I'm gonna click on my sprite
editor I'm gonna click on apply' and
here is the sprite editor well that we
have I'm gonna come up here and click on
slice and I'm gonna come in and go grid
by cell size and of course everything is
sixteen by sixteen just like we covered
previously one thing that really helps
here a lot is to print out the sprite
sheet and then put numbers on it so that
you'll be able to refer to that sheet
and easily pull the sprites on to your
scene that you need and of course I'm
going to click on slice and then click
on apply and there we go and now we can
open this up and take a look at all of
the sprites that we went and created and
that we're transferred over okay so
really really useful next thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna get my main camera
I am NOT going to mess with the
background color right now I'm gonna do
that after I have already set up
everything so so leave that blank for
now I'm gonna change my size however to
eight because that seems to be about the
right size for the pixels that I'm using
and I know that I want this to be about
twenty-five by eighteen and I want my
camera to be focused in the lower
left-hand corner of my screen so I'm
gonna come in here for my position
change that to negative thirteen since I
want it to be twenty five wide and then
the Y really doesn't matter at this
moment I'm gonna be moving that around
I'm gonna set that to well negative five
all right so that's gonna put that into
position and everything else here I can
leave exactly as it is now I'm gonna
create a whole bunch of empties that are
going to hold all of the different types
of sprites and I'm gonna be using inside
of this and I have to think about how I
want them lined up on our screen uh
first I'm going to do is I'm going to
come in here and I'm gonna change this
to Hills and I'm gonna create an empty
for each one of these and then I'm gonna
create sorting layer so they all lay on
top of each other so I'm gonna have
trees and I'm just thinking about all of
the different types of assets and how
they are going to stack on top of each
other that's all that I'm doing right
now
so I'm also gonna have dirt and I'm
going to have a house that you're gonna
be able to walk in to create another
empty
I'm gonna have grass of course whoops I
have to select that change that to grass
and I'm also gonna have stones don't
know how many but I want to be able to
pick up stones and throw them and do
things like that a lot of animation in
this you know this specific game I'm
gonna have my weapons and that's gonna
be weapons that I'm gonna be able to
pick up and then use inside of the game
and I'm also gonna have link of course
and then I'm going to have villains so
I'm sorting everything so that I can
have everything line up and make sense
okay so I got all that set up very first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
get my dirt layer and the sprite that
I'm gonna be working with I have the
picture sitting in front of me it's
labeled and that is ten so that is my
most basic type of dirt so I'm going to
grab that guy the sprite ten and I'm
going to throw it into my dirt area and
then I'm going to position that I want
that positions in the zero zero space
another thing that I want to do here
let's change this to negative hmm I
guess I'll have this be negative 13 and
five again just like I did previously so
let's still check that out so I got
negative 13 and negative five let's see
if I'm thinking in the right way well
that's gonna put it directly in the
center of this screen which I do not
want well actually if I think about it I
probably want link to always be in the
center of the screen so let's just have
him be like that so doing that I can
just change these all to zeros then and
then have this also be zeros and then my
dirt sprite is gonna be zero zero become
and I'm gonna set it up this way because
what I want to do is I want to create a
master game board array and I want to
put inside of it places where link can
travel and then other places where he
cannot travel so it's gonna make a lot
of sense to have that in the zero zero
position and now what I can do is go and
duplicate all of these so I have this is
my my dirt so I'm just gonna call it
dirt and I'm gonna call it dirt ten just
so that I know where in the sprite sheet
it lies so there's
dirt ten and I can go and duplicate that
I'm gonna put basic dirt around the
entire outline of my entire game and how
I'm gonna do that is just change this to
one and you can see that they all lay it
out right next to each other and I can
zoom in here if I want to so what I'm
going to do here is create a whole bunch
of duplicates and lay out the dirt on
the screen exactly like I did here I'll
show you once again so I'll just change
that to two and there you go okay so I
went and drew all the box basically with
that basic dirt and now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna draw more dirt later on
we'll get back into that excitement
later on what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna put my grass down here and then
just sort of work it in from the outside
in because that's what works best for me
alright so and then I will refer to my
spreadsheet and part 15 is the berry
bottom of the grass area so I'm gonna go
and get this and drag it over here and
drop it into the grass I'm gonna call
this grass 15 so grass 15 that's good
and it's in the zero zero position
exactly where I want it and you can see
here it's good to do it this way because
you can see the dirt there and
everything else and it all matches up
and looks good alright now after that
what I want to do is I want to put in
like a little bump so for the grass so I
got to go and refer to my spreadsheet
again and look for the part that is that
little bump and that is going to be
sprite 16 so I'm gonna grab that drop it
inside of there and let's move it over
into the one position you can see that
lays right in there
and then I'm gonna rename this grass 16
alright so there that is
alright and then what I'm gonna do is
make a copy of grass 16 and then I'm
gonna flip it so we got grass 16 here
and I'm gonna duplicate it I'm gonna
move it over one space and then I can
come in here and flip it by clicking on
this little X like that and that's off
by a little bit so let's move it over or
say 1.5 something like that and you can
see there that it lines up really good
and then inside of my array what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna block off the
whole bottom
area so that I don't have to worry about
that so are worried about the fact that
it's at 1.5 instead of in a fixed area
okay so let's do another duplication and
then I'm gonna move this over to two
point five I believe yes and then we'll
flip it again by unchecking this and you
can see that it goes and you know fits
right in there and it looks good so what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna make a
whole bunch more of those grass areas
and block that in in exactly the same
way okay so I have five of these little
bumps right here and you know of course
you could design is however you want I'm
just doing it this way so what I wanna
do now is I want to fill in sort of like
the side of the hill and I have a sprite
for that as well and that is going to be
at 45 so 45 and there it is so I'm gonna
get this guy drag it in here and where
do I want this to be sort of trying to
think to myself actually you know what I
think I'm gonna put I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna select all these guys and I'm
gonna put them instead in the hills part
so let's just grab them and let's put
them in hills instead of grass what I'm
gonna have with grass is going to be the
grass that's specifically directly over
the dirt instead of you know just
referring to everything as grass all
right so forty-fives what I'm gonna do
here now let's first uncheck that and
then let's get forty five and let's drag
it into the hills area and we can change
this into I don't know let's just let's
just call it maybe and you know now I'm
thinking about it yeah let's just leave
it the way it is alright so we could
grass forty five and then I'm gonna
click off of that and I'm gonna position
it up one and there you go you can see
that that lines up pretty good and let's
go and duplicate that and let's take it
up another one there you can see they
all are lining up with each other and
then I wanted to have it sort of turn
out and I'm going to have the hill sort
of go out a little bit and that is going
to be in position
25 I believe and that is this one no
it's not 25 um that is going to be 38 so
that's this one right here so let's grab
38 and drag him into the hills and we'll
just call this grass again 38 and then
we will position it above that so that's
gonna be in a third position and there
you can see it all is going together and
then I need to put 39 next to that
so here's 39 let's go get it dragging
into Hills you can see I'm just
positioning everything here so that's
going to go to talk let's say that is
four up right yes I believe so and then
that's gonna be one in maybe okay and
then I'm gonna have to well then it's
gonna be one down so it's gonna be three
all right and you can see exactly how we
were able to put those in there and
position everything to make it look
pretty good and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to have this guy here go
up so that is going to be 15 that's
gonna be another 15 so let's just get
that and let's duplicate that and then
we can also drag these guys around if we
you know we don't want a nut whoops we
don't know exactly what it is it's
definitely not 400 what happened there
okay let's put this packet to zero
position and then we will drag this over
until it is roughly where I want it
whoops
keep it low keeps going a little bit too
higher all right let's try that again
all right I'm sumed way in here so
that's the reason why I'm having a
couple issues with life all right so we
got that there and no I don't know let's
just go and do like eight I'm like that
no it's not eight let's do ten it's not
ten it's going to be 11 no it's gonna be
10 and then we are going to flip it so
boomp like that and that looks good one
two three four five and then it
transitions directly into that and then
I'm gonna do exactly the same thing with
this guy right here I'm just gonna
duplicate that and then that's was 11
all right so let's move it into the 11
spot
and then it's or it's gonna be a 11 this
way right and then it's going to be one
up and actually let's move it over one
to the 10 spot and flip it and you can
see exactly how that's set up so now I'm
gonna go and position some of these guys
together all right so I got all of those
laid in now what I'm gonna do is go and
I need an edge for this and I believe
that's gonna be 36 looks good once again
just dragging these guys in here
and then we can position them so let's
try like six nope
and we'll do seven and then we can raise
it up into position and now we can start
to make our edges and I'm gonna go and
do that and then I'm gonna go and get
these bumps and put that up inside of
here as well so that we can sort all of
this stuff out okay so we're getting
along here and it's coming together
fairly well and you can see all the
different pieces I'm just doing the same
thing moving things into place but one
thing is sort of causing some issues is
the fact that if I switch back and forth
between the dirt and the hill or the
grass or whatever it is you know
covering each other up so how we're
gonna correct that is look at all that
grass all right so what I'm gonna do
here is I'm gonna go into sorting layer
and I'm gonna create a whole bunch of
sorting layers here so now you have to
think about what is going to be on the
top or actually probably what makes more
sense of what's gonna be on the bottom
so the default is going to be the
default thing by sure and what we're
gonna do here is the very very bottom
thing I think it makes sense for that to
be dirt so we're gonna have dirt be on
the bottom and then we are going to have
our grass be on top of that and then we
are going to have our Hills so we're
going to the hill and then after the
Hills we will have trees and
we will have our house and then we will
have our stone and then we can put in
another layer for our weapons those are
once again gonna be the weapons that
they can pick up and use or that link
can pick up and use and then we will
have or our villains and then last but
not least we will have link himself all
right so we have all those all set up
now what I'm going to do is go into this
is actually labeled crass but it's
actually the hills so I'm just gonna
come in here I'm gonna select every
single one of those and I'm gonna go
sorting layer and I'm gonna put that as
Hill you can see that popped up right
there and then I'm gonna have my dirt
set up and I'm gonna select every single
one of those and then I'll switch it
sorting layer to dirt all right now I
won't have any problems and now what I'm
going to continue doing here is I'm
going to continue putting in my dirt my
hills and then I will see when I get
done with that okay so I have everything
filled in here and now what I'm going to
do is I'm gonna fill in this grass area
that's right here there's nothing and
that's at 25 there it is and let's just
grab it and throw it in right here and
there it is and I can just call that
grass like I did before and it went to
the zero zero mark which is way down
here and the bottom of the screen and I
can just go and move up into position
and it's not showing because I don't
have it set for this sorting layer of
hill there it is right there and then I
can just change this to four and then
we'll just do some more duplications of
that and change this to one and then
continue to do that until we have filled
in all of those grass areas all right so
I got all of my hills and my dirt all
set up now what I want to do is start
spreading some grass around on top of
the dirt area so let's go get rid of all
of this and go into the grass section
and I have those at pixel 20 and 30 I'm
just doing this by eye I'm gonna go and
try this one right here
and just drop it in there you can just
play around this have fun with it and
I'm gonna call this grass also because
I'm feeling creative with that alright
so we got that and let's just figure out
where we want to put it let's say I want
to put it like right here so let's move
it over a little bit and whoops a I'm
gonna change it sorting layer here so
sorting layer to grass and now you can
see it there and I'm gonna move it up a
little bit now let's say I want to put
it like this but I want it to flip it so
I just flipped it now let's do the Y
flip all right so that's good and let's
move it over into position no I'm just
moving in here so that it adds a little
bit of panache to our little design so
here's three and let's try 9 that's not
good so let's try 10 all right man you
can't really see it but you want you
will see it here in a second so you know
what maybe actually let's take it to
none and we'll put another grass next to
it and try that out and my other grass
is gonna be at 30 so we'll get this guy
here and then those are the only two
grasses I need to be able to do all this
work so that's good and we'll get this
and we'll call this grass 30 and maybe I
should have come up with better names
but you know works out for me right here
and especially since I only have two of
them and let's move this up so that I
can see it and then we'll rotate it on
the side so it's do something like
that's not gonna matter let's try Y
actually let's try rotating it all
together
and to rotate it I'm gonna come over
into rotation Z and let's try like a
negative 90 that works and let's move it
up and then let's move it to the right
and then I'm just gonna change this
whoops so let's change the sorting layer
once again to grass you can now see it
and then change this to 10 and then
change this to 3 and it looks pretty
good
alright so and we're gonna add some more
grass but I'm just gonna basically just
duplicate what I have here so I have
grass 20 right there and let's duplicate
that and then let's move it up or to the
left and then let's move it and let's
just change that to 8 and we'll change
this to 4 and that
in there and adds a little bit of
something to it and maybe I should have
put the dirt inside of here first off I
just do that so I'm going to unselect
that select this and then I'm gonna go
and duplicate that and change that to
eight you can see I'm just moving things
around here let's duplicate to that
again change that to 9 and then
duplicate and I'm just gonna throw in
some dirt everywhere where I plan on
having the grass show up which is
basically gonna be from here and it's
gonna circle up around and then sort of
like end up here
so I'm gonna fill in dirt in all those
areas ok so I have some dirt inside of
here and now we're gonna go and get some
more of the grass and duplicate it so 30
and duplicate that and I'm gonna come in
here and I'm gonna get rid of the
rotation on it so let's change it to
that and then let's go and flip it and
then let's move it up into position see
if that looks good let's change this to
8 and then change this to 5 then I'm
gonna select this one right here and do
another or a duplicate of that and let's
move it up again and then move it over
some more and I think you get the point
and I'm gonna go and fill in all of
these different grass areas and of
course as I'm doing this keep everything
7 &amp;amp; 6 individual numbers alright so I
got those all filled in and then 83 I
believe is going to be my fill color
let's see if that works out or not and
I'll just call this grass again grass 83
and sorting layer is going to be grass
and then we'll move this around to see
if we can find it and we'll move it up
in the air and there it is and it looks
like it might be the right color I think
I did that right maybe not maybe I did
we'll find out yes I did so I'm gonna
then fill in all the empty spaces with
this break right here okay so I have the
grass filled in over here you can see it
down there so what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to put in a little bit more
grass I'll just come over here and let's
go grab this guy right here
it's copy or duplicate it whatever and
let's move it over to the other side
and let's move this over here and like I
said just moving stuff around here until
things look kind of nice and I'm gonna
move it let's say right about in this
vicinity here and then let's change out
to 22 and then let's move it downwards
and not what I'm gonna do is just fill
in some grass down on the bottom okay so
I have all of that set up now what I
want to do is I want to fill in some of
these areas with like another random
Hill inside of here just because I don't
know it just sounds like the thing to do
so I'm gonna come in and select that and
do another duplication and let's go and
move it over in this general vicinity
and let's try moving it right about here
or something like that that looks like
that might work out good and then I'm
gonna go and drag in a whole bunch of
hill pieces until I have another hill
here okay so I have all of that set up
here are my little hills in the middle
of nowhere and what I'm gonna do now is
I want to try to make a tree so the
trees are going to be 18 19 28 and 29
for my sprite sheets so that is a teen I
just drag that inside of here whoops you
know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna create
an empty inside of the tree area so
let's go create and let's call this tree
sprite row what I call this here I don't
know tree sprite all right so that works
or actually you know what I can just
call a tree I called this trees okay so
let's call this tree and then we'll drag
this into the trees and then I'll drag
those into the individual part that we
have inside of here those are all 0 it
out so I'll go tree and I'm going to
grab 18 and drag that into there
eighteen and nineteen drag that and
there also and it's 28 and 29 I have all
those so 28 and 29 so there we go
works out good and those are all down
here in the bottom and I'm actually
gonna select all these also and sorting
layer and change them the tree so they
will all show up and there they are and
then I just need to position all of
these so I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get
this guy right here let's have it be
zero zero and then this one I'm gonna
put in the mmm that's gonna be up one
and I don't know the X is going to be
zero and the y is going to be one and
then I'm gonna get to the next part and
this is going to be zero and no no this
will be one and one and there you can
see that went into place and then we'll
change this the X will be zero and the y
will be zero and then I will get the
last one and that is gonna be X 1 and y
0 and there we have our tree and then I
can select all these guys let's just go
and call this tree actually it's not
even gonna matter but I'm gonna call
that tree like that and select that tree
and I'm gonna go and create a prefab for
these trees and then I'll be able to
drag my trees around on the screen so
there's all those guys and then I'll
select my tree all together grab it drop
it in the prefab section and then I can
go and select all this and delete it out
of there and then grab my prefab tree
and drop it inside of there and then I
can find someplace I'd like to put a
tree inside of the game board and let's
just say for the heck of it here
let's I want to do the tree and position
it and you can see it all moves all too
together which is cool all right let's
say I want to put a tree like up here
somewhere so let's grab it and you can
see the trees moving whoops that went
out of control all right let's just make
it like 20 okay I went a little bit too
far let's go and grab a tree and let's
throw it over here somewhere so let's
put it something like in this general
area and we'll go and change that to 20
and then we'll change this 14 and then
we'll also go and get a couple more
trees let's just duplicate this and
we'll move it over a little bit let's
say we want to have a tree in this 15
and then we'll take it up a little bit
pick something like that and change that
to 16 whoops
change that to 16 and then we'll do
another duplication of that tree and we
will change that let's see what
mmm-hmm I'll change it to 14 and see
what that well that's not 13 okay so
there are some trees that Lincoln sort
of walk around and maybe later on we'll
go and add in some more trees but oh you
can see right here how we're filling in
our game boards starting to look a lot
nicer now what I want to do is I want to
go and get some different sprites of
interest for my dirt area so I'm gonna
go since there is stuff here let's say I
want to throw some leaves in here so I'm
gonna go once again now I'm in my dirt
area and I want to go and get my sprite
prefabs and if I want to put the leaves
inside of there that is gonna be sprite
twelve so we'll just go and grab that
and throw it in the dirt section right
there and we'll just call that dirt 12
and then I can grab it and let's just
position it somewhere so we'll go and
position it maybe like over like this
and up a little bit and there you can
see it is showing up now and then I'll
just change this to two and then I'll
change that to two and then I want to
get let's say I want to put some bushes
here so that I can like cut the bushes
down well the bushes are gonna have a
stump after they're cut down and those
are going to be 14 so let's go and get
the
and drag it and sort of like just throw
it inside of here I can't do that
so let's go up here and throw it in the
dirt section so it's 14 drag that there
and change this to dirt 14 let's just
select the whole thing dirt 14 and then
we'll position that next to it so that's
gonna be like over here and then move
this up into position and then I'll get
it in position perfectly right here I'll
change out to three I change that to two
you know let's say I'm gonna have a
couple bushes next to each other like
you know they're set up in the game so
I'll throw a full another one there and
then I'm gonna throw the bushes on top
of it later so duplicate again and
change that to five and then let's go
and get the like an interesting sort of
rock formations seventeen is an
interesting rock formation so once again
back up into the top of the dirt
grab that and then move that into
position when maybe we want to put that
like right in this general vicinity
right here and we'll move this up into
this general area right there and change
that one and change this nine okay let's
change it to eight and maybe also go and
duplicate that and throw that rock up
here a little bit so let's grab it and
then let's drag it over here a little
bit and something like in this general
vicinity so it's gonna be like five and
that's gonna be six and then we have our
flower and the flowers are going to be
in eleven so we'll go and get eleven
once again drag that into there and
whoops I didn't name these differently
so let's change this to dirt
seventeen and then this is going to be
dirt seventeen also and this is going to
be eleven eleven and we'll move that up
into position so that's over there
underneath the green stuff oh I didn't
want to do that and let's get rid of
that altogether it's
leave that back can I make it go back to
where it was yes now it's down there
okay so the 11th one that I want to play
around with so let's move it up into
this area and as you can see I'm just
moving around all of the different parts
just around on my screen here a little
bit just to make everything a little bit
more interesting and I'm gonna continue
doing that here for a little bit until I
have all those positions okay so I have
little points of sprites of interest or
what you have you here
and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go and do a similar thing with our house
so I'm gonna go and grab my house and
you know what I'm gonna rename this
house is just so I can be lazy and then
go create empty and go house inside of
it
I don't I'm not complaining on having
multiple houses but you know in this one
area but whatever okay so I got a house
here and the house parts are gonna be 22
23 24 so that's gonna be 22 there you
are so 22 23 let's open this up a little
bit and so we can see a little bit
better 23 and 24 and let's go and put
this at our zero zero mark again just so
we can have it there you know what I'm
only gonna be working with one house so
you know why don't I just go and we'll
do zero zero but I'm gonna just rather
than make a doll make a prefab of that
I'm just gonna put everything in place
all right so let's just grab this and
get this one as well so house and then I
can go and get all these different
pieces and move them into position so
let's go and put it something like and
there it is there's our first piece of
our house and let's say I'm just going
to line it up inside of this general
vicinity here let's go put it in right
there and something in that ballpark so
let's just change this to 16 and change
this to 9 and then I can grab the next
part and this will be 17 and 9 and then
the next part after that is going to be
18 and 9
drag that there and then we'll go you
know what kind of looks no silly
let's go and now whatever that's
perfectly fine okay so the next row of
the house is gonna be 32 33 34 so 32 and
33 and 34 so just throw that in there
and let's way down there now and I'm
gonna go rename these as well so there's
house 32 and house 33 and house 34 and
I'm gonna do the same thing to position
all those guys and there we go it got my
house inside of there and I'm just gonna
keep one house and then of course make
sure that the sorting layer for this and
we can just select the whole all groups
inside of there and let's go and set
those for house all right so now we got
our house in order all right so what's
the next thing that we want to do here
well the next thing is probably gonna be
we want to fill in all of the empty
third areas and the stones and so forth
okay so I have all of my dirt in here
and I'm just gonna have to basically put
some bushes in my weapons a couple other
different random things I'm going to
also let's say what's this 50 all that
stairs so I'm gonna take these stairs
I'm gonna throw them on the dirt level
cuz I think that is gonna make sense and
why don't I go and give this a better
name let's call this stairs and this
would be like if you're going down in a
dungeon or something like that
and this is in the 21:8 spot I want to
put that so 21 and 8 and there you see
you're gonna see those stairs are right
there hopefully you can see that and
then what I'm going to do is I am going
to go and put a stone over top of it so
the link will be able to go in there see
here stone and stone is at 84 so there's
84 and I'm gonna throw that over top of
it okay so I changed the name to stone
84 for that and I'm gonna put that in
the same position so 21 and 8 okay so
now we have the stone over top of the
stairs and now whenever link picks the
stone up and throws it and breaks it
will
have the stairs underneath there and
what else do I need
oh I need my bushes I forgot that
somehow so I'm gonna have another thing
and I'm gonna have to go create empty
and we'll call this bushes bushes and
then I have to also go and create
another one my bushes are going to be
six right yeah there's bush so let's go
get my bushes and drop that in there
let's just call this bushes bush
six so there's bush and I'm gonna have
to create another sorting layer so I
don't have a bush layer no I do not add
sorting layer and I will call it Bush of
course and then I'm gonna put it like
right above the tree that seems like a
good place so let's go get this and
let's go and change the sorting layer
there to Bush and then we will position
the Bush in all of these different areas
whoops where we already have the stuff
there it is over there bringing the
middle zoom in on it alright so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna find out what this
is right here what that Bush area is
that's three two all right so that's
fine so we will go and get this and then
change it to three and then change it to
and it should have oh I know why I
didn't move into position let's go and
get bushes and change this to zero zero
and there you see now there's a bush
there see oops there's a bush right
where it's supposed to be all right cool
stuff alright so let's go and duplicate
create another bush here duplicate and
then let's move it over one and you can
see I am placing all these bushes into
place okay so all the bushes are in
place now I have to do is put all the
weapons in place so let's go get rid of
this and the grass and the bushings and
then we'll have our weapons so I want to
put like a bomb up here let's put the
boomerang here first and that is sprite
49
there's the boomerang so let's go and
drop it in there in the weapon area and
boom a rang I think that's how you spell
that and we'll put that in position 8:11
and it's right there oops and then I'm
gonna have to go and do sorting layer or
weapon and there it is and I'll zoom in
there in a second and also I'm gonna put
a bomb in there so let's get this guy
right here and drop him right there and
we'll call this bomb and we'll do like
explosions and things like that
it'll be very exciting and actually I'm
very excited about this there should be
a lot of fun and that's gonna be I'm
gonna put that in position like 116
something like that there that is a
maybe put it a little bit higher than
that 17 I don't know and then we got the
bow and arrow and that is like 77 and
belief so let's go drop that there and
change this the bow and sorting layer
weapon of course and let's put that over
in the position of 93 for like up 23 and
let's move it up 4 and there that is
okay and then well after that I'm gonna
get my main camera and I'm gonna change
my color and I want it to be a color
that's gonna make sense so it's 5 5 a 1
5 4 same color green and we could go in
there and lay some trees around the
outside let's play it and you're gonna
see right there is everything and then
what we'll be able to do is put some
trees and you know other things to look
at around the outside of it and we'll
put a link down here and then we'll put
villains in and a whole bunch of other
different things but there you go there
is the entire scene for our Zelda clone
and in the next part of the tutorial I'm
gonna put Zelda in there and start
animating them and doing all kinds of
other cool things so just like always
