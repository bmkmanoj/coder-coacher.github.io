show you how to manipulate a bunch of
documents on an iPad there are a lot of
limitations but between a couple
different applications that I have
tested I've been able to find a number
of different ways you can regulate
documents first off a lot of people
don't know how to get at attachments
from inside of mail on an iPad let me
show you it's real simple the
attachments normally are always at the
very bottom of the email that's one
thing sometimes people forget to look
there but to open them up all you do is
put your hand on the application and a
little handy window pops up that will
allow you to choose which application to
open up that item in and it's going to
use my default right here which is quick
office which by the way I think is the
best overall way to edit spreadsheets
and word processing and so forth on an
iPad but if I hit open in it's going to
pop up every iPad application that I
have that will be able to open that
document so that's how you access
attachments on an iPad let's get out of
there another awesome thing available on
iPad is what is called Dropbox what
Dropbox allows you to do is to have a
folder on any of your desktop computers
drop files into it up to two point to
five gigabytes for free and access them
from any device and you can see over
here you can open up PDF files and
numerous other different types of
devices so it's free so go out and get
Dropbox it's really really really a
handy application and also through the
use of Dropbox you're going to be able
to access a lot of files and on top of
that if you want to open one of your
files on another application on your
iPad come over here click on this little
handy thing right here what I'm borning
up and it shows you all the applications
that will open this item and here I open
it up on what is called good reader good
reader is a great reading application
for different types of file formats
it's only 99 cents so if you want that
go get it it opens up a lot of different
files however it doesn't open up any Sun
Microsystems open document formats but
if you save those as a Microsoft
equivalent type of document it will open
that up so that's good reader and is
definitely a useful tool you can see
everything that I have over here on the
left side of the screen and I want to I
can come over here and it has a built in
browser that will allow me to go to any
website and take any files from said
website and save them to be read
whenever I do not have Wi-Fi or 3G
available to me so that's very useful
and if you want to manage your file as I
have a duplicate file here you just come
over to manage files inside of
GoodReader
select said file and then come down here
and hit delete and it'll delete it so
that's a nice useful tool for moving
things around on your iPad now in
regards to actually editing these files
I looked at just about every single
document editing device on the iPad
guess what pages is the best way I found
to edit items on an iPad I'm gonna
explain to you here in a minute why that
is now again if you want to send
documents from inside of pages you click
on this and you can then send via email
and either a pages format PDF format or
Microsoft Word format and also you could
export those items also as well if you'd
want to do that the one shortcoming of
pages is you can't access Dropbox if you
click up here on the folder you can see
there's nothing available in regards to
documents for me to get access to I
think if this was allowed being Dropbox
inside of pages pages would be the word
processor period and I'm gonna show you
why the other tool that I found to be
the best and I've tested every one of
them it's quick office here's quick
office it again opens up pretty much
everything except for Sun Microsystems
OpenOffice documents but if you save
them in the equivalent Microsoft format
they will
open up and Quickoffice is awesome it
opens up pretty much any of the main
file formats you'd want and it provides
a ton of functionality it's like 14
dollars at the app store and it pretty
much solves almost every single issue
you could ever have on top of that it
allows you to access any files you have
in Dropbox as you can see there and also
in Gmail as you can see there and a
number of other places where you can
store files on the Internet or as they
call it the cloud super fabulous tool
one problem you cannot edit images or
embed images of any type inside of quick
office I'm going to show you a Dropbox
here
and here is a sample file this sample
file has a photo here it does not show
up there's also no way of importing
photos there is tons of different ways
to play around with text but for some
reason they thought nobody would ever
want a photograph in any of their
documents so pretty much quick office if
you don't need photographs is the way to
go on the iPad in regards to editing
documents like I said it opens up tons
and tons of different things and
whenever it comes to doing basic
presentations keynote is the best
without a doubt the only thing I would
say that's wrong with keynote is it will
mess up the bullet points here were nice
little bullet points and also what's
really funny about keynote is it's
always better to save a keynote
presentation on a Mac in PowerPoint
format because for some reason keynote
presentations saved on a Mac do you know
how to open up well on a iPad so explain
that to me I can't figure that one out
basically I think you should use Dropbox
for storage as well as Gmail when you
why not free GoodReader is a dynamite
reader on the iPad the best
general-purpose if you want the ability
to process Excel files as well as word
processing and so forth but not
powerpoints or any presentation software
Quickoffice is the way to go and then
aside from the shortcoming in regards to
not being able to save to the cloud
pages in keynote are dynamite and the
only negative I would say in regards to
numbers and the reason why I don't know
is it warm I allow you to export in
Microsoft Excel format so that's pretty
much everything I got in regards to
editing documents on iPad with all the
best apps available till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
