2 of my escape video tutorial today I'm
going to be reviewing a lot of common
questions and providing answers to said
questions so this tutorials going to be
all over the place going to do things
like explain what all these dialog boxes
over here do I'm going to show you how
to create your own keyboard shortcuts
and a whole bunch of other random things
so let's just dive into it now of course
if you are opening up Inkscape you are
not seeing these dialog boxes over here
so of course you're going to have to go
my over here and click on this four
stroke and fill that protects that four
layers and that four align and transform
and if you want to open up all of the
different boxes we're going to have to
go in here view and then find swatches
open that up you're also going to have
to go into object and then go and open
up rows and columns I'm going to
describe it all those things do by the
way this tutorial is going to be a
little bit more relaxed than the last
one because I want to make sure I really
focus in now I think it's very important
to go over once again the basic sort of
things you're going to use all the time
so if I create this rectangle here and I
want to edit it I'm going to click on my
selection tool or s and then I'm going
to be able to of course switch between
skewing or rotation or scaling very
important now if we are in rotation mode
of course if we hold down the control
key and I'm reviewing this multiple
times just to make sure it sticks
anytime we hold down the control key and
do something chances are it's going to
constrain something so in this situation
it's going to constrain rotation to 15
degrees that is what it does if however
we go and use the shift key it's going
to do something neat especially in
rotation mode it's actually going to
rotate this and that's when I hold down
the shift key based off of the opposite
angle so as you can see now it is
rotating that way control undo or
control Z another thing we can do if I
want to change the way that my objects
rotate so I can come in here and move
this center point so I can move it
anywhere let's move it up here now we'll
zoom out and I'm not holding the shift
key and I'm going to rotate it now it's
going to rotate based off of that
changed Center or rotation point which
is right there another thing to pay
attention to is while you are scaling
there are things called effect options
and they are up here in our top bar and
they are going to affect things whenever
you scale this one for example is going
to lock into position your stroke so
that as you scale your object it will
not change the stroke width that is if
it's turned off now it's currently off
now it's on when it's on as you scale
your object it is going to scale the
stroke I almost never change this
because it most of the time it makes
sense if I want to scale my object and I
like the way the stroke looked
previously I want to keep the stroke
looking the way that it did so normally
I keep all these on and this is also
going to change the angle of let's say
your rectangle which has a curve instead
of coming to a point this is going to
change gradients and this is going to
change patterns which we're going to
talk more about here as the tutorial
continues chances are though these are
going to all be selected at all times of
course if you have multiple different
objects let's just throw a whole bunch
of rectangles all over the place and you
want to select all of them just create a
big box with your selection tool they
are all highlighted now another thing
that's neat is as you have all of these
different objects highlighted if you
want to bounce through them and select
them individually and just hit the tab
key you're going to see that selected
that's selected that's selected and you
can bounce through one by one so it's
kind of a nice little thing to know
about another thing that is really neat
and I'm just going to use the text tool
for this is if you want to rotate your
objects you're going to be able to use a
keyboard shortcut which is going to be
those two symbols right there and if you
want to scale pretty much any number of
different objects on the screen that you
have highlighted you're going to use
these two guys so for example if I
highlight all those and in this
situation I'm going to rotate them using
these keys there you go and if I want to
scale them I can use these skis there
you can say this is going to be scale up
this is going to be scaled down and this
is going to be rotate to the right and
rotate to the left and there you can go
now whenever you are going to be working
with artwork inside of Inkscape you're
mainly going to be working with what are
called scalable vector graphics however
most of the time if you're going to X
words too like Adobe Illustrator for
example you're going to export as a PDF
and chances are if you're going to be
exporting just regular images or raster
images as they are called you're going
to be exporting in the ping format which
is perfectly great and something you
really shouldn't have to mess with now
I'll go in here and explain document
properties which is down here it's
basically this little page with a wrench
in it and we will zoom in here now we
talked about page already here's the
default units I have it set for pixels
and chances are that's what you're going
to do all the time that's going to
affect your rulers as well as if you
click and then create objects here we're
going to define our page sizes if we
wanted portrait or landscape and here
we're going to define if we want our
page border on or off last time I shot
it off and I'm going to leave it off
right now and we come to guides which I
showed you previously basically here
we're going to be able to change the
color of our guide when if we drag it
out and whenever we highlight it so if
you don't like blue or you don't like
red come in here and change that then we
have grids these are a little bit weird
here of course you're also going to be
able to come down and change the color
by default it's a bluish color I changed
it to a cyan just because I like it and
you can do whatever you'd like the thing
that's weird about these is if you want
to use a different grid you can actually
use more than one grid at a time you're
going to have to come in here right now
we're using a rectangular grid which
I'll zoom out here we're going to open
up the grid I don't need this anymore
just by clicking on the number sign so
shift and 3 and your you can see the
grid and you can see that it's I am if
however I want to use the axonometric
grid system think I got that right what
I'm going to have to do is actually
remove this rectangular grids it went
away and I'm going to have to create a
new one but I'm going to have to create
an axonometric grid and then click on
new and there you can see what that
looks like and what that is mainly used
for is 3d which I really don't do much
with 3d inside of Inkscape but maybe you
will and either way if that's what you
want you can do that and I'm just going
to remove it for now and then I'm going
to go back to my regular rectangular
grid and there you go and it all works
out good for me then we have snap
basically the way Snap works is whenever
you have a grid or you have a guide
very often you
have them on the screen because you want
to be able to have objects automatically
line up to them or snap to them and here
you're able to define that color
management scripting I'll worry about at
a later date because it's not something
you commonly need if you want to shut
off your grid you just go shift 3 or
number sign whatever you want to
remember I think number sign is great
because it looks like a grid of course
now in a second here I'm actually going
to come in here and delete or change a
key code and before I do that I'd like
to show you how to find all of the
different key code shortcuts that are
available just go help and keys mouse
reference and if you click on that it's
going to open up all of the shortcuts in
a window in a browser and there you can
see there are all of them you can search
for them and of course the ones that are
most commonly used or in boldface and
quite large I'm going to shut that down
right now and then I'm going to go into
exactly how to create a new shortcut now
you might say why would you ever want to
create a new shortcut well I'll give you
a perfect example let's take this
rectangle for example and let's go and
create a whole bunch of other different
rectangles on top of it now if I want to
send this guy to the back of this
rectangle here I can just come up here
and click on this but it'd be much nicer
if I could just hit a shortcut on my
keyboard only problem with that is this
says page down is how I lower a
selection on the canvas and this says
page up is how I raise an object on my
canvas well I don't have page down and I
don't have page up on my keyboard so
wouldn't it be nice to define those to
something else like for example the f5
or f6 key on my keyboard I'm going to
show you exactly how to do that and to
do that we're basically going to use a
file called default XML and it's going
to be inside of Inkscape and if you are
on a Windows computer it's going to be
located in whatever your Inkscape folder
name is share and then it's going to be
in the keys directory and then default
and everything's the same across every
single operating system so for Windows
this is where you're going to find
default XML if however you are on a Mac
you have to jump through a couple hoops
let's first open up my Applications
folder and there's Inkscape and if I
want to change this I'm going to have to
go and highlight Inkscape and then go
show package contents that is going to
open up this contents folder which I'm
going to open up then I'm going to have
to look for resources which is right
here and then I'm gonna have to look for
keys and that is right there inside of
that folder I am going to find default
XML just like on Windows this is going
to be the file that we need to edit okay
so here is default XML and remember what
I want to do is let's jump over into
Inkscape we're not in any big hurry here
ere's Inkscape again what I want to do
it's going to highlight this is I want
to change this which is going to allow
let me just show you exactly what that
does by the way okay so here is this
rectangle let's make it red just so it
stands out now what I want to do is move
that rectangle below this rectangle like
I said I can click on this button which
is going to lower it and that's what I'm
doing right now and there you can see it
went behind this button right here right
there is going to raise it and there you
can see it went on top so what I want to
do is create a shortcut that is going to
change this from page down which is the
shortcut it's over here on the right
side of the screen to f5 and then change
this from page up to f6 okay hopefully
that makes sense so let's jump back into
default XML and here it is now what I
want to change is page down but first
what I'm going to change is the f5
whatever it's currently bound to so to
do that I'm going to do a search and do
a find on f5 and let's see where it is
and there it is so currently the
shortcut for f5 is set to the tool org
but I already use e so I have no problem
getting rid of that I'm also on top of
that going to change display remember
when it said page down and page up
whenever I put my mouse over top of
those little tool buttons well I want
the display to no longer show f5 for
this of course and instead show it for e
which is what I use all the time anyway
and then so I don't potentially damage
anything
I'm going to come in here and I'm going
to comment this out and this is how we
comment things out by putting this guy
right here at the beginning and then
this guy right here at the end you're
not used to HTML that might not make
sense so there that is now the next
thing I want to do is get rid of the f6
so I'm going to come up here again
search through my document find f6 up
there is f6 and that is set for my
pencil well I definitely don't want to
use that because I use P just like I
showed you previously so I'm going to
take this guy right here and put him
down there and then I'm going to comment
this out again like that and like that
perfect so now I have f5 and f6
available for me to use instead of using
page up and page down so what I'm going
to search for now is page up where is it
I currently cannot find page up or page
down so what else could we use and I'm
acting a little dumb here on purpose
just so I can work through the process
let's try selection lower selection
raise selection and let's do a little
search let's see if we can find
selection and do a find and there we
have zoom selection that's not what I'm
looking for object selection selection
to front and page up there we go
it was underlined so what I want to do
is for selection raise I want to change
that to f6 no big deal just come in here
change this to f6 right like that and
maybe to be a little bit safe let's
comment this line out just in case
something goes crazy I need to come in
and change this later and then I'm going
to do a copy on this line right here
paste that in there and change this to
page up I want it to be f6 okay so that
looks really good now page down I want
to change this again I'm going to
comment this out just to get a copy of
it here for a second and let's comment
this out like that and like that and now
let's change this to f5 file save it and
then let's come into Inkscape and close
it and restart it to see if it works and
after I restart it Inkscape you can see
right here that if I put my mouse over
this you can see f5 shows up now and
here f6 shows up
so that is how you create your own
shortcuts kind of cool but you can also
see here that I lost on my dialogues
when I shut that down so let's open them
back up again layers and a line
transform there they all are I'm going
to shut off the text and then I'm going
to grab all of these guys and throw them
into place also open up layers there's
layers and then let's also go in here
and do view and swatches and object and
rows and columns there they are
drop that right there take the swatches
drop them right there da da da da da and
everything is looking really good okay
I'm just going to leave this little page
here gonna do a little zoom in zoom in
on the actual page on the screen and
there we are and we're ready to go now
of course if we are going to be creating
a whole bunch of rectangles and we want
to group them so that we can move them
around all once all the time I'm just
going to select them and I'm going to go
control group now they were going to
move in unison so if I select one of
them all of them get selected of course
if I want to change that well you can
say say they're scaling together if I
want to ungroup them I'm just going to
go control U and now they are ungrouped
gonna use that all the time and
basically we're going to group objects
to easily move them around to organize
them and of course like you saw there to
edit them all at one time and that
brings us into layers layers are over
here you could remember eyes shift
control l but why I'm just going to open
up the layers panel and let's take a
look at layers and why we would ever use
them basically we're going to use layers
because layer is going to make it easier
for us to organize our objects basically
when I create a layer or I decide you
know what I need a new layer that
happens any time I find myself editing
the same objects together over and over
again I tend to put them on their own
layer I also use layers to make it
easier to select objects that might not
be easy to access if they were on the
same layer just give you sort of an
example here let's say I have this
rectangle right here
and for some reason it
is under this rectangle now if I ever
want to access it I kind of can I mean I
can just hold down the Alt key and click
on it here and click on it there and you
can see that I'm able to get ahold of
this rectangle like that that's
underneath but if I need to access it to
do other things that don't quite work in
that situation that's a situation where
I want these two rectangles to be on
separate layers so normally the reason
why I use layers and most people in
general is whenever we want to be able
to come in and edit objects that aren't
easily selectable like for example let's
say that this guy was right here on the
edge and it wasn't easy to click on or
something like that hopefully that makes
sense
now if you were on a Mac and you just
had trouble doing exactly what I just
did where I held down the option key and
selected this layer back here the reason
for that is because of a weird funky
error and I'm just going to show
everybody how to fix that basically up
here you're going to see x11 you're
going to want to click on that and go to
preferences click on that this little
dialog box is going to open up here and
make sure this is unchecked this is
unchecked these is checked and this is
checked if you do that that problem will
go away and you will now be able to use
the option key exactly how people in
Linux and people on Windows use their
option key so there's another quick
little fix it just sort of popped up
there another thing that's kind of neat
is let's say we have a whole bunch of
rectangles all over the place and I want
to select a couple weird ones in a
strange sort of way so this is basically
what we got and I have my selection key
and let's say I want to come in here and
I want to select this one this one and
this one well that's not exactly
something that's going to be all that
easy to do because there's all these
other rectangles in the way so how can I
get them it's actually quite easy all
you're going to need to do is hold down
your option key and go like this and
this is with the selection tool and draw
this red line and with that I'm going to
be able to select just the objects that
I want so there's a neat little trick
for also going in and selecting objects
it might not be so easy to select
without that tool another thing is if I
have all of these objects selected and
if they are in a group
which of course we hold down control G
to create a group and I decide I want to
come in and just change this one square
not very easy because it's in a group
and it wants to change everything all at
once well if I come in and instead hold
down control and select that's going to
allow me to come in there and select
just that one object just for a second
and I could do something like change the
fill color by clicking down here in the
swatch and boom I was able to do that
but still everything is in a group just
like it was previously so normally if
you're thinking yourself boy I'd really
like to do this it's funny with Inkscape
you're going to find that you go let's
see if control and then clicking allows
me to do that it doesn't okay let me see
if what happens whenever I hold down the
option key and then click it up that
didn't work okay let's see what happens
when I hold down the shift key and click
it chances are if you do that enough
times you're going to find a way to do
exactly whatever you are trying to do
even if it is let's say let's draw a
couple more rectangles there's another
rectangle there's another rectangle
there's another rectangle select
everything here and ungroup it control
you
ungroup so now I have a whole bunch of
rectangles on top of each other and
let's say that I want to come in here
and select them one by one I'm going to
use my f5 key to hide all these
rectangles behind this big rectangle and
there we go now if I want to come in
here and select each one of these guys
even though they are all hidden I can
hold down on my option key and select
them one by one so I'm just holding down
the option key and clicking over and
over again and that's going to allow me
to cycle through even the hidden objects
that are underneath of this object
another thing we can do is if we have a
rectangle or any object let's just
delete that and let's draw an ellipse
instead just so you know that other
objects can do things other than
rectangles if we would want to come in
here and constrain the direction that we
can drag this so let's say we only want
to be able to drag it upwards without
going to the left or the right guess
what you're probably going to use the
ctrl key now you're not going to be able
to go to the left and the right if you
have that control key and you can also
hold it down and go only to the right
and don't have to worry about maybe
bouncing upwards okay
so control key almost always constrains
and allows you to do neat things
constrain wise and keep things lined up
rids we talked about before hold down
the shift and three and there are your
grids rulers talked about in last
tutorial one thing I don't think I did
talk about though is that you can use
diagonals so there's a guide I just drug
that out right off the side there's
another guide let's say I want a
diagonal one on a problem sometimes a
little funky there you go and I can drag
out a diagonal one another thing you can
do with this guide is this is at a 45
degree let's say you don't want the
guide at 45 degrees just double-click on
it come down here
change the angle from 45 which is what
it is by default and change it to some
other degree if you'd prefer to have it
that way and of course if you want to
get rid of your guides you just drag
them up off of the screen and I was
asked about how to change objects into
guides I'll show you that here but
another thing here that I didn't mention
is let's say you have a whole bunch of
guides on your screen and you want them
to delete or hide themselves you can
just hold down shift and the or key and
there they go they disappeared and by or
key I mean it's over on the right hand
side of the screen it's the same key as
the backslash like I said before you can
convert objects into guides as well
now that everything's cleared up let's
go and draw ourselves a rectangle let's
go and duplicate it ctrl D and now let's
go shift G and there you can say we
created guides based off of the object
that was selected on the screen so
something else neat now let's take a
second to take a look at the align tool
and exactly what it does so let's say I
have a whole bunch of rectangles here on
our screen let's draw them in there then
we'll go over to a line and distribute
this is actually pretty useful now what
you're going to want to do here is your
alignment and your distribution is going
to be based off of or be relative to
something so it's either going to be
what you have selected or your drawing
or the page or the smallest object to
the biggest object you're mainly going
to figure this out just by playing
around with it this guy is basically
going to align to the right line to the
left center so forth and so on so let's
go and select all these guys aligned to
the right there we go
let's do a ctrl Z undo this is a
different align to the right side
and there you can see this is normally
what you're going to use this guy
without these yellow dots so you're
going to use this one this one and this
one most of the time line to the left
and there you can see and you can bounce
backwards and forwards and then that is
Center of course you can also of course
align to the top just like you see right
there you can align to the bottom and
then you can do another Center and there
you can see after we hit Center both on
a horizontal and a vertical way that all
the objects are pretty much centered on
our screen and let's go and change the
color and you can see how I'm changing
the color is I have the selection tool
of course I'm clicking on an object
going down here and clicking on a swatch
so that is how all of my different
object colors are changing distribution
is going to do exactly that it's going
to distribute these different objects
that you have selected in a uniform way
unless you click on this which is to
randomize them so let's select them you
can see here's randomize there we go
everything's randomized and if you want
to distribute them to make them an equal
distance apart if we have them in a
horizontal manner say like this they're
going to put them in equal distance
apart on it horizontal way and there you
can see is how that works so if we want
to for the most part if you're
distributing objects and equal distance
apart from each other you're going to be
using this one to make them be an equal
distance apart on a horizontal plane and
you're going to use this one to bake
them an equal distance apart on a
vertical plane and then this is
randomized which I don't think I've ever
used and then this is also allowing you
to distribute text which is another
thing that I almost never use but that's
just a brief explanation of how you
would align and distribute different
objects inside of Inkscape another thing
is kind of neat which is often ignored
is rows and columns
that's this guy over here now it is a
nice way to align different boxes and
there's a whole bunch of other neat
things you can do with it basically what
it's going to do is it's going to
arrange your objects in a 2d table so
best way to explain that is to show you
how it works so let's say you want to do
like a box set up okay so let's just do
rectangle change to selection I'm going
to make my fill color be white so in
this situation I'm just going to go like
this and then I'm going to have my
stroke style b5 for my straw
so there you go there is rectangle and
I'm going to shrink it down in size so
there is that rectangle and then now
that I have this highlighted I'm going
to create a ton of duplicates so I'm
going to go ctrl D okay so I have
basically ten of them now let's jump
back into rows and columns which is what
we were talking about before and what
this is going to allow me to do is take
all of these squares so I'm going to
highlight them just change to 4x4 and
whenever I click on a range it's going
to put them in a nice little format I
could also come in here change the rows
and columns it's going to automatically
change the rows when I change the
columns hit a range again and there you
go and everything is all lined up real
nice on the screen so this is a tool
that's kind of ignored that for some
reason I find myself using all of the
time it's just nice it's a nice way to
create a whole bunch of boxes and if you
don't want any spacing between these
guys let's say we want to change this to
one and change this to one first have to
select them all and hit her age and
there you can see that they all lined up
and they're only one pixel part very
often inside of Inkscape you're going to
find all kinds of tools that maybe
somebody you know might not use but you
might find very very useful and rows and
columns is definitely that type of tool
for me so that's basically all I have
time for today
in the next part of the tutorial what
I'm going to do is just continuing this
sort of laid-back smooth explanation of
different tools and by the end I'm going
to cover every single one of them up
next I'm going to cover a lot about
colors and using swatches and the
dropper tool do a little bit about the
tweak tool which is this guy right up
here and a whole bunch of other
different things please leave your
questions and comments below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
