4 of my visual basic tutorial in this
part of tutorial cover constants
enumeration structures classes objects
inheritance polymorphism overriding
methods array lists and a whole bunch
more of course all the codes available
in the description along with a
transcript of this video and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it alright
so here we are over in Visual Studio and
I have everything set up just like I
have in the previous parts of the
tutorial so I didn't want to waste your
time going over creating these things
again just refer to what we previously
have done and we're going to be working
with four files we have our basic form
designer here we have form 1 which is
going to be the code that's going to be
attached to the update button we're
going to also have two other files
called a animal and cat and I'll show
you how to create those in a second and
now I'm going to jump over and start
writing some codes so I am in the code
window right now on one things I forgot
to cover are constants
now a constant it's just going to be a
variable that is going to be assigned a
value and that value cannot change after
it has been assigned and how we create
constants is exactly like this and
normally constants are in all uppercase
letters so let's say that I wanted to
create Pi inside of here I could do it
just like that alright so there you are
that's how you create constants not much
more to talk about in regards to
constants and now I'm going to jump over
and talk about a raid list so let's come
down inside of this function that is
going or the subroutine that's going to
be executed every time you click on the
update button and basically an array
list is going to make it easy for you to
create resizable arrays so you don't
have to worry about that so let's just
come in here and let's create one and
I'm going to call this customers as new
array list list just like that there you
go you create an array list now you're
going to be able to add items so you can
just say customers and then add and you
can throw anything inside of this array
list but I'm just going to throw in some
customer names generic names and let's
throw in another one let's throw in
Sally Robert
so there we go so we just added those in
there we didn't have to resize the
ArrayList or anything everything's just
going to work now what you're going to
be able to do is let's say you want to
get the number of items you have inside
of your list or your ArrayList and let's
just call this count and of course these
videos are made for pausing so if at any
time I'm going a little bit too fast
just click on that pause button and you
can do whatever you'd like there and to
get that value you just go count and
then I am going to throw in a new line
and let's go into a couple more things
here um it's this is going to be a
resizable ArrayList but sometimes it's
useful to be able to go and find out
what the maximum allocated size is for
your ArrayList at any moment and we get
that with capacity so we'll just change
count into capacity like that now let's
go and do a couple more things with
ArrayList here just so we can see some
interesting output you're also going to
be able to insert an element into a
defined indexed and it's just going to
move all of the other elements in the
ArrayList further down inside of the
ArrayList to make room and to do that we
use insert and here I'm going to say
that I want it to go in the zero mark so
it's going to move everything to the
right and I'll just put Paul called Paul
marks inside of there you're also going
to be able to remove any matching
objects inside of here so go customers
and remove and let's say that sally
roberts is not welcome in our store
anymore there you go now she's out of
our ArrayList we're also going to be
able to come in here and sort items
quite easily so this is going to sort
them alphabetically and we could also
then call for the information to be
reversed so there we are that's reverse
and we're also going to be able to find
out if an ArrayList contains a value
here will just put contains inside of
there and let's look and see if it
contains Bob Smith inside of there and
this is just going to return a value of
true or false if it's in there or not
and how we find that is just go
customers contains and then exactly what
we're looking
or so we'll say Bob Smith if we find out
that Bob Smith is indeed contained
inside of there we could get the index
for Bob Smith so let's change this to
index of Bob Smith and then which change
contains downside here into index of Bob
Smith and of course that's going to
return that information we're also going
to be able to copy an ArrayList into an
array so let's call this array customers
and let's define the size of that and
we'll say as string it's probably better
to make it a little bit bigger but
whatever I'm just going to keep it that
way and then you'd be able to come in
here and say customers and copy two and
then the array you want to copy that
information into and let's go and output
that information just so that you can
see it on the screen and we'll use for
each here so we'll say for each customer
as string in array customers and then
throw in some text output here this is
just going to be customer so let's just
get rid of that all together and then
get rid of this second line right here
and I'll just output the customers on
the screen and then finally if you want
to clear all of the information that is
in the ArrayList you can just go clear
okay let's run that and see what that
looks like and I'm going to click on
start up here and there it is right
there and we click on update and you're
going to see right here count gave us
the total number of values capacity is
the size that was set aside for the
ArrayList like I said before that's
going to constantly change does the
ArrayList contain the word Bob Smith
under the name Bob Smith yes what is the
index for that and you can see here the
list of items inside of our ArrayList so
that's pretty much all you're going to
be doing with ray lists and not want to
talk about enumerations now with
enumerations you're going to be able to
create custom types like for example how
bullying's can only accept values like
true or false you're going to be able to
create enumerations that are or custom
data types that are going to have a
limited number of values so let's say
and I'm outside of our subroutine right
here that's very important so let's say
that I would like to create an
numeration that is going to represent
seasons so I'm going to call this season
as integer and then inside of it I'll
just define our season so I'm going to
say spring is going to be zero and
summer is going to be one and fall of
course is going to be equal to two and
then winter is going to be equal to
three all right so that is how easy it
is to define an enumeration and now
let's jump down inside of the actual
function and you can see I have the text
box right here that's how I'm putting
the text into that text box and let's go
and use in the numeration so basically I
want to define a variable as our new
brand new season type and I'm going to
do it just like I do in anything else so
let's say I want to do current season as
season and let's spell season right so
everything's going to work just as
you've seen in the other parts and let's
go and define that we want this to be
season spring and then we can come in
here and output some information so
we'll say something like it is with
space and then if you want to actually
get the current season from this guy we
can just come in and say current season
and then to string exactly like that and
run it and update and you can see that
it is spring shows up inside of there so
that's a real basic overview of
enumerations you can do a couple other
things with them but just want to cover
the basics and I want to talk about
structures now a structure is going to
be used to store multiple pieces of data
with different data types so we're going
to come in we're going to call this
public and here public means that you
can refer to these variables outside of
the structure so I'm going to make the
structure public and I'm going to define
employee inside of there and then I'm
going to put some information so I'm
going to say public name as string and
public position as string and of course
we can put all kinds of different data
types inside of here so let's go and
throw one inside of here
public salary as
decimal okay there you go you just
created a structure and just to add
something else inside here you're also
going to be able to add a property with
all the information inside of here so
we'll say we'll go to public and we're
going to make this read-only and if you
mark this as read-only this won't allow
the property to be changed so we're
going to go property and let's say we
want to get the full information on any
of these structure types and we're going
to return a string in this situation and
you're going to have to put ends
property inside of there and then put
get and then whatever you want to return
so we'll say return name and and was put
is a and it will throw in the position
for this said employee and we'll say how
much money they make we'll say makes
will say and makes and a dollar sign and
then throw in the salary after that and
a new line so now let's go down inside
of our subroutine and actually make this
work so we're going to create an
employee here and I'm gonna call it Bob
Smith as employee just reference that
structure we can then come in and add in
specific information about Bob Smith so
we'll go name is equal to and of course
it's going to be bulb Smith we then have
to put in Bob Smith's position inside of
there and we'll say that Bob Smith is a
manager and then let's throw in Bob
Smith salary and we'll say it involves
Smith makes $50,000 all right so pretty
good money there Bob alright and then
we're gonna throw in some information
here first I'm going to show you how to
output the information by pulling it
from the what's stored inside its
structure and then I'll show you the
property for the full information it
does exactly the same thing but just
want to do something here a little bit
different so we're gonna go Bob Smith
and we're gonna get Bob's name out of
there and so let's go and get some more
stuff and inside of here we'll say is a
exactly like we previously had done I'll
go and and we'll get Bob Smith's
position and then we'll say and makes
and a dollar sign just like we did
previously and then we'll go throw
another hand inside of there and Bob
Smith again and salary okay so there's
all of that information that we want to
print out of course we had the full info
property that we created so let's go and
use that as well so we'll get a text
output and equal to and here we can just
go Bob Smith and full info and of course
you could have any number of different
functions inside of here and environment
data and our new line okay so there's
two different ways to print out exactly
the same thing we'll run it as long as I
did everything right you can see that
everything is exactly the same alright
so there's a rundown of structures and
now I'd like to talk about
object-oriented programming
now with object-oriented programming
what we're going to do is we are going
to model real world objects by defining
their properties or their attributes
things like height and weight and
favorite food and color of eyes and
things like that all right that's what
I'm talking about when I talk about
properties we're also going to talk
about the methods or capabilities of
said object the ability to run to eat to
fly to do whatever and we define the
properties and methods in a class which
is a blueprint for creating things
called objects pretty simple I mean
that's it everything on earth has
attributes and capabilities and we model
those using properties and methods
inside of classes so let's go and create
a new object I actually created two of
them here for us we have animal and cat
how you do that though is you come over
here and you right click there and you
come down to add and then you come down
to class and you click on that make sure
you have class selected here and then
you come down and type something in like
animal VB all right so I already did
that so I don't need to do it so I'm
going to open up animal VB and then
inside of here I'm going to define all
of the properties and methods for this
animal so we're going to say height is
going to be something that our animal is
going to have and we're just going to do
this exactly like always and here I'm
going to throw in default values we're
also going to come in and we are going
to define weights and again this is
going to be a decimal and I'm going to
throw in a default value also let's say
that we would like to track speed for
our animal we will be able to do so and
we'll throw it a fall value all right
there you go there's some attributes or
properties for our animal objects that
we plan on creating now you can also add
a private property to protect your data
so let's say that I want to protect the
name for my animal and let's say that I
do not want users to be able to enter a
number because that's just bad all right
so we're going to say we want a proper
name for all of our animals so I need to
mark this as read-only and property and
get name is going to allow them to get
access to the value stored inside of my
name that I have right here all right so
why that's a good thing to do make sure
you close this off we're going to say
and property there that is and then we
will go get and inside of this we will
return the name now the reason why you
would have this as read-only is let's
say you don't want to just provide the
name but you want to provide the name
plus specific output every time somebody
calls for that that is the reason why we
would use this now we're also going to
protect our data inside of here so we're
going to create another subroutine and
it's going to be called set name and
this is going to be called every single
time the user decides they want to try
to change the name for our animal
objects and here we're going to check
that the
name that was passed over isn't a number
because we have defined or decided that
we do not want a number to be a valid
name so that's what we're doing we're
protecting our data and that's the
reason why we set it up this way so if
they come in and they is numeric if you
pass a string value inside of there and
it comes back that it can be translated
into a number in that situation it's
going to give us a true value and I'm
going to say I don't want that so if
they do come in here and they send us a
number for the name I am going to not
allow them to assign it to the animal
and I'm going to put an error a message
out here so I'm going to say name can't
contain numbers just really simple now I
could make this a little bit better but
I'm just going to leave it like that and
what we're going to do is else if they
do give us a valid name which is just a
regular old string in that situation
we're going to assign the value they
pass to us to our name for our animal
and that's it so there we are we are
able to protect our data and that's the
reason why we go and mark these
properties as read-only and such now
another thing you have here is whenever
you go and initialize or create a new
object based off the template or the
blueprint that the class is defining we
would call a function called a
constructor and the constructor is going
to be called like I said anytime a user
creates a new object and how you do you
find that guy is you define a subroutine
with a new as the name and let's say
that we want to make it optional that
they pass in a height value that's how
you do that and we will say decimal is
equal to and here we will throw a
default value inside of there and then
likewise we're going to do this for all
of the other additional pieces of
information that could be passed inside
here so optional just means we might not
get it so we'll go wait and we'll leave
zero as a default value there we could
also come in and have speed B inside of
here again we're going to have that be
default and then we will also define the
name
just make this na em as string and we
will define the default name for all of
our animal objects as unknown because we
don't know what so that makes sense now
this is giving me all these red lines
because I haven't closed off this
subroutine
so I'll go and sub exactly like that and
now I'm going to define the height based
off the value that was passed inside of
here again I'm going to find the weights
based off of the same thing and the
speed based off of that and then finally
the name for that guy and the name
passed inside of there now let's create
one more thing here I'm going to create
a function inside of here that is going
to simulate running so I'm going to go
public and I'm going to say that it is
going to be over rideable
by subclasses and we'll get more into
what that means but for now just know
that this function by putting over
rideable inside of there means that it
is going to be able to be overridden
it's going to be able to be changed
later on and I'm going to show you an
example of what I mean by overriding
methods or functions or whatever
so we'll say string like that it's going
to return a string and here we will say
return name and runs and then we'll come
down and say speed and miles per hour
okay so that's what all of that does and
that's all we're going to do with our
animal class at this time and now we'll
jump over into the form and create some
objects alright so we're going to create
an animal object and assign property
values to it so we'll just go dim and
dog as new animal with and throw that
inside of here and then inside of here
will define the weight for our animal
and we'll say seventy seven point five
and we will define our height and let's
make that twenty five point five and we
will define our speed and that's going
to be equal to 30 and there that is okay
so let's come down here and let's
that's the name for our dog and remember
we're going to call set name because
that's going to protect us from entering
a number and then we're going to enter a
number just to cause an error to see
exactly what that does and then Willy it
will output some information on our
screen so text output again and equal to
and here we'll say something like the
dog is named and then if we want to get
that and that property that name
property out of there we just go dog and
call get name which is the name we
created for that guy and you don't have
to put this inside there actually we
give you an error if you do so just
leave that off of there and environment
and newline and likewise let's come in
here and call the run function to see
what that does
and we'll keep this very simple we will
just get a dog and run and that's going
to pass that information here you do
have to put the parentheses in though
let's go and use the constructor as well
so let's go and create a cat inside of
here as new animal and we'll pass in
some information about our cat and we go
30 and you're also going to be able to
pass the name inside of there without
any issues and here we're just going to
have our cap run so through that there
and here we'll change this to cat and
run and the new line and we'll save it
and execute and if we call update you're
going to see it gives me an error
message name can't contain numbers so
that's not going to allow it to change
the dog's name to ten we'll click on OK
and you're going to see that the dog
still remains named as unknown however
and you can see there it's printing out
unknown runs 30 mile per hour but here
we passed in a valid name of fluffy and
you can see that the output likewise is
valid ok so there's an overview of
classes and now I'd like to talk about
inheritance now basically with
inheritance so subclasses are going to
be unable to inherit all of the
properties and methods of the superclass
so a subclass is going to be called cat
and the superclass that we are
inheriting from is called the superclass
and let's go to actually inherit
remember you have to come over here
right click come down here ad and class
and then put a class name inside of
there
name yours cat dot VB I'm gonna open up
cat BB and going inherit away alright so
we are inside of our cat class and to
inherit everything that is in the animal
class all you have to do is go inherits
animal and that's it now you have every
single property and every single method
that was defined in the animal class now
we could create a function for example
to extend this so let's say that not
every animal cleans itself but a cat
does so we could say something like
clean and this is going to return a
string and we can just go a return and
call for get name to get the name of our
cat and even though it's not going to be
defined inside of this class it's
already there because it inherited it
from animal so it cleans itself alright
so there's something we can extend our
in our inherited new brand new cat class
and that's what's useful about
inheritance you're also going to be able
to override a function just by putting
in overrides inside of here and using
the same name so we're going to go
public overrides function run and whoops
get rid of that and if you don't
remember in the animal class the reason
why we are able to override this is
because we put over rideable right there
all right and that's what that means so
we're going to say public overrides
function run as string and here let's
say that we're dealing with a difficult
cat that may not want to run just
because you tell it to so what we're
going to do is generate a random value
so do this like that and it will go
math.floor and we want two values out of
this one either it's going to be one or
two so we'll throw that inside of there
and then we will multiply that times a
random number generator that we have
right here and add one to it and the
last part of the tutorial I explained
exactly how this guy works I'm just
going to keep this simple though then
based off of whether I get a one
are to from this I am going to perform
different actions so I'm going to say
here random value if random value is
equal to one well then I want to return
a string and it's going to be a get name
I want to get the name out of this class
and I'll say that the cat decided not to
be difficult and to run like it was
asked to do so we'll say speed and then
we'll put miles per hour otherwise if it
comes back to the value of two we are
going to return a different response
here we'll say get name and we'll just
say prefers to sleep all right so we're
dealing with a difficult cat instead of
a generic old animal and it does unique
things which is great that's all we're
going to do with that cat class now
let's jump over into form one and have
it do some stuff a rat so we'll just
come down here and we will create a new
cat object and let's call it kitty as
new cat with and we will define some
different things that this cats going to
have inside of it so we will say the
weights of our cats is going to be nine
point five and the height of the cat is
also going to be nine point five and we
will define the speed equal to 30 miles
per hour outside of this we will then go
and set our Kitty's name sets name and
we will pass Kitty inside of there which
is going to be a valid name let's go up
here to our dog by the way and give it a
normal name let's call it spot never met
a dog named spot but that looks good and
we'll throw that inside of there and now
we can go and check out how this is
going to work for us so we'll go equal
to and we'll call the kitty run function
just like we did with the dog and then
we will throw in the new line and see
how that works source run it and update
and you can see here kitty prefers to
sleep comes back as a response we click
on update again and we click on update
again and here you can see
Katie runs 30 miles per hour so it's
just going to go and give us random
values based off of the fact that our
kitty is or our cat is being difficult
all right now another thing comes up all
the time that confuses people is the
term polymorphism now polymorphism can
be used in numerous different ways but a
great way to basically understand it is
that polymorphism is when you can refer
to a subclass as if it was of the
superclass type and still execute all of
the overridden methods so for example we
can say that Kitty is an animal because
it is however it whenever we use it we
want to use the Kitty's version of run
not animal all right so it's very very
useful in practice that polymorphism
works so let me give you an example
polymorphism here now let's come down
here and let's create a function first
outside of our subroutine we have here
so we'll come down here and say function
show info and we'll say the animal as
animal now this function is going to be
able to receive any animal objects as
well as any subclasses of animal so it
can receive animal objects or cat
objects and what it's going to do is
it's going to return all of the
information about set animal so we will
go and get the animal's name and we'll
say ways and then we will go the animal
once again and get its weight and we'll
define that this is pounds that we're
dealing with here and then we'll say and
is bounced down here the animal height
and we'll say inches tall and then we'll
call for the run to occur so once again
the animal and call run on this guy and
that's it all right so that's what it's
going to do it's going to receive either
an animal or a cat object and it's going
to output all that information about
said animal or cat object on the screen
so we'll come down here we'll see it
work let's just grab this guy
right here and let's operate on an
animal as well as a cat object so here
we'll say show info and we will pass a
cat which is actually an animal object
inside of there and have that guy do its
thing and then after that we will come
in here and call showinfo once again
except in this information or in this
situation we are going to pass Kitty in
here which is actually a cat object and
if we run that you're going to see if we
click on update the fluffy weighs 9
pounds 9 inches does it add it off while
he runs and you can see in this
situation that the kitty or cat object
is going to be able to automatically a
call for the different version of run
and in this situation show that kitty
prefers to sleep if we click on update
you're going to see you get a random
value once again all right so there you
go guys that is a ton of information
about visual basic hope you found that
