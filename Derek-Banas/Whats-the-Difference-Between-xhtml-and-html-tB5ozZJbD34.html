talk about the difference between an
XHTML versus traditional HTML the reason
I'm doing that is because somebody that
viewed my HTML tutorial sent me a
comment asking me that question
so I'm gonna cover today if you didn't
see that HTML tutorial you should click
right here and watch it otherwise a lot
of this is not going to make any sense
but this video is going to be a little
bit more technical and normal but I'll
try to keep it light on the jargon just
know that by the end of this article
you'll be able to tell people you know
how to write extensible hypertext markup
language version 1 straight that is w3c
compliant
first up the w3c stands for the World
Wide Web Consortium and this is the
group that basically defines what hTML
is what cascading style sheets are and
how they should be used to say the least
the most current version of HTML is
referred to as XHTML version 1 straight
XHTML is now known as extensible
hypertext markup language because it has
borrowed a lot of formatting in regards
to how XML works and XML is a language
that's used to markup or structure any
type of document with tags just the like
HTML but the major difference between
XML and HTML is that if XML you can
create your own tags instead of being
stuck with the limited quantity found in
traditional HTML if you are feeling a
bit confused don't worry about it I'm
going to go through this whole process
what I'm going to do is actually take
the exact file from a HTML tutorial and
convert it into an XHTML file format
there's not a lot to it though but just
know that if you ever want to check any
of your websites for validity you go to
validator dot w3.org
right here and you could simply type in
a URL upload a file or directly input
the information and it will tell you if
it's validated or not
and another really neat trick that a lot
of people don't know about is if you
paste your HTML into the checker that's
all you do is quick check and it comes
out now this came out successful but if
it comes out unsuccessful and there's
loads of errors what a lot of people
don't know is you can check right here
clean up markup with HTML tidy and it'll
fix most of the errors causes a couple
on its own but it's definitely a useful
tool in helping you create validated
HTML right back to the presentation
basically first off in the the the
opening line of the HTML file that was
created in my tutorial I have
transitional as you see here use
transitional for the most part what your
HTML is almost compliant but not quite
well we're gonna make it 100% compliant
so what you want to do is you want to
replace this line of code with this line
of code you just copy and paste it right
into your HTML code Sid or right there
so that's one major change but it's not
really that and now we're going to go
through these couple of lines of code
here HTML and I'm going to tell you how
they need to be changed from the
previous we want to change the HTML tag
from just saying HTML to being more
descriptive just like this and also
extensible hypertext markup language
does not like styling to take place
within the page itself it prefers that
you have all the styling take place
outside of the actual codes so we're
going to remove this altogether and we
do that this is all going to be
compliant now let's move on to the
description area which is in the header
there's nothing here that needs to be
changed you're gonna find as I go
through this that there are very few
places where we need to make changes
this is all 100% compliant now we're
going to come down here and talk about
some tags basically there's only one
thing that needs to be changed here I'm
going to go through that all of your
tags that are considered inline and what
I mean by that is they are tags that
do not force whenever you get to the
ending tag do not force a new line and
here's some examples of some inline tags
and here's some more examples and what
you need to know in regards to these
inline tags to be compliant with XHTML
you need to just simply surround all of
these tags with a paragraph tag and
that's what a paragraph tag looks like
if you surround all of them even if you
would put a paragraph tag here and a
paragraph tag here all of this would be
perfectly fine and label another thing
you need to know is if you are creating
a block quote you need to put a
paragraph tag after the opening block
float tag and then put a closing
paragraph tag and then all of this will
be compliant on top of that the XHTML
compliant you are not allowed to use
these tags which were previously
available to you Center tag font tag
frames and use straight through on your
line allowed to use any of those and
here is your fixed up code that is a
hundred percent XHTML compliant you can
see here I have surrounded all of my
inline tags with paragraph tags just
like that complying them alright then we
see the center tag remember we looked up
here not allowed to use it anymore so I
have to get rid of that and here's the
strikethrough tag not allowed to use
that get rid of that basically surround
all of your inline tags again with
paragraph opening tags and closing tags
now your compliant now let's move on to
this long line of code basically lists
are the same as they've always been
you don't need to change anything with
that and you won't need to change
anything else except for of what you did
before surround all of your inline tags
with opening paragraph tags and opening
and closing paragraph tags
now let's come down here there is one
change in regards to links previous
tutorial you saw that I used this code
right here to tell the browser what
window it should open up my link when
somebody clicks on it you're no longer
allowed to use this and be XHTML
compliant so just simply not use that
anymore and then everything else here
out of your site compliant
what's needs to be changed in regards to
tables and away the tables function
nothing this is all combined 100% now
we're moving down into the form data
also all of the form data as long as you
have everything capsulated with
paragraph x is a hundred percent
compliant so basically to make an HTML
file into a compliant XHTML file you
just have to enclose all your inline
code with paragraph tags and if you are
going to use a block quote you need to
use paragraph tags around the text
inside of your block quote and don't use
actually show it to you again do not use
the target attribute inside of your
lengths when you're creating your links
also do not use these tags and that's
basically all that you need to know in
regards to making your HTML code XHTML
compliant and to check that everything
is valid remember you can go to the
validator website and if you type in
your code and hit enter and everything
is compliant this is what you're going
to say if you go to my website here is
all of the 100% compliant code all
available to you without my comments
included and I hope this helps you out
if you have any comments below thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
