7 of my android development tutorial for
beginners today I'm gonna show you how
to draw icons using Inkscape and if
you've never used Inkscape before you
can try to follow along otherwise in the
description for this video I have a
massive tutorial on how to use Inkscape
but if we're gonna make applications and
we want them to be customized we're
gonna need a way to draw our components
so let's get into it okay so this is
going to be the toolbar that we're going
to be drawing here and here we have a
little cloud that's gonna represent
whether this is a camera this is video
this is a voice recorder this is going
to be a location and maps and this is
gonna be YouTube so what I'm gonna do
here is I just took a piece of paper and
real quickly I drew those guys out now
what I'm going to do is import an image
and you can see it right here it's a
JPEG called icon scan and I'm just gonna
select that and this guy's gonna open up
I'm gonna hit OK and like I said I'm
using Inkscape that is the tool I'm
using it's free and it's just about as
good as Adobe Illustrator I did a
massive tutorial on it previously to
cover drawing interfaces and drawing
things that we're gonna need for
applications right now I'm scaling it by
holding down the control key and
grabbing the little strollers there or
whatever you want to call them now over
here I have a regular old layer which is
going to hold all of my images I'm gonna
be drawing on and then on top of that I
have my drawing layer which is on top
now since I have that image in there and
I don't want it to move around what I'm
gonna do is click on this and it's gonna
be locked
now I'm gonna jump over into my drawing
layer and to add layers all you gotta do
is go down here and hit add and of
course you're gonna be able to move
layers up and down by pressing on these
little buttons here or delete them all
together another thing I want to do
though first before I lock this is
unlock it come down here and I am going
to change the opacity on this so that
it's not quite so dark here is opacity
and let's take it way down let's take it
down - I don't know 29
there I don't know I'm just playing
around here and that is going to allow
me to better see my strokes as I draw
these little images so come back inside
of here and lock that then I'm gonna go
in my drawing layer and I'm gonna go
down into opacity again and let's take
this down to save 50% that's also going
to aid me in being able to see what I'm
doing here all right so the very first
thing we got here is our little cloud so
I'm gonna zoom in on that by just
clicking on Z and then there it is there
is our cloud let's zoom in again and
there it is I'm gonna come over here to
the bezzie atoll which is right here
click on that so as you can see yes
there was a reason for me to do in
Inkscape tutorial now I'm just going to
draw this so I'm just gonna click and
I'm gonna click and I'm not gonna worry
too much right now about how the paths
look I'm just going to rough them in
here and I'm pretty much going to allow
xscape to define what I am doing
path wise because it's gonna keep the
paths really really nice and yes indeed
I do consider this to be an Android
tutorial even though it's about drawing
because we're gonna have to draw stuff
and there we go
and here is our cloud and to change it
to black we're gonna come down here and
just click on black and then I'm gonna
hold down the shift key and click on the
little X and that's gonna make the
stroke go away from our cloud and right
there that looks pretty good to me well
now I need to draw these things now I
could go in with a Bezier tool and draw
this sort of rain if I wanted to but
what I want to do is try something a
little bit different so bezzie a tool
again that's this guy's shortcut B and
I'm gonna try not to use shortcuts cuz
I'm not a hundred censored if everybody
knows Inkscape but naturally I just use
them so what I'm gonna do is I am just
going to come in here and I'm going to
click and come down here and double
click and that's gonna make a stroke for
me now I'm going to make kind of an easy
way of doing this if you want to get the
fills and strokes to come up you just
press on this guy and then it opens up
fill in stroke if you want to open up
the layers panel go over to layer and
come down here to layers and click on
that that's how you open up those guys
so now I have this stroke and if I want
to increase the size of it go into
stroke style and
just take it up a lot so let's say I
don't know let's try 40 okay that's too
big all right so let's take it down some
let's try 30 and right around 18 point 3
is what I was shooting for then what I'm
gonna do is go in here to the cap
because I want part of it to be rounded
off so I'm gonna click on that and now
you can see that they are both rounded
off at the edges now what I need to do
is actually convert this into an object
to do that and we're gonna pair to path
and say stroke to path right like that
and now if I go over to the node tool
which is this again if you're completely
lost that's because you haven't seen my
Inkscape tutorial go check it out
because you guys have to know how to do
this stuff if you want to make Android
apps okay so now you can see that it's
no longer a stroke because it has these
little dots here and we're going to then
chop off the top and to chop off the top
what I'm gonna do first is drag this
down here a little bit go over here to
the rectangle tool click on that and I'm
going to draw a rectangle over top of it
now to chop the top off of this I'm
going to select both of them go up into
path and then I'm gonna go DIF boink and
now I have exactly what I wanted in a
very nice easy little package if I want
to duplicate this I'm just going to hold
down my mouse button hold down control
and either option or alt if you're a Mac
or you're on Windows or you're on Linux
doesn't matter then I'm gonna hit the
spacebar once and I'm gonna drag it and
I'ma hit spacebar again and drag it and
in another space bar and another space
bar
now I don't need to do that last one so
let's just leave it and there we go
there's our cloud all nicely drawn
inside of there next thing we're gonna
draw is our camera for that I'm gonna
use the rectangle tool right here yeah
I'm just gonna you know come in here and
sort of estimate what we're gonna do
here and as you can see since the top is
has a pasady you're gonna be able to see
the bottom and since the bottom has an
opacity it's not gonna be overbearing
now what I want to do is well I'm gonna
switch back over into my node tool this
right here and since I want it to curve
I'm going to come up here to this guy
and
drag that down and put a little bit of
curve in there deselect off of that go
back into the Bezier tool again hit B
and like I said just estimating this I'm
gonna hold down the ctrl key that's sort
of going to allow me to move in steps
whenever I'm drawing this and hopefully
they will be equal click here and then
double click there and there we go we
have that perfect I'm going to go and
make it black by coming down here click
it on black and then holding down the
shift key and hit next that's for the
stroke and there it is now if I want to
combine these two guys I'm gonna have to
put a big selection around all of them
go back up into path and go Union and
this is how I do it now it's all one big
object I have to get this little cutout
right here like I said I just drew this
very very quickly well we got to get
this one up here for toe so let's do
that first
bezzie a tool again we're gonna come in
if you can't see click hold down the
ctrl key click click click double click
all right come down here yeah well look
there Milo Apple stuff popped up I'm
gonna hold down the shift key X and then
hold down this and now it is what should
be black well I had to have it selected
for sorry about that I'm sorry I'm being
a little bit of a goofball here let's
come down again hold the shift key exit
in this and it worked that time okay so
we're gonna select everything here here
we go in the path and we're gonna do
another Union so there we go now I got
to cut this little part out rectangle
tool again come in here draw that inside
of there and this time I'm gonna make
this white and I don't like that curve
it's too much of a curve so let's come
up here and get rid of some of the curve
there we go
I'm over here no like this select
everything go into path and go
difference and now there is going to be
nothing inside of that then I got to
create this big circle here hold down
the e for the shortcut for ellipse hold
down ctrl and shift and that's going to
make it grow from the middle there's
that big giant thing select everything
again go up into path again and go to
what that's gonna allow is the
background that the psych one's gonna be
on top of we're going to be able to see
the background color cuz that normally
works best ellipse tool again come into
the center here roughly control and
shift draw that inside of there and
let's make it black and then probably
want to do a control G to group
everything so it's all in one piece so
there we go got our camera and we got
our other things you believe I forgot
what I drew first hold on the shift key
to zoom out that's a good thing to do
and let's come over here well I drew my
little rain cloud okay so that's gonna
be the weather okay zoom in again now
we're gonna draw this sort of like
filmstrip that we have here rectangle
tool again come up here I like the nice
little curve on this drop that inside of
there go to the selection tool by
hitting s or by clicking on this little
arrow up here
yeah let's enlarge it a little bit looks
pretty good now I need to draw those
rectangles inside of there so I'm gonna
do that rectangle there it is and let's
make it white there that is know what
I'm gonna do yeah why don't we just go
and draw all of them right now
so again hold down ctrl and either alt
or option and also of course click on
your shape hit the spacebar drag it down
roughly to where it needs to go and drag
it down again and drag it down again and
drag it down again and that looks about
right now we want to have them in equal
space part so we're gonna hold down the
shift key click on all of them
all of them are selected then we want to
get a line and distribute where is that
hidden I believe it's here yes it is
under object right there to make this
little bar or a little menu pop up we
click on a line distribute and this is
gonna show up this guy right here so I
want them an equal distance apart from
each other so I'm going to click on this
and now they should be an equal distance
apart I'm gonna keep this selected hold
down ctrl and alt or option at the same
time hit spacebar drag over here and
there we go now we can draw in and this
is basically trying to look like a
filmstrip
if you're wondering what this is get the
Bezier tool again click up here hold
down the control key click here come up
here and then double-click and there
that is let's make it white now it's
white now we can come in here select
this select the image here go up into
path and difference now there one select
this and then we go into path and
difference select this now there's
shortcut for difference it's ctrl
negative sign select this as well
ctrl negative sign shift select control
negative sign shift select control
negative sign shift control negative
sign a little negative song and control
negative sign control negative sign and
control negative sign and there we go
now we got three icons out of the way
let's look at what's over here now we
got a little microphone sort of thing
again gonna use my rectangle tool and
I'm gonna sort of estimate what this is
gonna look like I shouldn't have made
that flat or white let's get rid of that
go over and make it black instead now I
can see it and get my selection tool all
I'll be able to move it now that's
pretty good and then I'm gonna go back
to my rectangle tool which is going to
allow me to smooth these edges grab that
dragged it down like this and there we
go perfect now for this guy down here I
could draw the whole entire thing but
odds are if I do that one side is gonna
be different from the other so instead
what I'm gonna do is get my Bezier tool
click here hold down the control key
click here and then I'm gonna go down
here to the center of this you could use
guides and if this was a professional
app I would be using guides but I'm not
going to for now and let's go like that
and then it's gonna give me this sort of
weird curve but I'm just doing ignore
that for now click down here hold down
the control key click here click here
click here click here and then I'm going
to come the whole way up here click on
this and I'm zoomed in right now so I'm
gonna get a weird result meaning I'm
zoomed in with
video capturing software that's pretty
good all right so that's looking pretty
good except for this part get the node
tool I'm gonna click right here on this
weird guy just drag it in the whole
entire way and whenever you do it'll go
away and there we go
still have that path and this is
straight so everything's looking good
so now let's hold down the shift key to
get rid of the stroke click on the X now
it's black perfect now what I'm gonna do
ctrl and then alt or option key and then
space make a duplication of it I'm gonna
come over here to object scroll way down
here and go flip horizontal what didn't
make a copy of it now did it it's
compact and do that again so ctrl Z to
undo it control alt option and space
let's see that it made a coffee this
time didn't ru doggone thing so let's
just drag it over here space now it made
a copy and then we got this and we'll go
into object again and we will go into
flip horizontal and there it is and
we'll just drag it out here till the two
inner parts meet while holding down the
control key and we're gonna look right
here we're gonna see there's a little
bit of a space see if it corrects itself
by doing that kind of and then we'll go
in here and select both of these and
then we'll go path and then we will go
Union that's gonna join them together if
you wanted to really be a stickler about
this you could get your node tool over
here click on this guy and then zoom in
and click around here to see if the
nodes are bad you could delete them you
can do whatever but I think they are
pretty doggone good especially because
it's like one it's gonna be shrunk
dramatically down in size so I think
we'll have no problem seeing it hold
down the shift key to zoom out and we'll
see what else we gonna do all right so
we got to do our little map thingy here
and we got to do our YouTube a logo so
there we go
zoom in on this guy now what I'm going
to do is I'm actually gonna use the star
tool that's over here and the shortcut
for that is shift eight or star and I'm
just gonna draw in a triangle it's gonna
be roughly the same way there that is
put it in here roughly select the node
tool by hitting on N and if we go and
move this in it's going to mess that up
so it's hit control Z get rid of that
we're gonna go into path and go object
to path which is going to put those
little
loads on there see now there's little
nodes on there now we can stretch this
one without affecting the other ones
also what I'm going to do is I want to
get rid of this node and this node
because it's going to cause me problems
to get rid of them we go into path and
we go into simplify or simplify there it
is and now you can see that those extra
nodes are no longer there and now what
I'm gonna do is just grab this drag it
down here roughly I'll deal with these
paths here in a second drag that down
there unless you like this look it's
totally up to you like that
and then I'm gonna get rid of it so I'm
just gonna drag in these guys to make
them go away make it go away
get rid of that curve all together get
rid of that curve oh what's like this
get rid of this curve get rid of this
curve and now we're left with this and I
kind of like the curve there on the
edges so I'm gonna leave that there go
into the ellipse tool right here come in
the middle and I'm gonna draw this hold
down shift and control it's gonna draw
it from the center point outwards and
I'm just gonna convert this into a
stroke this time I'm gonna hold down the
shift key and click on black down here
so shift black that affects the stroke
regular X gets rid of it you can see
there's nothing there over here to fill
stroke there we are
there this is we want to add the stroke
just click on this you know we can see
that it's not quite big enough
go into stroke style and I'm gonna be
increasing this guy right here by
clicking on this button and I'm gonna
click on that button until it's about
the right size right there looks just
about the right size I'm gonna put these
little notches inside of here I'm just
gonna do that with a rectangle tool like
this maybe I can get something
interesting going on
that's kind of interesting again come
down here click on or hold down shift
get rid of the stroke then click on that
for the black and now it's a nice little
shape say I want to move it up kind of
interesting select shape hold down
control alt option and space drag it
down here
and just drop it there now I'm gonna do
a copy and paste and a ctrl V alright
got at that time got it over here and
awfully click on it we're gonna be able
to rotate it
hold down the control so it rotates in a
nice way and then we'll just sort of
like move it in here and again we're
gonna select hold with our mouse control
alt option space drag it over here and
let's see what you got looks pretty good
so there's our map now the only thing
left for us to do is the little YouTube
logo that's gonna open up YouTube videos
and I might add other icons here but
this is gonna be a big app we're gonna
be working with now ahead of time I went
I don't have the exact font for YouTube
but I don't think it's gonna be a big
deal because I'm not selling this I did
find that a font called headline a is
kind of similar to it click on text text
font if you didn't see that text and
then text font here I'll show you
text text font that opens up the text
font fine
there is a font called headline a which
is kind of similar so I'm just gonna use
that for now like I said I'm not gonna
sell this or anything you can actually
buy the YouTube font and that looks good
enough for me and we're gonna go y-o-u
kind of big so let's shrink that down
its size a little bit
I map here are the font size and I don't
know let's make it 20 I don't know
that's probably too small it is so we're
gonna select it and hold it down the
control key and enlarge it and go over
here and put it into place so there's
that and I don't know shrink it down a
little bit maybe just trying to fit the
rough guidelines of what I drew with a
pencil in about five minutes but Eve I
drill all these easily in five minutes
okay so there's the U and then if we
want the two tube T ube there that is if
we want it to be the same size select
this select text that's this over here
text and then we're gonna come up the
font size and go 69 0.45 hit enter and
there it is okay so does that look good
looks really close and really close is
good enough then we're gonna get our
rectangle tool we're gonna draw roughly
what this little box here looks like I'm
going to come in here
we make it curve a little bit more just
like this box right here I'm gonna move
it backwards by clicking on the object
up here I'm going to lower to bottom
like that that's gonna put it behind the
tube letters there they are then I need
to take the text that's here go up into
path and call it or convert it from an
object to a path like that select our
node tool let's go and convert those
letters to white so we can see them
better and there you can see right there
and now we need to go path object path
okay they are that way then go and click
on the node tool there they go and then
what I'm gonna do you think I have these
on groups let's see now they're still in
a group so I'm gonna go object up here
and ungroup and now I should be able to
select them individually and I can so
select this and then we're gonna go path
and difference to cut those out and then
select the U part path difference cut
those out
select the B path difference select the
e with the shift key held down path
difference and there we go we can drag
that off of there it doesn't look
exactly like the YouTube logo but
whenever it's less than an inch in size
it's gonna look perfectly fine we have
drawn everything so now we can go into
layers right here and we can click on
the layer 1 right here click on unlock
it selects all the things we are drawing
off of and there are those guys are
click on our drawing layer and increase
the opacity to 100% also come in here to
all of these guys now select them and
make them all the same color so that's
gonna be black somehow these little dots
ended up not being black so let's select
them revert them to black over here fill
them Stroke the opacity on those is at
fifty seven point three increase that to
a hundred percent select this one two
changes so one hundred percent and there
we go we drew all of those different
logos to be used and I'm gonna increase
the stroke on this of course so let's go
into this and increase it a little bit
it looks a little bit nicer and that
looks
very similar to what I have up here and
then to make these little gradient
buttons I haven't decided if I'm gonna
use them or not but just to give you a
rough idea what that's gonna be like
let's draw a rectangle on the screen and
hold down the control key to make it
into a square if I want to change it
into a gradient go into fill click on
this for gradient and then what I'm
gonna do is I get the gradient tool
which is just a letter G but select it
like that then I'm gonna be able to grab
this guy move it around a little bit so
let's move the black down here this is
actually transparent let's go and move
it the whole way up here go over into
our gradient tool and then we're going
to say edit like that and I can just
click on this guy right here if you can
see what I'm doing I just clicked on
this there it is got that right there
down here move the Alpha oh the whole
way up now you can see it's totally
black and let's say that I want to make
it gray
let's just go 120 120 whoops make sure
you could say 120 so if that looks like
okay so that's a very very very very
dark and we can come in here maybe this
black that we have here let's increase
it maybe we'll have to flip the gradient
who knows 194 so what that looks like
yeah very similar so let's come in here
and do like 220 220 and I'm get just
getting closer and closer to white oh
what the heck let's just make them all
white that is there now it's white and
that is how we change the gradient so if
you never saw Inkscape before chances
are you already left this tutorial but
let's just flip this around so that it
looks like what we had here before the
gradient tool let's grab this guy moving
down here grab this guy move him up here
dr. uh and there you go that is the same
as that you know you just have to move
your little icons in place and if you've
never seen guides before you just click
up here where the little ruler is and
you click and hold and you can drag out
guides if you want to make sure that all
of these line up so there is a tutorial
on how to create the icons we're going
to use throughout the rest or in the
next app that we make in this tutorial
series please leave your questions and
comments below
of the last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
