honor of having you Jenny Krug live on
for an interview and they are he's a
marketing guy at max Nick comm they are
a big time developer they have nine apps
currently in the Google Play Store
they won the Samsung smart app challenge
last year they developed spider Jack
with chillingo and the newest game which
is still in beta sword versus sword has
over 300,000 installs so this is a guy
that can answer all of the questions I
get all the time that I can't answer so
what we're gonna do is just jump right
into it
and you Jenny can you tell me about
yourself and your company yes by the way
we had another heat very accidentally
three years ago we published curling in
our curling the winter game and four
years later three years later we appear
to have featuring from Google during the
Winter Olympic Games and there was 1
million downloads quite unexpectedly for
quite an old game which we actually were
not thinking can ever make anything for
us I want us to earn some money
additionally to to what we have at the
current momentum so yes my name is
Eugenie I I work for max Newcombe as a
head of marketing but formerly I was
doing project and product management
within the company I originally started
with the Russian telcos 10 years ago and
we're doing some mobile services at in
Russia and CIS countries about four
years ago already I've turned to mobile
application development I think success
of Angry Birds really drived
out everybody and make everything
everybody think crazy
what's going on in this new market and
together with my old friends we decided
to start up game developing studio we
did few projects with them before but
actually was not part of their company
and the idea of making games came out
very quickly
the problem was we're not we didn't know
what games to do and so the very few of
them the very first few of them were
quite simple then yes we managed to had
a contract with Chillingo we actually
did two games with them one was like a
proof that we can do a good one then
then there was a spider Jack which is
very close to cut the rope game back to
the 2011 when it when it heated the App
Store's spider jack has more than I
think more than 1 million downloads
overall we we've moved to unity at some
point and we've been doing all our games
based on unity we tried self-publishing
self-publishing
unfortunately did not work for us we're
too small actually and there are too
many complicated things around them and
yes last year during with the project we
were doing on request force we were
developing in Game four for a company
who ordered the game development so it
was not internal project external
project we saw a presentation of local
Samsung office in Russia and they were
now sing some songs mark up challenge
and then on some songs small app
challenge I think it was June June 4 213
2013 Sony and decision made was very
quickly lespedeza
let's anyway participate with at least
something we can do for this for this
some songs challenge we had
approximately three months to deliver
the game and well oh no it was some
combination of our past experience in
all that we've managed to do by that
time on the one hand and some luck on
the other hand which made us win this
challenge so you know on that what
what's it like to compete in one of
these challenges is there anything
on-site done or is it literally you you
fill in a form that says I want to
compete in this challenge they won the
Samsung smart app challenge it's a
majorly big deal I'm saying that that
everybody out there what is there
anything on-site or is it literally you
just fill out an application submit your
application and then just wait or submit
your app and just wait it's more the
second base so there's nothing really
you know there's no how to say fight
again team so it's not like every day
you see your results there are some
scores and you follow this course from
one from the very bottom to the top
there are some iterations so like first
you receive first you register and then
you have to do some formal things then
you have to submit your application
actually the application it was some
smart app challenge basically for galaxy
s4 so the idea was somehow to support
technologies that are inside galaxy
which we did this is a group play so the
ability to play with the two Samsung
devices if you're in one place so they
can connect through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
and after we submitted the game to the
Samsung Apps and to the challenge there
was some time well actually nothing
happened so it was
like we didn't know what's going on but
then we received some first feedbacks
that the game was appreciated and and we
are going to do some how to say finals
and the results will be announced on
this time so please follow us and be
very specific to to react quickly when
we announce everything so we suppose
that we did okay that we are still in
the challenge and there will be some
finals where we'll be presented
but still we were thinking like you know
we're tenth in top 10 or something like
that it will be honored it will be good
to announce maybe make some PR about
around that but well there was no idea
we can be on the first place and then it
was like one no I think even worried
about actually about two months we were
really waiting for results with no
information actually they were sorry
just sometimes we were receiving emails
that guys the challenge goes on we're
still deciding bla bla bla so like more
formal things and at the moment actually
we were not expecting this to be any
result and at the moment we how to say
we not forgot about the challenge of
course we did not but they were you know
some problems going on is still the
company have has to leave if there are
other projects we were deploying sward
versus Ward which you mentioned and
there were some few other tasks we were
very busy with and then all of a sudden
on the eve of New Year we received such
a present from Samsung so it was really
a present no one no one thought of it
anyway and all of a sudden we appeared
to be winners
and that was of course a very happy
moment and we were celebrating this that
evening with all of our team it's very
cool
well I'm what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start just asking you a whole
bunch of questions that are coming in
the first one I have here is what goes
into coming up with app ideas well
generally every every game we developed
was mostly internal ideas but the thing
is that we were always watching on the
market so for example a spider Jack
which is very close to cut the rope was
the idea to review the this gameplay but
tried to do in a different way in a
different manner and mostly actually
this was challenge for us internally
because it was really first time we were
doing such complicated game though it
may not seem to be complicated at the
moment it was really complicated for us
at the day we published it generally we
were sitting around the table and
discussing different ideas that we have
we always assume the limitations we have
the the the company is quite small it's
less than 15 people mostly developers we
were you know we were evaluating each
idea and first like do you like it yes
now maybe let's think about it if
everyone comes that idea is interesting
and it should be worth moving forward
then we think what we need to to
implement this thing to a game and if we
understand that we generally have
everything to do to the game we
understand the mechanics the way to
program mechanics we understand the
graphics settings we understand overall
gameplay and what what things can be
implemented in this gameplay finally we
start developing and with preparing some
small document
I gained a design document and the
developer starts to do the prototype and
after prototyping so the main question
thing question is Christian decision is
what following to follow a further
development there were some times that
these prototypes didn't work at all and
we killed the idea when this ability is
not worth doing another in other stories
the the prototypes worked well and we
decided to go so that's it
every time every day actually every day
every one of us starts with the
searching through the app store through
Google Play through some other stores
watching what are the games at the top
what people are playing what is
interesting what is not interesting what
is new what is not new and this also
brings some ideas of the table during
our conversations and we're setting up
these brainstorms like once or twice and
months when we feel we need to discuss
we have some things to discuss that's
how it works it's if you probably have
30 or 40 or 50 ideas floating around
right now I'm guessing 40 30 or 40 is
too much for this we I think we all know
we had like 40 ideas which somehow were
thought over and let's say not developed
but worth work we spent some time on on
trying to develop to understand whether
they good or are they not some of the
games we even prototyped quite well even
with graphics and with levels so we did
some level design
and even maybe some some music but the
after that we were showing these
prototypes to some publishers and if
they were negative this goes to some
archive and stays there until we
understand we can use it for something
else but generally generally we we are
really we're small company we have on
the one hand now we have to support
things we've done before on the other
hand we have three projects life which
we are currently developing quite quite
actively and two of them are making a
lot of internal and external noise one
of them is dots out the winning game due
to Samsung requirements it was only
Android but now we're going to port it
to iOS and maybe some other platforms
and the second thing is the hour hours
idea about this turn-based play player
versus player game called SWAT versus
work where you can have at night and you
can fight against other nights so it's
such a medieval setting and there is a
tournament and so on and so forth but
this is really this game is really the
biggest and the most complex projects we
did ever and we have so many ideas about
what to do with this game single mission
I don't know what else more complex
complex tournaments so the users can
compete with each other in more
complicated ways some some other stuff
you know support of we currently do this
game on four platforms this really
requires a lot of efforts and we're
still like 12 people you know so this is
we can do
so many things we really want to maybe
we'll manage to do this in the future if
we succeed in the continued growing as I
told you sometime before when we were
preparing for this interview this year
was very hard to us actually the end of
the year well we were on the eve of
deciding whether the studio will leave
or we will close the company we're
really that close to this thing and one
by one several things happened and these
things really made us think that well
actually everything was worth doing it
even though at some point we were taught
that well maybe the idea of making an
independent game development studio for
mobile devices with a bad thing to do
because during four years there was no
real success
nothing interesting came out and all of
our ideas finally were not that good as
we thought they are and then boom boom
boom you know one by one several things
happened and and now we're the same
people were but we're a new company
because we're filling everything in a
quite different way everything I've ever
seen takes for it it's it's just bizarre
every business takes four years or a
large fish yeah yeah my businesses have
always been that way I've known
countless numbers of people that
everybody would say today oh this is a
successful person this is a successful
business that the first four years of
their life of that business everybody
said they're gonna fail that's right but
that's right yeah statistics says that
are you either die on the first year or
on the fifth year so we managed to
survive on the first year it was quite
easy for us and because we were very
exact excited about the the whole bunch
of things we were doing but this fifth
year was really really challenging and
but well you know you don't think that
you know business matures after four
years so this is our fourth year will
now be very mature now be more merry
experience very successful the and the
current moment you think only we
have to pay salaries you know we have to
give people the way to live their normal
lives
the this is our team and they cannot
struggle you know and and just drink
water and go on programming with the
with the it's unfair to the people so we
we actually suppose ourselves as a small
family because we're working together
for quite a long time and there's
responsibilities and and that's
responsibility comes in different things
and so really really we were a bit
desperate at one point and then when
things changed really quickly and for
good we're now feeling ourselves much
more confident and we're now pretty much
sure that well we're not going diet
adachi
you know the company will still live and
will continue developing our projects
the current ones and most likely we will
come up with the new ideas maybe we'll
even hire some people you know so this
is the completely different thing from
what we had before
and this is really great this was really
and I am winning this Samsung smart app
challenge contributed to this a lot so
we're very grateful to the guys who made
this choice and this is was you know all
of a sudden very great thing to happen
with us in in regards to that here's a
question do you think a person what's
the likelihood somebody sue could
succeed purely self-publish oh that's a
very good question well I didn't have it
somebody else sent it to me
yes the III I'm as a marketing I'm
visiting conferences quite often I
currently I'm at in San Francisco at JDC
Game Developers Conference and this is
the question I hear all the time whether
you should go self-publishing or whether
it's a big companies you have to develop
games with and I don't have actually a
short answer in this like always do
self-publishing
because you know there are examples of
companies that did self-publishing and
succeeded on the other hand there are
dozens of other companies that we're
doing publishing through Chillingo or
through I don't know some other other
publishers g5 well who else I don't know
well dozens actually are publishers that
exist at Electronic Arts Glu Glu Mobile
and so on and so forth and so your
developers stay developing the game and
do the pub and let the publisher do its
publishing work and you shouldn't think
about it and spend your time on on
marketing things and on the one hand
this is a correct way it's some period
of our company when we were trying to
reach Chilean go and when chillingo
agreed to publish spider Jack this was
really a big thing for us we'll learn a
lot I would say even more than a lot we
learned how to prepare the game for for
the market correctly we learned a lot
about localizations we learned a lot
about the game how it should be wrapped
you know how to work on the icons on on
the graphics on on everything actually
the way we we were doing this before and
the way we were doing this after
publishing with chillingo it's two
completely different ways we the
understanding of what should be done was
I can leave it it was absolutely
different from from what we had before
what do you think is the best way to get
your app out there socially like what
the chillingo do that they drew
attention to your app that you could
never do on your own or at least back
then on your own this is actually every
publisher does it's not only Chenango
it's I think every every more or less
successful publisher local or
international may have a bunch of games
already deployed with for example few
million users playing their game on a
daily basis and when they do they
advertise your game firstly through they
internal work so the user launches the
game sees a banner so guys check out our
new release blah blah blah and of course
not everyone but several people click on
the game and install it and this is the
way they attract first publicity to to
the game second thing is actually
publishers have a very good PR campaigns
so they the they distribute news to vary
quite a bunch of websites and bloggers
and so on and so forth people who write
about your game saying see this is the
new release from this of that company
quite nice interesting bah blah blah
they should video this song with the
gameplay recorded they should some I
don't know some some other marketing
materials and they hit them to to all
this public so this is this is they do
constantly I think like on a weekly
basis or maybe on a monthly basis with
the new releases they they have and this
is really a difficult thing to do for a
company where it's only one guy we have
to manage all marketing work work of
course just you know just
a build to an app store or is not enough
so when your build is available on the
App Store it me instead of your friends
will download it because you will write
to them see guys we have a new release
so the publisher sells this news not to
ten people but I don't know to ten
million people or and that's the
difference but that's but that's one
thing another thing is that working with
the publisher is always following his
rules so it's not like you do whatever
you want and then you just send the bill
to them and they say oh great and go on
publishing there are well really in
implementing a lot of things inside the
game but generally this is their view of
what the game needs requires to be to be
changed and this can be actually quite
opposite to what you think of a game so
this can can change the mechanics or
change some you know they're adding some
pay walls or enough applications in-app
purchases and you think oh my god if we
force users to buy that much no one will
play the game this is wrong but this is
their decision as they're the publishers
so if you really want to do something of
your own if you're really very pretty
sure that the game is good and the way
you did it the way you designed it the
graphics you used and everything and so
on and so forth it's better try yourself
a self-publishing but doing
self-publishing means that in this case
you have to understand that all this
marketing stuff should be done by
yourself or at least something should be
done by yourself it's not like just
uploading the game to the store and
waiting till it becomes successful you
have to do things same as publisher does
and you have to spend your time on that
and this is really difficult because
when you're your
programming guy it's you know it's why
should i write to these guys in I don't
know he at Cash arcade they just see my
game and understand it is great so I
don't need to write to them this is
wrong
really you have to do this you have to
reach these people and maybe if they
don't answer on your first email you
have to send them second email or third
email after they really a cancer and say
guide really great game really great
game see the next week we'll make a
review on our side
how important is you think those people
are on like in regards to marketing the
post a never-ending supply of game
videos on YouTube like marketing like
how influential are they well I can't
speak about all of them but I'm pretty
sure they're up good guys and really
popular guys them for example well you
probably know that with like PC games or
console games there are thing like there
they're reviewing the games and doing
Let's Plays when when they record the
playing and commenting and explaining
what they're doing and why and and there
are lots of people watching this on
youtube so if you are really doing it
good stuff with this game like this
people watch you and and of course if
you reach this guy and he really likes
you game it would be great to be for him
to review this game and show this to his
pop public this is this is this well
this is works for even for us we see
that people when they like the game they
write about it in Facebook or on Twitter
and commenting hey guys really
appreciated this try this out and there
is always 10 people you know that will
say ah oh so maybe I like it as well and
this go and gone this is like in a viral
thing word to mouth and under no hats in
English and I don't
I always found Twitter and Facebook to
be kind of pointless marketing wise I
mean that was for me
YouTube is a completely different
ballgame YouTube was amazing a very good
point a very good point in there because
they write and I'm well I think you
would be I'm not just saying that
because I'm on YouTube I'm you know I
still can't believe anybody actually
watches my videos I mean because I did
videos for three years and nobody
watched them and everyone who knew I did
this kind of almost thought I was having
an addiction problem just I was
completely insane because it is insane
for a person to lock themselves in a
room this is a good point it's a very
good point you were doing this on
YouTube but well think of some other
Derek who is doing this on a Facebook
and he's thinking well YouTube really
sucks but Facebook knows because I have
I don't know 1 million followers and and
I can put a thing on a Facebook and they
will read it and like it and share and
comment and so on and so forth they're
these bloggers that use I don't know
blog sports or other tumblr and some
other systems for blogging and and and
and they have dozens of thousands of
followers and hundreds of thousands of
followers there who read comment and
again like share so know this is really
a big thing to do and well generally a
marketing is important but well the
another point about the marketing and
self-publishing by the way is that if
you if your game is good and and you
started some marketing activities it's
sound point the game will start to
promote itself for sure because well
people will like it and they will and
they will share this knowledge to other
people but if you are
is not good you know it's a bad one
no marketing will help you never doesn't
matter how much you invest and we
actually we saw it and some of our games
were really not that good they could be
much better but we thought they are fine
we did them with it self-publishing we
tried our best and we failed really
really fast so when coming back to this
question self-publishing vs. publishers
I would say this is really tricky thing
there is no direct answer to this I
would suppose that you should try both
really both and maybe start with the
publishers to learn more about the
process then you'll be much more
confident if you decide to do
self-publishing but again for example if
you are just one guy who is developing
game on his own and who is just just you
know doesn't want to have a company or
or or cannot manage to have a company
for some reasons so do the publishing
this is okay this is okay to share your
revenue for others people doing a lot of
work and you will understand at some
point if you are ready to do it yourself
or not this is this this knowledge comes
well itself and you it's very difficult
this in the very beginning now you know
like from today on I publish I I develop
games and from today on I do only
self-publishing I don't believe these
really guys because they take all my
money this is not correct thing to do
you always have to try you always have
to learn and only after that you can
decide we it will cost three years to
self publishing and two of our projects
we did on ourselves or completely
unsuccessful completely it was a
disaster and actually it's our first
time we second time actually the
mentioning I mentioned curling we did it
so we self-published it three years ago
with no reason and three years later
we succeeded in the AppStore but you
know not everyone can wait for three
years just with one game and now it's a
swirl versus ward we published ourselves
and we're really hitting the the public
but but at some point it was like
gambling either you win or you lose it's
you you're you cannot be 100% sure you
always win so you have to change with
whatever opportunities come about yeah
yeah I mean I yeah I dabbled in the in
game development by giving examples back
whenever field runners came on brothers
okay and I'm sure I'm not anything
special but our our pitch was basically
okay fieldrunners is a hit you know a
long field runners came out we said
reversed our defense is the way to go
way to go and that ended up kind of
classic lands began was doggone close to
what our idea was but like you said we
were dealing with people that just
weren't willing to provide the money
needed and so it didn't go anywhere but
and I'm sure there were where there were
10,000 other people that also said our
first our defense is the next thing and
it didn't go anywhere for them either
it worked that's right that's right
yeah it's luck and it's also alternately
a people person there are people people
thing you know you have to be a good
person you have to remain honest you
have to continue doing good work and if
you get a good reputation and all of a
sudden people start helping you and it's
often the people that help you or people
you don't even expect to help oh yeah
that's right that's right and you know
it doesn't matter if you're game
developer or I don't know
anything don't you know a guy actually
yes you do like go online stores and
it's the same sort of thing I mean did
five years ago did I what I have said
all that's what my business absolutely
not but it was something that just I saw
I need I built relationships and things
just works and people all the time say
to me well you could make more money if
you did this sort of you cut out these
business owners and I say no no without
those business owners I would have never
become in any company you know and and
business yeah I can't add more to this
you know it's well becoming a
professional always requires time you
invest in things in things you do and at
some point if you are really good at
what you are doing if you if what if
what you did in what in what you
invested is really works out then you be
you your your your success and it's only
that way you know people are trying to
do a bunch of things and they're looking
for themselves and at some point they
understand this is this is it this is it
this a one they go in it and at some
point they're successful I I don't know
you probably know I've I've read this a
few days ago about this guy actual
colonel who who made the recipe for
Kentucky Fried chicken's he was like 65
years old and he was turned by I don't
know thousand of restaurants to whom he
was trying to sell the idea of this
chickens out on oppressors just imagine
he was visiting each one of these
restaurants I don't know once once a day
it means like three years in a row and
on 1,000 and I don't know if you first
run they said ah that's cool and now
they have this KFC thing and this is an
imagined but well if if he give ups
after tenth restaurant so where
you know yeah I think you'll die in
poverty oh you should be heavily
involved in sales and that's what I used
to always tell people when I get
questions all the time about how to be
successful how to sell the product in
law I say if you really believe in the
product you'll eventually be able to
sell it I mean determination is more
important than you know slick words or
or anything else if you believe in a
product you can start seeing this over
and over again in different forms
what has been your best way to generate
money through your app what do you think
about the freemium model that is taking
them for everything I'm just getting
that over and over again
yeah that's well funny thing you know
when we started there was no free to
play four years ago it was only premium
games well I think there were some free
games but actually they were quite
limited versions like light versions
with two levels and then you still have
a paywall and and you have to acquire
the full version the the thing the thing
is very simple here really really very
simple here the market evolves the
market develops four years ago it was
this small now it's this big and
probably in for you in another four
years it would be even bigger so I can
show it to see using my hands in the
camera how bigoted it would be and I'm
British tour in four years we'll have
some other business models some
something new something different from
what we have right now but at the
current momentum this is free to play
mostly so it's quite understandable why
people are eager to play a free game
instead of paying for something and
playing a premium hand on the other hand
if they if they know what you're doing
if they're pretty sure of what the game
you did is good they can pay for it and
we have examples like that
we cannot afford having a premium game
on the one hand as we're where we are as
a small now and we're competing with the
really big guys here we think that the
business model should be supplementary
steel and you shouldn't build your game
around the business model you should
adopt business model to the game you
develop so which it shouldn't drew in
the game it should be understandable why
you ask people to pay at some moment and
this is the only correct way of doing
free-to-play because nowadays you can
see a lot of games that just asking
money and quite straightforward and and
even it doesn't matter you like the game
where you don't like the game they still
trying to charge you with one box of two
bucks or three bucks or whatever and to
my mind this is not good so this is this
is just it's like I will show you
something and doesn't matter you like it
or not I'll try to force you to pay for
it this is not good thing in a good game
you are willing to pay your you're
looking for the wait for positive
possibility to pay because you want to
have something which which which this
feature or thing will make your life
happier you know like for example in
some games you don't pay for the
gameplay you don't pay for this for
speeding up or for I don't know if like
having some extra forces or whatever
what you're paying is for example to
have some Red Hat or I don't know
shining armor or something that just
will make you more personalised
something will which will feel you make
you feel that you are having your own
character not as the other characters
the same as other characters in the game
but something something to personalize
it and that's it and that's it and the
areum's works and and is great that it
works I think so at some point I think
two years ago we we moved to fruit
play what we did in the beginning I
think was not very good because we
extend were learning we were learning we
did that l market actually was learning
how to make free-to-play games at the
current moment all of our games are free
to play and this is on the one hand the
only way to compete on this market for
us and on the other hand it's it's well
the filling of the market as it is now
and I don't I don't think we'll change
this business model to some to like
premium for example just because we have
one heat or or two heats and this this
make us feel that confident of now
everyone will pay for our own games and
we can move to premium that's not but
well again if you look at the PC market
they also they they had also their ups
and downs and they were premium and
premium and so on and so forth or web
games more or less the same so at some
point there are games which are very
good as premium games you just pay once
and then you play with no limits with
everything at your hand and and it's
good and on the other hand there is a
less you know multiplayer games it's
they are free so there will be millions
of users and it would be fun to play it
and if you want yeah you have to
purchase some things inside the game
especially for you and that's works well
and well this is the way of doing it
again this is more experience more
experience than just you know let's look
let's let's build a game around a
free-to-play model and let let's make
every third user pay as three US dollars
and and and that's what will be our game
all about this thing doesn't work first
come the game playing then and
everything else if you are doing in game
and even in the beginning you don't
understand how to monetize that monetize
it pretty sure that as soon as you
release it
and you'll have some ideas just well
look at the flappy bird what she did
it's just a banner a banner on the top
of the screen that's it
but still I see here's a flappy bird
question I people were asking about I
don't know there's a whole bunch of
questions about the ethics of building a
game that are similar to other games I
actually think that's a fabulous because
I mean I was actually talking to a guy
the other day and he was talking about a
game looking like Mario Brothers and I
said oh that that wasn't right and I
said to him I understand the how few
games would be develop develop if was
able to copyright the concept of jumping
or the concept of having blocks on the
screen which is in essence all Mario
Brothers is there would be no game and
you know copyrighted you can't make
anything jump you know thank God thank
God that we don't have the ability to
copyright mechanics in essence that's
what it is it's the mechanic a very
simple answer in this very simple really
we-we've how to say we were thinking
about this long time ago when we were
actually we'd do some copying ends well
so guys Angry Birds is not an original
game it was a copy of a game play a copy
of a game which was already in the after
and with which is puzzle well actually
successful at that moment not that
successful as an angry bird I think it
was like castle castle something like
castle revenge or something something
like that I don't remember the name in
particular but well again no one
remembers it everyone knows Angry Birds
but still angry birds for the copycat at
some point copycat when they will added
a lot of things to their games like
these funny characters this graphics and
so on and so forth and there
succeeded succeeded they are a success
and still they are actually a success
and that's a good thing to do so it's
it's if you are doing just 100% pure
copy it's just the very every pixel is
the same as an original game of course
it's not a good thing to do and I'm
pretty sure it doesn't make any sense
actually if you are adding something
you're having some ideas how to improve
what to change still just using the the
core mechanics of course why not
everything you know in literature they
say that all all stories are already
written so there every author is
rewriting them once in a while so like
you know like Shakespeare Shakespeare
actually had all the dramas already
written there's nothing new he did it
already but still lots of books and a
lot of writers the same with the games
if I show the winners I like talking
from the outside people think it's it's
just natural to come up with a
completely 100% original idea and it
just isn't
everything's catotti I mean I I've
worked in worked in advertising
companies my wife works for a massive
industrial design company and he pretty
much the mantra that's repeated all the
time is there is no truly 100% original
idea and who cares yes and we learn from
everyone else I mean I struggle with
that a line trying to do things a
hundred percent original and I sometimes
not a hundred percent there's no such
thing but I mean even 50 percent
original and it's extremely frustrating
but it's you know it's rather difficult
you should be really a genius to make
this things happen so but if you're not
a genius if you're just a good worker
take somebody's idea and polish it and
improve it and do something of your own
and and see what happens there's elbows
in the history of things happen this way
and
you should be frustrated of not doing
this with a game or with an app or with
something with something else just do a
good job that's all yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah that's right that's right how many
people in the world do the best they can
with anything
I mean it's that's God love you much
much less much less that you can think
of that not everybody is doing the best
they can yeah actually even even we at
some point well I think we're not doing
the best we could and only some you know
some problems we faced forced us to do
the best we could
forced us to to improve ourselves to
grow and and we have the result we have
hey here's a personal question you ever
hear of a game called don't starve
starve it's not a moment I think I heard
I heard about it maybe in some news but
I didn't play no oh but so you know it
sounds really familiar I think I came
across maybe maybe some guy wrote about
it or in the news or just in a Facebook
and Facebook celibate know nothing cuz
somebody makes a mobile version of that
I if it's $50 something here's another
question get we've already talked about
this personally but do you develop your
own game system what development
platform do you guys use its unity its
unity 3d as soon as it was announced
publicly and we could start using it we
tried and really liked it it really
helped us to optimize the processes and
the ease of porting the games is more or
less tomorrow so we really like using
unity and I think for the last two years
all of our games were developing and
maybe even a bit longer but for two
years definitely everything was done on
unity and that's out and
SWAT versus world also a unity based
game so I would definitely recommend it
for for a user for any any developer to
look at this engine and to try it and
you know III know if you guys just you
know one guy who makes everything uses
unity and he can do much more he's much
more flexible with things he's doing
then then a team of three four people
doing things native so this is this is a
good thing yes to try okay next thing I
get all the time here what is the best
advertising company to do in sorry guys
we don't have any experience with that
we we've never added any advertisements
in the in the in the apps in the games
we developed I think it was it was I
think it was some publisher did probably
Chillingo did but on our cell on our own
we were not we did not so I don't know
how important do you think graphics are
versus mechanics in regards to the
success of a game again that's a good
question
really good question I think well both
are important
really and again having in mind the
example of Angry Birds same almost the
same mechanics but really different
graphic graphics setting helped to to be
a success so I would say I would say you
you better pay your attention to both of
these things really for example with
with the dots out when when we when we
decided to make it flat really flat is
not it was not because of the iOS 7 or
you know and all this stuff it was
because we we understood that this will
be the best graphical way we can do it
if we will
have to know you know to do some
complicated graphics with lots of things
and colors and little I know designs we
never be ready and we just turned to
something very very simple just some
colors and that's it
so only only things like that and it
worked for us and it's I think the best
graphics we could have for this game
really so on the other hand if we if you
see the word versus water we are still
arguing about the graphics settings
there so we know that the gameplay and
and and the mechanics are good but we
still want to improve things inside the
game in terms of graphics and we pretty
sure that this can help and this can add
a lot to the game because if people well
you know we consumed with our eyes so
this is this is one of way of consuming
things if you are playing with a game
which is nice-looking you'll probably
continue playing with it and you'll
continue having fun so but if the game
is dull no matter how beautiful it is
it's dull you won't play it and if it's
very interesting but with you know with
a very limited graphics with everything
you know which is not simple
understandable ah roars again even it is
very interesting you will stop playing
it because it will be complicated so you
better you better try to find the best
way of of doing graphics and of
improving this thing as well as in
inventing in investing in in in the
gameplay in the core gameplay III know
the example I think of a bad lamb you
know this game badly oh no oh yeah yeah
black blob because yes exactly exactly
exactly these are actually finished guys
and what the
making some presentation about how they
developed the game and they were
speaking we wanted to make a very good
design really we wanted to invest but
they were only two guys you know only
two guys they couldn't do and everything
there at some point whoops yeah yeah
yeah I don't know there it is that's bad
land but the thing is that at some point
they decided to make everything black
because it was on the one hand simple
but on the other hand all of their
graphic works went to the backgrounds
you see that it's a kind of a tricky
thing their backgrounds are really
beautiful but the main character is just
black and it worked out it worked out
and really they succeeded and and they
and and and the game itself was and it
still is a success so so the graphic
matters the graphic matters but as well
the game mechanics matter so I would
think there are more or less people at
some point here sword versus sword by
the way if I can get it whoops that's
very fancy it's there Oh
your intro doesn't there I can show this
say let's see if I can get my camera to
work actually what what we want to do is
to make this night really different so
now they are more or less how to say the
same so we we didn't manage to prepare
as many graphic works as we wanted
before the soft launch actually the game
was soft launch so it's not a full
version the full version I would think I
hope will be in major May or June and
will have a single mission and will have
bunch of other things that will be with
the game we're trying to designers do
you have in that are just focusing 100%
on graphical design for this game one
actually we always had only one guy
always only one guy and this is the
first time we
we think we need a second guy really
because we want to have a lot of traffic
words done for this game the idea is
that we are trying to every three weeks
we are trying to make an update and
adding some features and a new staff and
fix bugs as there honestly there are
lots of bugs but in terms of the game
has its Anna soft launch where we're
doing pretty well but for the for the
full release we really want to improve
graphics and we really want to add a lot
of content to the game and if we
everything will be fine and the game
will be a success we will continue doing
this because this is important but this
is important as well developing the new
features as well as developing the core
mechanics and you cannot subtract one
thing and focus only on the other it's
always the combination always another
thing keeps coming up Apple App Store
versus the Google Play Store store
what's your opinion what's your opinion
that's a good question they're both good
guys really both but you cannot decide
only this only that store you better
keep both of them because there are lots
of people playing on iPhones and iPads
and as well there are lots of people
playing on Android devices and substrate
again if you're making only android
games you your fans on Apple devices you
lose them because you they and the and
honestly they won't change the device
because of the game really never happens
never so you better you better try to do
your best to make the games for both of
the platforms why you go cross-platform
with yes exactly yeah yeah yeah by the
way yes good point yeah this is one of
the reasons we were always testing the
cross-platform tools and the unity one
really worked well so this was one of
the reasons and the
yes again now forward sward versus worth
of this our latest release we did
working to Windows Phone Wow guys
there's a picture there we with a bet
with you know with the better version
with the with this on a soft release of
a game which is not yet ready
we've got featured on the only Windows
Phone and we've got like 50,000 installs
they air for you know one week of
featuring it even works on this platform
which is not popular at all I don't know
it's like three four percent of the
market even last night I maybe one
percent of the market are you on
blackberry - no no but we're on Facebook
by the way we're on Facebook so guys if
you have facebook you can reach this
game on the Facebook and this is another
good thing about unity you now where did
mobile and we did that at the very same
moment other developers do you think
that most developers using
cross-platform tools like unity versus
developing natively
I think it's 5050 actually because I
always come across people that say the
cross-platform sucks and you lose and
beast on that and you always have to the
native it's you know it's more for
experience it's more of possibilities if
you are able to develop things natively
I will do it natively but this changes
the the processes the the business
processes and ID inside the company if
it means that you have separate teams
which you have to always trying to work
in parallel so you will be sure that the
things appears on the Android will
appear in iOS and vice-versa so this is
a I have did it in the common company
not a gaming company we I did a few
projects like that and and its really
complicated really really difficult on
the one hand but on the other hand you
have some result in speed and in
optimization and using some particular
features of this or that person so it it
can make sense on the one hand but again
it's
two times more developers at least it is
costly more costly where the
cross-platform tool you can have one
developer per game where we're having
more than one but the reasons for that
because we have a server and we need the
server-side to be developed a happy this
the application this is another guy for
the application development and we have
a support guy for him to do some things
well again even if you're using unity
you cannot use exactly the same thing
for iOS and Android because you know
in-app purchases are different
implementations and support are
different and they're still there is you
know there's things to be done to tune
these games to the particular platform
so in order to speed up we're having
actually three three and a half three
and a half guys on on that and I think
the team will grow as the complexity of
the project will grow are you doing
anything with wearable technology no
that's that's a nice thing and I think
it's it's really going to hit the market
in a few years but we don't feel
confident about that so we would we're
not able to invest on anything
internally into this but as soon as we
understand that we can at least try to
do something I think we will I think we
will but the the market is now there's
no market actually for the aware of
things there are only more of
experiments currently I think by the way
Samsung did pretty well with the with
these Samsung gear watches the watches
they did they're nice yeah I'm a
terrible case on your baby
yeah yeah I'm giving these away by the
way and they're all gonna be based off
of the order of your answers to
questions yeah I'm giving away somebody
out there is gonna win a three and a
smart
yeah Galaxy gear what
so guys I wanted them myself honestly
but I cannot oh I could give you one I
have six of these he won't he's
seriously done I can i samsung said I
can do anything I want with this it
won't be honest and this is all to you
well thank you you Jenny I mean I don't
think I'm seeing basically the same type
of questions except somebody once you're
gone wants to hear your ideas on web
scraping I think nothing I think people
are confused I don't know somebody that
there's confused about what this
interview is about for that one yes I
have done two scraping they're all my
yeah and there's some questions about
Samsung developing their own mobile OS
but I think that has kind of been pushed
off I don't know yeah yeah it's a tricky
thing actually and it's difficult for me
to comment on what Samsung doing here
but well I understand why they're trying
to develop their own platform this is
honestly this is a good thing but it's
very difficult the whole moto Motorola
being sold to Lenovo and Google not
enforcing patents kind of killed the
CMOS I honestly honestly I don't know
for sure but honestly I think somehow
some song when I don't know 60 or 70
there's 70 percent of the android market
somehow forced will go to live to live
the this business and Tizen was a thing
too as well too forced to show them that
we we can move to another platform and
do it quickly
I'm not aware of what how their plans
are the moment they promise to launch
first device in March so we have to see
the March is not finished yet so they
have still one week
for a week and a half to do something
here but if not well this will be
understandable but well until until
Tizen hits the market until they start
selling devices
I wouldn't recommend anyone to really
invest a lot in this so you can you can
look at it you can I don't know make
some tests
try yourself it's it's very simple
actually it's very common it's just
Linux so you know more the same as a
Android it's it's not that differs it
doesn't differ that much there are some
specifics but still more or less the
same so you can download the whole
development kit right now anyways
interested emulator yeah we I did a few
projects with Tizen outside but the
thing is that until it is launched it is
yeah I would I would recommend to invest
a lot a lot of time there you can of
course it's a good thing to learn some
things from there from them side but
unfortunately about with all these
delays it's very difficult to make any
forecast of what will happen there so
but again you should better stick to
Samsung official news as I'm not there I
just yeah yeah lest anyone who pokes
person they do they did a great thing
they choose our game and and we want the
there their contest this is really
awesome but again we cannot talk about
everything there still it doesn't give
us the right to make any predictions so
it's let's stick more to officials is
there anything you want to say to the 78
people that are online right now in
London
well guys cuz I would let you know
because I know your voice must be
burnout
and I say man you've answered almost
every question so that you know that's
good there's a couple I have to go I
have to go so because this this is
morning in San Francisco and I need to
go to the GDC and work actually really
well guys first of all thank you very
much for coming and for listening this
is really honor for me and for all of
our team dirt's thank you as well and I
do I wish all of you but all of your
ideas come true I mean you you manage to
implement them you manage to work them
out and you manage to to have the users
which will appreciate things these
things you're doing these things what
happened with the with this mobile is
really great I I am myself I'm really a
geek I am
I live with my iPhone i i i feel this is
really a big change in in in the history
of human things i well guys 20 years ago
no one would thinking that a phone could
be something that important to everyone
of us it was ridiculous thing in this
way and just imagine how quickly things
changed and and what will be the speed
of changes going on so and the games is
a good thing to do really because it's
fun you make people happy and you make
yourself happy because even developing a
good nice game is it's something that
can be of any really of interest you
internally and when you see users happy
users saying that that's a great game
thank you guys thank you for developing
please continue supporting the game this
is really a lot and i wish all of you to
to be to succeed to succeed in what
you're doing but well that's it I
suppose well thank you very much for
your time and everybody out there like I
said I'm gonna post questions based off
of what you Jenny talked about in this
interview
you whoever gets all the questions right
I'm gonna do a live drawing and I'm
getting I'm not saying like the video
favorite it nothing it's just gonna be
who gets the questions right I'm gonna
do a live drawing and then you good
thing yes go for it go for it it's a
good stuff all right well thank you
Jenny and I wish you all the best thank
you very very much
it was real pleasure okay good bye bye
