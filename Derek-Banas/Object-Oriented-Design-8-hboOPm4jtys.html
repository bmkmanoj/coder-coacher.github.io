8 of my object oriented design tutorial
today I'm going to turn the sequence and
class diagrams that we made in previous
parts of this tutorial and there's
something to those above if you haven't
watched them watch them otherwise you'll
be confused and I'm going to take those
guys and I'm going to convert them into
code on the fly in front of you so you
can see exactly how this works this is
going to be a two-part tutorial so I'm
going to create this code over part
eight and part nine and of course all
the code and all the designs and
everything's available under Neath
videos so let's get into it okay so you
can see on the left side of the screen
this is our key sequence diagram this is
recording 1080p if you want to watch it
full screen and it will look nice so
here is the sequence diagram and on the
right side of the screen I'm gonna write
all the code exactly like the sequence
diagram tells me to now the only thing I
did was I went ahead and I used the
class diagrams we created an elastic and
I simply copied them over so if we have
Bank ID int well I just changed that to
private int Bank ID and that was it so
any of the real code writing I am doing
that in my head but this stuff I did
ahead of time because I didn't want to
waste your time watching me do the same
thing over and over and over again and
actually if you had a really good UML
tool it would actually convert the UML
into this code that you're going to see
here so what I'm going to do now is I'm
just going to copy what's on the left
side of the screen over to the right
side of the screen and I'm going to
start off with tests ATM which is going
to be the name for our application and
I'm inside the main part of this
application and the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to come in here
and create an account just like the
sequence diagram tells me on the left
side of the screen and go new account
and then I have to give a bank ID so I'm
just gonna say 10 and then I'm just
going to type in my own name here as the
customer so this is exactly the way you
would create a customer account in the
real world which is what we're modeling
so that makes sense I'm gonna give
myself ten thousand dollars in the bank
and I'm going to make my pin code one
two three four and you can see that is
exactly what you see right there
so then after I do that of course put a
semicolon at the end and I'm going to
continue on now what I want to do is
generate an ATM card for this new
customer which is me so I'm just going
to copy the left side of the screen I'm
going to a card and I'm going to
all this customers ATM card and then I'm
going to go new card and then I'm going
to do exactly what it says on the right
side or on the left side of screen to
say account get pin even though that
doesn't exist yet I'm just going to
assume that it does and then I'm going
to go the count get stripped number
right like that and a semicolon so there
we are as soon as we create the account
and all those other different things
which we are going to do in this part of
the tutorial they're all going to work
so I got my customer and my car
generated now what do I got to do I got
to create a customer object and give it
an ATM card so I'm going to go customer
the customer is equal to a new customer
and I'm going to pass over the customers
ATM card and semicolon so now we got the
account the card and the customer all
generated here now what do I got to do I
got to create the bank computer that's
going to hold the account so I'm going
to go buying computer and I'm just going
to call this XYZ bank computer and this
is coming from down here
if you're wondering and then this is
going to be equal to new bank computer
and then I have to pass it over a name
just like it says and I'm just going to
go X Y Z Bank and then close that off so
now we have a bank computer so what's
the next thing we got to do well we need
to add account to bank then create the
bank network and so forth and so on so
I'm going to go X Y Z Bank computer
which is exactly what we just created
and then I'm gonna go add account to
bank and I'm going to say the account
right like that and there we are so now
we added the account to the bank then I
need to create a network that's going to
hold every bank computer and all the
different accounts inside of it so I
need to go a bank network and call this
the bank network is equal to new Bank
Network right like that and there we go
now we have the bank network as you can
see I'm just copying everything exactly
the way it tells me to do it then I need
to add my bank computer to my bank
network so I'm going to go the bank
Network and go add bank to network and
then go X Y Z Bank computer and then
close that off so this guy right here is
matched up with this guy right here so
that tells me I need to create an ATM
now I'm going to go this Main Street ATM
just
for the heck of it and this is new ATM
and the bank network because I want to
add the bank network of bank computers
to my ATM machine and then I need to go
Main Street ATM and say is Strip
readable and it needs to be passed the
customers ATM card like that and we got
that set let's just keep on scrolling
here through everything and just keep on
making stuff and all this code I'm going
to make available as soon as I'm done
here I'm going to copy it over to my
website you can get it and of course it
is free now I checked if the card is
readable now I need to go a TM cards
bank in network and I need to pass
customers ATM card and then insert pin
which I'm going to actually have done
with the ATM insert pin and you go
customers ATM card and one two three
four which is the PIN number that I gave
it above and this is customers that's
why we get a little error there there it
one away
man pick account to access and that
doesn't do anything so for that it's
just going to put up a message asking
them to pick the account access then
it's going to ask ammount to withdraw
and again doesn't do anything this is
exactly what you're going to do in the
real world you're just going to make or
follow the sequence diagram get
transaction OOP info and there we are
and that's it test ATM the meet your
application right here is doing
everything why do I have a message well
I have an error here because I haven't
created account yet so let's go in here
and create account so here is account
and just so you can see here's the class
diagram like I said for Bank ID account
number all I did was transfer all those
things over and then I did exactly the
same thing with the methods and just so
you can see exactly what's going to see
it's just return return return there's
absolutely zero logic here so I just
went ahead and did it ahead of time so I
got to think about okay well what am I
going to do inside of account well this
is the last I'm going to do this I'm
going to say this Bank ID is equal to
Bank ID say like that see this is why I
didn't want to waste your time with that
and then this is going to be customers
name based
so how many of those I got one two three
three more and then I'm gonna do the
same thing with account type base
account balance and then pin so there
you go that is the account there's all a
bunch of other different things to do
here and let's think about what those
other things are so where did we create
it here you go
so here is account and you can see
account type and I have little notes
here one is for savings two is for
checking that I don't really need do
anything with that account number
incrementer will start at a hundred
thousand and that is this guy right here
say that guy account number is equal to
the strip number with a one or two from
account type at the end so that is
something I need to set up here and did
I do anything with that no I didn't do
anything with that and then what else do
I need trip number is 8 digits and the
first two are going to be Bank ID and
the rest are going to be account number
- checking savings account so let's go
in here and let's create those two guys
that are written there so I'm going to
say strip number is equal to and I know
that I need to go generate because I did
that somewhere where did I do that
see here it is generate strip number see
so I know that I need to make that
because the brilliant person I put the
sequence diagram told me to do that so
that I can keep my name straight that's
very important that's why I don't like
sloppy junkie thrown-together sequence
diagrams okay so that's one thing that
will cause you some problems here I know
I want to call something called generate
strip number and I wrote it here in the
sequence diagram so whenever I get to
this point where I create the strip
number well now I know what the name of
the method is see I'm not going to get
confused by names so that's all I need
to do and that's going to do exactly
that it's going to get my strip number
by adding Bank ID say Bank ID it's right
there to the account number incrementer
every time we add a new account this
guy's number is going to go up by one so
you know that's good and then what else
do we need I need to go this account
number and then I need to go generate
account number and this guy is going to
get past strip number and account type
and how do I know that well I know that
because it's written here say count
number where is it there it is see
account number is equal to strip number
with a one or two from account type at
the end saying that's exactly what I'm
going to do so I got those guys set up
and then I got all these methods
here that don't do anything except pass
back information my gaiters and my
satyrs see real simple stuff and then I
went ahead and threw in generates trip
number and it's going to get Bank ID
right there so now I have to figure out
exactly what it's going to do well it's
going to get account number incrementer
right like this so where is it there we
are
paste that in there and it is going to
increment it so now we know we have a
new account then I need to go int and
I'm going to go new strip number and
it's going to be equal to Bank ID and
then times now if I want the bank ID to
go ahead of the hundred thousand say
this is a hundred thousand this
incrementer right here well I'm going to
need to multiply that times 1 million so
that it goes ahead of it it's like math
so I'm going to take the account number
and I want to throw the bank ID right
here two spaces ahead of a hundred
thousand and you multiply times that and
that's how you get that so you know
that's that's math and stuff and then
I'm going to go account number increment
or add that to that and that is exactly
what it's going to do when I spelled
that wrong and there we are
so this is going to generate my strip
numbers really simple and each one of
them is going to be new and then I just
need to go return new strip number and
it does its job it's going to generate
strip numbers for me and this strip
number is on the back of the ATM card
and then I need to go generate account
number and it's going to get an int
strip number and it's going to get
account number because I'm going to have
an account for both the checking and the
savings so that's what's going on there
so now I need to figure out the logic
behind that so let's go to test ATM and
look at this for a second you can see
here where I'm defining account type see
I have a C here and I also could have a
lowercase C or an S or an uppercase s so
that's what's being passed in say
account type so I'm going to go if I'm
going to go account type diet starts
with a lowercase s or and then I'm going
to do the same exact thing except with
an uppercase s we step there
throw that and air and input and
uppercase s so if it's a savings account
account type I'm going to put a 1 at the
end of the strip number to generate this
very specific
savings account account number and then
I'm going to save it to account number
just by going like this and then I'm
going to go strip number times 10
because I want to move it forward one
digit and by multiplying by ten that's
what it's going to do and I'm going to
throw a 1 at the end so now if we look
at this we're going to know that this is
a savings account and then after that
I'm gonna go else and right now whenever
I'm doing this code I'm not worrying
about making errors I handle all those
later on
I want this code to work if everything
goes perfect which means the customer
enters everything exactly the way I
expect them to and then during the
testing phase that's whenever I'm going
to go in and actually start handling any
events and things like that so that's
what's going on there else and then here
I'm just going to change it to two so
that's going to handle the checking
account is going to be a two at the end
of the account number and the same as
count is going to have a 1 and then
after I create that guy I'm just going
to jump out of here and go return
account number so that's how we're going
to generate our account numbers that's
good and I'm done with a count as far as
I know and I like to just move so we're
going to go into card Java now and do
all the things we're supposed to do here
and you can see here the card doesn't
really do anything so let's go and look
at our class diagram and here is card on
the left and you can see I have my pin I
have my strip number I have two
constructors set up inside of here one
card is going to be created whenever I
just want to test my strip number and
then another card is going to be created
whenever I want to check my strip number
and my pen and say just simple stuff
just assigning the values that are
passed over and then I'm going to
provide them with access to get my pan
and get my strip number and also set the
pin this is something I might actually
want to get rid of later on and also set
strip number and that's it
guess what all I did was copied this
class diagram over to this guy didn't
have to do anything different and it's
done see no logic so let's just move
into customer dot Java and create that
and look down here at customer you can
see customer looks pretty doggone simple
so let's go over here and see if
customers simple here well I have insert
ATM card and I have removed from
customer instead handled by customer can
structure that means the ATM card is
going to be an input inside of the
customer constructor so in essence
that's what I did and everything else
there is fine again just transferred the
class diagram which is over here over to
here and that's it I'm done so now let's
go into transaction now transactions not
going to be quite so easy and let's just
go like that and let's look at
transaction it's way down here I think
yeah there it is look at transaction
it's very very busy think about some of
the things we need to do here so if we
look at all this well I see that current
date time is here that means I need to
get a date and you can see right here
say it's underlined that means that it
is not there so I need to both get
access to the library that's going to
get me my date and also get the library
that's going to allow me to format my
date so date format I like that and I
could also come in here and just click
on this guy and have it import all my
different things which what the heck
let's do it
so there that guy is import they
imported that and there that is and then
one other thing I want to do is to be
able to output this as a string and have
it formatted the way that I want to do
it so I need a different library Java
text dot simple date format like that so
I know that I want to be able to format
that and that tells me that I'm also
going to have to come in here and I'm
just going to do this at the top because
it's going to be different I'm going to
go date format this is going to allow me
to format my date the way that I want to
have it formatted so we're going to go
simple date format and this is Java so
we're just going to go why I want years
forward slash months days
h/h : mm : SS there we go and that is
going to format my date exactly the way
that I have it year-month-day hours
minutes seconds okay that's it got that
done then if we go through here also
because I have this date inside here I
know that I'm going to have to create a
method to get my current date time just
like I have there so where does that
make sense to do that let's just go
through and see how about we just do it
right here after set customer name
and I'm just going to go public turn a
string get current daytime say nice
logical name pretty simple to get this
I'm just going to go return date format
haven't seen this before this is how you
format a date and turn it anytime
semicolon at the end and little curly
brace so if I'll save that and I forgot
I already have that in there so let's
just delete that no problem so there we
go got that all set up and then I'm
basically just going to scroll through
this guy and look for things methods
over here that are on the left side of
the screen that are over here but
nothing's been defined so set strip
number real simple everything's just
passed over set did the card verify it's
getting past a boolean card verified and
then I just have to use a little simple
bit of logic here to figure out what I
do so I'm just going to go did chord
verify all this is going to do is it's
going to take this boolean that's passed
chord verified it's going to be true or
false and then I need to set that did
card verify set it to this guy so I'm
going to go did card verify is equal to
and I'm going to go card verified and
just use this little trick to get it
done quick boom there we are a little
logical conditional and I'm able to set
true to this if true was passed in and
false to it if it was not passed in and
I'm done
so let's look at some other different
things here and you can see did chord
verify is getting passed and there's did
card verify so that's good set account
to withdraw from and it's getting an
integer pass to it count to withdraw
from and this method hasn't been defined
yet so how am I going to do it I'm going
to go this account to withdraw from is
equal to whatever they told me to or
whatever they passed over so account to
with draw from all I'm doing is just
setting that which is a field inside of
transaction Java you don't believe me
let's look see account to withdraw from
see it's right there so I'm doing is
getting passed a value and I'm saving it
inside of there so that's good and after
that what else do I need to do so I'm
going to also at the same time set the
account number that is going to be used
for this field as well and I'm just
going to go this do I account number
used and then I have to figure out how
to calculate that
well let me think about it well I am I
gonna do that account to withdraw from
well let me see here I do have strip
numbers saved inside it yep they're
strip number so there's strip number
right there and so I'm going to use
strip number to calculate this I'm just
going to go strip number and I'm going
to multiply it times 10 and then add it
to account to withdraw from such a
sneaky way to get the account number
used and yes that will work okay great
so what does that leave me with I have
all this I have all this this is just
simple gets and sets right like that
pretty easy pretty easy and that leaves
me with the last thing I need to create
which is my constructor for transaction
Java and this guy's job is basically to
get the strip number and then from the
strip number get as many different parts
of the transaction as possible I don't
know what I mean by transaction are all
of these different fields that are
available here so if I'm getting my
strip number what can I get well let's
look up here and let's see exactly what
strip number s well it's eight digits
and the first two are Bank ID and the
arrest or account number - checking or
savings code so this is going to be a
count number without the one or the two
on there alright so let's think about
this and I know that I have a note
written here that Bank network is going
to have a method inside of it where is
it Bank Network
there's Bank network and Bank network is
going to get first two digits from the
strip number that is sent to it and that
is a static field and I had that written
in notes in a couple different places so
first two digits if I get a strip number
and I want the first two digits to get
the bank ID how am I going to do that
well I'm gonna go bank ID is equal to
Bank Network right like that and then
I'm gonna go get first two digits and
I'll worry about how exactly it's going
to get this first two digits there in a
second and yes that's going to be strip
number and there it is
so I was able with the strip number to
get the bank ID as well and then I also
one of the other things I could
definitely get is the current date
because I don't need anything you get
that so new just to put it on the
receipt after the person is done using
the ATM and what else can I get well I
can get the account number say
numbers over here so let's get the
account number as well count number used
is going to be equal to strip number so
pretty simple and there in that short
amount of time I created test ATM Java
account Java card Java customer Java and
transaction dot Java and in the next
part of the tutorial I'm going to create
Bank Network Bank computer and ATM Java
and we're going to test this whole thing
to see if it works all the code and
everything imaginable is underneath the
video leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
