9 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps today we're going to focus in on
Android styles and themes and this
tutorial is going to be very much laid
out like a cheat sheet I'm going to show
you how to do everything then we're not
going to do anything elaborate that's
going to distract specifically from
styles and themes all of the code is
available on a link in the description
and I've a lot to do so let's get into
it okay so here we are inside of Android
studio and the application name for this
guy is going to be Android themes just
to keep it simple you can see everything
here da da da this is probably going to
be different for you it's just that way
because this is my website and I'm going
to click Next and in this situation I'm
going to set this for 10 and you're
going to see later on why you normally
wouldn't do that but I want to make this
run on every single device possible and
also cover everything you could probably
ever need in regards to themes and
styles next keep this simple I'm just
going to have a blank activity in the
next tutorial I'm going to cover
fragments click Next
and then come in here and you can see
the activity name as well as the layout
name and I'm just going to let those be
the way they are I could come in here
and go Android themes and then click
finish ok and after Gradle is done
building everything this is what we're
going to be left with I'm going to open
this guy up and I'm going to go inside
of the app folder and then I'm going to
go in the source folder go in the main
folder and then go in the resources
folder and you're going to have your
styles in the values folder we're
actually going to create a couple values
folders here in a second and styles is
right there ok and this is what the
files folder is going to look like and
basically themes and styles are going to
allow you to separate your design from
the content and what this is going to do
basically is just make your app design
consistent and easier to maintain a
style is a collection of properties that
are going to specify how widgets look
and a theme is going to be a series of
styles that are going to be applied to
an activity or the whole entire
application now basically you can see
this guy right here what we're going to
do to make sure that this is backwards
compatible is we are going to just come
in here and just delete this whole
entire thing right there and I'm going
go Android I want to make this
compatible the whole way back through
Android ten and I'm going to explain why
here in a second so I'm gonna go theme
and then I'm going to go light so that's
what I want to use right there now let's
just come in here and put a little
comment inside of here so that I can
explain what's going on
now theme light is just one of the
Android themes that are built-in so in
theme light is basically going to apply
to all API versions of Android older
than Android 3.0 as you're going to see
here in a moment when we create more of
these you're also going to have theme
holo and this is a cheat sheet this
isn't something you need to memorize
this was introduced in the Android API
11 and then what you may or may not be
used to using or seeing you also have
themed holo light dot dark action bar
and there are other other ones as well
and this was introduced in the API 14
which is what we are currently pretty
much using and as you can also see there
Android 4.0 also included the action bar
that's going to allow you to splay
buttons just like I showed you in a
previous tutorial whenever I covered the
action bar and we're going to come down
here and we're going to change this a
little bit we're going to come in here
and go app base theme and we're doing
this once again to make sure that this
is going to work with all these older
versions of Android okay and this is
basically something that I'm doing right
now just so that I can cover everything
and by changing this to app base theme
what we're saying here is that this
application is going to inherit the
theme based off of the android api
version on said device and that is the
reason why we're using theme light right
there what we're going to do here is
we're going to come in and do another
style and we're going to call this one
app theme and then we're going to say
that the parent is going to be app base
theme pose that off right there now
inside of here you're going to be able
to make customizations that won't be
specific to any API inside of this area
up here you can also make changes to the
overall application as well we're going
to focus in on here throughout most of
the tutorial but most of the changes I'm
going
make are actually going to be in API
version 14 as you're going to see in a
moment one thing we want to do also is
go over to the Android manifest and open
this up and you're going to see right
here is where we are going to define our
theme for our application and this is
just going to specify the theme that's
going to be used for this specific app
and as you can also see we're not going
to have to make any changes here now if
I want to be able to have my application
work for Android version 3 and prior and
also for the API 11 and 14 and
everything thereafter what I'm gonna
have to do is go over here and create
multiple different values folders now
make sure you create these values
folders in the resources folder we're
just going to go new and I'm going to go
directory and this guy is going to open
up now if I want to target the version
11 of our API I'm just going to go and
type in values - V 11 and go okay and
you can see if values V 11s there and
then I'm going to come in and go new and
I'm going to go file and this guy's name
is going to be styles.xml just like the
previous one and I'm going to hit OK now
to save myself a little time I'm just
going to come in here and I'm going to
copy all this and as you can see I'm
going to get the base theme name here
jump back over into our other Styles
folder and I'm going to go resources and
then inside of here I'm going to paste
this in and remember since this is going
to be version 11 in this situation I'm
going to use theme holo light this guy
right here jump back over into this guy
and then paste it in right there and
then inside of here what I'll be able to
do is make changes specific to the
Android any device any way using Android
API 11 through 13 the other one is going
to use 10 and backwards this guy right
here is going to be targeted at Android
API 10 and lower get back over here and
this is all that I need to do to make
this work automatically because all
these themes are built-in I'm also going
to create a folder in the resources
folder that is going to target version
14 of Android so create a new directory
see if you can guess what's going to go
inside of here it's going to be values -
V 14
like that click okay and there it is and
then I'm going to create a new file
inside of this new and file and guess
what this one's going to be called it's
going to be called styles dot XML and
then okay again there that is I just
come in here select this whole entire
thing paste this inside of here and in
this situation we are going to use theme
hallo light dot and remember this as the
action bar make sure you put a dot in
there dark action bar and there it is
and this is going to target API 14 plus
and whatever the highest folder is in
regards to version that is going to
target every API over 14 now what I'm
going to do is come over here to our
resources folder and go to layout and
activity my dog X ml is going to open up
and what I'm going to do here is create
a very simplistic application so that I
don't distract from what I want to
really focus in on here so we already
have a textview inside of here and I'm
actually going to committed the text
area and I'm going to change this name
another thing we can do before I do that
is over here in this display of what
your application looks like you can come
up here and click on the app theme area
and you'll be able to open up all types
of different themes to sample exactly
what they would look like so if I want
to see what holo light looks like I
would just click on this and then click
on OK and you're going to see how it
changed up here and I can come in and
click on this again
holo light dark action bar click on that
come down here click OK
and you're going to see we're back to
where we are and then you can see our
default light right here and click on OK
and you can see what that looks like so
that's going to be the older versions of
Android and let's go back inside of here
click on holo light dark action bar so
we're back to where we were again and
there that is click OK and there we are
again so this is going to be Android 14
and above then what I'm going to do is
go Android ID use code completion as
much as humanly possible
yeah let's just call this textview one
going to pop over into the design
section and I'm going to get myself an
editable text field this guy right here
and just drag this guy up here and drop
them anywhere come over into the
properties section I can change a whole
bunch of different things inside of here
if I'd like scroll down to text and I
could say something like enter here
come up here change this to match parent
there we go and there it fills the whole
entire screen and I can also just leave
the edit text as the name for my
editable text box and then I'm going to
go in and get myself another textview
plain text view grab that wrap it inside
of here
thumbs over inside of this and just let
the textview name be that ID or maybe I
want to change this to text view to
instead since I have the other one set
for one and that works go into the
design section grab another one plain
text view and I'm just dragging a whole
bunch of these out here so that I can
style them and to keep everything simple
at the same time and let's say I also
want to come in and get a button just
play around with that that's over into
the text tab right there and just make
sure everything has IDs and everything
does and that's good so now what we're
going to do is we're going to jump over
into styles.xml and this is going to be
the one that is specific to the one that
has the dark action bar which is going
to be Android 14 and above and I'm going
to come in here and just mess around
with a whole bunch of different styles
now inside of these style tag right here
or how are we specifically going to
change different styles well you just
type in item and in name and here is
where you're going to define the style
that you want to specifically change so
let's say that I want to change the
window background color for the whole
entire app just type in window
background and then close that off and
then inside of here let's just throw a
color inside and you're also going to
see over here it's going to show you
what that color is and if you're
wondering where exactly you find out all
these different things you can style you
just go to developer.android.com
reference Android our style able HTML
theme so let's say that for example I
wanted to change font colors and a whole
bunch of other different things this is
going to be a page you're going to look
at yourself to figure out this is a
little bit of learning curve but
basically every single thing you want is
going to be at this URL so for example
let's say I want to change the text
color for all widgets across the entire
app I just come inside of here and we're
going to use the item tag again and you
can see there are all of the different
changes I want to make and you can also
see over here the color I defined is red
and of course these are just hexadecimal
values and if we jump back over into
activity my well I have to change that
style and save at first and I'm going to
come up here and switch this to Nexus 7
which is something that I did
mine previously and you're going to see
that all of the colors for the whole
entire app changed as well as the
background color right there so let's
jump back over into styles.xml change a
couple other different things what I
decide to do this time is to make
changes to the font for the font family
and you can see right there that's where
it is and of course you can click on
this and find out more information about
different fonts that are available but I
went ahead and did that research for you
ahead of time and we can paste inside of
here and you're going to see all of the
different font family types you're going
to be able to use and in this situation
I'm just going to use sans serif and
it's going to give you a little error
here that says that you need to use API
level 16 but we're not going to worry
about that because I have all of this
information inside of the version 14
version right here as you can see so all
these changes will take effect for the
older versions Android the other ones
will just be neglected or ignored so
jump back over into here again and
you're now going to see that these are
bolded and you're also going to see
based off that URL that I mentioned
before you're going to be able to change
the font family the shadow color the
horizontal offset of the shout-out over
the vertical offset of the shadow and a
whole bunch of other different things to
design the exact theme using all of the
exact styles that you would like that's
a little bit advanced at this point in
time and it's kind of unlikely you're
going to go in there and make these
dramatic changes but at least whenever
you want to do that you're going to know
exactly how to do it another thing
that's interesting is you're going to be
able to define styles for single widgets
as well as multiple widgets and I'm
going to show you how to do that
basically you're just going to go
outside of the style tags and you're
going to create a new set of style tags
and for this one what I'm going to do is
I'm going to give it the name of
textview one close off that tag and then
again you're going to just create
different items for those specific
things that you want to change so we're
going to go item and we're going to go
name and so let's say that I want to
change the text size there that is and
then inside of this we're just going to
put say 30 SP come down here and let's
say that I want to create another change
so I'm going to go item again and this
time I want to change the text style and
again these are
in the property section for your
application so if you open this up and
you go into the design section what I'm
doing here is I'm editing all of these
guys right here that's what I'm changing
just doing it over in the style sheet
style and then close that off and let's
say that I want to make everything that
inherits this specific style 30 SP as
well as bold so save that then jump over
into activity my again and this time we
go into the text area right here and if
I want to add that specific style to
this text you
sorry about the wonky sort of back and
forth there I'm going to go style and
then inside of this I'm going to go at
style forward slash text view 1 if we
save that you're going to see that this
increased the size as well as made it
bold even though we already previously
made it bold so that's how you're going
to be able to specifically style very
specific widgets another thing we can do
over into styles.xml again is let's
create another style tag block and this
time I'm going to not only inherit a
style that I previously defined above
this one text view 1 but I'm also going
to go in and override parts of it now
just so you know you're not going to be
able to do this with android-specific
saved theme styles and you're only going
to be able to do them with your own so
just make sure you're aware of that so
we're just going to go style again and
this time I'm going to call this edit
text so you can do it even with other
different types of widgets they don't
specifically have to be only use text
view stylings you can use anything you
want we're just going to go parent is
equal to and we're going to define the
style text view 1 which is specifically
what we just created right above and
then let's say that we want this to be
item again and we want to override the
text styling instead of having it be
bold let's make it normal so the name
here again you're going to go Android
and textile close that off and let's
change that to normal jump over into
activity my and then let's create a
style for editable text box and you can
see over here the change as it's being
made its increase the size here just a
little bit editable text box this guy
right here specifically what we're going
to change so I'm going to go style
is equal to
at style forward slash edit text and
there you can see it increased the size
but it is not bold jump back over into
styles.xml and once again I'm using this
specific style this is where I'm making
all my changes so here we are again and
this time I'm going to both inherit as
well as add an additional style so go in
here create another style tag the name
for it is going to be text view 1 so I'm
going to inherit that style and then I'm
going to give it its own specific name
and that's going to be text view too now
for this guy what I'm going to do is I'm
going to inherit everything but I'm
going to add something on top of that so
I'll just go item again name and let's
say that I want to change the padding
specifically no problem and let's change
this to 30 DP save it activity go down
here into this text view and now in
activity my I'm just going to go style
again and at style forward slash and I'm
going to go to text view 1 dot text view
- it'll give you a little bit of an
error and you can see the changes made
to that text view so it has the
additional padding and it also inherits
both bold and then the very specific
size for that font of course back over
into styles and as long as you continue
adding periods you're going to be able
to add additional styles it's just the
way that it's all set up so let's go in
here go style again and yes you can go
text view 1 dot text view - make sure
you keep all the names exactly the same
and then go text view 3 and what
specifically we want to change this time
let's say we want to change well just
come in here go item again and let's say
with this new style we want to make a
change to the margin top I don't know
I'm just pulling this out of my head so
let's just go layout margin top close
that off and let's make this 15 DP and
then of course back over into the main
activity save ourselves a little bit of
time copy that bounce that in there and
then at the very end of this type in
period text you very save it and there
you can see that there is also a margin
change here
back over in styles.xml and just ticking
off each one of these another thing that
is very useful is to be able to come in
here and define styles that are going to
be applied automatically without you
needing to define styles over in
activity underscore my
and in that situation we just come in
here and go style again it's exactly the
same every single time except for the
name part we're going to call this
textview and the parent in this
situation is going to be Android style
for a / widget textview and then we can
define everything we want inside of this
just like we did before we'll just go
item again and then the specific name is
going to be let's say we want to go and
change the text size and let's change
that to 55 SP and then let's add another
item inside of this and let's say that
we also want to change the text style
and in this situation let's make that
bold and there you can see everything is
bold now and basically guys that is
everything you need to know about
changing styles inside of Android studio
and also creating your own personalized
themes once again get very acquainted
with this very specific URL and I'll put
a link to it in the description and
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
