20 of my android development for
beginners tutorial today I'm gonna
completely finish the App Inventor
contacts app so then you guys will know
how to do all bunch of things like pass
contact information across multiple
different screens have lists of lists of
contacts and do numerous different
things so I'm just gonna jump into it
and show you what the finished app is
gonna look like okay so here is the
application and of course I'm gonna be
able to enter in my name and I'll also
be able to enter in addresses and after
I do that I will be able to add the
contact and then we can see my contact
name right there and I'll be able to
click on it and I'll go over into a
totally different screen Paul this
information from a database if I want my
name to be capitalized I just click on
that and hit update and it's gonna
automatically be updated as you can see
right there and I will also be able to
come in and delete all the contacts so
it pretty much does everything so might
as well go and build it okay so you saw
the finished app and here it is again on
the design screen and of course these
are just simple buttons that are fill
parent and now we have the address line
inside of there but as you can see it's
just simple simple stuff so I'm not
gonna go into that and also I went and
created edit contact screen which you
also saw and it's gonna allow you to
come in here and enter a new name or
edit the name as well as the address and
update so a whole bunch of different
things and of course you could come in
here in that city state any type of
information you want as many as humanly
possible but first I need to get the
block set properly in screen one so
let's do that okay so pretty much I'm
just going to stream a conscious just go
through here and build the rest of the
application now for homework last time I
told you to go in here and figure out
how to add more information like city
and address and Street just like I did
here it's actually pretty easy I'm gonna
go in here I'm gonna duplicate this drop
it right there and this time I'm gonna
take whatever is in the address text box
and there we go that's it we got that
set and
and what we're gonna need to do a couple
other different things here so we'll be
able to communicate back and forth
between the two different screens one
thing I'm gonna need to do here is in
screen initialize I'm going to come in
here and also update a dull listpicker
just to make sure that that gets done so
update list picker drag that over there
drop it into place and there we go
update list picker another thing we're
gonna need to do is actually have the
list picker open up another screen
whenever it's used so that we can pass
the information over and edit contacts
if we want to so to do that I'm gonna go
into the list picker over here and click
on that and then I'm gonna come up here
and it's gonna go specifically to win
list picker after picking so after
somebody picked something I'm gonna come
in here and open up the other screen and
to open the other screen and also pass
information I'm gonna go into control
and the information I'm gonna pass is
the index for whatever item was picked
in the list picker so that you'll be
able to go in there and edit that
specific contact so we're to do that
we're gonna have to scroll way down here
to the bottom and get open another
screen with start value this guy right
here and drop it into place and I have
to give a screen name which is this guy
here if we just click Edit contact
screen right there so go over here and
type in edit contact screen and there we
go and drop it right there and the start
value that I'm going to pass over so
that we'll be able to find the proper
index is gonna be available with list
picker so I'm going to click on list
picker again and I'm specifically gonna
get selection index I'm have to zoom out
here selection index this guy right here
so that's gonna be whatever was picked
in the list picker and there we go
and now I'm gonna have to come in here
and handle what is going to occur
whenever the other screen is closed
which is gonna be where we're gonna be
editing things well I'm gonna click on
screen one right here and come over here
to other screen closed pull that out of
there drop it right here and of course
all these blocks are going to be
available in a link underneath the video
so what exactly do I want to do well I
basically want to go in
get data from the web cuz that data from
a web could have changed I'm also gonna
come in here and get the list picker and
make sure that it is updated so let's
just drag that out of there and
duplicate this and drag this out of
there and then the final thing that I'm
gonna want to do is update the name and
the address for the guy that's on our
screen and what I'm gonna do instead of
actually pulling that data from the
database I'm gonna make it blank
cuz I think that makes more sense I
might change my mind but in this
tutorial that's the way I'm gonna do it
so to make it blank I just have to find
set text for the name text box drop that
right there and I'm just gonna put a
quote and nothing and then I'm going to
duplicate this and do the exactly the
same thing for the address and there it
is and there it is okay and then the
only other thing I'm gonna have to do
and I really don't even need to do this
but I want to delete everything in the
database just to show you what that
looks like so I'm gonna go into the
delete button click on that and when
it's clicked bring it down here or drop
it right there and for this guy what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go over to
variables and set I'm basically going to
go to the lists that we have and we have
contact list this guy right there
and I'm going to make it an empty list
so come up here sorry about moving
around so much there we go
create empty list basically going to
delete that and then I'm gonna duplicate
this and make sure that our individual
which was like a temporary sort of
holding space is also empty and then I'm
going to make a call out to our tiny DB
our little database and make sure that
we store a value inside of there which
is going to be NTT contacts don't know
why I have a hard time Sante NTT
contacts and we are going to pass it
this empty list which is the contact
list right here I'm up here and
variables and get it very often whenever
I'm making these tutorials if you're
wondering well why do I scroll up and
down to get different information and
sometimes I go over to the little
sidebar and get information well I'm
just showing you multiple different ways
to get things so very often one
doing these tutorials it's not
necessarily indicative of things I do in
the real world okay and then I also want
to zero out my list picker so elements
from string and I'm going to give it an
empty string like this and there we go I
just did every single thing I need to do
with screen one to make everything work
exactly the way I want it to now I need
to go into the edit contact screen and
change everything over there and to do
that I'm just going to go up here to
screen one and edit contact screen
select that and here we are okay for
this guy basically let me just run down
what I need to do I'm gonna have to have
a list that's going to hold all the
contacts that I want to edit I'm also
all of the contacts in the entire
database I'm also gonna have another one
it's going to be the specific contact I
want to edit I'm also gonna have to get
the index that I want to edit
specifically and that's gonna be sent
over to this screen I'm gonna show you
how to do that and let's just leave it
at that for right now so I'm going to
come in here and create myself some
variables and drop that right there and
this very first one's gonna be contact
list to edit and that's gonna be an
empty list so get this guy right here
create empty list drop it right there
and I'm gonna have another one and this
is going to represent the individual
contact so I'm gonna call this contact
to edit and get rid of this two that
they put inside of there all right so
this is lists of Lists so list of
contact information inside of the master
list that holds all the contacts and I
need another space for the contact that
I need to actually edit so I'm gonna
come in here and grab this let's just
duplicate this except this is not going
to be a list just it's going to be a
number and I'm gonna call this contacts
index to edit and I'm gonna start it off
with a value of zero and drop it right
there the next thing I said I need to do
is get that start value whenever they
click on the list picker this screen is
going to be opened and I want to know
which specific name they clicked on so
to do that I'm gonna go into edit
contacts screen this guy right here and
more specifically I'm gonna get
initialize let's drop that there
and there we go and if I want to
actually get this value that was passed
over well I'm actually gonna store it in
this guy right here so drop that right
there and then if I want to get the
value passed over I know to control and
I have to zoom out a little bit gets
torque value there it is
and that's gonna be the index that they
clicked on in the list picker so now I
know what index I need to work with and
now what I'm gonna do is create a method
called get data from web to get that
data I might as well just come in here
and create that right now so there that
is and get data from web there it is and
to get that data remember we're going to
be using different screens but we're
gonna be sharing the same database where
actually anybody can get this
information if they know what keyword
phrase to use and specifically what I
want to get here is NTT contacts and
there we go that's gonna get me all the
information I'm gonna need and now I can
go to procedures get data from web and
put it right there with the initialize
guy right there so there you go now what
I want to do is of course figure out
what we need to do whenever we get our
data we're just gonna go got value got
that drop that right there and let's
talk for a second about what we're gonna
need to do here well the very first
thing I want to do is I want to check to
make sure that the data I got from the
database is actually a list then I want
to also make sure that it is called NTT
contacts and then I want to set the
contact list to edit this is gonna be
the master list that holds all the
contacts this guy right here and I am
also going to store inside of contact to
edit the part of this list that has this
index right here and then what I need to
do is actually fill in the name and the
address inside of this part of the
screen just like you saw whenever I
demonstrated the app all right so a lot
of if-then-else statements go into
control
if remember the very first thing i said
that i want to do is check if it is a
list and is a list thing there it is
right there drop it right there and I'm
gonna get the value get this drop it
right there and I'm just doing a lot of
double check
here so if and I am asking I'm making
certain that it actually says MTT
contacts I'm just doing this again just
to be very very careful I'm gonna
compare the text here compare text drop
this right there verify that it is equal
and duplicate and there we go and I'm
going to verify that the tag here is the
same actually for some reason I prefer
to have it this way I don't know why
just looks better that way okay so there
we go
now what I want to do is save the value
which is a list we know it is a list and
we want to save it in the master contact
list so get this drop it right there and
we're specifically gonna get the value
from the database so get that which is
just a list and then we want to also set
the contact that we're gonna be entering
so set this drop it right there we want
to select a specific part of it so
select item and we got the list and we
got the index we want to work with drop
that there the list that we're going to
be working with is gonna be the master
list so let's get this get there's the
list and the contact the specific index
we want is a scar here so there we go
now we got the specific contact we want
to work with so now we can go in and set
the values for the name text box and the
address text box so everything's falling
into place let's come in here zoom down
a little bit
set drop that there give myself some
extra space here and specifically to get
the list items I'm just going to
duplicate this drop that right there
this is the contact list to edit this is
the list that I want to use gonna get
rid of these two guys right here
oops duplicated it by accident let's
delete and delete and the list I want to
work with is the contact to edit this
guy right here and since I put the name
in first I'm going to type in a 1 here
I'm gonna get the first index and then
if I want the address that's no problem
just duplicate this drop it right there
zoom in change this to address and
change this to index 2 and it's all
gonna be based off of how the
information is added so you'll be able
to add 50 different pieces of
information about
contacts if you'd like alright so the
next thing I want to do let's go over
look at the designer for a second is
Handel exactly what happens when the
Update button is clicked on so jump back
over into blocks and for some reason I
just want to move this down here a
little bit so that I'll be able to work
closer with the variables at the top of
the screen there so move that down and
then I'm gonna go over here to update
button and do some things whenever this
is clicked on so put that over there now
the things I want to do is basically
whenever it's updated I just want to
replace the items in this master contact
list let's see here I don't zoom out
their contact list to edit we are going
to make changes to this and then we're
going to update this in bulk to the
database so that's how we're gonna
handle all of our updates so just need
to go over into lists and specifically
we need to replace items in our list so
replace a list item this guy right here
we know what we want to replace and we
also know what we want to replace it
with now since we're gonna be working
with individual contacts first we're
going to come in here and get the
contact - edits drop that right there if
we want to change the name while that's
an index one for every contact so get
this and put that there and then to get
the new name that we want to store
inside of there we're gonna go name
text-box and get whatever is inside of
that guy right there there we go want to
do the same thing for address just
duplicate this changed after two and
change this to address and then we have
to do a master replace which is
basically we're going to replace the
whole contact that's inside of there and
we're gonna still need contact to edit
we're not gonna need this guide and
we're not gonna need this guy the
contact to edits is gonna be what is
going to be replaced
right there the master list is this guy
up here contact list edit that's where
we're gonna be adding it and the
specific index we're going to be storing
it in is the contact list or the contact
index to edit so there it is contact to
edit is going to replace whatever
currently is in this index value in the
master contact list that holds all the
contacts then what we want to do is send
all that information of course back to
the database and also we're gonna close
the screen now to close the screen go
into control and specifically a closed
screen drop that right there and the
only other thing we're gonna need to do
now is create the procedure that's going
to store this new information on the
database and then we're all done so go
into procedures and I'm just gonna put
it right here don't get confused if on
my website where I have all these blocks
it's in slightly different places send
data to dB
all right so what do we need to do well
we're first gonna make sure that our
contact list edit isn't empty and then
we're gonna store it that's pretty easy
so yeah just drag it over here and drop
it right there we want to do a knot so
that means logic there we go drop that
right there want to check that the list
isn't empty is list empty and when we
put a knot inside of here to make sure
this comes back is true and then we want
to specifically get our contact list so
contact list edit and get so if this is
not empty well that means that it's okay
then to store information so we're gonna
go to the tiny web DB right here we're
gonna say we want to store some
information so we don't forget we're
also come over here and send data to
database make sure you put that before
the close screen otherwise that'll cause
problems tag we want to save with is NTT
contacts there we go and the data that
we specifically want to store is our
master contact less there we go so there
you go guys
there is the answer to the question I
got numerous times which is how to store
lists of lists on databases so hopefully
it answers a lot of your questions
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
