for my decision-making and meta
programming tutorial I want to start off
this tutorial because I've received a
lot of emails from you guys asking me
what the hell all this stuff means or
how is this useful well this tutorial
explains how a person's brain processes
information and why that's useful is by
presenting that information in the way
they process it makes the information
more believable it's as if the brain
says yes this is how i like to make
decisions so i should accept these facts
as true another example i wrote a sale
script for a local RV company in which I
taught the salesman to ask the questions
such as I will present to you in this
tutorial and in previous tutorials and
by doing so they were able to triple
their sales it's not real easy to sell
great big giant gas hog RVs right now
especially in the economy and just by
implementing these tools they were able
to triple sales in essence this tutorial
teaches you how to program a mind just
like you program a computer by issuing
very specific commands you can control
persons minds with the same write
commands so I hope that makes this more
understandable and not only is it
increase sales and increases managers
ability to get their workers that do
things that increases your ability to
get people to understand and accept the
different beliefs you have it's
all-encompassing and it's known as meta
programming so I'm going to continue in
this tutorial now after I've explained
what I'm doing on part 4 of the tutorial
by going over exactly how my brain
handles all these different things and
explain the different other ways that
people make decisions and then the
questions you need to ask to find out
how a person's brain works in this
tutorial we're going to specifically
focus on how we decide to respond
through communication and how we work
with others first we're going over the
recharging style people are either
extrovert introvert or balanced I
definitely imbalanced in this
personality style again because I work
on it I'm naturally an introvert what
that means though is that I get things
done and I'm charged up by being alone
instead of being with other people and
that
it would be an extrovert but I'm so
uncomfortable in situations in which
people are not talking I start
conversations immediately upon entering
a room everyone that I know thinks I'm
an extrovert I do get very charged up in
social situations but I'm also happy
when they are over there's a big
misconception that an introvert is
antisocial they just don't get energized
or relaxed around other people they feel
taxed just because you enjoy and get
your best work done while alone is not a
negative extroverts have tons of friends
and look for the outside world to
energize and entertain them these are
the shoot from the hip types it is to be
noted that while they have many friends
they normally have less deep
relationships than an introvert and to
find out who you're dealing with just
ask them when you need to calm down
after a long day do you prefer to take
some time alone or go out with friends
then you have the working with other
styles meaning whether a person prefers
to work on their own working teams or be
a leader I prefer to get my work done on
my own making me an independent I know
exactly what I need to do to get the job
done but I don't think it's worth my
time to get others to work meaning I
don't feel that it's part of my
responsibilities or it's a good use of
my time spending trying to get other
people to accomplish their tasks a team
player is comfortable with accomplishing
tasks with others because they expect to
reach a point in which they won't be
able to complete the task on their own
and 1 others to back them up a leader
knows how to accomplish their task plus
enjoys getting others to perform as well
now I'm not saying that every manager
out there fits this type I instead
saying that the best leaders possess
this quality to find out what
personality you're dealing with asks do
you value approaching a task on your own
or with a team and can you motivate
others to help you complete a task the
answers are self-evident now we'll go
into how a person expresses themselves
being either a blame or computer
distractor or leveler or play cater now
you know I'm being honest about my
results on this test not many people
would say this but I'm a distractor in
situations in which I'm on good behavior
I'm a leveller which I'll explain in a
minute a distractor style constantly
switches between all of the other styles
that's me one minute I'm a
that talks very carefully with little
emotion then I'm applicator that tries
to make everyone happy and if pushed
real hard I can become a blamer and lash
out so a distractor style is all styles
at once the perfect style is that of the
leveler they are always on an even keel
while being comfortable with their
emotions confident but also able to
disconnect from emotions when needed in
life we all strive to be levelers but
few of us will ever get there you can
normally spot how someone expresses
themselves after a short conversation
there are really no questions needed
here then you have your social
preparation styles being either active
reflective or balanced I actively
prepare for social situations and jump
in headfirst with little to no
preparation i'm referring to social
interactions that are spur of the moment
not preparation for a presentation in
front of a hundred people a reflective
style steps back and sizes up this
situation they may choose never to act
if it doesn't feel right and it often
doesn't they fear making mistakes and
may have issues with procrastination the
active on the other hand may make lots
of mistakes while being labeled a
chatterbox to find out the style just
ask in social situations do you actively
engage with many people or stick by
people that you know and you have your
chosen field style meaning either
information people planning or goals in
my chosen field I obviously focus on
information I'm most comfortable working
learning processing and simplifying
information others prefer working with
people they are most interested in the
feelings and thoughts of others above
all else they will go out of their way
to insert conversations in any activity
the planning style people are only
interested in crafting a plan that will
get the job done the people involved are
looked at as pawns in the system and
they don't see why they should
concentrate on feelings unless it messes
up the plant finally we have the goal
style they only see the finish line they
want the job done quickly and they often
don't care how it's done or who gets it
done to find the style and ask what is
it about your job that makes you the
happiest then you have the comparison
styles meaning either facts or feelings
I definitely compare things through the
use of numbers facts in expert opinion
if you are trying to convince me of
something you better bring all data
required to allow me to make an educated
decision others prefer to follow their
instincts and feelings they will
determine first whether they trust the
person providing the information
act accordingly everything to this
person feels right or wrong to find the
style ask how do you know that a product
represents quality then you have the
evaluating success style meaning either
authority research model learned or
experience I know that I've accomplished
something in the right way after I've
studied the process meaning i'm a
research type i talked my way through
the process and find my conclusions
there others will not assume success
unless an authority tells them how to
succeed once they believe someone is an
authority they will follow their plan
blindly the model style requires the
person to find someone who has succeeded
already at performing the act and
copying them exactly the learn style
will take from what they have learned in
school and hypothesize based off of that
knowledge what they should do and then
finally you have the experience style
requires the person to have already
performed the action before or an action
quite similar if they can't remember a
situation that they can use as a guide
they will have no idea whether they have
succeeded or not to find a style ask
when you have to perform a task what
information you trust to help you
succeed then you have the closure style
I definitely need closure in any
situation I will not leave anything
undone and love to complete tasks others
have no problem leaving a task
unfinished they figure that they can
come back to it later if something comes
up they more than likely prefer starting
projects but don't enjoy making sure
they're finished to find a style ask you
prefer starting projects or finishing
them then you have the impression styles
meaning either social or real I'm more
of a real style meaning when I go out in
public I dress for comfort and not to be
stylish this is all about how you
present yourself clothing wise and so
forth of course that changes if I'm
trying to impress someone but in general
i'm not very flashy others thinks it's
extremely important to always look their
best and judge others greatly by how
they look these people often are more
conservative and polite because they
don't want to say the wrong thing both
groups will label you if they don't
think you follow that which they feel is
the right way to dress or present
yourself to find the style asked you
value looking your best when going to
the grocery store or do you prefer to
just be you and we come to how people
act whenever aggression is pushed upon
them meaning they'll either compete
cooperate or focus on results when I'm
faced with aggression from someone I'm
trying to accomplish a task
I push forward to finish the job I know
people have different ways of
accomplishing a task and as long as it
gets done I don't care how we get there
others enjoy interjecting competition
into every act to prove that their way
is the right way they're most interested
in doing things their way and that
others know it finally you have those
that just want to get along with
everybody they will cooperate with
either other style as long as no
feelings are hurt in the final tutorial
on decision-making and meta programming
part 5 I will go over what we value and
how we see ourselves if you have any
questions leave in the comment section
