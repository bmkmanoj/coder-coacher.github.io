10 of my java algorithms tutorial today
we're going to talk about Java hash
tables and more specifically I'm going
to spend a lot of time on hash functions
and how they work
I'm going to present them in numerous
different ways and show you numerous
different code examples to make sure you
100% understand this so let's get into
it so what exactly is a hash table a
hash table is just a data structure like
anything else in this tutorial it's
probably better to think of it as an
array because I'm going to go through
this really slowly and completely build
up from the base what it does is it
offers very fast
both insertion as well as searching
however they're limited in size because
of like I said before it's based off of
an array it can however be resized but
of course that is to be avoided and they
are very hard to order so how to hash
tables and hash functions work together
well key values are going to be assigned
to elements in a hash table just think
array using a hash function and what a
hash function helps you do is calculate
the best index an item should go in now
of course the index must be small enough
so that it stays within the constraints
of the array size but also it can't
overwrite other data in the hash table a
hash functions basic job is to store
values in an array with a limited size
and it does it in a way that the array
doesn't need to be searched through
whenever the user decides to go and try
to find that information in the hash
table so this allows you to enter values
in any order and be able to find them
using a calculation instead of searching
through the array and that is why they
are very fast so basically if you have
your little guy here and he wants
information that was stored in a hash
table and he has a very specific non
duplicate ID for that information that
ID is going to go through a calculation
and that calculation is going to provide
the exact index for that information
then it goes directly to that location
in the array
or the hash-table and sends the
information back to the user that is in
essence what a hash function and how a
hash table functions so let's go and
look at some code and of course all of
the code in this video is available to
link underneath the video so and of
course it's free and you should get it
because it is very heavily commented all
right so we're gonna create our array
because that's in essence what we're
dealing with here also gonna monitor
array size and even though I don't think
I'm going to use it in this part of the
tutorial I'm also going to store the
items in our array then I'm going to
create my constructor for this and I
just called this hash function because
that's really what we're gonna be
focusing on and it's we're going to
receive a size for our array and then we
are going to store that array size of
course and we are also going to create
our array with that specific size I'm
going to show you two different hash
functions in this tutorial and I'm going
to store negative one in every single
one of the indexes in this array to
start out so that we'll be able to see
which parts are empty and of course you
wouldn't do this in a real world but I
just did this so I can display array
index information whenever I execute
these functions and you can see down
here display the stack that is some code
I wrote that's just going to help us
learn exactly what's going on with hash
tables and we're going to look at both
how to insert items into a hash table as
well as how to find them now to start
this guy off I'm going to start with a
very simple hash function and it is a
hash function even though it's a bad one
what it's going to do is put values in
the same index that match their value so
if the value is one it's going to store
it in index one and then I'm going to
show you a little bit more fancy one and
this guy is going to receive a string
and this is going to be a string of
numbers that are going to be stored in
the array and this is a hash function
right here then what we're going to do
is go in n is equal to 0 and less than
strings for array it's just an array
that's going to have a whole bunch of
values that you want inserted into your
regular array
here I'm going to go string new element
value and here I'm going to take the
information that is stored inside of the
array that's passed over you move that
up a little bit and then array all I'm
doing here is taking whatever is stored
in the array value wise and I'm storing
it in that index so this very
specifically is the hash function part
of this function now of course we're not
going to be able to have any duplicates
here and now let's go up here into main
and then start executing some things I'm
just going to call this the func and
we're going to create a array with 30
empty spaces in it then we're going to
create a string array that's going to be
the elements to add to our main array
this guy right here and of course in
this situation it's going to have to be
limited to 0 up to 30 in regards to the
values that are entering actually it's
gonna have to be limited to 29 so I'm
just going to take some junk values
throw them in there and remember no
duplicates then we're going to say the
func asks function 1 and inside of this
we're going to pass elements to add and
I'm also going to pass along the
function itself with the array and then
after we got all that done the func
and I want to display I have this cult
display the stack that it should be
called display the hash table and
execute and as you can see all of the
values were inserted in exactly the same
index as the values themselves so very
simple but this is a hash table this is
exactly what a hash table does the only
difference is the complexity of the
calculation that is it that is hash
table we just made a hash table it's not
a particularly wonderful one so now for
our second example let's say we're going
to make a more complicated hash table
I'm actually just gonna copy this right
here I'm gonna call this hash function
too now let's say we have to hold values
between 0 and 999 but we never plan to
have more than 15 values total stored in
any array now it wouldn't make sense to
make a 1,000 item array just to be able
to use our previous hash funk
so what exactly are our other options
well one way that we can fit these
numbers into a thirty item array is to
use the mod function and all you're
going to need to do is take the modulus
of the value whatever value we have here
zero through 999 and take the modulus of
that value versus the array size to make
sure that it fits in one of the indexes
in our array and in judging on the size
that our hash table or our or our array
needs to be the goal is to make the
array big enough to avoid collisions
which you're going to see what that is
in a second but not so big that we waste
memory so what this guy's gonna do it's
gonna also have a for loop inside of it
and we're going to do something very
similar strings for array length we're
gonna cycle through the array that's
passed over course at that lower case
we're going to keep inserting them as
long as we have additional values to
insert and I'm going to show you what
collisions mean here in a second it just
means you're trying to throw something
into an index that already has something
that's all collision is that doesn't
make sense though I'm going to show you
exactly what it is and again we're going
to do exactly the same thing we're going
to extract the actual value from the
array that's passed over in this
situation then we need to create an
index to store the value in by taking
its modulus array index and modulus is
just going to guaranty for us that it's
not going to be bigger than 30 go parse
int go new element value and modulus 29
and then let's say that I want to print
out some information here on exactly
what's going on so the modulus index is
equal to array index for value we're
going to be able to watch this
information gets sent into this because
it's a little bit more complicated and
then I want to cycle through the array
until we find an empty space and how I'm
going to do that is go while the array
array index is not equal to negative 1
remember when I create this array I put
negative 1 and every single one of these
guys again that's just there to help me
be able to display things well then I
want to increment to the next index
in the Arai and what this means is a
collision occurred which means that we
tried to put information in an index in
the array that already has information
in it we're just going to print that out
and then of course if we get to the end
of our array we want to cycle back to
the zero index and of course this goes
outside of that area and then if we get
down here we know that we found an index
where we can store our value so we do so
now let's go back up into main and
execute this guy okay so these are going
to be the elements that I'm going to add
into it and you can see there's exactly
30 items so that we can guarantee
they'll be collisions and then what I'm
going to do pretty much the same thing
I'm just going to execute it on our new
function set that to two and then set
this two elements to add two I'll save
and execute and you can see right there
all of our items are inserted into our
hash table and you can see collisions so
after the modulus calculation the value
for 100 was inserted in index 13 5 10
over here was inserted in index 17 so
forth and so on so let's say we got 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 values were inserted
before we had a collision right here we
had a collision because 235 was already
inserted in index 3 that's what a
collision is so what are we gonna do
we're gonna try 4 instead as you can see
there is no 4 so it has no problem going
into index 4 and if we have 6 99 come
down here into the our actual array you
can see it is in index 4 and that is
precisely what it does and this is also
why you want to make sure that your
arrays or at least twice as large as the
number of values you ever want to put
into them because you can see how many
collisions are going on right here
pretty messy so now that you know how to
insert information into a hash table
let's go through how to find information
in a hash table okay so let's go right
down here after function to and this is
going to be public
it's going to return a string and I'm
going to call this fine key going to
receive a string key that is going to be
searching for it's going to be searching
in the hash table that we just created
there so what we want to do here first
off is find the keys original hash key
and how we're going to do that I'm going
to call this guy array index and this is
the calculation that's going to help you
go directly to the index where the
information was stored instead of
messing around we're going to go parse
int and we're going to enter the key
which is like an ID modulus 29 which is
exactly what we did up here say modulus
29 so this is going to allow us to go
directly to the first place they tried
to put the information then what I'm
going to do is start cycling through
this and look for a match so I'm going
to go the array array index hash while
this is not equal to negative one which
means it's empty
then I must say if the array index is
equal to the key the unique key that all
these are going to have well this means
that I found the key so I'm gonna print
out some information here I'm gonna say
was found in index array index hash
right like that and I'm also going to
return the array the value itself now if
it didn't match I just want to look in
the next index
all right index hash and increment it
because that's exactly how I put the
information in and if we get to the end
of the array I want to make sure that I
go back to 0 and is just done like this
with your right size otherwise we get
down here we're going to return null and
that just means we couldn't find it so
now let's go up here see how exactly
this is going to work go right after
this where we inserted our values and
let's say that we want to find 660
inside of this just go like this
and then I'm going to go find key right
like that and just type in 660 and
execute and you can see 660 was found in
index 26 if we come down here to index
26 you can say 660 so there is a basic
introduction to hash tables and hash
functions in the next part of the two
Rowman to cover even more complex
examples on hash tables and hash
functions please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
