you how to set up a forum or a social
network inside of wordpress and a ton of
other things i'm going to show you how
to set it up so that people can log in
using their Facebook IDs how to allow
them to share pretty much any type of
content and a whole bunch more first I'm
going to do I'm using godaddy for this
because this is who I use but you can do
this pretty much with any hosting
company this is the standard way that
you would go and have WordPress
automatically installed on your site
inside a godaddy I'm going to click on
account and then I'm going to click on
hosting over on the left side of the
screen right here and what that's going
to do is it's going to open a page on
the screen that looks like this going to
find which ever site you want to install
WordPress on and then you want to come
over here to launch and click on that
button then you're going to see a page
that looks like this what you're going
to do is in this situation click on
applications in the upper right hand
corner then for godaddy you're going to
click on WordPress right here it's going
to open up a page it looks like this and
you're going to come down here and click
on install now and you're going to find
whichever domain you want to install
WordPress on and put a little tick in
the radio button and if you can't see
this you can watch this full screen
because it's a high definition video and
this is the important part and something
that people mess up all the time you
want to define where or what directory
you want WordPress installed and it make
sure it's not in the one where you
currently have a wordpress site or it's
going to overwrite it and I just put a
directory in here called forum and then
I'm going to click on next then here
you're going to find you're admitting
you're going to give yourself a pass
where you're going to type in your email
address and the name that you're going
to use for your WordPress site in this
situation its new think tank forum and
then hit finish and then you're going to
be presented that the WordPress
installations been submitted and you
have to wait a little bit it normally
takes about 10 minutes and then
WordPress will be installed and whenever
you go to the installation area where
you have put it WordPress and you're
going to have to define your site name
type in your username and your password
and your email address and hit install
WordPress and that is it once you do
that WordPress will be a hundred percent
installed and now I'm going to show you
how to install a plug-in called
buddypress and this is version 1.5 so
this is the newest newest newest version
of buddypress and it's real simple sooo
here make sure you can see what I got
here I want to come down to plugins and
click on add new and you're just going
to type in body press search plugins all
right there's buddypress and click on
install now so simple hit OK and it's
going to download everything on packet
for you and install it and then start
using it you just have to click on
activate plugin and buddypress is all
set up there and now down in the bottom
left-hand corner you're going to see
buddypress listed you want to click on
that guy and now you have to go through
the whole installation process which is
pretty much hit ins save and next over
and over and over again we're going to
keep everything here exactly the same
and hit save and next men through here
you don't need to do anything else so
we're just gonna hit save and next on
pages permalinks in this situation i am
going to come in here and switch it to
month and name so it's a little bit more
friendly in regards to search engines
and hit save and next theme i'm going to
use the buddypress default i'm not going
to change that and hit save and next and
that is it i'm gonna hit finish and
activate now we have all that set up
inside of here then imma come over here
and hit forums and this is a brand new
feature here this is site-wide forums
and i'm gonna show you how to set that
up you just come in here and hit install
site-wide form since it's super super
simple and then hit install now boom hit
activate plugin alright so that's now
all set up so let's go over here and
take a look at it and you can actually
look at this it's at new think tank
comms forward slash forum so here's just
the beginnings of the whole entire site
doesn't look all that fancy there's
actually nothing on it because this is a
brand new installation so there's really
no members there's no nothing there's no
reason to be actually if there was a
member on there'd be a little bit
frightened we're just going to jump back
inside of here and I'm going to set it
up so people couldn't actually log in so
I'm going to come down to settings
inside a wordpress and I'm come down to
general click on that and then I'm going
to set it up so that anyone can register
and I'm going to leave them as
subscribers no more power than that and
I'm gonna hit Save Changes now people
are actually going to be able to
register and sign up to become members
of your site which is a nice thing this
is the normal way of setting this stuff
up so that's why I'm doing it when I am
and I'm just going to call this news i'm
just going to hit publish that's all I
needed to do now I'm going to come down
here again to settings and I'm going to
come under reading and click on that and
here I'm going to say that I want to set
my static page my front page is going to
be
activity and my post page is going to be
news which I just created and I'm gonna
hit Save Changes ok so now I'm going to
go over exactly what you can do in
regards to profile fields inside of this
little forum we have inside of wordpress
so if you click on body press your left
sidebar and click on profile fields you
can define certain things that are going
to be required for the person n or if
they want to sign up to use your forum
by default they're required to enter
their name and of course you could
change this and also by hitting add new
field you could require them to enter
some other information so let's say
country for example country you live in
alright then you say is this field
required field type text box i'm just
going to leave it that way and hit save
so now if we jump out to actually look
at our forum you're gonna see right here
if I log out what somebody's going to
see whenever they come to your page and
they are currently not a member I'm
going to quit have to click on create an
account over here on the right side bar
and then create a username type in an
email address and create a password as
well as name and country because that's
the way I defined it and if they do that
then everything will be set up but what
would be kind of neat also is you could
set this guy up so that it works if the
person is using their wordpress account
for example or their Facebook account a
log back in to this guy all right and
how we're going to do that because I'm
going to come over to appearance i'm
going to go over to widgets and let's
say we want to give them the option to
log in with their wordpress account if
they already have that it's real simple
and a grab text arbitrary text and HTML
or HTML and we want to create register
with wordpress account just call it that
register for this forum using wordpress
say that for example and then we'll put
an option inside of here that they can
go over to wordpress com and retrieve
their may be lost login information or
what have you just go to http www
wordpress.org a forward slash to port
forward slash register dot PHP so then
if they click on that what that's going
to allow them to do is log into their
wordpress account or create an account
or do whatever you want that's kind of
neat nice option to have there's all
kinds of other different things you can
drag over here in regards to widgets i'm
going to close that and if you'd like
them to be able to
log in using their Facebook account
while you're going to have to go get
yourself a plug-in so going to plugins
and click installed plugins or add new
and then type in WP FB dash auto connect
here it is when just click install now
and hit OK and it's installed so hit
activate now what you're going to have
to do is you absolutely have to set up
this whole entire thing using Facebook's
real simple don't worry about it but
we'll come down here to where we just
created this WPF be auto connect and go
to settings and what you're going to
want to do and there's directions right
here but I'm going to show you how to do
this because it's so so so simple if you
go to developers facebook com and if you
click here or you click on apps and you
do not have an account with this page
the deface book developers page it's
going to ask you if it's okay to connect
those two things with Facebook just say
yes just like you do all the other times
and then whenever you click on apps
right here you're going to come to a
page you're probably not going to have
anything on the Left sidebar unless you
already remember it facebook developers
but then you want to click on create a
new app and whenever you do that you're
going to see a page that looks pretty
much like this and then you want to give
your app a name as you see right here so
i just called this new just in forum and
then you have to put your email address
in then you have to put the domain that
you're going to be hosting this apple on
and then you have to say the exact
location for where this guy is going to
be well quite simply I just jump over
here and type in that app ID as well as
my app secret ID and now you're going to
see log in with facebook is now an
option just after doing that little bit
so somebody's going to be able to come
to your forum even if they don't have
any login credentials and hit login with
facebook and just that easily you can
allow them to be a member on your forum
without them having to give you any
private information though so that's
also really really cool i'm going to log
back in and I'm going to do one really
more cool thing here i'm going to show
you another plug-in that's going to
allow you to enter really cool
information inside of buddypress so
we're going to go to plugins add new
again and just go inside of here and go
Oh embed or buddypress its search
plugins install now it okay activate
plugin and that guy set off and what's
cool about that is if I go back to my
forum again and let's say for example I
wanted to take this video that I hadn't
previously made on YouTube but I wanted
it to display inside of here so people
could see it and do whatever they want
with it now since I just put that
plug-in in there if I paste this link
inside here and hit post update it's
automatically going to put that video
right in there for other people to watch
and then of course there's forum area
for the website there's groups you can
set up groups you can see all the
members on your forum if you like i said
if you want to play around with this
thing it's new think tank column forward
slash forum i don't know how long I'm
going to keep it up but what the heck
you can go over there and see if it's
there and you can become a member and
play around with it and do whatever you
want with it doesn't cost anything of
course so that is how you set up a forum
/ social network with a whole bunch of
really cool tools inside of wordpress
