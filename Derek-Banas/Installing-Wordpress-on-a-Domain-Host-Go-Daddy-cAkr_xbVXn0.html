affordable website that search engines
will love today I'm going to cover
installing WordPress on a godaddy hosted
sites this is the long hard way to
install WordPress but we're going to
cover it because this is the normal way
that most domains require you to install
WordPress if you do not have them
install it for you what you'll need you
either need to go daddy or a similar
hosting site you'll need text editing
software and if you're on bc microsoft
notepads best and if you're on a
macintosh mac text at its best don't use
microsoft word however you'll also need
a program called filezilla i'm going to
use this because it will allow me to
describe how to upload files on all
domains not just go daddy this is a
little bit of look the long way around
uploading files but I'm doing it for
that reasoning you can download
filezilla it filezilla dashed
project.org you're going to be wordpress
and you can download that add
wordpress.org and you're going to need a
secret key for wordpress and I'll get
into that a little bit later just so you
know this is the basic process no matter
what to mean you would install wordpress
on you need to set up a private hosted
domain in my circumstance godaddy
download all required downloads I just
told you everything the previous part in
that you're going to need to download
you're going to need the login to your
account you're going to need to create a
database and that is super simple make
changes to a wordpress text file you're
going to upload that folder to a hosted
account in my circumstance godaddy
you're going to log into more press
administration area you are essentially
done so let's get into it first just
want to let you know this is
wordpress.org and this is what you would
click to download WordPress those two
buttons right there
this is filezilla project org and you
click this to download the client and
then choose whichever version you need
if you're on Windows you're going to
click on this link right here and it's
going to stall filezilla right for you
so we don't need that anymore we don't
need this anymore we're going to leave
the key for a little bit later now back
to and good at you're going to type in
your user ID and your password okay go
now what you're going to do is click go
over here and click on hosting now
you're going to pick where you want to
install WordPress and click on manage
account going to open that a separate
box now what you're going to do is go up
here to databases and click on my SQL I
already have some in here but I'm going
to go to create database now here for
description i'm going to type in
wordpress database and your username
this is going to be very important i'm
going to type in my name and i'm going
to type in a password and then i need to
confirm that password ignore this
information out here will appear leave
my SQL persian selected at spot down
allow direct database access make sure
this says no and of course Wintermute a
big password it's going to give you a
rating say how strong it is and you're
going to go down here and click OK and
whenever you do that I already have this
setup you are basically going to see a
window it's going to look like this and
it's going to load and we're going to
come back to that in a second consume as
blows let's go back into your starboard
press into a folder I am assuming
here's my order with WordPress in it and
I'm going to go here to WP config sample
dot PHP that is the important part and I
want to open that in a text file edit
until whenever you do that you're going
to come you're going to open up for the
text file and you're going to see here
database name you're going to type in
there the database name that you entered
on previous screen the database user if
you followed my directions is going to
be the same as the database name your
password is going to be whatever you
typed in there and this information we
should have ready for us if we jump out
back over into the hosting center and
yes we do you're going to want to copy
this information where it says host name
copy that jump over in the text ebony
and paste it right here that information
then what you're going to want to do is
scroll down here number i said there's a
secret key you're going to have dinner
well you just have to go to this address
right here and its api wordpress.org
forward slash secret cache key forward
slash 1.1 /and you want to copy this
information that's right here
authorization keys to represent a
logging teeth and the other team jump
back in the text edit go down here you
can see that this information in your
text editing tool is precisely the same
it just requires you to enter the Cape
the only thing I would say to just make
sure that whenever you select the key
in your browser that you do not select
these two quotes because you don't want
to have double quotes in there you will
just copy them and save that is key as
said and you're going to want to file
save you're going to want to chop the
ending off of this and call it dot PHP
as you can see here you're on a Mac
we're going to want to set this to utf-8
if you're on a PC more than likely
you're going to want to select the box
that says text files you want to switch
that to all files this is another look
at this box so it's going to be WP dash
config.php and you're going to click on
save my circumstance and I'm going to do
that close that now what we're going to
do is go to your trusted filezilla which
you downloaded I would hope and here
you're going to type in whatever your
host name is so it's going to be
whatever your domain name com or the
likely your user ID and your password
and then port 21 this is going to stay
the same yeah click on quick connect
when I did that successfully up here in
this box you're going to find the
location for your WordPress file that
you just downloaded on your computer and
where you just save the previous text
file you're going to want to go over
here if you don't have it already set up
you don't want to right click in this
area and create a new directory maybe
titled blog I've already done this you
can see it right here once I do that and
I have WordPress selected I'm going to
want to select all of these files like
this
and then I want to upload them and
they're all he's going to take a little
bit of time they're all going to upload
over into this directory over here we
have everything pretty much set up now
you have all of your files uploaded
everything is all edited everything is
pretty much ready to go now what you're
going to need to do is go to in my
circumstance this is going to be sleep
up here a little bit this is my domain
name / blog /w fiat min forward slash
install PHP you're going to want to go
to this address except this is going to
be your domain name you want to type in
your blog title when you want to type in
your email and then you want to leave
this check word says allow my blog type
your search engines and click on install
WordPress then it's going to
automatically give you a username admin
in this circumstance and it's going to
give you a password you're going to want
to copy that password and then click on
login now this as your number for this
item in this is your password want to
type that in in my case I'm going to hit
remember me and click on login
and you are on the dashboard and
everything has been taken care of for
you and that is basically it that's the
long and hard way to install wordpress
