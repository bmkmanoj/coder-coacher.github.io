affordable website that search engines
will love today I'm going to cover
installing wordpress on godaddy hosted
sites this is the long hard way to
install WordPress but we're gonna cover
it because this is the normal way that
most domains require you to install
WordPress if you do not have them
install it for you what you'll need you
either need to go daddy or a similar
hosting site you'll need text editing
software and your own PC Microsoft
notepads best Macintosh math text at its
best
don't use Microsoft Word however you'll
also need a program called FileZilla I'm
going to use this because it allows me
to describe how to upload files the long
way around uploading files but I'm doing
it for that reason
- project.org you're gonna need
WordPress and you can download that at
wordpress.org and you're gonna need a
secret key for WordPress and I'll get
into that a little bit later just so you
know this is the basic process no matter
what domain you would install WordPress
on you need to set up a private hosted
domain in my circumstance GoDaddy
download all required downloads I just
told you everything the previous part in
that you're gonna need the download
you're gonna need the login to your
account
you're gonna need to create a database
and that is super simple make changes to
a WordPress text file you're going to
upload that folder to a hosted account
in my circumstance GoDaddy
you're gonna log in more at Preston
ministration area you are essentially
done so let's get into it first just
want to let you know this is
wordpress.org and this is what you would
collect to download WordPress those two
buttons right there
this is FileZilla - project.org and you
click this to download the client and
then choose whichever version you needed
here on Windows you're gonna click on
this link right here and it's going to
stall FileZilla right for you so we
don't need that anymore we don't need
this anymore we're going to leave the
key for a little bit later on now back
to me
GoDaddy you're gonna type in your user
ID and your password go now what you're
gonna do is click on hosting
now you're gonna pick where you want to
install WordPress and click on manage
account gonna open that a separate box
now what you're going to do is go up
here to databases and click on my SQL I
already have some in here but I'm gonna
go to create database now here for
description I'm gonna type in WordPress
database and your username this is going
to be very important I'm gonna type in
my name and I'm gonna type in a password
and then I need to confirm that password
ignore this information out here go up
here leave my SQL version selected it's
fine allow the record database access
make sure this says no and of course
whenever you type in password it's going
to give you a rating say how strong it
is and you're gonna go down here and
click OK and whenever you do that I
already have this set up you are
basically going to see a window it's
going to look like this and it's going
to load and we're gonna come back to
that in a second as soon as it loads
let's go back in to start WordPress into
a folder I am assuming
here's my folder with WordPress in it
and I'm gonna go here to WP config -
sample dot PHP that is the important
part and I want to open that in a text
file editing tool
whenever you do that you're gonna come
you can open up a text file and you're
gonna see here the database name you're
going to type in there the database name
that you entered on previous string the
database user if you followed my
directions is going to be the same as
the database name your password is going
to be whatever you typed in there and
this information we should have ready
for us if we jump back over into the
hosting Center and yes we do you're
going to want to copy this information
where it says hostname copy that jump
over in the text ebony and paste it
right here that information then what
you're going to want to do is scroll
down here number I said there's a secret
key you're gonna have better well you
just have to go to this address right
here and it's API wordpress.org forward
slash secret stash key forward slash 1.1
forward slash and you don't want to copy
this information that's right here
authorization keys through our
authorization key logging T and the
other team jump back to the text edit go
down here you can see that this
information in your text editing tool is
precisely the same it just requires you
to enter in the cave it's the only thing
I can say to you is make sure that
whenever you select click feed
in your browser that you do not select
these two quotes because you don't want
to have double quotes in there you would
just copy them and save those key I've
said and they're gonna don't want to
file save you don't want to chop the
ending off of this and call it dot PHP
as you can sit here you're on a Mac
we're gonna want to set this to utf-8
and if you're on a PC more than likely
you're going to want to select the box
that says text files and you want to
switch that to all files this box so
it's gonna be WP dash config dot PHP and
you're gonna click on save my
circumstance and what is that now what
we're gonna do is go to your trusted
FileZilla which you downloaded I would
hope and here you're going to type in
whatever your host name is so it's gonna
be whatever your domain name.com like
your user ID and your password and then
for 21 this is going to stay the same
yeah click on quick connect and I did
that successfully up here in this box
you're gonna find the location for your
WordPress file that you just downloaded
on your computer and where you just
saved the previous text file you're
gonna want to go over here if you don't
have it already set up you don't want to
right click in this area and create a
new directory
maybe titled blog I've already done this
you can see it right here once I do that
and I have WordPress selected I'm gonna
want to select all of these files like
this
and then I want to upload them and
they're all gonna it's gonna take a
little bit of time they're all gonna
upload over into this directory over
here we have everything pretty much set
up now you have all of your files
uploaded everything is all edited
everything is pretty much ready to go
now what you're going to need to do is
go to in my circumstance this is going
to be zoom up here a little bit this is
my domain name slash blog forward slash
wp-admin forward slash install PHP
you're going to want to go to this
address except this is going to be your
domain name you're going to type in your
blog title what do you want to type in
your email and then you want to leave
this check word says allow my blog so
here in search engines and click on
install WordPress then it's going to
automatically give you a username admin
in this circumstance and it's going to
give you a password you're going to want
to copy that password and then click on
login
now this admin this is your password
want to type that in in my case I'm
going to hit remember me and click on
login
and you are on the dashboard and
everything has been taken care of for
you and that is basically it
that's the long hard wait or install
wordpress on godaddy i'm gonna post
underneath this video how to set up work
for us on how their domains as well I
hope that helps ya if you have any
questions leave com thank you and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
