the tutorial I showed you how to create
a custom dungeon and Dragons fighter and
a lot of you guys said you'd like me to
create a wizard this time because it's a
little bit more complicated so in this
tutorial I'm going to create a wizard
I'm gonna focus more in on just filling
out the data on the character sheet so
that there's not any other information
there and if you want to see the more
detailed explanation how the character
sheet works on what saving throws me in
an AC and DC and all those different
things look in the description and I'll
have a link to the previous part of the
tutorial but just like before on the
left side of the screen we're gonna have
our basic rules which are free and
there's a descriptors a link to that in
the description as well and on the right
side of the screen we're going to have
our character sheet and I'm gonna fill
everything out here live on the screen
no the only thing you need to know if
you didn't watch the previous tutorial
is when I talk about ad for this is ad
for whenever you roll it whatever the
number on top is is going to be what the
role is so that would be a 2 we're also
gonna have D sixes which is its regular
old die you're gonna have d 8 which are
going to be like diamond shaped and the
biggest number is going to register what
type of dice it is this is the D 10
doesn't have a 10 on it but it does have
0 we're also gonna have d twelves
biggest number is 12 and then the big
guy is going to be the d 20 there it is
I got it on the screen and there is a
d20 so now I'm gonna jump over and start
making our wizard okay so this time
we're gonna build a wizard and I have
the basic rules over here on the left
side of the screen and I'll provide a
link in the description to how you can
get those on the right I have a
character sheet and I'm gonna be filling
everything out here now in the first
character creation tutorial I made I
covered what saving throws our normal
class and all that stuff this time I
just want to make it very simple and
just go in and fill the character sheet
out so that it isn't confusing and it's
quick so what we're gonna do here is I'm
gonna start off with things that I
absolutely know so class level for
example a class and level I want a
wizard and it is going to be level 1 and
crown'd I haven't covered yet and
playername that's me I'll just fill that
in there a moment my race information
well hi elfs are very good in regards to
being wizards so I'm gonna pick a high
elf or wizard of course you can pick
completely anything else and you don't
even have to be creating a wizard to you
know go through this tutorial experience
points as well or going to start off at
zero so I'm just gonna come in here and
throw a zero inside of there and I'll
fill in alignment whenever I get to that
later on proficiency bonus is always
going to start off with plus two so
we'll fill that in and now we come to
our ability scores and that is gonna be
found on page seven of your basic rules
and I'm just gonna use the standard here
instead of rolling for them so we have
15 14 13 12 10 and eight and I'm gonna
pick them based off of what works best
for wizards so I'm gonna come in here
strength doesn't really matter for
wizards so I'm gonna put an eight inside
of there for my strength the most
important is intelligence which is going
to be my spell modifier for casting my
spells so I'm gonna put my 15 inside of
their Constitution I want to keep my
wizard alive and so I'm gonna put 14
inside of there then I'll go in with
dexterity at 13 and then wisdom and
charisma is basically going to be
determined based off of which of these
things here you want to focus in on so
whatever your skills you want to hype
those up that's what you're gonna put
there I'm gonna put a 10 in for wisdom
and a 12 in for charisma to store it off
and now it's going to be time for us to
add our race data and that is going for
the elves is going to start on page 14
so I'm gonna go there and we come to our
elf names and I am just going to come in
here and pick whatever sounds good so go
Kerrick Anastacia so I got my name
inside of here and then we're going to
scroll down into the next page you're
gonna see elf traits and you're gonna do
the same thing for every one of these
guys so I see here ability score
increase your dexterity score increases
by two so that means I'm going to come
over here
and I'm gonna change this to 15 instead
of 13 so I've got that all set up speed
is going to be 30 feet put 30 feet
inside of there I'm using skim if you're
wondering what software I'm using over
here on the right side of the screen
that's what this is and then we come
down to dark vision and you're going to
put those over in your features and
traits area so for this I'm gonna say
dark vision and I'm just put an
abbreviated version of this dim lights C
60 feet in dark C as if in dim and after
you play this game for a while you'll
just know what dark vision is and you
can just write dark vision there but
we're not certain yet then we come down
into keen senses you have proficiency in
the perception skill and that just means
that I want to come over here and here
I'm gonna put a little mark inside of
here for perception and with this and we
grab this guy here and just draw a
little mark inside of there and I'll
know to increase that by two whenever I
fill out my skills data then I get Fae
ancestry so again we're going to be
adding that over into features and
traits again I'm just going to put an
abbreviation of this Fae ancestry and
advantage on charm save magic can't put
to sleep once again we're going to go
into trance and say gain same benefit
from four hours of sleep as eight hours
then come down into this area and I'm
going to add in my languages some to
know actually I'm gonna end up having a
ton of languages so I'm gonna put calman
and elvish and then comma there's gonna
be more to come after that and then we
get into the high elf specific data that
we have here and ability score increase
your intelligence score increases by one
so we'll come in here and change this to
16 elf weapon training you have
proficiency with longbow short bow short
but blah blah blah okay so we got that
stuff so I'm going to leave some space
inside of here for my additional
languages that are going to be coming
I'm gonna go longsword short sword short
bow long bow and we will be adding
additional proficiency weapons as well
as we continue on even though we're not
really gonna use them you also see here
you know one can strip of your choice
from the wizard spell list and what this
means is it's going to as a high elf
you're gonna get an additional canned
trip and it's a spell that you're gonna
be able to cast what I'm gonna do is
open up this guy and I'm gonna say plus
one can strips just so that I remember
whenever I get back to that then we're
also gonna see that you can speak read
and write one extra language of your
choice remember I said we're gonna get a
whole bunch of different languages and
the first one I'm gonna put inside of
here is draconic and that's going to
allow me to be able to understand
dragons so that's kind of cool and
normally the languages you pick are
gonna be based off of what types of
characters you're gonna come in contact
whenever you're playing the game now
what I'm gonna do is go into the
background area and fill out all of that
stuff and that is gonna start on page 33
for everybody and we're gonna come in
here and we are going to calculate our
height as well as our weight and to do
so what you're gonna do is roll to D 10
so we enrolled to D tens right now and
that is going to give me a total of 13
and you can see right here I have a high
elf so that's gonna start off at 4 foot
6 inches so I just want to add 13 inches
to that and that is gonna give me a
height of 5 foot 7 inches so pretty big
foot 7 inches and then what you do is
you do a similar thing with your weight
you're gonna take the 90 pounds you have
right here right there if you can't see
it so you're gonna start off with 90
pounds then you're gonna take your 13
and you're gonna roll one d4 so I'm
gonna roll that and I got a 1 for that
so I'm gonna multiply 13 times 1 and add
13 to 90 to get 103 pounds so pretty
tall and very skinny
so 103 pounds and there we go now we
have our weight now I'm going to come
down here into this area and you can
either roll for what this is is
alignment or you can
just look at what the information says
here on the screen and then pick
whatever character you want based off of
that I am gonna go with chaotic good
because I think that's gonna work well
for my wizard you can see right here
chaotic good
da da da da da very common with elves so
alignment and just come inside here and
type in chaotic good and some people
like to go in and have all this stuff be
random and some people don't just do
whatever you want then I'm going to
decide let's scroll down inside of here
and there's all kinds of other stuff you
can read about and I'll get down into
backgrounds now background that is gonna
work really well for a wizard is going
to be a sage in my opinion a lot of
people pick notables as well but I'm
gonna go with the sage and you can see
here if I pick a sage that my skill
proficiencies are going to be in Arcana
and history so I'm gonna come over here
to this guy and I'm gonna put a little
mark inside of here for Arcana and then
another one inside of here for history
languages I'm gonna get two additional
languages of my choice so I'm gonna be
able to speak pretty much everything so
what do I want to do well the campaign
that I'm working on it's gonna have
Giants inside of it and goblins so why
don't we go and put both of those inside
of there
then we're going to get a certain amount
of equipment here that we want to add
inside of here so let's go into our
equipment area of course and add all of
that equipment in so I'm gonna get a
bottle of black ink quill small knife
letter now let's go and put a little bit
more information inside of here this is
mainly for storytelling dead Colleague
calm and close and there's gonna be
additional equipment of course and then
we're also going to get ten gold pieces
so we'll just put ten right there
then I'm going to roll a d6 to figure
out what type of specialty I'm gonna be
and I'm going to be a researcher so we
could come up here and why don't we just
go inside here and just say this is
purely I'll just put sage researcher and
just so you know this is for role
playing more than utility so you
basically are just going to you can see
some information actually additional to
the research
down here and it's all about
role-playing so you don't need to worry
too much about that so now I'm gonna
come in here and I'm gonna roll for my
different personality traits and I'm
gonna start off with a d8 and I rolled a
number two so over inside of here I'm
just gonna copy this and again this is
just for role-playing as well and then
we'll get into ideals and for this
you're going to roll a d6 instead
so all d6 and I got Beauty so let's go
throw that inside of there and of course
feel free to pause the video as you
watch this so that you'll have plenty of
time to fill in your own character sheet
and then we get into bonds and once
again I'm gonna roll a d6 for this and I
rolled it to again so I'm gonna copy
that over here all right so that's kind
of cool and then finally for flaws again
d6 and with this guy I rolled a four and
that's also kind of cool
and there we go alright so got all of
those all filled in I have all my
backgrounds all set up so now it's time
to start working with the class and for
the wizard class that's gonna start on
page 30 so let's jump to page 30 and
there's a whole bunch of different
things you can see here hit dice 1 d6 so
hit dice I'm gonna bounce over inside of
this and I'm gonna put it in 1 d6
and you're gonna see here hit points at
first level it's gonna be 6 plus your
constitution modifier we haven't figured
out our constitution modifier yet so we
will get to that in a moment
so what I'm gonna do here is just put a
note so that I know in a little bit
later so I'll say 6 plus Constitution
and I'll know what that is whenever I
calculate that we're also gonna see that
I have proficiencies with daggers darts
slings quarter staffs and like crossbows
so I'm gonna come in here and add all of
those additional proficiency weapon
types daggers darts slings weapons
aren't going to matter normally so much
with a wizard and that's the reason why
we have strength solo and there we are
tools are going to be none saving throws
we're gonna put marks and intelligence
and wisdom so we'll come up here and we
intelligence and wisdom I talked all
about saving throws as well as skills in
the previous tutorial if you want to
learn more about those go watch that
video then I'm also gonna be able to
choose two from Arcana history insight
Investigation medicine and religion for
my skills and I am going to mainly focus
in on intelligence so I'm going to come
in here for investigation and put
another tick mark see it says
intelligence right there and then I'm
also gonna come down and do the same
thing for religion again completely up
to you whatever you choose to do in that
situation and now that I have all of my
proficiencies all set for saving throws
and skills I think it's a good time to
go in and calculate my ability score
modifiers so let's go in and do that
that's gonna be on page 7 you can see
right here is the table that we're gonna
be using to look up everything so what
I'm gonna do is just go into strength
right here and I can see that that's an
eight so on the table over here I find 8
to 9 is gonna be negative 1 and I just
come in and put negative 1 so there's
negative 1 likewise do the same thing
for dexterity that's gonna be +2
Constitution is going to be +2 also once
again this is 14 this is 14 plus 2 ok so
that's where that's coming from
intelligence at 16 so that means that's
going to be a plus 3 wisdom is going to
be a 0 and charisma is going to be plus
1 and then what I do is I just take all
of this information that I have over
here so strength dexterity Constitution
and I find the how they line up here as
well as up here so I can look here for
strength for example and I'm gonna put a
negative 1 inside of there because there
is a negative 1 right there and
dexterity what I'm going to do here plus
2 Constitution again plus 2 intelligence
however I have a proficiency in
intelligence so instead of plus 3 I'm
gonna make that a plus 5 that's plus 5
and wisdom I have a proficiency in it so
even though it is a 0 here that's going
to be a plus 2 and charisma
I don't have a proficiency in it so this
is gonna be a plus 1 and then you're
gonna have exactly the same things here
as you do down
here again depending upon proficiencies
so dexterity for acrobatics is going to
be +2 animal handling is going to be
zero because this is wisdom and wisdom
is zero say Arcana again we're going to
do a plus five here and that's because
intelligence is three plus two arcane is
plus five athletics minus one deception
plus one history plus five insight is
zero intimidations plus one
investigations plus five medicine is
zero
nature is plus three perception is plus
two formants plus one persuasion is plus
one religions plus five sleight-of-hand
plus two stealth is plus two and then
finally survival is going to be zero
alright so now we have all those set up
and we can also come in here now we know
what 6 plus and our constitution
modifier is going to be so a
constitution modifier is two as you can
see right there so we're gonna make this
eight so now I know that my hip points
are my life points are going to be eight
we can fill in a couple more of these
passive wisdom is gonna be 10 plus your
wisdom so that's just going to be 10 in
that situation your wisdom modifier
which is zero so that's how I get that
initiative is just gonna be whatever
your dexterity is so my dexterity is
plus 2 and so that's plus 2 inspiration
I'm gonna have that be plus 1 and now
let's jump back over into the class
features and if you're wondering what
your armor class is if you are not
wearing any armor it's just going to be
10 plus your dexterity modifier so
that's gonna be 12 not much armor on our
wizard that's why we add more into the
Constitution to hopefully keep our
wizard protected okay and now I'm gonna
get into some fun stuff in regards to
spells and we might as well just come in
here to our equipment and put a spell
book inside of there because we know
that we get a spell book as part of our
equipment as a wizard say spell Vulcan
and I'll come back to all the equipment
stuff later on you're gonna put all of
your spell casting information and over
inside of a scepter
cheat which I'll also put a link to that
in the description I'll probably just
put a link there to my website and then
you can get all this stuff there and
I'll set it up so that it will work for
skim so that you'll be able to go in
here and edit this different stuff so
the very first thing we're going to come
to our Kant strips and these are going
to be spells that you're gonna be able
to cast as many times as you want
there's no restrictions on them and
you're gonna have three as per a table
on page 29 so you can see right here can
trips right there you get three but
since I am a high elf I'm gonna get an
additional one so I get plus four on
that and then you're also gonna get to
spell slots so on your spell slots we
might as well just come in here and put
two right there so now we know that and
Kant strips we know that we are going to
be able this is can trips sorry about
that
we're going to have four of those that's
gonna be really cool and the basic rules
talk about a whole bunch of different
ones so let's come in here and let's
just take a look at them really quick
and so a light is on page 95 so come in
here and we'll look at light and we'll
decide if we want it or not this is
totally up to you you can pick whatever
you want so basically it comes in here
and it describes what light does and the
basics of it is you touch an object and
it gives off light for one hour it's
going to have bright light for 20 feet
and dim light for twenty additional feet
after that and then you're going to have
VM and also some type of what B and M
mean okay so basically if it says V what
that means is you must be able to speak
to be able to fire this spell if it had
an s inside here which stands for
somatic that means that you must be able
to move so you can't be bound in any way
and then the M means material which
refers to particular objects that are
required to cast this spell now if it
isn't stated that you must have an item
of a certain value then act as if you
have it so in this situation it says a
firefly and phosphorescent Moss since it
doesn't have a value next to it just
assume that you have that available to
you and if it doesn't say that an item
is used up whenever you cast a spell
just assume that you always
available whether it costs money or it
doesn't cost money okay so that's the
basics of firing your spell's now after
reading this about light I'm not
particularly excited about light so I'm
going to look at some other different
options that we have here another can
strip well let's come back up here
because you don't even know which ones
are available to you there we are
so as a wizard we are going to have
available all of these canned trips
right here all of them we can pick
whichever we want and since I'm a high
elf wizard I'm allowed to pick four of
those then afterwards you're going to be
able to pick spells and because we have
to spell slots that means we're gonna be
able to pick two of these different
spells and once again it's gonna be
completely up to you to decide what you
want to pick
I think mage hand is quite useful so
what I'm gonna do is come down here and
we'll look at mage hand and we could see
it right there and just to keep this
rather simple I am going to come in and
I'm just gonna type in some information
on the types of spells I want you're
gonna be able to put six spells inside
of here you're only going to have three
two of them be prepared however so let's
say I want to have based off of all the
different options I have and what I see
let's go back up to side here again
based off of what I know about these
spells these are the ones that I want to
be able to pick for my main spells so
I'm gonna go burning hands and then
afterwards I'm gonna put in the page
number so that I can look it up if I
need to while I'm playing the game I'm
also going to be putting in charm person
once again that's on page 85 Mage Armor
and that's on page 95 magic missiles on
page 96 and whenever I make the episode
in which I actually do a playthrough
you're gonna see how spells work and how
you cast them and all kinds of stuff
like that and sleep which is gonna be on
101 and I've decided that my prepared
spells which are going to be spells I'm
going to be able to use in combat I'm
gonna use shield and I'm gonna use
asleep and then I get up here into the
can
trips and the ones that I like here are
going to be fire bolts and that is gonna
be on page 90 and I'm also going to use
and I can use any of these at will as
much as I want to use them the spells
you can only use them until your spell
slots are used up and you use up one
spell slot each time you fire one of
your spell's so I'm going to put mage
hand here and that is on page 96 ray of
frost which is going to be on page 99
and then finally acid splash which is
going to be on page 83 then what I'll be
able to do is just come in here and go
to page 96 and mage hand and basically
what mage hands gonna allow us to do is
a hand is going to be created up to 30
feet away from you and it's gonna last
for one minute and it's gonna be able to
do anything except attack activate magic
items or carry more than 10 pounds and
shields are less than 10 pounds at least
some of them are and so you could use it
to carry a shield or something like that
so that's kind of useful and it's useful
for reaching things that are out of
reach and then we have our ray of frost
which is on page 99 this is really cool
whenever you're building all these
spells you can see right here and the
abbreviation abbreviated version of what
ray of frost does is it has a range of
60 feet on hit it's gonna do 1d8 cold
damage and also reduce the speed of
whoever gets hit by it by 10 feet until
the next turn fire bolt which is on page
90 also very commonly used where is fire
bolt there's fire bolt it's basically
has 120 foot range and on hit it's going
to cause one d-10 worth of fire damage
and then acid splash which personally
like a lot is gonna be on a page 83 it
actually allows you to hit two
characters and there's acid splash right
there 60 foot range choose one or two
characters within 5 feet of each other
and creatures must succeed on a
dexterity save or it's both could take
1d6 worth of acid damage so cool stuff
and I leave it to you to look up how the
different spells or what all these
different spells do as well
because you know you might not
necessarily be making a wizard or you
might choose completely different spells
for me which was perfectly fine and
let's jump over here well let's come up
here spell casting class and let's put
in wizard right there spell casting
ability it's gonna be intelligence or
you could write out intelligence there
and your spell say of DC which is what
it takes for others to resist your
spells is going to be 8 plus your
proficiency bonus which is going to be 2
plus our intelligence modifier which is
plus 3 so that's gonna be 13 so that's
pretty good and our spell attack bonus
is gonna be our proficiency bonus plus
our intelligence modifier which is gonna
be 5 and before we jump over into the
character sheet and finish filling out
all that let's talk a moment about areas
of effect now you can see down here with
silence it's saying that you're going to
create a radius sphere that's going to
be centered and it's going to hit a
certain number of people and I think
sleep also works that way let's look at
sleep here's sleep now it doesn't go
into area of effect with sleep but
basically area of effect how they are
gonna work let's jump over into page 80
so we can see them different spells are
going to cover different areas it's
gonna cover different areas so basically
if some spells could be a cone a cube a
cylinder a line or a sphere and you can
read the specifics here but the basic
gist is a cone area of effect is going
to extend from its point of origin to
its maximum distance with the same
maximum distance at its widest point so
it's gonna be like a triangle on your
gaming board the cube size is going to
be determined by the length of its sides
with a cylinder the origin is going to
be the center of the circle and then
energy is gonna shoot down filling up
that cylinder from above a line is going
to extend from the origin to its maximum
length and width and a sphere is going
to expand from its origin to its defined
radius so that's a basic gist of how all
the different area of effect spells are
going to work for us so now let's jump
over and finish up our character sheet
and here we are so what do we have left
to do
well we have a trinket that we can get I
actually forgot trinkets in the last
part of the tutorial again they're
mainly for role-playing so let's go to
54 and you can either roll ad 100 or 2d
tens to figure out what your area of
effect is go or what your trinkets gonna
be so I rolled and rolled again and with
this I got 93 for my trinket where is 93
and 93 is an empty wine bottle okay so
there it is and let's see if we can do
something with that and I'm just going
to stick that down inside of my
equipment area and I'm just gonna put
empty wine bottle that is odd enough
that I will remember it and one thing I
forgot was the arcane recovery jump back
over in the page 31 and here we can see
arcane recovery and once again this is
going to be inside of my wizard
information and let's come in and fill
that in and we'll put arcane recovery
and once per day recover 1/2 your level
rounded of spell slots so that's gonna
make it easier for me to get my spell
slots back so that I can go in and shoot
more spells and that's gonna bring me
back to my equipment so let's go that's
gonna be on page 30 and here it is
quarter staff or dagger well my a
quarter staff is going to work based off
of strength and my strengths negative
one so that's terrible so instead I'm
gonna work off of a dagger which is
based off a dexterity which is plus two
and I can throw it so let's go down to
page 46 and let's look at the different
types of weapons we have here and you
can see here is a dagger and here is a
quarter staff so this guy is gonna be
based off of your strength and this guy
up here is going to be based off of my
dexterity so I am going to pick a dagger
instead of quarter staff so it's throw a
dagger inside of there and since I have
daggers listed here as a ficient
weapon I can use my proficiency bonus
which is +2 and they are going to do two
points worth of dying damage so the
proficiency plus your dexterity right
there so that's gonna be a total attack
bonus of four and in my damage type I'm
just gonna copy exactly what it says
here for dagger and that's just gonna be
one d4 plus two for my proficiency and
then I'm gonna put piercing inside of
there cuz that's the type of damage it
does and then down inside of here I'm
gonna go dagger throw and it's gonna do
exactly the same type of damage and all
the same things are gonna work the same
and here I'll just say a range is gonna
be 20 or 60 whenever so 20 feet or 60
feet and if it goes anywhere past 20
that means whenever I roll to attack
that I am going to take a disadvantage
which means I roll two times and pick
whatever the lowest number is whenever I
decide to throw my dagger let's jump
back up inside of here again and let's
decide what equipment I'm going to pick
up after the dagger so then we're also
going to have a component pouch or
arcane focus and basically both are
identical so I'm gonna go with arcane
focus orb and we can see what pages that
bounce down inside of here and here we
can go or arcane focus orb and that's 20
gold pieces so that's pretty awesome so
I'm going to pick that instead of a
component pouch and sometimes you're
forced to pick a component pouch by your
DM so it's just gonna depend upon
whatever and then we'll jump back up
into 30 and we'll see what other
equipment we have to pick and we already
got the spell book there so I'm gonna
have to pick either a scholars pack or
an explorer's pack and get these
specifics of that guy I'm going to jump
down to page 49 and there you can see
what I got and I'm gonna pick the
scholars pack so I'm gonna come in here
and fill out all that information book
of lore and ink pen ten sheets of
parchment a bag of sand and then I'm
also going to get additional bottles of
ink so I'm just going to put 2x bottles
of ink and
I'm also going to get another knife so
let's just put 2x inside of there for
small knife and let's look over
everything that I have here on my screen
and it looks like I have covered
everything except for my name of course
so there you go guys that is how you
create a custom wizard inside of
Dungeons and Dragons and very soon I'm
gonna do a walkthrough of the game so
that you completely understand how to
play the game of Dungeons and Dragons
and that should be a lot of fun so like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
