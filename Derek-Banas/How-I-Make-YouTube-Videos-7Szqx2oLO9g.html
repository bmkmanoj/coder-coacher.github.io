tutorial on how I make youtube videos or
how I would like to call this how a
regular guy definitely not an expert
makes youtube videos and the only reason
why I'm making this tutorial is because
earlier today one of you guys and
actually this has been going on for a
while
asked me how I make youtube videos and I
said if five more people asked me I will
make this tutorial immediately and about
16 you asked for it so here it is when I
very first started off making youtube
videos this is the computer I used a Mac
Mini that cost me less than $150 Oh idea
behind it was this was just a fun hobby
my whole entire goal was to make videos
to help people and just like everybody
else that makes tutorial videos we don't
do this stuff to make money because as
you're gonna see here in a minute it
takes literally years to get enough
subscribers where you actually make
anything so it all began with a Mac Mini
and the only reason why I decided to get
that was because the software if I
wanted to do this on my PC was extremely
expensive the microphone I have is just
a cheapo regular old Mac iPod microphone
and by the way they don't make these
anymore and on top of that the new ones
aren't particularly good but there are
plenty of other good inexpensive
microphone headphones that you can get
so many that I won't even bother to
really point one out just check the
reviews and I'm sure you'll get
something good and this right here is
the video camera that I normally use and
I have no idea those girls are whenever
I am recording and this is the kodak zi8
and know you can't buy this anymore but
you guys want to know exactly what i use
this is what i use and this is kind of
also showing you that you can do this
stuff for pretty much nothing because
I'm sure this guy cost me well less than
$100 as per the software I use I use
Camtasia Studio actually I use a very
old version of Camtasia and if you're on
a Windows computer you can definitely
get this and I use this only for screen
recording and it
a couple other little silly things which
I'm going to show you here in a second
and of course it also is available for
Macintosh and I consider it after I
tested a whole bunch of these different
guys to be the best recording software
that was available previous to this
I used QuickTime X or QuickTime Player
to do screen recordings but I ceased to
use it because I could no longer do this
a new version of OS X came out and they
got rid of the zoom so that's the reason
why I switched originally for at least
three years I used QuickTime Player so
if you don't need to zoom you can have
QuickTime Player for free if you're on a
Macintosh computer I do all of my
editing which you're gonna see an
example of here pretty soon on iMovie
why cuz it's extremely simple remember
I'm not an expert I'm kind of an idiot
really for producing videos I'm not
really I don't consider myself to be
anything near an expert and as you're
gonna see iMovie makes it extremely easy
so sorry PC guys but like I said before
I chose to use a Macintosh a cheapo
Macintosh so that I wouldn't have to
spend a ton of money on software so
that's just my choice I'm not saying go
do it but you guys asked me what I do
and this is what I do
brings me into Camtasia Studio actually
I use Camtasia too but it's still pretty
much exactly the same and I'm actually
using the QuickTime recorder up here
because I can't record with Camtasia and
also have it open at the same time so
that's what I'm using up there but
remember the only reason why I'm not
still using QuickTime is because you
can't zoom a QuickTime it stinks so I'm
gonna make that go away and basically
I'm going to try to explain exactly what
I do with Camtasia I do very little with
it I'll just put it that way I use it
only for screen recordings and this is
1080p so you will be able to see the
video fullscreen and you're going to
have to look down here now basically
what I use Camtasia for is I drag this
little thing down here around and then I
split the video by hitting command T
like that and then if I want to track
showing a cursor a little yellow dot I
can just drag that down here and drop it
on there and now whenever I play
wherever my cursor is it is going to
follow my mouse around and that is the
extent of
what I do with Camtasia now the only
other thing that's great about it is you
can record in 1080p you have to go up
into share however and do something a
little bit weird
sorry I can't zoom remember and then you
go to advanced export and then this
guy's going to pop on the screen then
you hit options and then after that
you're going to see 1920 by 1080 P if
you're not full screen just trust me on
that that's what it says and if it
doesn't say that you have to go into
size and then change it to 1920 by 1080
P if you want to record in 1080p and
just so you know whether it's my
computer being extremely slow or not
this guy takes about three hours to
render after it's done so that's kind of
a nightmare
but there it is that's camtasia studio
and that's what i do with it so next i'm
going to export this render it whatever
and then jump over into iMovie and show
you exactly how I edit now a bunch of
you guys have asked exactly what is
sitting in front of me whenever I am
writing these programs and you can see
it right here it is a sequence diagram
that is what I use I don't almost ever
actually model it out in omlette which
is an application for creating sequence
diagrams but I normally draw everything
out just using a regular old pencil and
then I write little notes just like you
can see right here you know so that I
know exactly what is going on so I try
to never actually work from code I
really don't like that it kind of makes
the videos boring for me to make however
you can see right here I have all the
different classes and here's some more
classes right here and then in between
them I go and define all of the methods
that I need and all the attributes and
how they interact and I actually made a
tutorial I'll link to it in the upper
right hand corner in which I show
exactly how I go from ideas the whole
way to finish code using sequence
diagrams if you have any interest in
that at all so that is basically what's
sitting in front of me whenever I'm
making these video and that brings us to
iMovie this is where I edit everything
this is all the cool awesome stuff and
this is the only reason why I ever
bought a Mac basically to import a
project you just go into file new it's
just so simple and you get all of these
different sorts of themes
use the bulletin board all of the time
mainly for consistency reasons when I
first started using iMovie all this
stuff down here didn't even exist so
I've just never used it
so bulletin boards what I use and then I
just give it a project name and all
these are my settings that I use and
then I hit create
but I've already created that then I go
in to file again and go new event and
that will create a new event down below
in this area and I'm actually editing
the video that I'm making right now sort
of like we're stuck in a time warp then
after we create the event and just
right-click on it and import movies and
you pick up all of your different movies
you want to use then to get them you
just select them with your mouse and you
get all of them and then wherever you
want to put them you just drag them up
here and drop them in that's it that's
so easy I like to work with the
waveforms right here
that's what these are you can hear me in
the background making noise and to do
that you just click on this button you
can see there they went away and there
they came back I find it's very easy to
edit that way the only other thing that
I really use up here except for editing
like what I do is I come in and I find
an area in which I want to edit out
sound I just highlight it right like
that and then I hit delete and it goes
away and that is all I do
when I do that a couple hundred times in
each video that's why it takes forever
to edit these videos it actually takes
me very little time to make the videos
editing and rendering is like all of my
time about the only other thing that I
ever use which I don't really even use
is record a voiceover and this is kind
of cool what you do is you just click on
this and you can just you can see my
voice talking down here then what you do
is if you actually want to do a
voiceover anywhere you just click with
your mouse and then you start talking
and it automatically throws in a
voiceover as you can see right there and
it will play out for you right along
with your other video clip if you want
to use that and that's about the only
thing I ever do with iMovie in regards
to this guy up here now when it comes to
actual editing things I use this stuff
all the time you can see a lot of stuff
automatically goes in here and what this
is is you look on the right side of the
screen that right there is a transition
you can come in and move the transitions
all rounds and then if you want to throw
in say some text well this is music over
here what I got right now in my opinion
you should never use any of this music
over here
even though legally you have the right
to do it because you bought iMovie I
have had an insane number of copyright
claims against me
illegal copyright claims that I fought
and got rid of but I've had tons of
videos taken down that I had the fight
to bring back so I never use this music
and music in general kind of stinks in
regards to making tutorials so what's
the point then I can open up my picture
library just like that then there's all
sorts of text that you can use and so if
I want to throw in my website here just
drag it over and drop it in and that's
it and then you can type in whatever you
think tank comm and hit done and there
it is and I mean this is why everybody
gets iMovie it's just so easy and you
can just stretch it and you can see
there it is and then it shows up and it
goes away and there's a whole bunch of
these different types of little text
elements that you can use but for the
most part I stick with these two here
and sometimes this stuff up here and the
other thing I use that you guys think is
really cool is these transitions right
here and basically they work just like
the text areas do but if I want to throw
a transition and you can see there's a
transition there's a whole bunch of
transitions now these transitions right
here across the top they're kind of
slower transitions and what I want to do
a really fast transition I use these
guys down here it's all up to personal
taste which ones you like but if I come
in here and I decide that I want to
throw a transition in so right there
sounds like a great place to put a
transition in all I would do is grab my
transition drag it over
and drop it in it automatically and
there is the transition so iMovie is
just absolutely awesome I like I love it
it makes video editing a breeze and it
has all these cool effects and in my
opinion it's well worth buying a
Macintosh just to get iMovie of course
like I said I started off with a cheapo
cheapo Mac Mini and I think that that
really was enough for video editing it
was kind of slow but really
transitioning up to my bigger Mac I mean
size wise or speed wise I haven't really
noticed that much of a difference which
is absolutely amazing now once again I
know I am no big guy actually almost
nobody even knows I exist except for you
absolutely awesome great guys and I
don't think I ever take enough time to
tell you how absolutely amazingly
grateful I am that you guys watch my
videos and you enjoy them and you learn
things and you talk to me always feel
free to leave questions because I just
really love to talk to you guys it's
it's unbelievably cool if you think it's
cool for you to watch my videos it is so
much cooler for me actually to get in
contact with you guys and actually help
you and know that you enjoy my videos
but I just wanted to get to the point of
exactly how long it takes to actually
get a substantial number of views and I
think you're gonna see here exactly why
everybody I don't care who you are
everybody who does tutorials and even
almost everybody that does videos on
YouTube they don't do it for the money
we do it because we enjoy it especially
the people that make five hundred six
hundred a thousand videos and the reason
why is when I first started off after
doing this for four months I averaged a
hundred views a day that's it and I made
a lot of videos and they were horrible I
know I mean I I'm amazed anybody watched
him because they were really really bad
but I just really wanted to be able to
do what I'm doing today which is you
know talking to a lot of you guys so I
just kept doing it and then after nine
months I was getting about 500 views a
day and then after 11 months I was
getting about
a thousand views per day and right now
as I speak I get about fourteen thousand
views per day which is absolutely
amazing so that's it takes years to
build up a subscriber base and find
really cool people that stick with you
and I just wanted to show you exactly
how long it takes
as per subscribers previous lives
talking about views this is subscribers
and I never even bothered to track this
stuff I just think it's accurate I got
it off of another website and it looks
good and I thought you guys might want
to see how long it takes to get
subscribers now I started making video
as well before October 2011 but
basically October 2011 I had three
thousand seven hundred ninety three by
January 2012 it went to 55 oh nine and
you can see all of the other numbers and
right here I am at 54 nine sixty or
maybe I broke fifty five thousand but
like I said before I just really don't
pay a whole lot of attention to this
I've always said a million times I would
be so much happier to just have a
hundred hardcore awesome fans that
talked to me and I interacted with over
having a million you know fans that just
you know weren't fun to be around so you
know I really like you guys and that's
why I continue making videos why else do
I do this just in case you guys really
really wanted to know the backstory
basically a couple years ago before I
started making YouTube videos I was in a
car accident and I wasn't hurt but it's
sort of like made me think about life
and stuff and making an impact and doing
really cool things and helping other
people and so that's why I started doing
this I thought I could be good at
teaching if I applied myself and kept
trying to get better and I was in a
situation in which because the accident
I had to quit my job at the time and
basically start over and what I ended up
doing was starting my own business and I
wanted to sort of like walk people
through that process and show them what
it's like to start from nothing and to
build what ended up being a really
extremely successful business so along
the way I just as I learn
things I just put it out there for
anybody that was interested and
basically why I do this I mean I saw the
Khan Academy that was one of the
enlightening things and it made me want
to teach people for free but basically I
saw a movie called
Benjamin Button an in Benjamin Button
this is what he said for what it's worth
it's never too late or in my case too
early to be whoever you want to be there
is no time limit start whenever you want
you can change or stay the same there
are no rules to this thing we can make
the best or the worst of it I hope you
make the best of it I hope you see
things that will startle you I hope you
feel things you have never felt before I
hope you meet people with a different
point of view I hope you live a life
you're proud of and if you find that
you're not I hope you have the strength
to start all over again and basically
just wanted to let you guys know that
that is pretty much it and if I can in
any way help you guys have the strength
to start all over again like many of us
have to in life then that is the
greatest thing that I could ever achieve
so just wanted to let you into my world
answer a question I get all the time and
just tell you how cool you guys are and
I will end it with my obligatory ending
