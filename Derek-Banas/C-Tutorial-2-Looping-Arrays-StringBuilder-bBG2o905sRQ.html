my C sharp tutorial in this part of the
tutorial we're going to talk about a
raise for for each string builder
casting and a whole bunch more I'm going
to be covering all of these topics with
a lot of detail and like always all the
code and a transcript of the tutorials
available in the description and so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so in the last part of the
tutorial I showed you how to use marin -
if you're on a Macintosh but right now
we're just going to focus hundred
percent on Visual Studio like I said
before everything is exactly the same
now I just started a brand new project
and everything here is exactly what you
should see you do however want to make
sure that you have this guy right here
in your code because we're going to be
working with string builders and that is
needed also you're going to need to
import another module and this one is
going to be system globalization and
this is going to help us with culture
specific formatting which you're going
to see later on in the tutorial and
that's all you're going to need to
import for now
now something I forgot to talk about in
the last part of my tutorial is
something that is called implicit typing
now you don't always have to but you
normally should go and define what type
of data type you want to use for your
variables but you can also come in and
do something like this var and then
let's say whatever this you don't have
to use this name obviously and you go
and you create a number now C sharp is
going to be smart enough to realize this
is an integer and it's going to
automatically make it an integer type
and just to prove that that is so I'm
going to come in here now and I'm gonna
go write line in Val type and I'm not
sure if I told you last time or not how
to get the data type for a value or for
a variable but this is how you do it you
go get type like that and it's going to
output whatever the data type is for
that guy and if we run this you're going
to see that indeed whoops I was silly I
need to come in here and make sure that
that guy is going to stay open and of
course I'm going to do that exactly as I
always do by just going in here and
going
read line like that now if we run it
you're going to be able to open it and
see that it knows that it's an integer
based off of the data that was assigned
to the variable so that is implicit
typing and I just want to make sure that
I covered that so that you did know how
to use it but like I said it's better to
actually define the data type yourself
and now we're going to talk about arrays
so arrays are just boxes inside of a
bigger box and they're going to contain
many values of the same data type and
each item is going to be assigned a key
starting at zero and then incrementing
up from there so the very first item you
put in your array is going to be 0 with
it's going to have the key of 0 and then
one and two and three and so forth and
so on
now arrays are going to be all of a
fixed size and to define one let's say
that we have an integer array and let's
say favorite norms is what we're going
to call it we're then going to say a new
there's a couple ways to define this and
you're going to find the size for your
array and that's the biggest your array
is going to ever be if you want to use
an array that has a dynamic size you use
lists but this is how arrays work now
what you're going to be able to do now
is go favorite nomes and if you want to
get the very first item inside of there
or assign a value to the very first one
of these guys let's say 23 that is how
you do it and now we can come in here
and we can go and retrieve that same
value out of there
let's say let's go favorite numb and
we'll say 0 and if we want to get the
value that is stored inside of there
we're going to basically do exactly the
same thing will go fav nomes and 0 once
again and if we run that you'll see the
23 does indeed show up all right so
that's how we put values inside of there
as well as get values out of there
we're also going to be able to come in
here and assign values whenever the
array is created so let's say we want to
create a string array and it is going to
contain customer information so we'll
say customers between curly brackets we
would then define all the different
values that are going to be assigned in
side of this guy and there we go and
that is automatically going to make it
the size of three to accommodate those
values that you assign to it you're also
going to be able to use var once again
to define an array without an explicit
datatype just as long as everything has
exactly the same data type so it's going
to have to all be integers all be
strings all be whatever so then you
could also come in here and do this and
that would also be a valid way for us to
create a string array one thing we can
do however is we could actually create
an array and put numerous different
different types of data inside of it by
saying it's an object array and the
reason why is the object type is the
base type for all other types inside of
c-sharp so we would be able to say
object and we'll say random array is
equal to and then inside of here we
could say Paul and we could say 45 and
we could say one point two three four so
there you have a string and an INT and a
double or a dozen or whatever we're then
going to be able to come in here and
it's automatically going to figure out
what type of data we have inside of it
so we'll say random array and 0 in this
situation and then come down inside here
and go random array and let's go and get
the very first one and then let's go and
get whatever the data type is and don't
try to memorize all this stuff just use
the code I have in the description as a
cheat sheet to write your own code and
if you do that long enough you're just
going to learn all this stuff and if you
run it you're going to see that comes
back as a string and if we would go and
change this into two and run it again
you're going to see that it comes back
as a double alright so pretty cool stuff
you're going to also be able to get the
number of items inside of your array
let's come into another one of these and
we'll say array size and then we can
come in and go random array whoops
at the wrong button random array and
length let's go do a couple other
different things here
so that we can see them all at one time
you're also going to be able to cycle
through an array and there's a couple
different ways I'm going to show you how
to use for as well as how to use for
each and we're going to start off with
zero because remember the very first
item is has the key of zero and you can
see here how the length is going to be
useful because we're going to be able to
automatically no matter what array is
passed to this we'll be able to cycle
through all of the items in any array by
just referring to the length of that
array and then we can come in here and
do some different stuff let's say that
we want to say array and we want to put
whatever the index for it is inside of
here and then afterwards we want to put
the value that is assigned to that index
then come down here and just go I like
that and then random array like that and
I like that and if we run that indeed
you're going to see not only does it
give us array size but it's also going
to cycle through the array and go to get
all that array information so another
useful thing to be able to do we're also
going to have things that are called
multi-dimensional arrays now whenever
you define an array like for example if
you go our names and five this means
that we are going to have five boxes and
they are going to be stacked on top of
each other vertically up and down so
that's what that is going to be now
however if you would instead come in
here and do something like two two what
that's going to do is with this first
one just going to stack vertically up
and down and then this is going to say
that we want to total values from left
to right or horizontally and I'm going
to show you an example of how that's
going to look so what we're going to do
now is we're going to define array and
it is going to be two rows high and two
across so we will say string and then
throw a comma inside of there and I'm
going to say customer names is equal to
new and then this is going to be a
string and then I'm going to say that I
want it to be two by two like that then
inside of here if I wanted to find a
multi-dimensional array directly inside
of there I can
say Bob and Smith and then after that
curly bracket put another curly bracket
and say something like Sally and Marx
whatever okay so there we go now we have
a multi-dimensional array now if we want
to get a value outside of that
multi-dimensional array what we can do
is come in here like this and we can say
something like MD value and then get
whatever value we want out of there and
then come down here and go customer
names and get value and we want to get
whatever is in the 1:1 position once
again run that and you're going to see
that Marx comes back why is that well we
have Bob's in the zero zero position
Smith is going to be in the zero one
position because it moves over one then
we're going to have Sally's going to be
in the one zero position and then Marx
is going to be in the one one position
and that's the reason why Marx came back
as that we're also going to be able to
cycle through multi-dimensional arrays
using for loops and much the same way so
we're going to say something like for
int I is equal to zero and we're going
to continue cycling through as long as I
is less than customer names and then
we'll go get length which is a way to
get the length of a multi-dimensional
array item and then we'll increment that
by I then inside of here we're going to
create another for loop and I'm just
going to copy this guy right here
because it's going to do exactly the
same thing so paste that there call this
J call this J if we want to get the
second part of our multi-dimensional
array we're going to put a 1 inside of
there we're going to increment this guy
right there - J and then to output this
information I'm going to go console I'm
actually going to change this to write
instead of write line and I'll get rid
of this all together come down here tab
that in and then to get this item out of
here I'm going to go customer names like
that and I'm going to go eye
J inside of there inside of these square
brackets and then after that let's just
go copy that paste this inside of here
and I'm going to do a right line with
nothing inside of it which is just going
to give us a new line save that run it
and now you can see that it prints out
Bob Smith and Sally marks right like
that I could have put a space inside of
there but I didn't so no big deal just
so you know and this is something you
can play with on your own let's say that
you would go and go array names like
this and two and two and three what this
is going to do this first part remember
this is vertically up and down the
second one's going to say how many items
horizontally and then you can think of
that as just a matrix or a spreadsheet
or whatever and then this guy is going
to tell you how many of these are going
to be created so this is pretty much
like saying how many sheets of 2 by 2
matrices are we going to create and
that's something you can play along with
on your own and that will give you a
better understanding of how arrays work
now what I'm going to do is come in here
and also show you for each so let's go
and create another integer array and I'm
going to call this random number and 9
and 2 I also want to show you that we
would actually be able to come in here
and pass an array to a function without
any problems so let's say that we want
to do something like print array and
random number it and then we want to
have like a descriptive phrase it's
going to show up in the output ok so
that's going to give us an error because
it says what's print or I don't know so
let's go and create that so outside of
main we're going to come in here and I'm
going to say static and void and print
alright and it is going to be receiving
an integer array and I'm going to just
call this int array and then it's going
to be able to it's also going to get
sent some type of message so I'm just
going to go like that and then what it's
going to do is cycle through using for
each like I talked about before so we
can say with for each for each and then
int
K
in whatever the array was passed in here
so that's into right and what it's going
to do is temporarily store each value
from the array in K and then we'll be
able to manipulate it down inside of
here and how we're going to manipulate
it and how we're going to be able to
manipulate it is consul and what I want
to do probably right line and then we're
going to put the information inside of
here so that's going to be whatever the
array value is and then afterwards I am
going to throw a message inside of there
so well let's put the message first and
then let's put whatever the value for
the array is alright so there's that guy
whoops
change this into and put the K up there
must accidentally Lily did that all
right so that's saved and if we run it
you're going to see one four nine two
prints out okay so good stuff now we're
also going to be able to come in here
and sort array information so let's go
and do that very easy to do we're just
going to go array and sort and then pass
inside of it
whatever our array is going to be so
random number on that and you're going
to say that it now puts them in
numerical order so that's useful to be
able to do we're also going to be able
to come in and go reverse like that run
it again now you can see they're in
reverse order from how I put them inside
of there we can also get the index of
whatever we are searching for or a
negative one if negative one comes back
in that means that nothing was found and
for this guy let's say we want to search
for one so we'll say one is that what
index and this is going to return some
type of a value for us and to search
through it we're going to go index of
and then we'll say what specifically are
we going to be searching inside of
what's the array name and what are we
specifically searching for which is
going to be the number one run that you
can see it comes back as zero index and
you can also see it's in the zero index
right there
we're going to also be able to change
the value at a specific index so let's
say that we want to change it we can go
random
nomes and go set value and let's say we
want to change whatever is in index one
to the value of zero we can go zero
comma one and we're also going to be
able to come in here and copy part of an
array to another one so let's go and
create an integer array and let's call
this the source array just so it'll be
easy to see what we're doing here and
we'll go and put some values inside
error so one two and three we're then
going to create a destination array
which is where we're going to be copying
information into and here I'm just going
to create an empty array so I'll go and
say it's going to have a total capacity
of or size of two I'm going to put
starting index is going to be equal to
zero once again just so you can see
what's going on and the length is going
to be equal to two now what we're going
to be able to do is come down inside of
here and say array copy and source all
right where we're going to be getting
the different pieces of data from
starting at a specific index then we're
going to define the destination array
and the starting index and the length we
can then come in here and call our print
array function that we created a second
ago pass inside of it
destination array and then just to see
exactly what we are working at or what
we're looking for put copy inside of
there and you can see that it copied one
and two over into the destination array
you're going to be able to create arrays
in other ways as well another way is you
can use the create instance function
here we can just say array and let's
call this another array because I'm
running out of names that I can use for
my array so we're going to be able to
say create instance and then we could
say type of and let's create an integer
array and then after that say that it
want
want ten spaces total inside of our Iraq
we're then going to be able to copy
values in our source array to our
destination array and how we can do that
is go source array copy too this time
we're going to be copying into another
array this new guy that we just created
and what we're going to do is copy the
entire array over and we're going to
start putting values in at the 5th index
inside of another array and then we will
use for each to come in here and cycle
through all of those different items in
another array and here we're going to go
and output that information so this is
to demonstrate copy 2 and we want to get
each item out of that Rea and run it and
here you can see that it started putting
in at the index number 5 so 0 1 2 3 4 5
and it put in all three values from our
source array into that new another array
that we just created another thing
that's really cool is we are going to be
able to search for an element that
matches certain conditions that we are
going to define something called a
predicate so I'm going to go and create
another integer array and I'm going to
call this number right and inside of
here I'm going to go 1 and 11 and 22 so
there is an array and then what I'm
going to do is create the predicate or
what it is is it's going to be a
function that's going to return true or
false depending upon certain conditions
let's go down here and create a new
function and I'll make this private
static it's going to return true or
false like I said before I'm going to
say greater than 10 is what this is
going to stand for and it's going to
receive a value and then it is going to
return true or false whether this value
that was sent in or not is greater than
10 ok so pretty simple function so let's
come up here and use it ok so right
after this guy I am going to come in and
go console.writeline and we'll say
greater than 10 and it's going to come
back true or false and I can go array
find numb or
is what I'm going to search for and it's
going to come back with the very first
match so greater than ten is the name of
the function or the predicate that I
defined and if we run it you're going to
see that 11 comes back doesn't get the
22 because it only returns the very
first value and of course it would
return nothing if none of the matches
and it's important to know on your own
go and you can do pretty much exactly
the same thing with a function called
find all so instead of find use find all
and the only difference is find all it's
going to return an array of all the
matches and another function called find
index is going to return in index of the
match okay so that is a run-through of a
whole bunch of different things we can
do with race now what I want to do is
take a look at string builder okay so we
covered strings in the last part of the
tutorial and something that you probably
are not aware of because I didn't talk
about it is anytime you go and make any
changes at all to a string you are
actually creating a brand new string and
this can can become very inefficient if
you are working with large blocks of
text so what we have available to us
inside of Steve sharp is something
called a string builder and what it
allows you to do is to actually go in
and change a block of text without
creating a brand new copy which is what
you do whenever you're working with
strings so how you create a string
builder is you just go string builder
and I'm just going to call this s B and
you go equals to new string builder and
then you define whatever text you want
to put inside of it and it's
automatically going to give you 16
characters of space if you do not define
how much space you want if you however
would like to define how much space you
get you would instead go and do pretty
much exactly the same thing in a string
builder like that and here we'll say
something like more stuff that is
important and then after that say that
we want to set aside 256 characters
worth of space and make sure you always
put the new inside of there because it
is an object and we'll get more into
objects here very very soon we're then
going to be able to come in here and get
to the maximum size so let's go it's
called as capacity and then let's go and
get the capacity so we can get the
capacity for well let's just do both of
them
so capacity like that and then let's get
the capacity for the second ones so that
you can see indeed that I was right so
we'll go string builder two and we can
run it and you can see 16 is the default
no matter how many you put in there and
256 comes back because I forced it to be
on 256 likewise you're also going to be
able to get the length or the number of
characters that are inside of there so
you can just go lengths like this and
then change this to length and run it
and you're going to see it comes back as
11 because that's how many characters
you have assigned inside of this string
builder up here you're going to be able
to add text to a string builder and
let's just go SB to just by going append
line and you can throw new lines or
whatever you want to put inside of there
so we'll say more important text and
close that off you're going to be able
to define culture specific formatting
and this is what I was talking about way
up here this guy right here
globalization that's the guy that we are
going to use for this so we're going to
go culture info and I'm going to say
that this is English specific to the
United States and then culture
info create specific culture and
remember I said English - us and now
what we'll be able to do is use
formatting so we can do something like
string best customer is equal to Bob
Smith and then go sb2 and appends format
and English us and then we can say best
customer curly brackets and then follow
that up with best customer and that's
going to append that formatted piece of
information and make sure you put your
quotes in the right place otherwise
that's going to cause an error all right
you're going to be able to output your
string boat builder
in much the same way so we can just go
SB to let's just get rid of this all
together and go SB to two-string and run
it just you can see what it is now you
see more important texts all that stuff
was added in and best customer Bob Smith
also shows up will also be able to come
in and replace a specific string inside
of there by going SB to and replace and
what we're going to replace specifically
is text and change it to characters I
mean here and we can print that again
just to make sure that works going to be
able to come in and clear a
stringbuilder just by calling the clear
function on it will then also be able to
append some text to it so we'll go
random text we could also compare over
to see if equality exists between two of
these objects by going SB and equals and
SB - guess what that's going to come
back as false we're also going to be
able to come in and in insert a piece of
text in a specific index so let's say
that we want to start at index 11 and
put a string in that says that's great
like that and it's throw space inside of
there so that shows up inside of the
output and we can run this just to see
how that works you can see random text
that's great shows up there and also
false for whenever we check to see if
they were equal or not we're also going
to be able to remove a number of
characters starting at a specific index
so we could go SB to and remove and say
we want to start at index 11 and remove
the next seven characters after that and
sure enough if we then come in and paste
that in there and run it you're going to
see that that's was removed out of the
string builder alright so that is a
rundown of what you do with arrays and
string builders and loops and a whole
bunch of other different things and I
have a couple more minutes so let's go
and cover one more topic and that topic
is casting very often it is very useful
to be able to cast from one type to
another so
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
and that just means castings it's a
fancy word for converting so let's go
and let's create a long here and it's
going to have the value of one two three
four and let's go and let's create an
integer and let's assign it well let's
let's first off let's go and try to
assign num1 to that to see what happens
you can already see there's an error and
it says right here cannot implicitly
convert type long to int so how do you
solve that very easy just come in here
like this
and go int and your error goes away and
we can come in here and verify that
everything is peachy keen and indeed
this is an integer by just going in and
it'll say something like original and
cast and then for this one we'll go num1
get type c and get type already before
and then we will say num2 and get type
again because that's awesome and we will
run it and we'll see that the original
was a 64-bit integer which is a long and
here it is a 32-bit which is an integer
all right so there you go guys a whole
bunch of random topics I covered today
and I'm pushing forward to cover the
entire language as quickly as humanly
possible and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
