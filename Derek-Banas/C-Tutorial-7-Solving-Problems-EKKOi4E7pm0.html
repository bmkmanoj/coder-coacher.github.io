my C++ tutorial series in this part of
the tutorial we're going to solve four
more problems this time I'm going to
show you how to solve the Caesar cipher
that I brought up in the last video
we're gonna learn how to solve equations
for X we're also going to cover how to
create lists of primes how to generate
risk lists of random values and a whole
bunch more leading up into the next
tutorial where we're gonna start
covering more advanced algorithms and
like always all the code is available in
the description underneath the video
along with a transcript of the video and
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so last time whenever I left you
this is what I told you I wanted to have
you figure out and a couple people did
which is really cool so what are we
gonna do we are going to return a string
and this is a Caesar cipher is the name
of the function as I defined and it is
going to receive a string which is gonna
be the string that it is going to shift
the characters for and the key is going
to represent how many characters we're
gonna shift and then we're also gonna
have a bowl inside of here that is going
to define if we are encrypting or
decrypting the string that is being
passed in all right so now I have to
create the function to make all this
work and of course if I'm moving a
little bit too quick you could of course
hit pause button or get the transcript
and the code in the description of
course everything's free alright so now
I gotta make this guy work so the very
first thing I have to think about here
is going to be the string that I am
going to return I'm just gonna call this
return string and yes of course I'm
gonna be getting into object-oriented
programming here I just really wanted to
get a basis for how we can go and
actually solve problems to learn how to
use C++ instead of just covering just
basic syntax which isn't learning the
language is actually you know just
covering syntax all right so then we're
going to store character codes for each
of the characters I'm going to be
shifting and then we're gonna be turning
them back into letters from that point
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
see if I am going to be encrypting or
decrypting and based off of Adam going
to
to change the direction of the key so
I'm going to say are we encrypting or
not and if it is true I'm going to take
the key and multiply at times negative 1
and that is going to give me the
opposite direction we're gonna be
shifting characters around okay so the
next thing I have to do is I need to
cycle through each of the characters
that we have that was passed into it so
character and get that character and
then I'm of course we're going to be
operating on the string and since
there's gonna be more than one thing
here more than one character we are of
course gonna use curly brackets but then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna check if
it's a letter and if not I am NOT going
to change it so I'm going to say is it
alpha or not and of course I'm checking
the individual character Am's if it is a
character well that means I can convert
it so I'm gonna go and get character
code and we get the character and change
it into an integer and then I'm going to
get my character code and increment its
value based off of the key that was
presented to us all right so then what
I'm gonna need to do is if it is an
uppercase character what I'm gonna need
to do is check if the new character code
is going to be greater than the
uppercase letter Z and if it is I'm then
going to have to shift back to the
beginning of the uppercase letter
character codes otherwise I'll be going
into ASCII characters that are not
letters all right so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna say if is upper and of
course I'm gonna be checking the
character I'm gonna move this up here
because I think going get all it'll get
the rest of the function inside of here
so if it is an uppercase character what
I want to do is I want to say if
character code is greater than and go
and change the uppercase character for
the letter Z into an integer and if it
is I'm going to say character code is
going to be minus or equal to 26 so that
I can
of it back to the beginning of my
uppercase letters alright then I also
want to check if I'm going to if I'm
gonna be shifting downwards I want to
make sure that I don't shift directly
out past the uppercase letter a so I'm
gonna say and go and get the uppercase
letter A and get that guy and then in
this situation I'm gonna do the absolute
opposite I'm gonna say character code
and I'm going to add 26 to it all right
so we got all of that set up then I get
a situation in which I'm going to do
this for lowercase characters see here I
checked if it's upper and otherwise I
can assume that it is a lowercase
character and I can just copy this so I
don't have to type all that out again
and then just change it a little bit
here what I'm gonna do is change this to
a lowercase Z and then I'm gonna change
this to a lowercase a and there we go I
have all that set up and absolutely
everything is going to be exactly the
same alright so I'm in here and I got to
the Alpha part so in this situation I am
going to want to convert from integers
to characters and then I am going to add
the new letter to the returning string
so I'm going to come out of here and I
can do that directly right here I can
just say letter is gonna be equal to
character code and that's gonna
automatically turn it from an integer
into a regular old character and then I
can add it on to the end of my return
string right like that very very simple
and then otherwise else if it is not are
we out here if it is not a alpha this
guy right here
well in that situation you can see that
lit up here real nice for me well in
that situation I am NOT going to change
it at all
I'm just gonna and that's mainly gonna
be spaces and things like that and I'm
just doing this for simplistic reasons I
can just go and let the letter B equal
to what it is and then go
and yet my return string and add it on
to the ends of the string and then I can
now I don't need to do anything else I
think that's enough and then after I
have all this stuff done at the very
bottom of this function I could say
return return string and there we are
and as long as I typed all that
incorrect or as low as I typed it in
correctly it's gonna take me make me a
secret it's gonna turn it into an
encrypted version print that out and
it's gonna go and decrypt it and then
print that out and let's run it and you
can see right here that is indeed what
it did it went and encrypted make me
secret and that's what the results are
and then down here it decrypted it and
put it back exactly where it was all
right so pretty cool stuff and hopefully
you guys got that and if not the whole
goal here is just to understand so the
next thing we're gonna do is we are
going to go and have the user enter an
equation and we are going to solve for X
and more specifically what I'm going to
allow the user to do is they're going to
enter in an equation of the sort X plus
4 this is gonna be the string input and
I'm going to solve for X for it so I'm
gonna go and do like I did previously
I'm gonna show you what's in the main
function and then you can pause the
video and try to create it yourself so
we're gonna say enter an equation to
solve and let's put space inside of
there then I'm gonna go and do or create
a string that we have here I'm gonna
call this equation and give it nothing
to start off with then I'm gonna use
getline and I'm going to I'm just
assuming you know how to do this because
I've done these a whole bunch of times
all right and they're gonna receive or
we're going to receive standard input
and store that input into the equation
and then your job is to create a
function called solve for X and all that
is going to receive is the equation
alright so now what you can do is pause
your video and try to solve that
you can watch me solve it right now all
right so obviously for this we're just
gonna copy this come up inside of here
and define our function prototype for
our function and this is not going to
return anything and it is going to
receive a string and it's gonna be
called equation we could throw that
right there we're gonna be able to then
come in copy this throw that down inside
of there and start creating our function
what is one thing that we are going to
need however well one thing that would
be extremely useful is to go and use
that awesome function that we used
previously called string to vector that
is gonna make it much easier for us to
go in and convert our string into vector
values that we will then be able to take
and store so that function I'm just
gonna copy it because I made it in a
previous part of the tutorial series and
you can see right here where I went and
put the prototype for it string to
vector it receives a string and you
define whatever the separator is gonna
be and then you go and figure that out
and here is the actual function like I
said we covered this in previous parts
of the tutorial series you should be
watching this in order because this
tutorial gets progressively more
complicated so there is the code I'm not
going to cover how that exactly works
because it covered it previously so what
am I worried about instead is how solve
for X is going to work very first thing
we're gonna do like always is we are
going to come in here and we're going to
get our vector equation so we're gonna
go vector and this is going to be a
standard string vector and I am going to
call this vector equation just so that
we'll be able to understand what's going
on here
and I'm gonna skip down to the next line
and I'm gonna call string to vector and
I'm going to pass in the equation of
course and then I'm also gonna pass in a
character which is going to represent
the separator that we're going to
so this is the guy we're calling here
obviously and then what do I have to do
well basically what I need to do is
convert my strings to integers that are
going to be represented with our two
numbers so I'm gonna have number one
this is gonna be equal to standard and
sto I which is gonna convert our string
into an int and then I'm gonna go and
get vector equation whoops
equation spell that correct and yeah
remember the format that I said we
wanted to have we wanted to have let's
go and put a commented line inside of
here
so it's gonna be X plus 4 is equal to 9
and then of course we're gonna solve for
X so based off of that I know that
number one is going to be a vector
equation and more specifically it's
going to be the second item in there so
that's how we're gonna get that so we're
gonna get this guy 0 1 2 obviously and
then I'm gonna go and get the other item
inside of here and let's go number two
and this is going to be the fourth index
inside of our vector and then I'm gonna
go int I have the value so let's just go
and create it so this is gonna be number
two - number one just basic arithmetic
obviously and then I'm gonna go standard
and C out and I'm gonna say whoops X is
equal to and we're going to output or
value and there we go so a pretty simple
nice little simple function just really
based off of if you thought about hey we
have this nice function we created
previously that created string converts
strings to vectors and you were able to
use that either way we're gonna come in
here and we're gonna test it out so
let's test it
we'll go X plus four is equal to nine
and you can see that X is equal to five
comes back as a result so we were
successful in creating yet another and
solving yet another problem so good
stuff and now we'll move on to yet
another problem this one is going to
return a list of primes and I'll give
you a little hint here that we're going
to be using a function that we
previously used in the tutorial
once again all right so I'm going to
create all the code that is in Maine and
it'll be up to you to solve it we are
going to come in here and check you know
what I think I'm also going to allow the
user to enter a value and see if it's
prime I think that might also be an
extra thing okay so and that's gonna be
that's another problem before isn't it
not so if we're gonna say number two
check and they're gonna pass that in and
you're going to verify if that is a
prime value or not and we're gonna go
standard CN and save that to the
variable no another thing it's kind of
cool somebody asked me about by default
bul values or either 1 or 0 and somebody
asked me how to make them be true or
false well what you can do is you can go
standard see out dot set F and then you
go standard iOS and bol alpha and that
will instead have your bullying's be
either true or false instead of 0 or 1
so just thought I'd answer that question
and then what I can do is I can go an
output on-screen is and we'll have our
value that the user entered and then we
will follow that up with Prime and then
after that we will call a function I'm
giving it away right here is from it's
gonna receive a value and then it's
going to go and output on our screen
whether that is my problem value or not
but it's gonna output true or false
instead of 1 or 0 which would be silly
then you have two functions you have to
create so this is actually two more
problems I should have said 5 problems
in the beginning of this tutorial well
whatever I said to or I said 4 so
whatever now you know so the second
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna ask
the user to tell us how many Prime's
they want us to generate and I'm going
to keep this prime number calculation
kind of simple I know there is a little
bit more complex ways of generating
Prime's but I'm going to
keep it a little simple here for now so
I'm gonna go in Max Prime and I'm just
gonna this and then I'm gonna say that I
want to whoops get that value and store
it in the variable called Max Prime and
then what we're gonna do is we're going
to create a vector and of course it's
gonna be an integer vector and this will
be the prime list as what I want to call
it and it's gonna call your other
function called get Prime's
which is going to generate a list of
integers in a vector which is gonna be
our prime list and then we're gonna be
able to go and output on the screen that
prime list of values and so we'll just
up with them you know it's simple I
don't think I have to do anything
special here alright in there way far so
there you go guys you're gonna have to
create two functions one's gonna be
called is prime the other one's gonna be
called get Prime's and you can pause
your video right now and give that a try
otherwise I'm gonna do it for you right
now oh right so bonus points if you
figured out that the range function that
we created in a previous part of the
tutorial would be a useful things I have
there of course I just went ahead and
put that in there since I've already
covered it actually we've used this
function a couple times and there is the
working code for our range function so
what we want to do now if you want to
pause the screen type that in or like I
said get the code do whatever you want
alright so now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create is prime and we're
also gonna create get Prime's
so is prime is obviously going to return
a boolean and it's gonna receive a
number that is going to that we're gonna
check against and then for the other one
called get Prime's what we're gonna do
for it is it's going to receive or it's
going to return a vector of integers and
it's get primes and like we defined down
below it is just going to have a maximum
number that we are going to check for
some just copy this guy right here and
come in here and paste that in
and we will create that and then I'm
gonna get this guy right here copy that
and paste that in as well all right so
now we just have to create them so like
I said I'm gonna do a really simple
solution to check if a number is prime
or not I'm not gonna get into a really
complicated stuff I'll do that later on
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just going
to create a simple for loop and we're
gonna use our range function that we
placed inside of there I'm gonna start
it - we're going to go from number minus
1 we're gonna increment by 1 each time
through and then I'm just gonna say if
num modulus and n is equal to zero well
in that situation if we ever get a
situation in which there is no remainder
then we know that we D we have a number
that is not a boolean otherwise if it
goes through all the four loops all
those different values we are going to
return true okay it's a pretty simple
way to check if a value is a prime value
or not and now we'll go and we will
generate a vector full of primes and of
course we're gonna go and create side
vector first and we are just gonna call
this vector primes and we're going to
create a for loop here Auto X use our
handy-dandy range function once again
we're gonna start it - we're gonna go up
to the maximum number and you know that
the user just said that they wanted us
to go up - and then we're going to call
is prime over and over and over again so
we'll get like this and in a situation
in which it is prime well we're going to
add it to our vectors so we'll say
pushback of course which is gonna add
that value to our vector and you could
see here just as simple it was to create
something I guess that people could
think was complicated all right we could
save it and we can run it and what I do
error 44 so here use of undeclared
identifier max
crimes and here we have max prom ah I
put max Prime's it should have been max
prime okay run again and everything's
fine so what we can do here first is
check if a value is prime let's put 19
inside of there and it comes back is 19
prime it gives me a value of true you
can see now instead of putting ones and
zeros and puts true inside of there and
then I could say generate prime numbers
up to hey let's save 5,000 and you're
gonna see that it does that
alright so pretty cool stuff hopefully
you guys got that correct I am now I'm
gonna go into my last problem for today
and that is a to command and generate a
random vector full of numbers all right
so this is mainly to test it's a test to
see if you remember how to generate
random numbers and also to see if you
can figure out how to generate random
numbers within a range so what I'm going
to have the user do in this situation
let's go into our main function
and let's create there's gonna be
something you need to include to
generate random numbers I'm not going to
tell you see if you remember so I'm
gonna go and create a vector once again
integer and I'm just gonna call this a
vector of values it is gonna be equal to
and this is the function you're gonna
create it's gonna be called generate
random vector and the user is going to
be able to come in here and type in as a
number of values they want number of
random values inside of the vector and
also they're gonna be able to tell you
at what number they want to start and at
what number they want to end so there is
the trick in this and then after that
you're just going to output them on the
screen for all the world to see and then
we're gonna go and we're gonna output
this simple simple and there we are so
there is your hint and now you can pause
the screen and try to create this
devious little guy or you can watch me
do it
alright so did you remember what we need
we are going to there's a bunch of
different ways I'm going to show you a
C++ specific way of generating random
values
and I'll do it in the next tutorial all
right we're gonna use C time to help us
generate our random values and this guy
is going to receive a or it's gonna
return a vector of integers and it's a
name as obviously generate random vac
it's gonna receive an integer and I'm
gonna call it num of gnomes so the total
number of values at once we're gonna
have our minimum value and we're also
going to have our max value so now we
need to create this function we're gonna
do it come down here and we will create
it so what are we gonna need to do once
again well we're gonna very first define
our vector value that we're gonna be
returning so of course that is integer
and of course I got that from right here
that's where I got that all right so I
want that and that's gonna be a vector
values is what I'm gonna call that and
then what I need to do is I need to
generate my seed so I'm going to go S
Rand and time and null if you don't know
what that means it's just gonna allow me
to generate random values based off of
the ever changing times okay which is
the number of seconds since January the
1st 1970 I believe I've taught my head
ok so we have that generated now what
we're going to do is we're going to
create an integer I is equal to 0 and
then we're gonna have random value also
equal to 0 and let's go and create more
of this stuff I'm gonna generate a while
loop here and we're gonna continue
cycling as long as whoops
I already did create I as long as I is
less than the gnome of numbers that it
wants me to generate and then comes the
complicated part well you know what
let's go an increment I inside of here
now comes the complicated part how am I
going to come in here and generate this
random value in the range in which I
have here well I'm gonna go random value
is going to be equal to then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to put men
inside of here and men is going to be
added so that we're able to
increase the results of our overall
random value so got that set then we
need to actually create our random value
so we'll go Rand just like we did
previously and we'll go and get modulus
of and then we need to correct so
whenever we do a modulus like I said
previously the remainder of the modulus
can't possibly be greater than the
divisor and that what is what max is
gonna be but I need to also correct for
the fact that men is going to you know
need to be subtracted off of the max so
we're gonna have a minimum value but
then we're gonna also make sure that the
max never goes over the max amount so
we're going to go +1 on that and then
after this we're going to subtract out
the men that we previously added so
that's how we can create that and then
what we can do is go and get this random
value and we can push it on to our
vector that we're creating here and
random value and I is gonna be
incremented and the only other thing
we're gonna need to do is we created our
vector so we'll go vector values and
return it and we'll run it and you can
see it went and generated a series of
random values that generated 10 of them
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and they all fall
between the values of 5 and 50 and if I
run it again
you could see there it is and there it
is and there it is hopefully you guys
got something like that and like always
like I said previously and the next part
of the tutorial to get into you know
algorithms like bubble sorts and sorting
procedures and things like that and of
course I'm gonna cover object Orion
of course and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
