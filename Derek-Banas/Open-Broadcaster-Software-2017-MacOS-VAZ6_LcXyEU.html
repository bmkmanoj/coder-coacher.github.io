open broadcaster software tutorial you
guys asked me to make a sort of show you
how to do live streams of games on
YouTube using free software so I'm gonna
do it then I'm gonna use clash Royale
and I'm basically gonna create exactly
what you see here on your screen I'm
going to down here in the right side of
the screen is gonna be a chat system and
you don't see it right now I'm gonna
start it up here in a second and
obviously there's a webcam also we're
going to be able to record not only the
microphone but also the game audio so
it's gonna do pretty much everything and
you guys will be able to make big shot
clash royale videos or whatever type of
videos you'd want this is specific to
Mac because the PC is different and I'm
already live streaming a live stream
while teaching you how to make live
streams so this is a little bit
complicated so I'm just gonna stick to
the Mac right now if you want to see the
PC version leave a comment and I shall
do it and I see all your comments hello
ok so now I'm gonna jump in and I'm
gonna show you how to set everything up
okay so basically obviously you're going
to need the open broadcaster software
and you can get it for Windows or Mac or
Linux or anything and you just go to OBS
project comm and you could view this
video fullscreen so you'll be able to
see that after I record it and after it
processes I will go and put all the
links in the description underneath the
video next thing you're gonna want to do
is you're gonna need something called
sound flower and you're going to have to
click on this guy right here this sound
flower - 2.0 B to this dmg file down
here and you're gonna have to load that
on your computer then you're going to
want to click on the little magnifying
glass in the upper right hand corner and
type in audio MIDI setup and obviously
you know you have to install sound
flower first and whenever you do you're
gonna see audio MIDI setup pop up there
as an option
and then you're gonna have to go and
open that up on your screen and I'm
doing this live I don't doing one they
do live streams that's just going as
best that I can
next thing we're gonna want to do is
you're gonna want to come and open up
the the MIDI application that you had
right there and you're going to want to
come down and let's see here you're
gonna want to click on the plus sign in
the bottom left-hand corner of it and
create multi output device and please
say Java I just saw that in the comments
don't know why and so you're gonna want
to click on create multi output device
this is a live stream by the way
obviously and whenever you do so you are
going to want to check on the built in
output as well as whatever your
microphone is mine has Plantronics there
because I have a plant Ronix microphones
gonna be whatever you want
and also sound flower and then on the
right side of the screen you're also
gonna want to put a check in whatever
your microphone is as well as sound
flower and what this is going to allow
us to do is capture both the microphone
as well as the game audio and let's move
on then what you're going to do is click
on system preferences and bottom the
screen and yes I'll play clash Royale at
the end of this tutorial just to show
you how everything works and I'm not a
very gifted clash Royale program player
but we'll see what happens
okay so System Preferences you're going
to want to open that up and then you're
going to want to double click on sound
then you're going to point at the multi
output device that you just created and
that's going to be under output so make
sure that you have that checked and then
you are going to open up OBS inside of
OBS you are going to first off we're
gonna click we're gonna create comments
audio input iPhone I'm using our iPhone
here for the game video capture device
that's going to be your webcam
background is the background image you
see here with a little night
and also you're going to have your
microphone that you're gonna be speaking
through and what we're gonna do first is
set up our audio so we're going to come
down here click on plus and an audio
input capture after you do that this
little guy's gonna pop up you're gonna
come in here and select whatever your
microphone is and you're gonna click on
OK for that and feel free to pause the
video here because you know I know I'm
moving kind of quick then I'm gonna set
up my background image and I just
created this inside of Photoshop I just
went and got some free images and threw
some stuff in there and figured it would
be alright so again we're gonna click on
plus in the bottom left hand corner
click on image and this is where we're
gonna get our background image and you
can name it whatever you want to and
click on OK and then you locate your
background image and you're going to
just click on browse obviously and you
can click on unload it vanishes if you
want doesn't matter what matter and then
find whatever your background image is
and click on OK and then you will have
that background image then we're going
to move on to capture our video so we're
gonna go and plus and video capture
device and this is gonna need to be for
our webcam so video capture device click
on OK and then I'm even going to use my
webcam I have a c920 which is a great
webcam by the way if you're wondering
and yes you'll be able to - I saw in the
comments who will you be able to start
the livestream from the beginning yes
after it's all done I will process it
but YouTube takes forever to process
sometimes so see what happens all right
so we got a webcam selected and we're
gonna click on OK and then what we're
going to do is set it up so that we can
use our phone it really work with iPad
iPhone pretty much anything and to do
that what we're gonna do is click on the
QuickTime Player
and and it might not be in your bottom
bar you might have to go into your
Program Files or your to your utilities
file and find QuickTime Player but find
it and
it up and then inside of it now whenever
you have that open you're gonna click on
new movie recording and prior to doing
this you're gonna want to connect
whatever your device is to your computer
and then we're going to pop this guy
open and you're gonna select first off
for the camera you're gonna select
whatever your iPhone is and make sure
that there's a check there and then for
the microphone you're also going to
check that you have your iPhone picked
up there and depending upon your
internet speed you can have your quality
be high or maximum just test it out see
whatever works for you and whenever you
do that your advice will pop up on the
screen and you are almost home and
you'll be very ready to go whenever you
do this though make sure you have your
mic your you know your volume turned up
because if it's down the whole way
you're not gonna be able to hear
anything so turn that little guy up
there that's next to the record button
and then we are back in OBS and to go
and get your device you're gonna have to
keep the QuickTime movie on your screen
and whenever you do that you click on
plus on and window capture and then
you're going to just name it whatever
you want and click on OK
and now you're going to see QuickTime
Player and movie recording and that is
referring to your iDevice iOS device and
you're going to be able to pull that
from QuickTime directly into the open
broadcaster software and now what we're
gonna do is go and get our audio so
we're gonna go plus an audio input
capture and you can name it whatever you
want and click on OK and now we're gonna
come in and get the sound from both your
microphone as well as your game audio
and to do that you're going to click on
sound flower 2 H and click on OK
obviously and this is going to be your
main screen on YouTube and down here
you'll see stream name kay
whatever you do protect that what you're
gonna want to do is click on reveal and
you're gonna copy that and a little bit
later on in the stream settings you are
going to paste that inside of there but
what I want to do now is show you how to
set up chat so you'll be able to display
the chat window inside as you are
streaming so what we're gonna do is come
over here and click on those three
little red dots next to the smiley face
and click on pop-out chat and whenever
you do you're gonna want to select just
the beginning of the URL that you have
right there not that is pop-out part but
everything up until that AM sign and
then you're going to jump back over into
OBS and you're gonna click on the little
plus sign at the bottom and select
browser source and open that guy up and
then you're going to paste that URL
directly inside of here you're going to
define whatever you want the width and
height of the chat window to be and you
can see here on the screen it's like red
that's where your chat systems gonna be
all that stuff's gonna be and then
you're going to down inside of here or
we're gonna have CSS that is going to
style it so that it looks nice and I
will provide a in the description after
I get all this done I will provide a
link to all of that stuff in the
description so you'll be able to paste
that in there and it will just work for
you and look nice now what we're going
to do is we're going to set up our
output so you're going to go into
settings inside of OBS and you're going
to set everything up basically exactly
as you see here on the screen like I
said before pause the screen if you want
to take a chance here or we if you want
to slow everything down here so you can
go and type all this in but pretty much
everything is a default after you do
that you're going to click on the audio
once again in settings in OBS and you
could set everything exactly as I have
right there and I'm I have it set up so
that we can cut down on the amount of
Lag so that everything looks kind of
good and then we will come to video and
you can see the video that I have set
here once again this is going to depend
upon your internet speed but this all
works pretty good for me so that's what
I got set up there and then what are we
doing here yeah we are pouncing over it
to this guy once again
oh I'm referring to the stream key
you're gonna click on reveal get that
stream key jump back over into OBS and
you're gonna paste your stream key
whatever the code is right inside of
there set everything else up exactly the
same I don't use twitch I assume twitch
works quite simply and similar like I
said if you guys want me to make a video
anything you want me to make a video
about I will I think I've kind of proven
on at this point so gonna paste all that
stuff inside of there and click on ok
once again for your stream and there you
can see an example of what the comments
will look like inside of your system
and let me see here now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna jump in and do a live
broadcast here there you can see is my
device and we will do a video capture
Here I am hopefully it works well and
actually I just saw somebody said is
this a PowerPoint no I actually have all
those slides directly inside of OBS you
can use OBS for so many cool things and
you don't just you can't just you can
also use OBS to play games it doesn't
have to be just I I phone games
obviously can be android games it could
be desktop games you could use it for
hooking up your console Xbox ps4 you
could do so many cool things for it and
it's it's pretty pretty amazing so let's
see here if you can see there's the chat
system all working pretty cool and now
I'll go in here and play a game just to
prove to you that everything works so
let's open this up
and let's open this up there's clash
Royale and there you can say I'm in and
I am playing and we can come in and do
some things now I'm not a pro player or
anything by any stretch of the
imagination I think I've spent maybe
five dollars on this game ever so I
don't know let you got them whatever you
guys think about the sounds oh yeah
there's this right here you can adjust
the sound by playing around with these
different things down inside of hear it
inside of OBS you can't see it but in
the main software it will allow you to
see that let's see if I can open up a
slide to show you here real quick where
is it
there it is you can see right here this
will allow you to lower your desktop
audio and the game audio as well as the
Michael audio so that's why I'm actually
looking at here while I am talking to
you alright
um and let's just come in here I'll open
up another chest and see what happens
and there we are and there we are and
what the heck I will play a game so I
will come in here and just a test that
everything works this is the thing that
I do the you know based off what I have
like I don't have all the legendary see
all these things I'm missing I don't
have all those stuff like I said I'm not
a hardcore player but I think I'm okay
so let's see how good I am at playing
clash Royale jump right into a battle
here thumbs up
good luck and let's see what I got here
okay that's not very good so Valkyrie
those guys all right so we're just gonna
get whoops I was gonna elixir room let's
go and throw a Meg minion out there and
throw the witch in here this person's
really aggressive so I am going to do
some things here a little bit more
aggressive than what I'm used to me and
let's go fireball that wizard and I'm
sure you enjoy looking at the top of my
head and boom boom boom so we're doing
all right here we're losing a little bit
but whatever I should have on purpose
went and lost a whole bunch of games
before I did this so that I would do a
little bit better in this game here but
you know whatever to do and you know let
me do my elixir this time he's being
less aggressive now and I don't know who
I am playing against no idea who that is
oh this is not good
really stinks because I don't have any
of the really cool sort of cards I think
the coolest card I have is a log and how
often do you hear how cool log is and
now we're gonna make our big push here
alright so there we go he thinks he has
the win on me let's see how well we're
gonna do here oh boy just kill that
Oh killed my witch this guy is not cool
pretty good and we got our tower okay
yes I know OBS can I'm sort of watching
the screen here your chats yes you can
stream anything you can stream anything
with OBS it's totally awesome if you
play around with it a little bit let's
go and be a little bit aggressive here
and let's go and do another elixir
collector and let's go and prepare for
those minions coming at us throw in
another giant suck that up and let's go
and kill his wizard and his other thing
oh I got lucky there and throw this in
here and now I'm just going hog-wild and
dropping it and dropping and dropping
and let's even get another witch out
here and let's do another attack and
let's take all those outs and let's
throw another make minion inside of
there and let's throw another goblin
inside of there and let's go and and I
won
alright so there you go guys
that is how to set up open broadcaster
software how to stream how to do chat
how to do all this stuff how to be
awesome at clash royale and so or at
least as good as I can be and just to
inform everybody of what's coming up I'm
playing a lot of people asked me for ask
me any questions about this software or
whatever you see here if you'd like but
also I wanted to let you know what's
coming up and videos I am and to also
tell me what you want to say I'm always
want your input but a lot of people ask
me for
Visual Basic learned Visual Basic in one
video and I'm trying to do that Visual
Basic is however very heavy in regards
to setting up forms and it is really
causing me some crazy pain here trying
to figure out how to do that because you
know whenever you're doing form design
and so forth you have to move things
around and then resize them and that
eats up a lot of video time so I'm
trying to figure out a way to both show
that but at the same time keep the video
short and condensed like all of my
learner in one videos so if I can't do a
visual basic learner in one video
I might just for fun just to break
things up a little bit because I've been
doing Python tutorials for like months I
might do you know like try to pack in a
whole bunch of Visual Basic tutorials
and like maybe like two weeks of not
nothing but Visual Basic tutorials just
to teach it because I'm getting that
request all the time in Visual Basic is
one of the only languages I have not
covered ever so it would be an
abbreviated Visual Basic tutorial and um
what else I'm also I'm gonna make more
Django tutorials so a couple more just
to cover some of the things I haven't
seen there and by the way I can see your
comments obviously um and no I have not
done I Oh s tutorials yet another thing
it looks like the c-sharp tutorials are
probably going to end up being the thing
which means I'm going to do a c-sharp
tutorial it's gonna be a hundred percent
c-sharp and then I'm gonna convert that
into making c-sharp games it's still not
defined if you guys want to see C++ or C
sharp videos that that is going to be my
new epic video series which is gonna go
on for a couple months leave comments
down below vote tell me what you want
because if you don't vote I don't know
what you want because everything I do is
gonna be based off of of your votes but
that's that's what do you tell me what
to do that's the reason why this video
that I just did exists is because you
voted you told me in the comment section
this is what I want to say and that's
what I did
and I see people are disappointed does
anybody want to want me to play another
clash royale game I'll do another one if
you want just tell me in the comments I
will play again I can be forced to do it
so that's what's coming up it's gonna
depend on votes if I do a big giant huge
month months and months and months long
C++ tutorial that's based off of more of
an academic level I'm not making C++
games I don't feel like doing that
because it's just going to be irritating
or I can do the c-sharp route and do
c-sharp games okay so that is what's
gonna be depending upon your your votes
and and obviously if I do the c-sharp
game tutorials they're gonna be mobile
games but we could do anything we'd like
make games on desktop or whatever so is
anybody want me to play one more game I
play well market attack so let's see
what happens here
like I said I am NOT the best they don't
try to act like I am
what is this silliness down here Oh epic
chest I don't have ten thousand okay so
let's go in and I'm gonna do another
battle and yes more django tutorials are
coming if I lose this I can bait I can
blame it on the comment section here so
that's a good thing
alright not doing anything elixir
collector good luck and let's go in here
and do it boy this guy is gonna lose
okay that's what he's doing alright so
here comes Sparky let's see what happens
with old Sparky and I'm left for a giant
down here and this
alright so that's what he's pulling it
let's just go bomb oops I'm wait he did
that bad all right
I hate Sparky I think everybody hated
Sparky let's go and kill this let's see
if I can pull this off and I did it he
got some damage on me but whatever okay
so I felt like I was doing good but now
I'm doing bad let's come in here and
drop another elixir collector and I'm
sure I'm gonna see another Sparky here
in a minute
mmm oh that's weird he should have and
let's throw a witch down here let's
throw now I'm gonna do my push throw a
giant down here and I would like to have
my goblins all set up but I don't have
them set up so let's throw that in there
and goblins and let's start doing some
damage here
go and get a fireball oh yeah
fireball all right there you go all
right so Sparky is getting whooped on
here and let's throw down a Valkyrie and
there's nothing better than beating a
Sparky deck and let's go and get
ourselves a giant and let's go and get
ourselves a witch and let's go and throw
a make minion down there and let's go
and fireball them and let's go and zap
them and ah I want a three stars guy but
let's see maybe I should just chill
let's just chill
let's just win this game rather than try
to be a show-off and let's do that and
you're gonna lose because you're a loser
and sorry gonzo Monza and let's go
through Valkyrie inside of there again
you're gonna lose this is all that said
okay there's a giant and there we go two
one
awesome okay so one again guys so there
it is
there is my open broadcaster software
tutorial once again tell me about your
input on what you want to see in the
future and otherwise it's been fun and
you guys have a great day and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
