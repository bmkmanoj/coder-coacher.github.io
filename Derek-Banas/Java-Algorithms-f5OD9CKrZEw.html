java algorithms tutorial today I'm going
to introduce you to both algorithms as
well as data structures this tutorial is
going to be heavy code wise and I'm
going to present algorithms in numerous
different ways so let's get into it so
what exactly is an algorithm it's just a
series of steps you take to manipulate
data that's it it's not that complicated
so what are data structures they're just
a way the data is arranged in memory and
today we're going to focus on the main
data structure operations or algorithms
that you're going to need to understand
completely
being inserting values deleting values
and searching for values and we are
going to focus on a race and I know
everybody says they understand arrays
but I'm going to get into a question I
get all of the time about
multi-dimensional arrays but while I'm
here I might as well cover the basics
whenever we're going to create an array
of course we're going to define how many
boxes we want and this is an array over
here and of course the very first index
is 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and so forth and so on so by
putting this line right here we're
basically saying we want 3 boxes down
here we actually initialize the array
and put 12 16 and 24 just like you see
right there the third value in this
situation would come from the second
index and of course that would be 24 and
if we would ever call for array name
with the index 1 it would return 16
basic stuff out of the way so what is
going on in this situation this is
initializing a large multi-dimensional
array and I get questions on this stuff
all of the time now finally I'm going to
answer it basically whenever you see in
an initialization of an array like this
what the boxes represent the first one
being how many down well you can see
right here
1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so if we were want to get ahold
of this value of 0 to 0 we would put 2
inside of there for the index 0 1 &amp;amp; 2
then the second box is going to
represent how many across in our
multi-dimensional array being 0 1 2 3 or
for total boxes now's whenever things
get complicated whenever we get to the
third box which is going to be how many
of these groupings are we going to need
now since it is set at one things aren't
that complicated as you can see this is
in essence one page one big box with a
bunch of boxes inside of it but what
happens whenever we increase this value
from one in essence we have just created
two pages exactly as you see here on the
screen and the only difference for the
second page is we are going to increment
the third value just as you can see
right there for every single one of the
indexes on that second page so now I'd
like to jump over and look at a
graphical program to show you all the
different things we were going to cover
in this tutorial and I basically threw
together this little program here you
can download it its own link underneath
the video if you want to play around
with arrays inside of this or see how a
multi view controller sort of setup
would work which I've also been getting
a lot of questions on so what we're
going to cover is how to delete indexes
so let's say we want to delete index six
in this situation just type in six and
then delete and you're going to see this
ten move up and there it did just like
that we're also going to see how to
insert values and you also may have
noticed that the index value altogether
or that row deleted we're going to cover
that as well we can also insert a value
let's say 23 insert and you're going to
see there it is down there we're also
going to cover multiple different ways
to find values so let's say we wanted to
find all of the 16s inside of this no
problem just put 16 inside of there for
value and here we're going to do a
linear search and click on find and you
can see that 16 shows up in index 1 3 &amp;amp;
4 and in fact 1 3 &amp;amp; 4 show up right like
that we're also going to cover how to
sort both using ascending sort just like
that as well as descending sorts just
like that and we're going to do a whole
bunch of other different things in this
tutorial so let's just jump
right in the code okay so I basically
have a class here called array
structures and all this code is
available in link underneath the video
so and I'm going to create a private
integer array I'm going to call it the
array and if I want to define that it's
going to contain 50 boxes not 50 values
well that's exactly how I'm going to do
that then I'm also going to be storing
the array size because I don't want to
be printing out the default values
whenever I'm cycling through these
arrays I'm just going to want to print
out the parts of the arrays that have
values so that's going to be something
that's important for us to work with and
let's say that I want to come in here
and create a random number of values
inside of my array well of course I'm
just going to go integer I create a for
loop for this guy and here array size is
set for 10 so I'm only going to be
generating ten of those and then to add
them to my array of course I'm going to
go they array and then put an I inside
of here I know this is all basic stuff
we're going to get into the more
complicated things here in a second just
want to cover everything and we'll just
go random and let's say that I want
numbers between ten and nineteen ten and
ten to the end of that and there we are
now we have an array full of random
different values now if I want to print
these out on my screen in a way that
makes it look like an array with little
brackets around it I'm just going to go
print array and system.out.print line
and one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten I think that's ten and
then if I want to print out all of my
different values I haven't stored inside
of it well just going to go from 0 let's
say an array size and then increment I
as we go and then let's print little
brackets here so I'm just going to go
like this I'm going to print out the
index and then if I also want to print
out the array value I'm gonna go the
array I or another line inside of there
and I should put another space there and
then print this line here as well now
what I'm going to be able to do is come
down here and actually create this guy
so what I call this the array so I'm
going to have to go array structures
new array is equal to new array
structures then I can go new array and
generate my random array for myself and
then if I want to print my array and use
that guy right there
zoom in here find printer and click on
it and then execute it well that looks
terrible so let's come up here instead
of print line let's take that out just
leave that as print I'll save execute
and there you can see much better so we
got our index and we got all of our
values and it looks just like an array
would look so let's get into the actual
algorithms of this guy things we're
going to be doing all the time how
exactly are we going to get a value by
our index now this is a simple one
public int get value at index and I'll
get past an index and let's say that I
want to verify that the index is less
than my array size no problem return the
array and the index value and otherwise
let's just say return 0 just do anything
basic basic stuff and of course new
array get value at index and let's say
we want 3 then let's throw a
system.out.print line around this guy
I'll save execute and you can see here
index 3 18 and there is 18 I know still
simple let's get more complicated now
let's say we want to find out if an
array contains a value and what we're
going to do with this guy is return a
boolean does array contain this value
little long name I know search value
boolean value an array is equal to false
and then if we're going to search
through them of course we're going to
use our for loops again I array size and
then we're just simply going to bounce
from a raider array and say does the
array value in that box equal the search
value and if it does work this as true
and then at the end we're going to just
return it do pretty much the same thing
we have before new array does array
containing this value and then inside of
it we'll put 18 this is going to be a
surprise for us all execute and false
came up and we don't see 18 there
that is a good thing so let's ratchet it
up get a little bit more complicated how
are we going to go about deleting an
index and then moving all the other
values up a little bit more complicated
than before and let's look at briefly
exactly what we're going to try to do
here okay so we're going to have like we
have here we have three boxes with
values inside of them if we decide we
want to delete the zero index what we're
going to do next is we are going to copy
the value of the first index just like
we did right there and then we're going
to move down inside of our array copy
the next lower value being ten up here
over the original 18 and then after we
get to the end of the array we are going
to delete the last value in the array so
how are we going to do that code wise
let's go public void lead index and of
course we're going to have to get an
index to delete from and we're going to
do a little check here to make sure that
our index is lower than our array size
and then like I said before we're going
to overwrite the value for the supplied
index and then keep overwriting every
index that follows until we get to the
last index in their array so here's our
trusty for loop again this time we're
going to start at the index that they
provided right like that and we're going
to go up to array size minus one because
we have one less actual value than our
array size because of the zero index of
course and then we're just going to
simply say that ray I is going to be
equal to the array I plus one and that
is going to move up those values and
we're going to continue doing it until
we get to the very end of the ramp and
then after that since we no longer have
as many spaces in our array we're going
to decrement the array size so let's
take a look at that new array deletes
index just like we saw before and let's
say we want to delete index four and
then let's say that we want to print out
our array just like we did before file
save and execute and there we can see
index four is what we wanted to delete
the value there was 18 and the values
above it were 19 and 11 and if we come
down here you can
it's gone there's 1911 we knocked out
that original value in the fourth index
and now you can see we have one less
space inside of our array so let's
continue how are we going to insert
values well we're going to insert them
at the end of our array so we'll just go
in value again I'm going to do the same
thing I'm just going to copy this and
then I'm going to go array size to make
sure that we don't try to throw in a
value if we no longer have space inside
of our array so make sure that we keep
that below 50 and then we're just going
to go the array array size and insert
the value and then we just got to
increment the array size and again the
reason why race size works there and not
array size +1 is because of the zero
index is going to be one less than what
we actually have and then of course we
can insert a value new array insert
value and let's say that we want to put
55 inside of there so it stands out and
then we can print our array and execute
and there you can see 55 is inside of
there any other reason why that's 9 is
because we previously deleted it
well now let's do something a little bit
more complicated being a linear search
with a linear search what we're going to
do is look at every single indexed value
in the entire array and how this would
work would be if you wanted to find both
11s inside of this because linear search
works better whenever you want to find
all matches instead of just one if you
only want to find one match if there's
no duplicates in your array then a
binary search is going to work better
you're going to see that in a second so
how we going to do our linear search
just go public string linear search or
value and it's going to get a value that
we're going to search for inside of our
array boolean value in array which is
going to be like a question well we're
going to start off with it being false
and then let's say indexes with value
because we're going to get all our
matches not just the first one we find
like we're going to do with the binary
search
system.out.print and we're going to say
something like the value was found in
the following indexes or whatever I'm
just going to leave it like that
the linear search is very
straightforward
we going to do we're going to go and
create our for loop int I 0 index I
array size and then real basic we're
going to go the array I does it match
our value and if it does we're going to
say value an array is equal to true
system.out.print line actually print and
then I'm just going to put aa inside of
there and put a space and then let's say
that I want to store this to return it
or something like that because I do have
this set up as a string return indexes
with value I'm just going to put I plus
spaces and then after our for loop has
finished I can go if value in array
because remember that's a boolean and we
can go indexes with value it's going to
copy this in that situation I'm going to
make that equal to none and we could
actually also print that out here onto
the screen indexes with value and then
let's say we want to just print a space
at the end of that and also at the same
time print out or return the indexes
with value if we wanted to do that I
don't know as you guys know I'd like to
do these things out of my head so now
let's see what it looks like when we
execute a linear search for values new
array and then we're going to go and do
linear search for value and I'm just
going to put 17 inside of there and
execute it and see what happens and you
can see here the value was found in the
following indexes 5 7 &amp;amp; 8 and there's 8
7 &amp;amp; 5 so that's how a linear search
works well I've covered a ton of
different things in this tutorial in the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
show you how to use bubble sort to both
sort in ascending and descending order
and binary search different ways to swap
values and a whole bunch of other things
please leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
