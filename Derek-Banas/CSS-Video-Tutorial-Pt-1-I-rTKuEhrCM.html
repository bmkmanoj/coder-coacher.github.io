one of my cascading stylesheets tutorial
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
absolutely every single way to interact
with cascading stylesheets and explain
everything you can possibly do with them
well the normal way that people bring
style sheets into their HTML files and
all they do is they just style all of
the different texts that you should have
seen in either my HTML tutorial or my
xml tutorial and also this all is a
continuation of my web design and
programming tutorial I provide links to
all of those on the screen right now but
the normal why people bring them in as
they type in link type is equal to text
/c SS re l equals stylesheet and all
this is doing is telling the browser
that this is a style sheet and then of
course H reference is going to point at
the style sheet right like that and of
course we want to close it off like this
so this is the normal way so you have a
style sheet that's just full of a bunch
of descriptions of what you want your
tags to look like and they are in a
outside file and this is how you link to
that outside file what I'm going to do
here in this tutorial is instead of
jumping back and forth between multiple
different files at once cause I don't
think that's really important is I'm
going to use the style tag now this is
frowned upon but just understand that
for example if I wanted to make all of
my body tags and all anything basically
any text that lies within the body green
this is how I would do it and the style
sheet that I just showed you would be a
full of a bunch of these things no style
tag just a bunch of these definitions
and this is exactly how you define all
these things so let's say that I want
any text inside of my paragraph tags to
be the color purple well this is exactly
how I would define that now I'd close
off that definition and then I can also
define styles for multiple different
tags all at one time so here I'm
defining styles that I want to be
attributed to all of my h1 tags emphasis
and bold tags and you can see where you
normally define all these things is
inside of the header file just before
that what place right there and normally
people stop put all their styling
information after they define the title
ok and you could also define font family
and here what you do is type in
specifically what you would like
to see first use Times New Roman and if
that's not available then you would
prefer to use Georgia and if that's not
available you want to use serif which is
always available and this is sans-serif
right here this is a sans serif font see
there's no little hooks on there and
we'll get into them more of this here in
a second and then you close that off and
then here also I'm going to define that
I want all my anchor or my links to have
the font family or Dania preferable if
that's unavailable Arial which is almost
always available and if that's not
available then sans serif and if none of
these are available which these last two
are always going to be available the
default that the user or the browser set
up is going to be used and then after
you define all those in the style tags
you want to of course close off that
area of your definition for all of those
guys all right now I'm going to
demonstrate exactly what the cascading
part of style sheets means it's
basically based off of the fact that if
you're defining that you want all of
your text to be green and you're using
the body tag and the body tag surrounds
everything because that's what the body
is it surrounds everything that's
displayed on the browser that means by
default now all of your text is going to
be green unless another tag that lies
below this is defined with another color
so for example at this point everything
on the screen all the text is going to
be green and less text is inside of a
paragraph tag and then it's going to be
purple however let's say that I would go
up here and I would put font family
inside of body and define that as
verdana but I do not define a font
family inside of the paragraph tags well
what this is going to do is it's going
to override the color green and it make
all the text inside of paragraph tags
purple however this definition is going
to cascade down into all of the other
definitions so by default everything
else is going to be for Danya until you
get to this point where they define a
new font family so everything cascades
all the rules that are not overridden by
tags that lie under simply cascade so
this will be font family verdana but
this has changed so now it's going to be
Times New Roman and then this link which
hasn't been touched at all except for
the fact that if it's in a paragraph tag
or in a body tag is going to
by default for Dania and this
technically doesn't have to be here at
all because it's not affected by any of
these other definitions so I'm just
going to show you here how all these
different things will change so I got
the body tag and it's saying all the
text must be green and I'm just going to
type in here body text and then I'm
going to define a paragraph tag this is
text and I'm going to throw a break
statement here and then I'm going to use
the italic tag close that off break h1
if you can remember from before I went
in there and defined some different
rules for h1 tags and here I'm going to
create a link this is bold and then I'm
going to close off the paragraph tag
altogether more body text and then I'm
gonna come up here and throw it on the
break statement in if I save that jump
over here reload it gonna see some
things happen okay so you saw what I did
there on that side so I'm going to go
over some of the definitions and explain
what exactly is happening here because
cascading of rules work differently
based off of whether the tag is what we
would call a block element and a
paragraph is a block element and if you
didn't see the previous HTML tutorial
what seperates what are called block
elements from what are called inline
elements is the fact that a block
element will force a new line to occur
where inline statements will not so for
example a link is an inline statement
you can see that it did not force a new
line and let me just go in here to
reinforce that fact I'm going to come in
here and delete that I'll save it and
watch this is going to jump up there say
jumped up why because inline statements
do not force a line break and just so
you are 100% positive of what is a block
statement I'm going to show you every
single one of them block quote if
statements which I'm going to get into
here in a second definition lists forms
all the H tags I'm just going to put h1
down there or I can just put H tags
horizontal rules which draws a line it
forces a new line ordered lists
paragraphs as we've already discuss
tables and unordered lists better is the
complete list that is every single block
element if a tag is not one of these
guys that means it is an inline that's
it these are the only block elements
that exist in HTML code so what's going
on here
let's go back up to where we defined
what we're doing all right we said we
want all of our body text to be green as
long as it's not contained within a
paragraph tag what we can see here body
text is green but then what goes on here
why is this purple well the reason why
this is purple is because it's inside of
a paragraph tag see this is some
paragraph text
this is italic text this is but then
wait a minute why does the h1 tag show
up as green the reason why are the block
elements and you if you look here
closely body is not a block element
whatever you define inside a body will
extend to every single tag but if you
use one of those block elements such as
it here where we define everything
contained in the paragraph should be the
color purple it does not affect any of
the other h1 tags or other block
elements that are contained within the
paragraph tag so just because you define
a rule in a paragraph tag that rule is
not going to extend to any elements or
any tags that are contained within that
paragraph tag if they are block elements
or one of these guys right here
hopefully that makes sense and on top of
that even though this is supposed to be
purple it isn't and you would be may be
asking well why is this text not purple
because it's not contained inside of one
of the block elements well as soon as it
hits a block element it ceases to pay
attention to any rules that are defined
inside of the paragraph tag so it hits
this h1 tag rule right here and it
ceases to care about the fact that
paragraph tag should be purple so
cascading works to a certain extent
right up until the point in which it
hits a block element and it ceases to
work however since you did define that
you want the font family to be verdana
and this is an inline statement and not
a block statement it goes back to using
the rules of paragraph meaning that the
color should be purple and also that the
font used is verdana or sans serif as
you can see right here and right here
you see what our serif fonts see those
little guys hanging off the side of the
letter those are serifs
these are sans serifs as are everything
else there on the screen so that is how
cascading works in cascading style
sheets
everything just falls down to all the
tags and underneath of it as long as it
is not a block element if it is a block
element it follows whatever rules are
defined inside of body or any rules that
are defined for that specific block
element and ignores everything else so
let's come in here and let's say that a
customer says to you that they want
their h1 tags to be different colors
depending upon what title they are being
used on well it's real easy I'll just
describe to you how to make multiple
versions of one individual tag so what
we're going to do is within the style
tags here we're going to define that all
of our h1 tags should be a font family
Times New Roman Georgia or serif and
also let's say that our customer wants
all of the font sizes for all h1 tags to
be 14 pixels okay super so let's close
that off now if we want to create
specific h1 tags that are going to have
for example the color purple what we do
is we just give them a special name so
we type in H 1 followed by purple now
you could have this word here be
anything it doesn't have to be purple
it's just a specific name that I'm
giving or a specific rule that I'm
defining for any h1 tags that I want to
be purple and then I just simply type in
this write like this and close that off
and if we also want to have h1 tags that
are green so for no problem color green
right now down inside of the HTML itself
if I wanted to actually define all these
different guys I could have my h1 tag
let's just call it regular h1 right like
that then I could define my special h1
tag by typing in class and then putting
in purple this purple is a reference to
this name that I put right here not to
this and close that off and here I'm
going to type in purple h1 and then you
close it off with a regular h1 tag you
don't have to type purple in again and
then I could tie a class is equal to
green and if I'll save that
jump over here you could say that they
showed up and let me just zoom in here
you can see here that showed up as black
here it showed up as purple in here
showed up as green and just to prove
that these have no meaning I'm going to
call this
read and then I'm going to call this
read if I'll save now of course you
wouldn't do this in the real world but
you see it still stayed as purple okay
and what's really neat is you can also
create a generic class that isn't tied
to any specific tag and then you can
easily use this special class that you
create to define other tags so how you
do this is let's say we wanted to be
able to easily define any text contained
within a tag to be both purple and a
serif font you would just put a dot and
then put a name in there of any type
that you want and we're going to type in
font family we're going to get a bunch
of different types of serif fonts and
also purple and we're going to close
that guy off and now you can easily turn
any one of these tags like this let's
just say we come in here we go h1 you
can see this has no reference to h1 tags
at all I can just give them into the
class area if I type in purple serif
which is the name that I defined right
here if I'll save it jump over here you
can see that it showed up as a purple h1
tag so those are all the different ways
you can define classes and define all
the different types of styles how you
link to outside CSS stylesheets and how
you can also embed and a whole bunch of
other different ways you can define the
different roles that we you want to use
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you every single font property that you
can change and use in cascading style
sheets if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below and I also provide a link
