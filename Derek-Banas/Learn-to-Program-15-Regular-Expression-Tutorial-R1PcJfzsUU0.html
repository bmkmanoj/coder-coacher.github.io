my learn to program series in this part
of the tutorial and in a couple videos
after this we're going to cover regular
expressions and what makes regular
expressions really awesome is they allow
you to locate and change strings in very
powerful ways another thing that's great
is that they're going to work almost
exactly the same in every programming
language and before I forget if you
haven't watched in the previous parts of
this tutorial you may want to watch
those and I provide a link above and in
the description underneath the video you
will find a transcript of this video as
well as a cheat sheet for everything you
see here and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it
okay so here we are back inside a pie
charm and regular expressions or reg X
are used to search for a specific string
in large amounts of data they allow you
to verify that a string has a proper
format so example if you were
specifically asking for an email you'll
be able to check that it actually fits
the format of an email or a phone number
or whatever they can also be used to
find a string and replace it with
another string or anything else and they
also provide you with a way to format
data into the proper form for importing
for example so let's go in here and
let's start creating some things here
first thing we're going to want to do is
import our regular expression module and
then we'll jump into an example here so
we could do something like let's say
that we have a sentence and we want to
find the word ape inside of it so we
could just type in search like this
we're going to follow that up with
whatever we're searching for and then
we're going to have the string inside of
here that we want to find so the apex
and if this comes back as true that's
what search does it returns true or
false in that situation we can come in
and we could say there
is an eight and if we run that you're
going to see there is an ape comes back
here so let's get a little bit more
specific however let's say we want to
find all the matches will find all is a
method it's going to do that for us so
we could come in and we could say all
apes is going to be equal to or e find
all and we're going to look for ape once
again and then we'll have the like this
now what we could do is go for I in all
apes and we could cycle through those
results and you can see it goes and it
matches two of them however it's only
going to return a pand eight there is a
break there and there is a bright there
but let's say we wanted to also come in
and get apex and have that come out on
our screen
well a period is going to be used to
match any one character or any one space
so if we wanted to come in here and also
go in and get a pan apex we could just
put a dot inside of there and run it and
you're going to see right there you get
ape and apex but up inside of here
you're also going to get the space that
comes after eight we could also do some
other cool things so let's just go and
turn this into a regular old string just
call it a string and get rid of this
we're going to be able to generate an
iterator by using find iterator and it's
going to return an iterator of matching
objects so let's go and do that we'll
say for I in and then we'll go find
iterator
and then we'll type in ape with a dot
after it and then show that we are
specifically going to be searching for
that string that's inside of there and
then we can put a colon at the end of
that and we can go and create another
guy here and use that on each of these
individual objects with a method called
span and span is going to return a tuple
so we're going to store that in location
tuple and let's go and print that out on
the screen so you can see exactly what
that looks like if we run it you're
going to see right there that it comes
back and it shows you the starting index
as well as the ending index but let's
say we wanted to also come in there
and slice out those matches and print
them out on the screen
we could do so also by going the string
and then typing in location tuple and
get the first one inside of there and
then location to poll once again and get
the second item that comes out of there
and you can see right there that we went
in and we found the starting and the
ending index as well as the match and
there you see the starting in the ending
as well as our second match once again
you can see that it also grabbed that
period there and the reason I grabbed
that period is because the dot is going
to match anything including a space so
pretty neat stuff now let's say we
wanted to come in here and match one of
any of several letters well we could use
square brackets which are going to match
any of the characters that are lying in
between the brackets so let's create
animal string and inside of it we'll
throw cat and rat and Matt and Pat we're
going to see what we can grab out of
there go all animals is going to be
equal to and I'm going to do a find all
and in this situation I want to match
anything that ends with at so all of
them that match in that situation but
then I also there's the square brackets
I want to match specifically for C or M
F and P and of course I'm going to be
using the animal string for that
situation we can come in and then cycle
through our results and see exactly what
we got all the animals and just print
those out on the screen and run it and
you're going to see in this situation we
get back rat Matt and Pat well you may
be asking yourself well why didn't I get
cat well the reason why is you have a
lowercase C inside of there instead of
an uppercase C change that to uppercase
and run it again now you're going to see
that you cat C so we're going to show
you a couple more examples here in
regards to how this is going to work out
for us let's say that we would want to
come in here and match a series of
ranges for characters we can also do
that so we'll do some animals is going
to be equal to re we're going to do find
all again we want to get all the matches
inside of here
if we wanted to match for lowercase
letters between C and M we would just
put a dash inside of their uppercase
letters between C and M just put them in
there that way and then we can come in
and do animal string once again and do
the same thing we did previously if you
ever get left behind of course there's
pause button click on it and then you'll
be able to type the code in whoops made
a little bit of an error also I'm going
to want to come in here and type in at
and run that and you're going to see
that we got cat and Matt but we did not
get rat and Pat and the reason why is we
were only looking for letters between C
and M and R and P lie outside of that
range likewise we would also be able to
use the caret symbol inside of here to
denote any character but whatever
characters are in between the brackets
and in this situation if we type C n R
it's going to grab any app word as long
as it doesn't begin with an uppercase C
or a lowercase R and if we run it you
can see we got Matt and Pat so just a
couple little things to memorize and you
can play around and grab pretty much
anything you'd like to grab but now I
want to jump in and show you how to
replace strings so here what we're going
to do is we're going to create a string
called al food and we're going to have a
rat and a cat and a mat and a pat and
what we want to do is come in here and
basically anything that could
potentially be Al food is going to be
replaced with the word owl so kind of
mean for the rat and the cat but that's
the way nature works another thing we're
going to be able to do here is compile a
reg X into what are called pattern
objects which provide with additional
methods one of which is going to be
substitute which you're going to see
here in a second so to compile you're
just going to go compile and then throw
your regular expression inside here so
we want to get the cat and the rat and
make them al food do it just like that
and then the methods sub is going to
replace items that match the regular
expression you defined inside of the
string and let's just save this back
inside of al food and just go red X you
put this guy this compiled regular
expression you're looking for right
there and
and what you want to substitute so we'll
say we want to substitute al anywhere
inside of al food if it matches this
regular expression and of course we have
to print out al food and run it and you
can see right there we went in and
replaced cat and rat because the owl ate
them now something that's going to come
up eventually here that I'd like to get
out of the way is solving what are
called backslash problems now regular
expressions are going to use back
slashes to designate special characters
so you're going to see here in a second
and Python does the same thing inside of
strings and this can cause issues so for
example let's say we're trying to get a
string that is backslash backslash and
stuff how exactly would we do that let's
create that string random string and
we'll just say here is backslash
backslash stuff and we're going to try
to grab it so we'll trow first off here
we'll say print and I'll give you an
example that isn't going to work so we
backslash backslash stuff I'm just going
to call it stuff from now on because
that's sort of a hard thing to say and
then here we're just going to use search
to try to find it and then we'll put
inside of here exactly what we're
looking for
followed by the random string we're
searching for if we run that you're
going to see that none comes back well
let's go in here and fix this we could
also come in and we could type in
backslash backslash like that and run it
and you're going to see that yes indeed
it did find the match right there and it
gave you the starting as well as the
ending index there so there is a easier
way to do this and that is to use raw
strings and to use raw strings you're
just going to put a lowercase R in front
of it like that and raw strings aren't
going to treat backslashes as if they
are special so what that's going to
allow you to do is look specifically for
what you're looking for and if you run
it now with the raw string you're going
to see that yes indeed you were able to
find it okay so that's going to be very
important as we go on here and now I
want to take a look at matching any
single character now we talked about a
second ago that the period right
is going to match any character but what
if we want to match a period how we're
going to handle that
well we're simply going to backslash the
period so let's say we have random
string inside of here and we're going to
have some organizations so f.b.i i-r-s
and then we'll put CIA inside of there
without any periods well we come in and
see how many matches we get and to find
out how many matches we're going to use
a length inside of here then we're going
to re-find
all and then to get what we're looking
for what we're looking for is pretty
much anything followed by a period
that's what the dot represents anything
then we want a period so we're going to
do a backslash and a dot then we want
anything and a backslash and a dot and
then we want anything followed by a
backslash and a dot and that is going to
allow us to get FBI IRS but not CIA
then afterwards go in to random string
and run it and you're going to see that
the matches come back as two so that's
how we're going to backslash so that
we're able to use special symbols
regular expression symbols inside of our
searches another thing we're going to be
able to do is match for whitespace so
let's go and create a random string
inside of here and let's make it go over
a couple different lines so we're going
to say something like this is a long
string that goes on for many lines all
right so now that we have that created
let's say that we would like to go in
there and remove new lines first of all
I want to do though is I want to
actually print this out on the string so
that you can see exactly what's going on
and now we'll go in and we will remove
the new lines so rig X and we're going
to compile our regular expression inside
of here and specifically what we were
looking for are new lines and the
special code for new line is backslash
and just like you saw previously I'll
show you a whole bunch of other ones
here in a moment and then if we want to
go and remove those new lines from our
random string we just go right
expression dot sub and then we'll put
what we want to replace the newline
which is going to be a space and then
specifically what we're going to be
working with is that random string that
we have up here and now after we do that
we can come in and we can print that to
see exactly how it changed and run it
here you can see the string is exactly
as it was with the new lines and here
you can see is the string with the new
lines removed and if you want to know
with the other white spaces that you
will be able to work with are you can
see right here is backspace form feed
carriage return tab and vertical tab and
on windows alone you may also need to go
in and specifically replace this guy
right here because windows very often
uses that instead of just the basic
newline so that's something to play
around with if you're running this on a
Windows computer so let's go in and talk
about how we can match any single
numbers and provide a couple more
examples
basically backslash D is going to be
exactly the same as if you would type in
0 through 9 like this and backslash D is
going to be exactly the same as if you
would go in and throw the caret inside
of there and put 0 through 9 so this is
going to match any numbers 0 through 9
and this is going to match anything but
the numbers 0 through 9 and that's
individual digits so let's say that we
have random string once again and this
is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 and let's go
and do a specific search so we'll do
print and we'll do matches once again
and see how many matches we get we're
going to use length for that
re and find all and then we'll do a
search for a digit like that and you're
going to see here in a moment how we can
go in and match for the entire block but
let's just run it and you can see right
there that based off of that string we
were able to find five individual
matches so how would we go in and match
multiple numbers actually very easy
we're going to use curly brackets in
this situation so if we were
specifically looking to match for five
numbers
you can just go in through our curly
brackets inside of there and type in
five and run it you're going to see the
match comes back as one if we would
change that to two and run it you can
see the match right there comes back is
two and the wave regular expressions
work is once you eat up you find a match
you I call it eating up but basically
once you find the match it is no longer
included in further searches so that's
the reason why this comes back is to so
you got right there there's two so right
there is your first match and then your
second match is going to be the three
and the four and then whenever it
searches again it can't find any more it
only finds one and that's reason why you
get two matches out of that other things
neat is we're going to be able to match
within a range so let's say we wanted to
match values that are between five and
seven digits let's do number string and
let's just do 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we want to see how
many matches we could get out of that
I'll just do print and matches again
length find all with regular expression
in front of it and then what we are
specifically looking for we're looking
for numbers and if we want to find
numbers that are either 5 6 or 7 numbers
in length we put 5 with comma and 7 and
then of course we put in exactly what
we're searching for if we run that you
can see we come back it's 3 matches and
we match for this one this one and that
one you're gonna see very soon here that
there's very few things you need to
memorize getting most of the
memorization out of the way in this
first part of the tutorial and then
we'll get into other things as it
continues so now let's look at how we
can match any single letter or number
so basically backslash W is going to be
exactly the same as if you would type A
through Z capital A through Z and you
have to type in the lower case and the
upper case you want to match for those 0
through 9 which are going to be your
numbers you want to match for and the
underscore and of course as you may have
guessed if you type in an uppercase W
like this it's going to be the same as
if you put the caret inside of there so
this is going to match for all the
characters and inside of there this is
match for anything that isn't the things
that are listed inside of there let's go
into a couple examples so you can see
how this works so let's say here that we
wanted to come in and check if something
was a phone number or not I could do
this with digits right over just doing
this out of my head just this will work
just perfectly fun so here is a
telephone number if we would like to
come in here and check if it's a number
the digits in this situation would work
better meaning the backslash D but
whatever this isn't work perfectly fine
as well so how would I match this well I
would just come in here and I would say
that I want to consider something a
phone number if it starts off with three
characters so just throw three inside of
there
the next thing you want to match is a
dash again you want anything inside of
there that's a letter or number and
again we want three of those and then
another dash for the dash that you see
there backslash again W and then in this
latch situation we want a four so that
is specifically what we are looking for
and we're looking for it in our phone
number inside of there and it will say
it is a phone number and run it and you
can see it comes back as it is a phone
number and if we went and change that
and ran it you're going to see you get
no results on that that's how we can
combine those different things and you
can see we can use our special little
character codes like this and at the
same time we could throw just regular
old dashes inside of there and that's
the way it works let's do something a
little bit better here let's say that we
were specifically looking to see if a
first name is valid and let's say in our
world a valid first name is going to be
between two to twenty characters we can
do that
and run search once again on it and
specifically we're going to be looking
for something in this between two and
twenty characters in length and then
what we'll be looking for specifically
and then we could say is a valid name
and run it and you could somebody you
can see over here it comes back as if
that is a valid name there's also a
shortcut for working with whitespace
once again
have your backslash s for space and that
is going to be exactly the same as the
special characters you saw before so
there's the form feed a new line and all
of those other different things tab and
vertical tab and so forth so backslash s
is going to match all of those and guess
what if you would go in and put an
uppercase s that's going to match
anything that isn't one of those things
so let's go in do another example let's
say we wanted to check for a valid first
and last name well we can go and do that
with a search and we'll say we have
those characters right there and we want
it to be between two and twenty
characters in length and then we want a
space inside of there you just throw
that inside of there then you want to
throw 20 in length and then once again
if that works we want to say it is valid
let's throw a name inside of here of
course
there it goes there's a name and is it
valid and yes indeed it is valid so
that's how you can squeeze spaces inside
of there and verify that spaces are
inside of whatever you're searching for
another thing we have is the plus sign
and what it's going to match for is one
or more characters so let's say we
wanted to do a match for the letter A
followed by one or more characters click
into print do a matches once again link
re-find
all regular expression we're looking for
is letter a followed by one or more
characters and then the string we're
going to work with is a as a p-- and
we'll throw a bug inside of there
run you can see we get three matches and
here you can see that it went and
grabbed the a just by itself the plus
sign in this situation is going to match
for that space it's then going to grab
as and it's then going to grab eight and
you can see also that's smart enough to
know when to start and stop whenever
it's searching inside of here to find
your matches and that brings us to a
final problem here what I'd like you to
do is to create a regular expression
that's going to match email addresses
from a list so what we basically needed
are what are our rules for what is an
email address well in this situation
these are the rules that I want you to
follow I want you to first off look for
1 to 20 lowercase and uppercase letters
numbers plus I want period underscore %
plus and minus then of course you're
going to have an @ symbol then you're
going to look for 22 or two to twenty
lowercase and uppercase letters numbers
plus a period and a dash followed by a
period and then you're going to look for
two to three lowercase and uppercase
letters so pause the video and jump in
there and see if you can create it
otherwise I'm going to show you the
solution right now all right so I'm just
going to create a junk email list all
right so there you go some nonsense and
we're going to see how many email
addresses are actually inside here so
I'm going to go email matches and of
course we're going to do our length once
again re-find all and then inside here I
need to define exactly what an email
address is going to look like based off
of following these rules right here so
what do I'm looking for well I'm looking
for basically letters or numbers as well
as periods you don't need to backslash
the periods whenever they're inside of
square brackets
underscore % + + a - or - and I'm
specifically looking for 1 to 20 of
those guys then I'm looking for an @
symbol then we just keep on working from
there after that I'm going to put a
square bracket inside of there I'm going
to say that I want letters or numbers as
well as dot and a - like this and I want
between 2 and 20 of those then I'm
specifically looking for a period then
I'm going to be looking for uppercase
letters as well as lowercase letters and
they are going to be between 2 &amp;amp; 3 in
length come outside of here and then the
email list is what we're going to be
searching for and if I run that you're
going to see that email matches comes
back as 1 let's go in there throw
another one ends out of there
eat at email com
and run it again you can see there match
that and it disregarded all of these
guys sorry good guys that is an
introduction to using regular
expressions hopefully found out fun and
jump in there and try some other
different examples on your own in the
next part of the tutorial I'll do more
complicated things with regular
expressions and just like always please
leave your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
