talk about referral strategies the
reason I'm talking about referral
strategies is Randy 19 wrote in and
asked do you have any information on
referrals I really need referral
strategies a referral script I could
follow would be great well Randy 19
you're gonna get just that chances are
very good that you have customers that
like you so why are they not referring
your business chances are they just
never think about it if your services
were brought up in conversation they
might refer you business or they might
not think about it when's the last time
you refer business to somebody people
might tell you all the time how great
your hair looks they never say that to
me but people might tell you that at
that point you might say well I get my
hair cut here or more than likely you
will not ill just say thank you what you
need to understand our people very
kindly remember symbols things like this
silly little thing bring all kind of
memories washing back to me or this
little guy or this bobblehead you've had
many amazing experiences that you'd
never think about until the day you pick
up a concert ticket and then boom
instantly you're thrown back into that
period of time if you don't believe me
open up a junk drawer and take a look at
some of the souvenirs you've saved now
could you conjure up those memories
without the souvenir yeah sure you could
but chances are you won't what you need
to do is to create a souvenir anchor
that will get your customers to remember
you and then get that souvenir anchor
into their office but I would go even
better than that if you don't know what
an anchor is an anchor is a simple touch
word or object that win experienced
makes you feel and re-experience
something from your past now you
obviously want to anchor yourself to a
positive experience that your customer
has so the next time you go back to
their office you want to look for things
they're proud of a great thing to anchor
12 would be photographs of children or
grandchildren or something like that
photographs are great for anchoring now
you just simply have to figure out what
gift you're going to give that customer
it shouldn't be expensive it should be
unique it most definitely should
represent whatever event you're trying
to anchor to it should be personalized
someone and it definitely should be
given unexpectedly this is the sort of
gift I'm referring to so in my example I
am going to say that my customer showed
me photographs of his grandchildren
something that's very calm and it
happens all the time then you simply
want to follow this script you would say
Paul I've been thinking about it we've
been working together for the past eight
years and I get calls from businesses
acquaintances of yours all of the time
then you say I have to believe that the
reason I've received these calls from
your acquaintances is because you've
brought up my services or my business
during conversation then you just simply
hand them the gift and say I want to
give you this as these personal thank
you for referring me so many times in my
example I'm going to refer and say to my
customer I remember how fondly you
looked upon the photographs of your
grandchildren last time I was here and I
think this frame would fit one of them
perfectly then end the script with thank
you buddy your health has been very
appreciated chances are they're going to
accept the gift whether they remember
giving referrals or not they'll think
themselves maybe I did give them a
referral or at the very least they're
just not going to want to bring it up
and spoil the moment I'd like to talk a
second about reciprocation human beings
follow certain rules in life one of them
is reciprocating by reciprocating I mean
that if someone does a favor for you you
are expected to do a favor of equal
value for them this rule is responsible
for the whole creation of societies
across the entire world in fact if
people never shared the cities and towns
would not even exist nowadays a long
time ago we started sharing food for
pottery and so forth and someone and
that's where reciprocation come true in
fact this rule is so powerful that
anyone who doesn't return a favor for a
favor is looked upon very distastefully
so what's going to happen now every
single time your customer looks at the
picture frame he's going to remember how
much he loves his grandchildren he's
going to remember you gave him the
picture frame he's then going to
remember that you gave him the picture
frame because you thought that he was
referring you business he's going to
remember you're a swell guy and then to
reciprocate this nice gift that you gave
them he is going to want to reach out
and find you business and refer you
you might be asking yourself isn't this
kind of manipulative absolutely what you
have to understand is it's impossible to
not communicate on one level or another
what I'm simply doing is showing you a
positive way to communicate and anchor
good feelings let's say instead of doing
what I just told you to do you go to
Paul's office and that day Paul got a
brand new coffee machine this is the
first time Paul's going to use his
coffee machine and he's going to share a
cup with you whenever you drink from the
coffee cup you respond like this you
make a nasty face if you don't like the
coffee what is Paul going to think of
from that day forward whenever he goes
to get himself a cup of coffee the face
you made so you just passed on and
anchored a negative response that he is
going to relate directly to you things
like this cost you business as a final
tip Joe Girardi was considered to be the
greatest salesman in the world by the
Guinness Book of World Records he sold
six to seven cars a day received most of
his sales because referrals what did he
do every single month he sent a card to
every single person would ever purchased
a car from and it's simply said inside
of it
I like you people find it also very hard
to dislike people who openly say that
they like them the simple little gesture
kept Joe Gerard's name constantly in his
customers mind so what did they do
whenever a friend did bring up the fact
that they were looking to buy a new car
bring up Joe droids named do you have
any questions leave them in the comment
section below and if there is a question
you'd like me to answer leave it on
there as well til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
