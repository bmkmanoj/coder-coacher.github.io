15 of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm going to continue
talking about MySQL and more
specifically what I mean by
normalization of databases which is just
how to properly structure your databases
so that your tables are standard
compliant meaning that other people that
are gonna look at and we're gonna be
able to understand them and also easily
searchable
okay so just as a review from last time
I'm gonna show you how to log in to
MySQL however you might just type my SQL
minus the five on your system and then
enter your password so we're into MySQL
know if I want to show my databases I
just do that and you could see all the
databases that I have here if I want to
use the customer database just I've use
customer database changed I want to make
sure that I have the database that I
want to use I just type in select
database followed by parentheses and it
shows me that I'm using the customer
database and if I clear all the scroll
back what I'm gonna do now is explain to
you the first rule of normalization and
that is two-tiered first each column
must contain one value and also you
cannot have tables that have repeating
columns now to explain this I'm actually
going to create a bad table and as I go
through them and I'll explain where I
messed up in regards to the first rule
of normalization or structuring of your
database okay so I'm going to create a
table called customer and if you didn't
see the previous tutorial to this most
definitely you should watch that alright
so I'm gonna create a name field and
this is gonna break the first rule of
normalization because each column must
contain one value only the way I have
this structured I'd actually have to
type out the entire name see first name
last name I have two values inside of
one box that is not allowed inside of
normalization but I'm gonna continue on
explaining how you don't do things and
then I'm going to show you how to
correctly do everything and by the way
you create comments inside of PHP like
this with the hash mark and if it's a
multi-line comment forward slash star
and then this would be multi-line and
then close that off I know this doesn't
go over multiple lines but just so you
know how to create
multi-line comments inside of MySQL and
then I'm gonna create a address field
and this is one sign that you're not
following normalization rules if you are
creating a variable number of characters
that is extremely long there it is one
sure sign that you're not following that
rule so for example this would be a full
address with city state and zip code
again you would not want to do that but
I'm gonna continue on this role actually
break the second rule within the first
rule of normalization in that I'm
creating multiple tables that have
repeating columns meaning that more than
likely there's going to be multiple
phone numbers and here I am going to
just continue to add additional columns
for each potential telephone number this
is not allowed what you need to do
instead is to create another table that
just contains telephone numbers okay so
there is how that rule is broken and I'm
also if you're creating a bad table I'm
gonna show you how to get out of it just
hit backslash c and that will cancel out
of your table inside of mysql now i'm
gonna show you how to make a more proper
table you're gonna want a cape and
create table customer again and in
upcoming tutorials i'm going to trade
perfect tables for you and through
examples you're going to really get this
stuff so just pick up just like before
everything that you can't pick up from
each tutorial and then we'll move on
from that point so see i'm splitting the
first and last name into their own
little boxes just like that so that's
proper in here i'm gonna create street
forty characters right there that's
perfectly fine here i'm gonna create
city and this actually there are three
normalization rules the first one has
the rule of each column must contain one
value and you cannot have repeating
columns this second normalization rule
only has one rule you can't allow
repeating values what i mean by that is
in my circumstance if this was a
customer database i would have lots of
people living in pittsburgh by that rule
that means I'm going to have repeating
values inside of this box that means
that I should split out City and put it
also into its own table okay and as well
I should do the same thing with state
because I'm more than likely going to
have the same state repeated over and
over and over again technically I should
have ZIP code in its own table as well
but that totally depends upon you and as
a review from the last tutorial a small
int can contain a maximum number of
65535 so in my circumstance that's going
to cover all of my potential zip code
for you it might not or you might live
in another country and you don't even
know what a zip code hits then what I'm
doing here is I'm breaking out phone
into its own table so what I'm gonna do
here this is what we call a foreign key
and it's unsigned and it's not no
meaning I'm requiring it and this guy
can contain a maximum of 255 digits so
I'm guessing nobody's gonna have more
than 255 telephone numbers so this is
what we call a foreign key meaning that
it's going to relate to another table in
MySQL and then I'm also gonna do the
same thing by creating in a foreign key
in relation to orders that get placed
through here and I'm gonna guess I'm
gonna get less than 65,000 orders from
any one person you always whenever
you're creating your table so ever want
to err on the side of caution and then
I'm gonna create the master primary key
for any of my customers as I review din
previous tutorial so this is like the
social security number for any of my
customers that I create and then I want
to notify MySQL what my primary key is
and I do that with this line of code
right here then I close off everything
now I said there are three roles of
normalization I actually broke the third
role in actually having Street city
state and zip code inside of this table
the first role is always followed
meaning that again each column must
contain one value and you can't have
repeating columns that's always followed
whenever you're creating databases the
second rule of normalization meaning you
can't have repeating values is followed
if it makes sense so I would follow that
and create an a separate city and state
table but I might not create a separate
zip code table and the third rule of
normalization states that you cannot
have anything in a table
doesn't directly relate to the primary
key being customer ID so to explain that
further Street does directly relate to
the customer meaning that the street
where they live at or their businesses
is very personal to them however city is
not so that really does tell me you know
what city should be in its own table as
well as state and as well as zip code
because state relates to city more than
state relates to the customer ID meaning
there's gonna be a lot of people or
potential customers who live in this
state as well as this city
so the third normalization rule says you
know what these should all be put into
their own tables you don't quite get it
leave a comment below I'll go into more
but in future tutorials I'm going to
really really explain this so let's
create our table all right so we created
that but remember I have my phone up
here so I have to create a table
specific to phone numbers so I'm gonna
do that there's my phone table it's
gonna be identification number for each
telephone number that they give to me
okay and that's how we create all of our
identification numbers or our primary
keys this is the phone number itself
being work home what have you fax and
here we're going to specifically say
what type of phone number it is meaning
that they can't give us a telephone
number without describing what it is and
then primary key telling - ql that yes
phone ID is the primary key for this
table and we created that and now i'm
gonna create the orders table because
remember i broke that out into its own
table this is gonna contain the name of
all the products and this technically
should be broken out into its own little
table and i'm gonna make a perfect
orders table here for you in the future
this is the quantity that they're going
to want the price for each product they
order the date they order the product
and the identification number for each
order that they put through and notify
that this is indeed the primary key for
this new table all right show tables and
you can see that we have a customer and
orders and a phone number table inside
of the customer database and if I want
to describe or show more information for
my orders table
you can see that it puts all that
information here in front of me but
technically you should not structure
your table this way for your products
technically what your order table should
look like and I would get into it in
this tutorial however I don't have
enough time to fit it all in here you
should have your order so you should
have like orders table should look like
this
and then you should have your order
identification number quantity
underneath that date of the order and
then you should have a part ID number so
this would be the orders table order ID
quantity date part ID of course I want
to cancel out of that and then you would
have a and this is a perfect way to
structure orders tables by the way you
would have part identification number
model number manufacturers ID so let's
say I sell computers this would be like
IBM product type let's say that I also
sell power plugs with the computers okay
so that would be a identification number
specific to power plugs the price for
that individual thing and then you would
have a description for each individual
product and then you see here's the part
ID this is the primary key for this new
table and it would be interlinked with
the orders table right here so here it
would be a foreign key and then you
would go on and create a manufacturer in
a product table as well in the next
tutorial I'll actually create these
tables for you you could see them
on-screen I'll explain everything and
then we'll go into actually putting
information into these new tables and
pulling information out of them if you
have any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
