3 of my CV do tutorial today I'm going
to talk about the switch statement
arrays strings functions and a whole
bunch of other different things and if
you missed any of the previous parts of
this tutorial series I provide a link to
the playlist in the upper right hand
corner so I have a lot to do so let's
get into it okay so I'm using the basic
setup I had before basic text editor
text for angular notepad plus if you are
on a Windows machine terminal or command
line if you are on Windows as well and I
have my basic standard i/o library and
another standard library that I'm going
to require because I'm going to show you
how to use the exit statement which is
going to allow you to exit completely
out of a program from anywhere inside of
your code and basically to show you the
importance or the NIF teenis of the
switch statement I am going to create a
basic menu system and since I have no
idea how many times I'm going to have to
loop I'm going to use a do-while loop
mainly because people are always asking
what is the purpose of do-while and of
course it is whenever you need to do
something absolutely one time and then
you may not have to ever do it again
okay so I have my basic print statements
inside of here and this is a basic menu
system actually not really going to do
anything but it's good nonetheless and
throw in two and it's just going to
allow the user to ask different
questions and provide output and finally
it's going to be quick and then I'm
going to throw scanf in here I'm
actually going to show you another way
to accept input in a less volatile way
than using scanf in this tutorial as
well
here is the pointer information which
I'm actually going to cover in the next
part of the tutorial and then finally
we're going to come in here at the end
and we're going to say while and I'm
going to continue showing this menu over
and over and over until they give me
input that is a 1 2 3 or a 4 so how
exactly what I do that you can pause
this for a second if you want to think
about what my condition was going to be
but what my conditional is going to be
is I'm going to say what to do this is
going to continue looping as long as
what to do is less than 1 or what to do
is greater than 4 so as long as either
of those is true this is going to loop
forever well then what exactly we're
going to do in regards to handling
whenever they enter a 1 2 3 or a 4 I'm
going to show you what it would look
like if we used an if statement and then
I'm going to show you how the switch
statement is going to improve on that so
I'm going to say what to do if a 1 was
entered and in this situation and I'm
just going to say print the time there
we go
then what I'm going to do is have to
copy this and say else and then I'm
going to go in here paste else if put
another else if inside of there and then
I'm going to say 2 then I'm going to say
3 and then finally there's only one
option it could be which is 4 otherwise
it wouldn't it passed our little
condition we had else and I'll put that
in there but I'll just get rid of this
if statement here at the end then I'll
come up here and just say print the date
print the day and then this one I'll
just say bye-bye because that was the
quit option and then just to show you
how to exit out using 0 which means that
it's a non air causing exit just type in
exit with a 0 inside of there and that's
going to exit out of your program
altogether and I get all the braces all
set up here and all that looks like it's
good so let's file save it and I'm going
to be using the standard c99 version for
my compiler like that and then let's
test this what day is it let's type in a
0 you can see it asks me for it again
and then I can type in a 3 and you can
see it prints the day on the screen so
that's basically what it does and the if
statement does indeed work but if we
look at the switch statement you're
going to see that it's a better solution
for this problem we have now basically
what the switch statements going to do
is it is going to check the value for
the actual variable that is provided
which is going to be what to do and it's
going to have curly braces just like
most other things the only thing is here
is this must be either a character or an
int that we are checking here and then
what we do is we say case they entered a
1 what are we going to do now we're
going to say print F print the time like
that and then what we're going to do I'm
going to pop in here is say break now
unless you want to check the next case
which is going to be this guy and that's
going to handle
- this is going to handle a three and
this is going to be what we call default
the way switch is set up remember I said
the if statement if one condition is
true it doesn't bother to check the
other ones for whether they're true or
not
well the switch statement keeps on
asking unless you put break that throws
you out of the switch statement so here
we'll say print the time print the date
print the day I think that's right yes
and then here default bye bye and then
we're going to also put exit inside of
here
and if I did all that right it's going
to work in exactly the same way looks
like it did you can see what time is it
what's today's date
dah dah dah dah dah zero it's going to
ask me again and then I'm going to type
in four and it is going to say bye-bye
dah dah dah dah dah so there is the
switch statement as you can see it's
much neater for this situation so if you
need an int or a character and you're
only going to be checking one value look
how neat it is very very nice now onto
our next program next we're going to
talk about or arrays now we've already
talked about arrays in regards to a
string inside of C is actually a
character array but I just want to point
out a couple simple things like for
example the very first piece of data
that we put into an array is going to be
an index 0 this is just a number that is
going to tell us in which box inside of
the array we are in second one's going
to be 1 and then it's going to be 2 &amp;amp; 3
&amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5 before as big as your array is
you can initialize your array like I did
here with the 2 3 &amp;amp; 5 quite simply with
prime numbers 3 inside of it and then
define exactly what's going to go in
each box
so array is just a big bunch of boxes I
can also come in here since I am
defining what data is going in there I
actually don't have to determine or
provide a size I can just leave that
area in the brackets blank so let's look
at that in code so here we are got a
main again just like before and I'm
going to create right now a printf
statement there and I'm also going to
create myself a character array and I'm
going to put in whole name and I can
type in 12 and remember we're
have to leave space for nul after our
string so if you add these up that's
going to be five that's going to be five
that's going to be 1 and then the null
at the very very very end that equals 12
now it doesn't always and it actually
almost never make sense for these to be
exactly the right size as we're going to
get into in a second here in the null by
the way is this guy right here that -
and then the 0 but for now that's how
I'm going to define it like I said
before you can also come in here and
define exactly what data is going to be
inside of there and you can also define
a size if you want and you put the
little curly brackets and you say
something like 2 3 &amp;amp; 5 like that another
way to create and put different values
inside of an array and like I also said
more Prime's if you're defining the data
that goes inside of it you do not need
to actually put a size you can just go
in there and put things in and it'll
automatically size the array for you
also like covered if we want to actually
come in here and check what the first
prime in the list is and come in here
and just put a D because that is going
to be a decimal and then what we can do
is go prime number and of course make
this prime numbers sorry about that and
bounce over here compile that and
execute it you can see the first prime
in the list is 2 so there you go zero
index like many other languages if
you're aware of other programming
languages we could also come in here
even though this is a little bit silly
and define a character array in exactly
the same way you're gonna see why this
is silly
so let's say I wanted to say Chicago
this is how I would have to come in here
and do it and just keep on going on just
imagine that I typed in all the letters
required for Chicago because that's
silly and the reason why is because I
can also go in here and type in
character third city and say something
like Paris
da da da so there's no real point in
doing this another positive of doing it
this way is whenever you create your
character array this way it's going to
put in your null character in here in
the last position
and if you would type in Chicago like
this you'd actually have to put that in
yourself so you know equally silly so
don't do this but I wanted to show you
that you can do it you know because why
not now whenever we are creating arrays
like I said before everything is just a
whole bunch of boxes and one of the
reasons why we're going to do away with
scanf is because scanf and we're also
going to do away with string coffee
which I talked about previously which is
very very bad once an array is going to
be defined we're going to actually be
able to go in and change the values with
things like string coffee for example
the only problem with that is is if you
have two three and five and you enter in
two three five and seven it's actually
going to potentially destroy or
overwrite other important stuff in
memory that is a definite definite
definite possibility so I'm going to
show you a different way to actually
work with arrays and eliminate that
issue and it's also very very important
to make sure your arrays are big enough
to hold all the potential input that
would go into it but of course you're
going to not want to make it too large
because you don't want to consume a lot
of memory so it's sort of like one of
those things where you're going to have
to make a judgment call on your own so
we come back into our coding world here
so let's say I want to allow them to
enter some sort of input and it's going
to be a city name and I've decided at
this point that 30 is big enough even
though we're going to find out later
that it isn't and I'm going to say what
city do you live in now the reason why
we're going to want to get rid of scanf
is because scanf like I said before is
going to allow you to override data past
the end of our space that we have
allocated inside of our array scanf is
not smart enough to know not to do that
also as we've seen previously in the
tutorial it's also not going to allow
you to enter spaces unless you define
exactly where those spaces are going to
lie and then pull the information apart
and throw it in to do different
variables also on top of that scanf is
very very big and bloated so what we're
going to use instead is something called
f gets what makes f gets
much better is it has neither of the
problems that you will find using scanf
and on top of that it's also going to
add in your little null character at the
end of any of your strings that you put
inside of it and really the only
negative with F gets is that you must
provide a size limit for the data that's
going to be entered into your string so
we're going to come in here and go your
city then we're going to define the size
for it and then standard in which is
going to be your keyboard and then we
got that data and we're going to say
printf and I'm going to show you a whole
bunch of other different ways to input
and output data later on and then we're
gonna say your sunni compile execute
let's say you live in Pittsburgh and
boom hello Pittsburgh prints out on our
screen so there you go that's super
duper now really another thing that I
forgot to mention about F gets that's
not exactly the best thing is as I was
typing that information in when I typed
in Pittsburgh what did I have to do at
the very end I had to put in a new line
because I hit Enter well with F gets
it's going to make a lot of sense to get
rid of that so let's just go in there
and get rid of it and I'm going to be
initializing this inside of the for loop
that's why I'm using the 99 version of C
and as this tutorial continues I'm going
to be using that all the time and then
only get into some of the things that
are in the 2000 version of C so what I
can do is I can say if your city
basically what I'm doing is going
through all of the different parts of
the array all the indexes starting at
zero for our array and I'm going to say
if this index contains a newline well in
that situation I want to go your city
and you're also seeing here how to
change the value that's in an index and
I'm going to put my null character in
there instead and then to keep it from
continuing the loop after it finds that
I'm also going to throw a break
statement in there now I'm going to take
this exact thing up here and then after
the for loop print it in there and we're
going to see the difference we're
basically going to see that the newline
goes away compile it
execute it da-da-da-da-da Pittsburgh
loop Pittsburgh say there's not as many
new lines here as there is there so
that's basically all we did but it's
very useful nonetheless and
is going to continue in here writing
some code and go over a couple other
different string functions that are
available to you now one of them is
string compare what it's going to allow
you to do is it's going to take two
strings and it's going to return a
negative number if the first string is
less than the second it's going to
return a positive number if the opposite
occurs and it's going to turn a zero if
they are equal to use it we're going to
say print it and I'm going to say
something like is your city Paris and
then here I'm just going to print a
result and then we can use string
compare and put your city and then we
can put third city which is where Paris
is stored and to use this guy I'm
actually going to have to come up here
and throw another include in paste that
in there and then type in string then we
can come in here and compile it and
execute it city do you live in
Pittsburgh little Pittsburgh blah blah
blah your city is your city Paris and it
spits out eight and the reason why it
spits out eight is because my first
string being Pittsburgh is indeed
greater than the second string being
Paris or to put it otherwise Paris would
come first if everything was in
alphabetic order so that's string
compare of course you should go and play
around with these different things till
you get used to them another thing you
can do is you can add a second string to
a first string which is called
concatenation but if you just prefer
append that's perfectly fine but it is
called concatenation and to do that
you're going to use another string
function called STR CIT or string
concatenate and let's say that I want to
put Pennsylvania on the end of my city
name I can say string cat and then just
type in your city which is going to be
the first part of this new string and
whatever you want to add to it and then
I could say you live in and it's going
to return a string your city just
remember that this isn't a temporary
thing this is permanent now your city is
going to have the full name and there we
go
Pittsburgh bubble bubble law you live in
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania say there it is
so there's another function for you no
other thing that is very useful for
Strings a string length
and it's going to do exactly what you
think it's going to return the length of
a string minus the null character at the
very end so just the letters so letters
in Paris D and then a bunch of new lines
and to get the length of the string
we're just going to type in STR le n and
let's just say third city this time
which is going to be Paris and of course
put this brace inside of there save
execute letters in Paris five comes up
and then the final thing I'm going to
show you is in reference to not using
string coffee remember we're not going
to use string coffee because it can
overwrite other parts of memory so if
you want to use something that does
pretty much exactly what string coffee
does but in a safe way and you want to
use string ll coffee so if we want to
print out your city and let's say it is
a city that has a very very long name
and yes this is a real city name well
what we're going to have to do with this
new guy that is much better than string
coffee is provide the size for it that's
it that's the only other thing and then
we don't have to worry about overwriting
different parts of memory and then if
somebody tries to print it out let's say
something like new city is string your
city like that of course make this an
uppercase C that's over here and execute
it new city is El Pueblo da da da da and
you can see that it cut off the Angeles
part at the very very end of it and if
you count all this up it is going to be
equal to 29 different characters so you
can see it's just basically if it enters
more information than you can fit in it
just cuts off any additional information
that has entered into it so that's all
very very very useful information so now
let's go and write ourselves another
program and talk about global variables
local variables functions and all a
bunch of other things now a global
variable is going to be a variable that
is going to be seen or every function
will have the capability to see this
value and change it and I'm just going
to type in global var it you can type in
anything you could type in C that's just
the name that doesn't have anything to
do with anything other than that and
give it a value of zero now any function
that you create and yes there can be
more functions than just main of course
is going to be able to access this
information we just have to put it in a
position
where it is not inside of any other
functions inside of your program and
that brings us to functions now what
this function is going to do is it's
going to receive two different numbers
it's going to add them up and it's going
to return the result and each function
that you're going to create is going to
have a return type and if it doesn't
we're going to have to put void at the
very beginning like I've been doing with
main here all along but this function
might create a second is going to
actually return some information and so
there is going to be the type the data
type value that is going to be returned
and I'm going to say I add two ins then
inside of here these are going to be
attributes and you're going to have to
define the data type for the attributes
that are going to be passed inside of
this function and then this function is
going to do something really simple it's
just going to return number one plus
number two that's it and of course we're
going to need functions inside of C if
you ever want to make any type of
program that is big in any way it's
almost impossible to make a complex
program in which everything is going to
be inside of main and in regards to what
is a function you're basically going to
want to turn any task any calculation
pretty much anything into a function
into item C and then have main call to
function and you want to make the main
part of your program be is a little
readable as humanly possible and to use
this function we're just going to go in
total its equal to add to hence and then
we can pass in any integer inside of
that guy and then of course we can say
the sum is and of course it's going to
be an integer itself and total and
execute you can see the sum is not of
course so that's basically how functions
work now we're going to get into the
difference between global and local
variables now this comes up even to this
day just today I had somebody asked me a
question about local variables versus
global variables like I told you before
if it is a local variable inside of see
without pointers you basically are stuck
you're not going to be able to do
anything with that data as you're going
to see later on with pointers you're
going to be able to go into memory and
access from any different function but
inside of C basically every
rhe function you create it's going to
have access to this guy right here but
the local variables the variables
created inside of a function are only
going to be there so inside of here what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
local variable which everything created
in the function is going to be local and
it's going to be age is equal to ten
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go and get the global variable that
anybody can change and change the value
for it to 50 then you're going to say
age before a call to the function and
I'm going to call another function is
equal to D and then print whatever age
is and then I'm going to do exactly the
same thing with the global variable and
here I'm just going to type in global
there like that and global very again
then I'm going to call an outside
function which I haven't created yet and
it's just going to be called change
variables and you don't have to pass an
attribute by the way if you were
wondering and then we're going to come
up here and make sure we do this up here
ahead of main want to make sure all your
functions are created before you call
main because the way C works everything
out it assumes that every function is
going to return an int so if it comes
down here inside of main and it gets to
this point down here where he has change
variables and then I go up here and I
actually define this guy as void like
that
it's going to throw an error because you
can say hey wait a minute remember all
the execution starts in main so it's
going to say hey wait a minute change
variables an int because I always make
everything an int if it hasn't been
defined before I see it
so if change variables was down here
that's going to throw an error okay
so just want to point that out that's
another funky weird thing with C so
inside of this guy remember we have age
down here there's age well up here I'm
going to say alright well I want to
change age as well but I have to define
it inside here what this is doing is
creating a new local variable that is
local to the change variables method it
has absolutely zero effect anywhere else
however if I print this in here and I
say age inside of function of function
and then put age inside of there it's
going
not 40 as you can see here in a minute
that what I'm going to do is go global
there and set the value for it to 100
change variables can do that and can
affect the global variable as you're
going to see in a second so then we're
going to come down here like that and
when instead we're going to say global
very inside a function and global very
inside a function then come back down
inside of here again we're basically and
do the same thing except we're going to
say age after a call and global variable
after and if I did everything right up
over here and executes and you guys see
age before a call to the function is
going to be equal to 10 okay make sense
because that's what this is right here
global variable for a call to the
function is going to be equal to 50 make
sense because that's what I set it their
age inside a function is going to be 40
okay because I set it to 40 here but
remember that's a local variable that's
not the same age global variable inside
of the function is going to be a hundred
why because I defined it as a hundred
age after a call of the function however
is going to be ten because nothing
changed I was not using this variable I
was using the variable that was local to
the change variables method and that is
a whole bunch of stuff about functions
global variables and everything else I
covered in this tutorial up next I'll be
talking about pointers please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
