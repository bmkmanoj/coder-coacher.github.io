of my XML video tutorial today I'm going
to show you how to create a document
type definition or a DTD file and I'm in
Eclipse alright so we're going to go
into project explorer go to source
folder just like we have before and
we're going to go new scroll down to
other click on that and just like have
happened before this little wizard pops
up here we want to click on DTD file
click on next and then we are going to
name this file TV show 1 . DTD which it
is right there we're going to click on
next
everything here is perfectly right so
we're going to go down and click on
finish alright this is going to open up
our DTD file for us to start creating
some stuff here I just want to let you
know I'm going to do this a little bit
later on but in your XML file you want
to link to this file that's right here
on the screen you would just enter this
right here doctype TV show which is the
name of the root element for our XML
file and then TV show 1 DTD so that's
how you would link to this in your XML
file but more on that later as you can
see here I have the basic layout of a
Maximoff alma to change a couple things
as I go through here and I'm going to
show you how to basically create the
model for what you have here on the
right side of your screen now if you
would want to input this directly inside
of an XML file you could do that and you
would just go like this and type in
doctype TV show which is the route for
it and then everything that proceeds
this line here what I'm going to be
typing is going to go right here inside
of this box and that's one way you could
put this directly in an XML file but I'm
not going to be doing that right now I
as I like linking out to a DTD file
instead now I don't think I'd even
mention it but a DTD file defines the
make up of an XML file so it's going to
define or model out exactly what you
want your XML file to look like which is
what's on the right side of our screen
and you specifically use the DTD to make
sure that your data is valid and also so
that multiple people can go and work
together in a nice standard way the
first thing we're going to do here is
we're going to go element and this is
pretty much what you're doing you're
going to define all the elements that
are going to be in your XML file on this
guy so I'm going to type in my root
element which is going to be tv-show as
you see on the right side of the screen
and then I'm going to define that I want
to guarantee that I have at least one
show and I do that with the plus sign
however I want to allow for any number
of different shows to be used in this
XML file and there you go so that's
exactly what I'm just doing right there
and then I'm just going to continue to
come in here and define exactly what I
see on the right side of the screen by
typing in element everything is an
element like we've been saying then I'm
going to find the rules for show now I'm
going to say that it must have a name
and elements that don't have a
quantifier when I say quantifier that's
what the plus sign is right here
elements that do not have a quantifier
must appear only one time then I'm going
to come in here and just create a couple
more so we have release date every TV
show is going to have a release date
network well it is totally possible for
there to be want more than one network
so I'm going to put a plus sign inside
of there once again and then I'm going
to put in a description and again if I
don't put a quantifier that means it's
going to occur one time then I'm going
to say actors and then I'm going to say
poster so let's say I don't have the
rights to show a different poster or
show a specific poster on the screen
because it's copy written which is 100%
possible if I do not want to guarantee
or make the user enter a poster or H
reference or a link to a very specific
image on the internet I'm just going to
put in a question mark and also let's
say I don't have access to information
regards to viewers of this television
show I'm also going to put a question
mark inside for that and that just
simply makes it optional and then also
let's say that I want either one or
another of these to be entered which
would be the end date now I'm going off
a little bit from what's on the XML file
here on the right side of screen but
that's perfectly okay so let's say that
we want to have an end date if there was
an end date or if there wasn't I just
put that over sign in there we want them
to put in the date for the next episode
and that is exactly how you would do
that so just to reiterate if there is an
end date we want them to enter it
however if there is no end date and
there's going to be a new episode
meaning the show hasn't been cancelled
we're going to put next episode inside
of there so they're going to be able to
either enter in information for this or
for this right here and then we're just
going to continue putting new ones in
here next thing up I'm going to define
exactly what is inside of the element
name and you just keep typing element in
here over and over again and I'm going
to say that I want it to contain PC data
now
PC data is what is called parsed
character data and it's used to denote
the element contains text and if you
mark something down as PC data that
means that it can only contain text that
means it can't contain child elements
these are child elements what you have
up here however you could go in here and
put or and have like different child
elements inside of here and then put a
star afterwards and that would allow you
to basically have anything you'd want so
let's just say name and nick name by
putting this star here that's going to
allow people to have either PC data or
have a child element named nickname but
you really don't want to do that so I'm
not going to really elaborate on that
and buy PC data what we're referring to
is if you enter an entity which I've
talked about in previous tutorials if
you haven't seen them you've probably
left already but either way you should
definitely check that out like for
example whenever we had less than
previously versus this parse data means
that if you use this inside of the name
field it's going to turn into the lesser
than sign and as you're going to see
here a little bit or something called C
data that is non parsed text and you
could use C data inside here if that's
what you'd like and just what would
happen in that situation is if you typed
in this less land sign like that it's
going to show up exactly as you have on
the screen it's not going to parse into
less than sign you see there and it's
also very important of course since this
is parse that you do not want to use
these different symbols that I've shown
you in the past otherwise they could
cause errors just stay away from those
guys and just in case you'd like to know
let's say that we wanted to make this a
hundred percent diverse meaning that the
user could basically do anything they'd
want with it which like I said
previously you don't want to do you
would just enter this in here like this
this would not hold them to enter the
information in any very specific ways
that we really wouldn't hold them to any
rules at all and I'm just putting or
signs inside of here and I think you get
the point let's just cut this off to the
end like that or this like this and then
you could throw a star in there like
that and that's going to allow you to go
in there and basically put any type of
element that you'd like in any order at
all and of course I think you see why
that would be a major downside and
something you should avoid and another
thing that's kind of a no-no but
definitely something that you can do is
you can come in here and define an
element and instead of put in PC data
and or blah
 and stars and things like that all
over the place you can just simply come
in here and type in name and then follow
that up with any and that's going to
allow it also to enter any type of data
or child elements inside of that element
again I'm telling you some things that
you shouldn't really necessarily do but
it's also very important to understand
how they work now that I've created this
guy let's also say that you'd like to
have a unique ID for each name of a
television show I'm going to show you
how to create an attribute and if you
don't remember previously an attribute
is like with Network here where we have
country or with post or where we have
href or width or height or whatever if
you're going to define one of those guys
you just want to come in here and type
attribute list and then you have to
define which element it's going to be
tied to being named then let's say that
I want to put a unique ID code in here
for each show name this is a data type
called ID and that's exactly what it
does an ID is unique and it can't be
used anywhere else inside of the
document except for one situation which
I'm gonna explain to you here in a
second and then if we want to make sure
that this is a required field meaning
the user has to put something inside of
there we just put required in there
right at the end so there you go that's
how you create an element that's going
to contain data it's also how you create
an attribute for set item I can just
copy this now and use it here a couple
different times because gonna be doing
pretty much the same sort of stuff all
right so we're going to type in release
and I'm gonna leave that be PC data
which is perfectly fine paste in another
one in this situation we're going to
have Network go inside of there then we
also have an attribute that we're going
to want to assign for that as you can
see on the right side of the screen and
it's going to be for network instead of
name and it's going to be called country
right like we have there and in this
situation the data type that I want to
use is going to be C data which is going
to be non parsed and pretty much just
using it just because I want to then I'm
going to also leave that as required
then we're going to come in here and
we're also going to need to create the
same thing for description then we're
going to get to the part where we're
going to define actors which is going to
have child elements inside of it so
we're going to go actors and because we
want an unlimited number of actors or
zero we're going to put a star inside of
there because that's exactly what that
does for us and then we just need to
define those child elements which is
going to be actor right like this
and then inside of this for actor I'm
going to type in real underscore name
coma and character also just like you
see on the right side of the screen then
I'm going to have to come in here and
define for these two elements that we
just created right here which is real
name and character and I'm just going to
sell this real name like that leave that
be PC data and character like that also
going to be PC data then we're going to
put it in here attributes for this just
drop that in there and we're going to
say that the character element has an
attribute called profession and we're
going to leave it set for C data however
we're going to say implied what implied
simply means is that it might not
contain a value so let's say you don't
know the profession of a specific
character in a show then you just
wouldn't put anything in there and we
want to give the user the option to do
that and now I'm going to cover the
poster and it's just going to be Bo ste
or however the way I have this set up
and I did this on purpose it would
actually be better for them to put the
data in H reference which is going to be
the link to the image inside of the
poster element but I just want an excuse
to be able to use empty inside here
which basically means that this element
will never contain any value between its
opening tag and its ending tag and I'm
going to get into well form this later
on in this tutorial series and a good
example of what would be a great empty
field would mean the break statement so
this is a statement or a tag that never
will have a value however it does
definitely have capabilities and that
would be how you would define the break
statement inside of a document type
definition but either way we're just
going to leave that the way that it is
so I can continue explaining this then
we have to put in or different
attributes that we have for this guy so
this is going to be for poster and then
this is going to be H reference I'm
going to leave this as C data and I'm
gonna leave this is implied remember
again we don't want to guarantee or
force the person to enter a value in
this situation hence we're also going to
do the same thing for width and for
height now it gets to the part wherever
I was talking about the unique ID let's
say inside a poster we would like to
link to the show ID that we defined way
up here right on line 6 and all this
code is available underneath the video
let's say that I would want to reference
that from inside of poster
just for the heck of it how would I do
it well I'm going to come in here and
I'm going to create a new attribute and
it's still going to be inside a poster
however I'm going to call this guy show
ID and then I'm going to change this
data type if we would want to store an
ID inside of there a unique ID that is
exactly what we would do and in this
situation I'm going to leave that as
implied because once again we don't know
if there is going to be a poster and you
could actually hold multiple different
ID numbers in here just by using a
different data type and in that
situation if you'd want to do that I'm
not going to do that but let's say that
you did this is just going to change
from ID ref to ID refs and this is going
to give it the capability to hold
multiple different data types and just
like to see what it would look like XML
wise someone would go in and type in
poster show IDs which is what this is
should be called and that they wanted to
assign values to those show IDs they
would just type in show and I don't know
100 maybe and then show underscore 101
and then close off that tag and that's
exactly how they would do that again
it's set up like this because poster is
empty doesn't have a closing bracket on
it so I'm just going to continue adding
elements to this so we got element and
another element that we have here is
viewers and this is going to be PC data
just like that and then we have
attributes let's just get rid of that
for now paste that and sign there and
then we're going to assign this
attribute to viewers and we're going to
call it units and then we're going to
put in C data and then if you would want
to define a default value for this you
would just inside of quotes go million
which more than likely a television show
is going to have at least a million
viewers and if you would want this
always to be a fixed amount which means
that nobody's going to ever be able to
change it you would just type in fixed
inside of there like that and if you'd
like to give the person an enumerated
list for example which means that they'd
only be able to pick from either say
thousand or million that's exactly how
you would do that and you could throw
something like implied in there and then
to end off this guy it's real simple
we're just going to go in here and type
in element end date and then in this
situation we're going to put PC data and
I'm going to do the same thing again for
next episode and now that we have this
saved we can use this to create an X
Oh file so let's go over here to Java
code source again and we're going to go
file new in this situation go down
author now whenever the wizard pops up
we're going to click on XML file go next
call this TV show one XML click Next and
in this situation want to say create XML
file from a DTD file click Next and then
we just have to go and find our DP file
that we created so I'm going to go into
source and you can see it's the second
one on the list next and then click
finish and there you can see it went and
automatically setup our XML file for us
which is very convenient leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
