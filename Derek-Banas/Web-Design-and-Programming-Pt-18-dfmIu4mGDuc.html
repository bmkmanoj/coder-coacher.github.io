my web design and programming tutorial
here I'm gonna continue going over all
the different things you can do with
MySQL and going through all the a lot of
different statements I haven't covered
previously on SQL period what I'm going
to show you here first is well login of
course okay so I'm logged into MySQL and
if you didn't see the previous tutorials
absolutely you must watch them otherwise
you'll be confused okay so I'm gonna
choose the Hamm database that I've been
playing around with here before yeah I'm
gonna show you here how to create what
is called a join and the most common
joint is what is called an inner join
and with it you literally join the
information you want into a new
temporary table and then you reference
information in multiple different tables
with what is called the dot operator and
just like this you type in table name
and call and you're gonna see an example
of that here in one second but first
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pull up
all the different product types that
exist inside of this database and they
are all held in the product ID table and
you can see a list of them all here so
here are all the product types and
here's the product ID numbers and let's
say I wanted to figure out all the
manufacturers that sell inkjet printers
in this database well I'm gonna
specifically look for a part
identification number then called 32 and
say I want to describe or show you here
what is contained within a product a
été table so you can see right here
this is the part ID right here and I'm
going to specifically be looking for 32
now let's say you just did something
stupid like that where you deleted all
the information it's on your screen
here's a shortcut to bring back the last
command just press up on your arrow key
that points up and you can see that that
comes right back and then you can also
by the way sort through a whole bunch of
all your previous commands that you put
in - ql so there's just a little short
shortcut okay so we have our product ID
numbers here and we know how they're
associated so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna bring up all the different tables
that we're going to be using here to
search for manufacturers that sell make
junk printers so we're gonna be using
the manufacturer ID table and all
we're going to be using the model
numbers table we're going to really be
joining the manufacturer ID table and
the information contained in there with
some of the information contained in the
model numbers table what we're
specifically gonna do is we're gonna go
to the model numbers table here and
we're going to look for part
identification numbers equal to 32 if we
find one of them were then going to
match up or look up what it's
manufacture ID number is then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna link these two
tables based off the manufacturers of
high D numbers and anywhere the
manufacturer ID number down here has a
part ID number of 32 we're gonna print
out the manufacturer ID and manufacture
name to the screen hopefully that wasn't
confusing I'm gonna show you exactly how
to do it right now if it was okay so
what we're doing here is we're going to
use the Select command followed by
distinct what this is going to do is by
putting distinct in there it's gonna
guarantee that you only have values
printed out once okay because obviously
we're gonna have many manufacturers
match up for that part ID number so by
putting distinct in there we're gonna
guarantee that the manufacturers name
and manufacturers ID number is only
gonna be printed to string once remember
I you've said about the dot operator
well here we're going to be referencing
the manufacturer ID table and if a
manufacturer's name so this is the table
name and this is the column name and
we're also going to look up the
manufacturer ID then we're going to
define the tables that we want to join
or pull this information from being the
manufacturer ID table and the model
numbers table and if you left it right
here and put a comma this is what we
would call a full joint it would join
both of those tables together but we
only need part of the information so
we're gonna create an inner join the
only difference is an inner join as
clauses that will define what
information is needed so use the where
command and we're going to insist the
manufacturer identification number is
going to be equal to manufacturer ID in
the table called model numbers paint
that's what that Clause does then we're
going to put the and command in here and
we're also going to say that we want the
part identification number
in the table model numbers to be equal
to 32 and if all that holds we want to
print all that information to screen in
alphabetical order based off of the
manufacturer name and if we hit enter
here you could say that it did just that
it went in and it located all the part
identification numbers equal to 32 and
then found all the manufacturer ID
numbers that also had a part ID number
of 32 and then matched up the
manufacturer ID numbers in the
manufacturer ID table and printed out
the manufacturer name and the
manufacturer ID number for all of those
things that qualified to see in this
database these are all the guys that
sell inkjet printers in this database
and if you didn't quite get that I'm
gonna be doing a bunch of tutorials
which is gonna demonstrate this
technique over and over and over again
because this is something that's done a
lot and web design this sort of joining
of tables and pulling information based
off of very specific values so you'll
get it over the next couple tutorials so
let's do some things that are a little
bit less complicated so what I'm gonna
do here is use the customer database
which is a lot less confusing and you
can see here the tables that are
currently in it play around in the
customer table so let's take a look at
all the information that's inside of
there and I previously talked about
foreign keys and primary keys and so
forth and so on
and in MySQL you technically can't
really create foreign keys however you
can kind of fudge that and if you define
what are called indexes which are you
what you're gonna assign an index is
gonna be something would be a foreign
key so like phone ID is gonna be one of
your foreign keys and state ID as a
foreign key and or your ID as a foreign
key well if you want to speed up your
database dramatically what you need to
do is actually tell my SQL that hey
these are indexes so just think of it as
a different sort of name and how you
define these guys as being indexes one
main zoom in here a little bit so you
can see everything here a little bit
better is you use the command I'm gonna
make this
upper case altar table and I say
customer and I'm gonna put in here add
an index on the column called state ID
just like that now all of a sudden this
guy is going to be an index and it's
going to be a lot easier to analyze the
information at search through this table
and you can see right here whenever we
call this an index when it really
created an index this is defining to
MySQL that this guy can have the same
value
multiple times and the reason why we
called it an index instead of what is
called a unique index is because of
course we're gonna have a lot of people
who live in the same state in this
database let's get rid of that and also
just so you get it I'm gonna create
another index for the telephone numbers
if you want it to actually see how to
remove an index let's come in here and
say drop index like let's say you decide
that you do not want an index associated
anymore
you just type in drop index and the name
of the column you associated an index
with followed by on and the name of your
table and you could say that we came in
here and this is no longer in index but
this guy right here is and I previously
talked about what are called unique
indexes those would be indexes in which
all the values contained within them are
going to be completely unique how you
would create that is by putting alter
table customer in this situation and
unique state ID for example and you can
see right there this is gonna
dramatically speed up all of your
searches in your database however you
have to make sure that you fit into the
qualifications and what's really crazy
is there's one other type of index and
guess what it is called it is called
primary ok okay so that's for all the
people out there that want to create
foreign keys and speed up their database
access that's exactly how you would do
it and if you wanted to create an index
for a column that doesn't exist
currently in your table you would use
the create command create index and then
you would type in the index name on
whatever your table name would be and
you could actually type in multiple
columns inside of here if you wanted to
and it would automatically create
indexes for all those different columns
so there's another little command that
you can do and let's say in our customer
table we actually want to create what is
called a comments column which is going
to contain text in which we describe how
much we like our customers so this is
come in here and click on an add column
and whatever you want that column to be
called and say that's gonna have a
variable number of characters of 40 you
can see now we have the coments column
inside of here and we're allowing Nall
to be a value inside of it but let's say
we realize after we create this column
that we actually need more than 40
characters to describe our customers
well again here comes the altered
command for you it's cooked in alter
table name your table change column and
remember everything that's in uppercase
as a command everything that's in
lowercase a references to either columns
or tables or what have you and we're
going to say we want it to be of type
text because we want to be able to type
in as much information as we want and
now you can see it's been switched to
type text and what's great about this is
we're going to be able to actually come
in here and create what is called a full
text index so what that's gonna allow us
to do is very quickly and easily and
very precisely search throughout the
comments call them and look for very
specific information and I've trying to
describe one more commands we're gonna
do just that so let's say you wanted to
change the name of your table this isn't
often done but just to show you all the
different things alder can do and when I
actually go over here what you do is
type in alter table customer
they've been renamed as and whenever you
want your new table name today if you
issue that command the table previously
called customer will now be renamed to
new table name and now I'll show you how
to create a full text index on our
comments column so that you'll be able
to perform really precise searches on it
just do this type in comments right like
that alter table customer add full text
index to the column name comments and
you can see now it has the ability
to contain the multiple values and
what's really neat about this is now I
can perform very precise searches so
let's say I come in here currently I
have one person inside of your inside of
the database one customer and the
informations a bit squished so this is
me and this is a fake address and this
is all kinds of information so I have
one customer inside here and I have
nothing contained in comment because I
created this information or I inserted
this information before I even created
this column called comments what I'm
going to do now is I'm actually going to
jump in here and enter a couple other
customers real fast just so we have a
couple more in here so here I'm using
the insert command into customer tables
and I'm entering a new customer called
Sally Smith and I'm using the shop
function right here we're just gonna do
is convert her password monkey 2 into an
encrypted code passwords it's gonna look
like this and here you can see that
since I do have the comments field
created I'm gonna actually type in right
here really nice lady who loves cats ok
so there's a new customer that I just
inserted in there and I'm gonna put
another guy in here in Paul Smith which
is gonna be Sally's husband and I'm
gonna put somebody else in here named
Mark Marx obviously these are all fake
people ok so now if we look at our
customer table you can see that we now
have four different people inside here
but you can also say that I don't have a
comment next to my name this field is
empty comments is messy but I'm keeping
this big so you can read it and it's not
gonna matter be here in a second if you
need any of this code it's all available
on the website so let's say I wanted to
come in here and actually type in a
comment for myself how exactly would I
do that easily ok an update name of the
table set and the column that I want to
update or change and type in something
like crazy man who I'm gonna put in a
clause here customer ID is equal to 5
and I'm getting that right here that's
where that 5 is coming from and let's
just say I type in comments that's all I
want to see here
customer ID is e45 and you can see that
I popped up all that new information
just insert it into this guy now what's
really neat is I can perform full-text
searches on these comments and look for
very specific information so let's say I
wanted to pull out the first name and
last name and comments from the customer
table where there is a match in the
column called comments against crazy
then you have to type in in boolean Emma
D and you're gonna see that my name
actually matches for the word crazy in
the comment section right like that but
there are other crazy customers
potentially how can I perform other
searches well just like in regular
expressions and so forth there are other
really cool ways to search so I'm gonna
just blatantly copy this guy right here
against and instead I'm gonna put a
catch-all and basically it's gonna
return results if anywhere in the
comment section there is the letter C or
AZ chances are that's gonna be crazy or
a reference to crazy and you put a
wild-card character or a star inside of
there and then again boolean mode boom
now you can see it returns both mark and
mine because craziest and crazy match
here being letter C or AZ followed by
whatever else could possibly go there
and another thing you could do is again
I'm just gonna paste the screen again
exactly that same line except this time
one when I do is say that I'm looking
for any matches for Krays followed by
any other letters and I'm putting the
plus sign saying that this absolutely
must be in the comment section but then
I'm gonna put in a negative sign then
with that negative sign I'm gonna say as
long as the word cat does not exist
anywhere in the comments so that's what
the negative sign is right there does
and then this is the wild card that you
saw already and boom and you can see now
that mark matches because it matched for
the word craziest inside of here
but it didn't return me this time
because mark likes dogs and there's no
mention of cats in his comment section
and there is a reference to cats in my
comment section
so there's a whole bunch of really kind
of crazy things you can do with MySQL
I'm going to provide a link to a bunch
of articles that go more into joins and
so forth and so on but because I wanted
to make this tutorial more interactive
with a ton of examples I'm going to
continue doing that and get more into
PHP and MySQL in the next tutorial
family and there are questions or
comments leave them below otherwise till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
