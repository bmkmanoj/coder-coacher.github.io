to program tutorial in this tutorial
series is going to be multi-part series
I'm going to teach you how to program
through problem-solving I'm basically
going to show you how to do a couple
different things using Python that's a
language I'm going to use and then I'm
going to ask you a question ask you to
solve it and then I'm going to show you
how I solved it a lot of people get
confused about programming but
programming basically involves listing
all the things that must happen to solve
a problem and whenever you're writing a
program you have to first determine step
by step what needs to happen and then
you need to convert those steps in to
the language being Python in this
situation based off of many requests
I've received I'm going to use PyCharm
in this tutorial series and at the end
of this tutorial series at the end of
this video I show you how to install
PyCharm and in the description
underneath the video you can just click
on that and jump directly to that part
and watch how to install it if you'd
like to use Python or you could use
whatever different platform you'd like
to use the program Python we're
specifically going to use Python 3 in
this situation and also in the
description there is both a cheat sheet
as well as a transcript of the entire
tutorial and enough talking let's get
into it now this whole tutorial series
is going to be basically code writing it
isn't going to be a whole bunch of
frames that you just look at and read so
this is basically going to be the only
one we're going to look at and basically
what we're going to talk about here is
what every program language is going to
allow you to do each language is going
to have the ability to accept input and
store it in many ways also the ability
to output information to the screen or
files or other different places also the
ability to conditionally do one thing or
another thing based off of different
conditions they also allow you to do
something multiple different times they
also allow you to make mathematical
calculations and they provide the
ability to change data and if it's an
object-oriented programming language
like Python it's going to allow you to
model real world objects using code and
that is a short list but for the most
part that covers what every program
language is going to allow you to do so
it's not that complicated and now we're
going to jump over and we're going to
start writing some code okay so to start
a new project inside of pycharm you're
just going to come down here and this is
on Macintosh I'll show you Windows and
second click on create new project and
then we can go and save this wherever
location untitled we're going to click
on this and I'm going to find a location
this is perfectly fine click on OK then
you want to make sure that you pick the
version three point five point one the
new version of Python you installed
click on that click on create it's going
to say so I'd empty data might give you
a different piece of information and
then to create a new file you're going
to go file and new and then you're going
to go file and then we are going to call
this Python Tut and the extension for
Python files is dot py and click on
people or click on ok and there you are
for Mac and for Windows you're going to
do pretty much exactly the same thing
create a new project you're going to
find a location that's perfectly fine
we're going to say ok you're going to
make sure that you have version 3.5
point 1 of Python click on create it's
going to say it's not empty click on yes
and then come over here and click on
file and new and new file and I'm going
to call this Python Tut as well you can
call whatever you want of course dot py
click on OK and now you're ready to
program alright so here we are inside of
pycharm and once again in the
description click on that it's going to
jump you to the end of the video and it
will show you how to install it on Mac
or Windows either one of them so
basically what we're going to do here is
we are going to want to ask the user of
our program to enter in their name and
then we are going to say hello and
follow that up with whatever their name
is now remember I said previously that
we need to list all the things we want
to happen to solve our problem so what
we want to do here is we want to first
off if you put a hash symbol right there
that's a comment that means the Python
interpreter is going to just regard
everything you put there and it is very
good to comment your code if you want to
have a multi-line comment just put those
three little quotes like that and look
at that now you have a multi-line
comment
okay pretty cool stuff so you can
remember that for later pretty easy to
remember but what we want to do here is
we want to just start writing out
exactly what we want to happen
so we're going to say ask the user to
input their name and assign it to a
variable named name and we have to have
a place to store things and variables
allow us to say this is a name and it's
going to be associated with a certain
piece of data so how do we convert that
into Python well we want to create a
variable name name and there it is and
then we want to accept input from the
user so we just type in input we want to
put a message on the screen so the user
can see it and that message is going to
be what is your name and you don't have
to put anything else there and you can
skip down to the next line so what do we
want to do now that we have that all set
up well we simply want to print out
hello followed by the name they entered
okay that's it it's pretty simple
program and how do we print things out
on the screen well we just call for
print because we want to print out on
the screen and then we type in exactly
what we want to have here so we're going
to have hello and we're going to
separate all of the different things
we're going to print out to the screen
so here is going to be a string which is
just a bunch of characters and here
we're going to say that we want the data
that is stored inside of name to also be
printed out on the screen
now I'm going to run this and you can
see right here at the bottom of the
screen it says what is your name and I
am going to type in my name look at this
I made a mistake already I'm supposed to
be an expert let's go and put a space
inside of there and let's rerun this so
rerun it what is your name and I'm going
to type in Derrick and hit enter and
it's going to say hello Derrick just
like that so pretty simple little
program
and we're going to get much more
complicated as these go on and of course
I'm going to start asking you questions
and then I'm going to pause the video
you're going to write the code and then
you are going to then be able to just
learn through problem solving so another
thing just before we move on is variable
names can either start with a letter any
letter you'd like or underscores and you
can of course come in here and separate
these you can say something like the
name like that and after the first
letter inside of here you can also come
in and also use numbers so that is the
ways that you would create variable
names which are just storage cells and
it's also very important that those
variable names are not any of these
words right here so you can't use and
DDL from da-da-da-da-da not anything you
really need to worry about and as you
learn more about Python you are going to
just know that these are commands used
in Python and you cannot use them who's
going to name anything lambda anyway or
a variable named 4 these are all pretty
weird things and by no means should you
go in and try to memorize that ok so now
let's do something a little bit more
complicated basically what we're going
to do is allow your users to do math on
to values that they enter so what are we
going to do we're going to type out
exactly what needs to be done so we're
going to say ask the user and you should
do this for every program I even do it
today with very very big programs so
we're going to say ask the user to input
two values and store them in variables
that are going to have the name of num1
and num2 what we're going to then do
that's going to be a little bit
different is whenever these pieces of
data come in they are all considered
just random bits of characters or
strings so what we're going to have to
do is figure out a way to convert the
strings that the users enter in into
regular number
and these regular numbers are not going
to have decimal places and in situations
in which you have a variable that
doesn't have a decimal place it is known
as an integer okay so we received the
pieces of data that we want the two
numbers that we want to sum together so
what do we need to do that we need to
add the values entered and store in a
variable named sum okay pretty simple
stuff and then what do we need to do
well let's go and do a little bit more
math let's also say that we want to
subtract values and store in a variable
that is known as difference and let's do
some more we will multiply the values
and store in a variable that is named
product and finally we will divide the
values and store in another variable
that is going to be called quotients and
what the heck let's do another one and
then we also want to use a funky little
tool that we have called modulus on the
values to find the remainder and guess
what we are going to call that remainder
and let's do another one we're going to
print the results on the screen for the
user because it wouldn't be useful if it
didn't do that and I guess that's
basically it so now after we created all
the steps that we need to do we're going
to come in here and fill it in with
Python code so how do we receive two
pieces of data inside of Python pretty
simple we used input before so of course
we're going to have input is going to be
used and we're going to again type in
the men the message we want so we're
going to say enter two numbers and then
we are going to receive two numbers and
there's a fancy little function inside
of function inside of Python called
split what it's going to do is it's
going to you're going to enter not two
numbers let's say they're two and four
well we have to decide how are we going
to take these two numbers that they
enter in well what split does is it says
if there is a space or whitespace
between these numbers we are going to
separate those values that way and then
we're going to have to assign them to
variables and if you want to have two
variables one is called num1 and the
other one's called num2 you just put the
two of them in there just like you did
with the one previously and there you go
now you're going to be able to receive
two pieces of data instead of just one
so pretty cool stuff we then have to
convert our strings so that python knows
that we're working with integers and
that's pretty easy to do we just say
that we want to store inside of the
number one variable an integer version
of num1 and then we can go and do
exactly the same thing for num2
so there's num2 and there's num2 so it's
just converting a string into an integer
it's all it's doing now we need to add
these values and store them into a
variable called sum
pretty easy to do we just say num1 plus
num2 pretty much exactly the way that
you would think it would work
so we're going to take the value in here
add it to the value in here and store it
inside of this guy right here let's go
and do the same thing with subtraction
and all we do is change that guy right
there when we want to multiply we're
just going to go and put a star inside
of there like that if we want to divide
we're going to change this to divide and
be modulus which is going to give us the
remainder we're just going to come in
here and we're going to put it like that
but this is sum we can't use these
variables these variable names because
it would overwrite the value stored in
some each time and we already know that
we want to store those in variables
called difference in this situation and
product in the situation because we
wrote all this stuff out and quotient in
this situation right here and then
finally remainder
like we have right here but now we want
to print our results and we want to
print them in a format let's say that
they enter 5 + + 4 inside of here what
we want to do is we want to go and print
it out on the screen 5 + 4 is equal to 9
so how are we going to do that with our
print statement we can't do it in its
current format so what we're going to do
instead is we need to format our output
onto the screen whenever it's printed
we're going to still use print just like
we did before and what we're going to do
at the end of this is like I said we
need to format our output and we need to
say num1 and num2 and then some
but how inside of this little string
inside of here remember if it's in
quotes it's a string we're just building
it ourselves how are we going to say
we're num1 num2 and some go to well we
just come in here and throw in some
curly brackets and throw in some more
curly brackets and then throw in one
more curly bracket and what this is
going to do for us is it's going to take
this number one right over the value 4
it is and throw it right there num2 is
going to be thrown in right there and
then some is going to be thrown in right
there so that is how we can format all
of our data we can just come in here and
do this a couple times and then we will
just change that to subtraction we can
come up here make sure that we have our
variable names exactly the same and also
if I didn't mention this previously
difference is completely different from
difference it's this case sensitive so
make sure you use exactly the same
variable name and also we can come up
here and get product bring this down
here change this to multiply and throw
in products right there and quotient
whenever your very first starting off
with programming it is a good idea to
just come in here copy and paste make
sure these variable names are exactly
the same that's not a problem
and then remainder for the modulus and
let's change to this and
remainder and if we save that and then
we run it we come down here enter two
numbers and the two numbers we're going
to enter our five remember the space and
a four hit enter and is going to go and
output our data exactly the way that we
think that it should and let's just move
this up here so you can see everything
all at once so there you go that is how
we go about receiving all that
information and then providing the
proper output and now based off of
everything you learned right there I
think you are ready to solve your first
Python program so what we want to do
here is our problem let's go and throw
in a comment our problem is going to
allow the user to enter miles
so we'll say receive miles and convert
to kilometers and then some information
that we need to know is that kilometres
is going to be equal to miles times one
point six oh nine three four and the
output are basically the program the way
we want it to look here is the message
is going to be printed out on screen is
enter miles they are then going to be
able to enter the number five and then
we are going to output on the screen
five miles equals and something like 8.0
for something kilometers whatever that
is so there you go so like it's a cheat
sheet description you can refer to that
so that you don't have to jump back and
forth through the video or you could
rewind the video or whatever you want to
do but basically what I want you to be
able to do here is to print out this
string allow them to enter a number and
then output this information and what
you do right now is pause your screen go
write the code and then come back and
I'll show you the results or my solution
for this program alright so here we are
back again and now I'm going to walk
step-by-step through exactly how to
solve this so I'm going to say something
like ask the user to input miles
hopefully you went and typed all this
out and assign it to the miles variable
and what else are we going to need to do
here well remember we need to convert
from string to integer and yes there's
other ways to do that I'll get into that
later on we then also want to perform
calculation by multiplying one point six
zero nine three four times miles and
save that in a variable called
kilometers and then we want to print
results using format yes I use kind of
bad english whenever i'm typing out
comments sometimes sorry about that
hopefully it doesn't bother you all
right so what we going to do right here
well we're going to create a variable
called miles and we want to receive
input and we want to print out a message
here that says enter miles and we'll
throw a little space inside of there
then we want to convert miles into an
integer version of the variable called
miles we need and then need to perform
our calculations this is going to be
kilometers is equal to miles times one
point six oh nine three four and then we
need to print our results using format
and I showed you what I wanted you to
print out before and we're going to
throw in our curly brackets right there
and we're going to say miles equals and
then throw in with the kilometers come
outside of that double quote and then
we're going to say format and then what
we want to go inside of there is going
to be whatever is stored in the variable
called miles and whatever is stored in
the variable called kilometers we're
going to save that and then we're going
to run it and it's going to say enter
miles in our example I typed in five and
here we can see five miles equals eight
point zero four six seven kilometers so
there you go hopefully you did good with
your first example if you didn't
is not a problem at all you're going to
have a lot of chances to do all of this
right and like it said making mistakes
is the best way to be able to learn how
to program that's all programming is so
now let's do something a little bit more
interesting let's say we want to create
a calculator so we want to be able to
receive two numbers separated by the
operator of choice and then we want to
show a result so for example I want to
output on the screen enter calculation
and then I want them to be able to enter
something like five times six and then
it's going to output the proper
information thereafter I then and we're
going to print out on the screen five
times six is equal to 30 okay but we are
going to allow them to use addition
subtraction multiplication or division
whenever they are providing that
information to us so here we are let's
comment that out so it doesn't mess
anything up and then we'll walk through
exactly what we need to do here so we
want to store the user input of two
numbers and the operator of choice and
then what do we want to do well we need
to convert the strings into integers
just the numbers though we're not going
to convert the operator that they're
going to be using then we're going to
use a fancy tool remember I said before
every programming language is going to
provide the ability to perform different
operations depending upon conditions so
what we need to do here is we need to
say if they enter plus then we need to
provide output based on addition and
then we're going to also do exactly the
same thing with subtraction
multiplication and division we'll just
keep that there because we're smart we
don't need to type out all that so then
after we have that basically depending
upon whatever the condition is we are
then going to come in here
and we are going to print the results
and then our program is going to end
because we don't really need to do
anything else
alright so store the user input of two
numbers and the operator also feel free
to pause the video anytime you would
like to if you want to go and see if you
can do it the right way so what I'm
going to say is number one and an
operator and number two and I want to
receive the input for this and I'm going
to type out enter calculation and then I
will need to split those guys based off
of whitespace and then need to convert
number one into an integer and to do so
we go and call our int function then
we're going to do exactly the same thing
for number two and there's number two
and there's number two again we're not
doing it for rid of the operator well
then that brings us to if and how to
perform different operations based off
of conditions so how we use if is pretty
easy we just type in if the operator
they entered in is equal to and remember
it wasn't converted in anything so it's
still string so we have to put it
between quotes we're going to say if the
value for operator is equal to the plus
sign well then put in our little colon
and then we need to put some white space
inside of here that's the way Python
works that that's the way the Python
knows that everything underneath here
that's indented belongs to this
condition if this condition comes true
this is what's going to be executed and
what specifically is going to be
executed is our formatted data so we're
going to go and put our little curly
brackets inside of there again more
curly brackets and then we're going to
have another curly bracket and then
we're going to say format and then this
is going to be kind of neat we can go
numb one inside of there and numb to
inside of there but you're probably
saying why didn't you do the calculation
for this some or you can do the
calculation directly inside of here so
that's pretty cool stuff and that's all
we want to do because we know the
operator we know the number
we don't want to do anything else so we
want to jump out of that condition and
basically exit the program unless the
value for operator is not equal to plus
in that situation we say else if but the
people that designed Python were really
cool funny people and they decided to
just abbreviate that to LF exactly like
that so now we're going to say operator
is equal to and here we're going to say
- and we're going to put our little
colon inside of there again and in this
situation we're just going to do a
subtraction we want to tab in there
print this right here throw in our
subtraction right there throw in our
subtraction right here and there we're
ready to go and now we need to check the
rest so we'll do an else if the other
two conditions were not true what are we
going to do throw that inside of there
we're going to check if this was
multiplication we're going to change
that to multiplication and then we're
going to change that to multiplication
and then we have another one and in this
situation that's going to be subtraction
or that's going to be division sorry
about that and we're going to throw in
division and here we will do a division
but what if they didn't enter anything I
order they entered something that wasn't
one of those things well in that
situation there is a Ketchel and that
catch-all is known as else so in that
situation we're going to come in and
we're going to print a different message
that is going to say use either plus
minus multiplication or division next
time and there we are and that is all
that we need to do here so we're going
to save that and we are going to run it
and they can come in here and go enter
calculation look at me being silly I
didn't come in here and put a space in
there and your calculation let's save
that let's run it again enter
calculation and we can come in and say 5
plus 4 and it's going to automatically
perform at that calculation for us we'll
also be able to go 5 times 4 get exactly
the same results or well different
results obviously it's multiplication or
we can come in and say 5 and then let's
think you maybe wanted to use modulus
well our program doesn't accept that and
you can see that we get
a little error message there in that
situation it's also very important to
know there are different ways to perform
conditions as you're going to see as the
tutorial continues you're also going to
be able to check if a value is greater
than less than greater than or equal to
less than or equal to or not equal to
and that is weird
but that is the way you check if two
things are not equal to and now what
we're going to do is we're going to do
another example and then you're going to
get another program problem that you're
going to have to work through in this
example what we're basically going to do
is decide if a birthday is important or
not yes I know it's silly but whatever
what we're going to do is we're going to
go and say something like we'll provide
different outputs based on age and
there's going to be different conditions
that we have if the age is one through
eighteen while those are very important
so we're going to print out on the
screen that they are important we are
then also going to come in here and in
some countries if you are the age of 21
or 50 or you have an age that is greater
than 65 that is also considered
important and so we will act as if they
are important and then finally all the
other poor people myself included we're
going to say that their birthday is not
important I'm sorry about that but
that's just what I came up with for an
example to mainly show you how to use
logical operators and you're going to
see more of those here in a second so
basically what we want to do here is I'm
going to show you a new way to
automatically convert the string that we
get from input into an integer but what
we want to do is we want to receive age
and store in a variable called age and
then after we do that we are going to
say we're going to use an if statement
again and we're going to say if age is
both greater than or equal to 1 and less
than
or equal to 18 we want to print the
important things so important what else
do we want to do here with our if
statements well we want to say if age is
either 21 or 50 then it's going to be
important also and then we can also them
doing this mainly separately just so I
can show you something else that's neat
we can say that we want to check if age
is less than 65 and then we're going to
use a nifty tool to convert true to
false all right and you're going to see
that and vice versa that tool you're
going to see in a second and that's it
and of course these are all going to
print the message important important
and then we're also going to have
another thing that's going to say not
important for everybody else and that's
going to be our else default so we want
to receive the age and we want to store
it well we are going to call age this
time like I said if you want to
automatically convert the string that
they input into an integer you can use
eval you can do a whole bunch of things
with eval but with this you just refer
to it as evaluate it's going to allow
you to be able to automatically convert
strings into integers in this situation
so that's eval and it's pretty cool and
you're going to see it do even cooler
things later on we are then going to use
what are called logical operators and
they allow you to stack the conditional
operators like the equals to not equals
to greater than and greater than or
equal to and all those guys you're going
to have and that is one of what are
called the logical operators and
basically if both conditions are true it
returns true you're also going to have
or and with or if either condition is
true then you get true as a result and
then finally you're going to have nots
and basically naught is going to convert
a
true condition into a false so if you
give it false it's going to return true
if you give it true it's going to return
false that's what it does all right so
we received our age here and now let's
get down here and let's start using the
logical and conditional operators that I
talked about already so here we are
going to convert this we're going to say
if age we're comparing two conditions
here so throw those little parentheses
around there to keep everything neat if
the age is greater than or equal to one
then we want to use the logical operator
and we want to say if the age is less
than or equal to 18 in that situation
you are important so we're going to tell
the whole world that this is an
important birthday then we're going to
come down here and we're going to say LF
because this is going to be a different
condition and we're going to again say
age is equal to 21 or age is equal to 50
so that's going to cover either one of
those guys and that's why that's good
and once again you are deemed an
important person or a person that has an
important birthday so we'll throw that
in there then what we're going to do is
the snazzy little thing in which we are
going to convert in this situation what
you would normally do here I'm just like
I said I'm looking for a reason to do
this else if I would normally do age is
greater than 65 like that and then print
important birthday but what I'm going to
do is I'm going to change this to a less
than and then I'm going to throw not in
front of it and that is going to allow
me to get the opposite and you're going
to see not being used for things that
are a little bit more interesting and
useful than that but I just wanted to
show you what not does converts false as
in the true stars trues and falses okay
and then finally we get to the end here
and we want to say else and then we want
to make the whole world sad by saying
not important birthday or let's be a
little bit nice and let's just say sorry
not
important okay so at least we said sorry
there we go we saved it we're going to
run it come down here to the Aged area
and we're going to enter something like
twelve important birthday comes back
let's run it again now we're going to
type in twenty opps sorry not important
then we're going to run it again and
we're going to type in 65 enter
important birthday and we can continue
doing this over and over again until
infinity and there you can see exactly
how that works how conditional operators
and logical operators work together to
allow you to combine condition and now
it is time for a problem this problem is
going to be basically a person is going
to enter their age and then you are
going to determine what grade they
should be in so if we think about this
problem if the age is five you are going
to print out that the person needs to go
to kindergarten and then what you're
going to do is you're going to say ages
6 through 17 in that situation goes to
grades 1 through 12 and you should be
able to handle those with one condition
I'll have a whole bunch of them and then
if age is greater than 17 say go to
college and then there's going to be
another condition you're going to have
to handle which I'm going to let it to
you to figure that one out and basically
your goal in this situation is to try to
complete this program with 10 or less
lines so there you go pause the video
refer to your cheat sheet and see if you
can solve this little problem we got
here alright so we are back again what
are we going to do we're going to ask
for the age and then we're going to
handle this is the one that I told you
you're going to have to find on your own
if age is less than five we don't want
any toddlers going to school we are then
also special output
just for age five being the kindergarten
thing that we had there before and here
what we're going to do is since a number
is the result for ages 6 through 17 we
can check them all with one condition
okay may not I may have got that one it
doesn't really matter and then what
we're going to do is handle everyone
else so we're going to come in here and
I'm wondering if maybe whenever you were
asking for the age if you use eval you
remember to eval no problem if he
doesn't then we're going to come in and
we're going to say enter age and in this
situation I'm going to remember to put a
space inside of there
then we come down here and we're going
to handle if age is less than 5 so if
age is less than 5 we are going to print
out a message and that message is going
to be too young for school and then we
need to come down here and do LF and in
this situation we're going to say if age
is equal to 5 we're going to print on
another message and this message is
going to be go to kindergarten and then
we're going to come down here and go LF
and in this situation we're going to use
a conditional as well as a logical
operator we're going to say LLL if age
is greater than 5 number 5 is being
taken up with kindergarten and age is
less than or equal to 17 in that
situation we're going to print out well
what we're going to do first do a
calculation we're going to say grade is
equal to age minus 5 and if you didn't
get this don't worry about it you're
going to get better and better as you
see examples and how they work so you're
going to say go to throw in the curly
bracket grade
then after this we are going to call for
Matt throw in the right information and
that's going to be grade like that and
then otherwise we're going to come down
here and go else and we're going to
print go to college and we're going to
save it and we're going to run it and
enter age let's type in 17 go to 12th
grade lamp great I should reword that
and said grade 12 whatever I'm writing
these programs out of my head that's why
I didn't think of that type in five go
to kindergarten run again and here we
are going to say too
too young for school and running again
and type in 65 and there you go so there
you go guys that is part one of my learn
to programming series and these problems
are going to get more and more
complicated and you're going to learn
more and more as the tutorial continues
and this is technically the end of the
tutorial
but what I'm going to do now is show you
how to install pycharm on windows as
well as Mac and if you don't want to
learn about that you're free to leave
the video otherwise I'm going to jump
over and show you real quickly how to
install pycharm ok so what we're going
to need to do here first off is get
python and this is for windows what
we're going to do is we're going to go
to python.org get it forward slash
windows like that or you if you just go
to python.org and click on downloads
it's going to show you this guy right
here and then what you're going to want
to do is click right here which is
python 3.5 point 1 if it's a bigger
number don't worry about it this
tutorial is no doubt going to work for
it so click on that you're going to see
this page you're going to want to scroll
down your screen and you're going to
come down here where it says windows x86
executable installer and click on that
after that downloads down here you're
going to get the option to run it so run
it and then you're going to come down
here and make sure that you click on
install launcher for all users and
definitely add python 3.5 to path after
you do that you're going to click on
install now and that's going to load up
and then after it's done setup was
successful and you can close this and
that was easy wasn't it now what we're
going to do is we're going to install
pipe charm make sure that windows is
circled right here we're going to use
the community version which is awesome
and free and click
download once again it's going to say
hey it's downloaded let's click on run
and this guy is going to open up we're
going to click on next we're going to
let that be - okay and we're going to
click on next I'm going to make sure
that you put a little check mark in here
next to the dot py click on next you can
leave everything be the same click on
install and it will install for you and
after it's done you can put a check mark
in here run PyCharm Community Edition
and click on finish
right down here more than likely you're
not going to have a previous version of
Pi charms and put a check in there and
click on OK and then PyCharm is going to
open up you can leave everything exactly
the way that it is click on OK like that
and then you're going to click on create
a new project I went and defined my
location as Python code and then you're
going to click on this little drop down
and make sure you are using Python 3.5
and you're going to click on create then
we're going to go and create a new file
and to do so you're going to click on
new and file and then I call this Python
tut py click on OK and then we're going
to verify that we're using python 3.5 so
just type in import sis and then on the
next line print sis dot version
underscore info like that and then you
can right click on the screen anywhere
and click on run python tucked and there
you go and you're going to see major 3
and minor 5 right like that and that is
going to verify that you're using python
3.5 and you're ready to go and that's
all you need to do everything's set up
and now i'm going to show you how to
install python on a macintosh so here
you go you're going to go to python.org
/downloads to install from mac it's
going to say latest version for mac OS x
and we're going to click on download
Python 3.5 point 1 and don't worry if
it's a bigger number it's more than
likely going to work after it downloads
you're going to come down here click on
this little downward facing arrow click
on open and there it's going to open up
for you and now it's time to install
python we're going to click on continue
you're going to click on continue and
you're going to click on continue and
to agree to that and you're going to
install probably going to have to type
in your password and install software
and it will take a little bit of time to
install and then it's going to say
installation was successful and
everything is awesome and then we're
going to close that now it's time to get
PyCharm
and to get pycharm you're going to go to
JetBrains comm /pi charm download and
you're going to click on community
download and it's going to download
you're going to click on this little
arrow right here and then click on open
and then really simply you're going to
come over here and grab this guy and
drag it into the Applications folder
like you do all the time and it will be
loaded now you can go into the
Applications folder and double-click on
PyCharm c e and PyCharm will open then
you're going to come over here and
you're going to click on edit
configurations click this guy edit
configurations and then inside of it
you're going to name this python Tut dot
py and then make sure that you click on
this little guy and you select python
3.5 point 1 or whatever the new version
is right after that and then you're
going to click on ok and be able to
start writing some programs so there you
go guys that is a start of my learner's
program with python tutorial as well as
how to install PyCharm and set up python
on both windows as well as on macintosh
