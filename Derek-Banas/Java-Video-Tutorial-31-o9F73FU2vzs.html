31 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to start off with part 1
of what's going to be a 2 or 3 part
tutorial on how to use files inside of
Java well if I want to be able to do
that of course we need to go imports new
libraries and the one I'm going to bring
in here right now is going to be the
Java i/o library you want to be able to
use whole bunch of things there then I'm
going to jump in here and I'm going to
use frames here later on in this
tutorial that's the reason why this is
here and this is here it's basically
just to show you the J file chooser
which is something I haven't shown you
yet so I'm going to come in here go
static string file path and parents
directory which are going to be two
strings that I'm going to use later on
in the tutorial and then I'm going to go
static and I'm gonna go file this is how
you define a file alright so we created
three file objects and it's important to
understand that whenever you create a
file object you're just creating it in
memory until you actually later on call
a method called create new file in that
situation you're actually creating the
file on the hard drive now if you want
to come in here and actually create a
directory go random directory here and
I'm going to say new file and I need to
tell it where it's going to show up I
actually have this saved and there you
are that's where I want it to actually
show up on my hard drive so I'm defining
that right there and even though that's
what I created right there that is just
creating any memory I want to actually
create this actual directory on the hard
drive I need to go random dir and then
go m'kay dir if is a method that's going
to actually create this directory on our
drive now I'm going to go on create a
couple other things let's go random file
equals new file and I'm going to call
this random text and whenever you do not
define a file path and like I did in
this situation it's just going to by
default throw this text file wherever
your JVM is or it's going to save it
wherever Java lesson 31 is on the hard
drive
however if I go random file 2 is equal
to new file and I actually define where
I want it to show up of course that's
going to be the directory that I just
created and then this is going to be
followed with random tude
next that's a very specific location so
it's going to save it on the hard drive
in a very specific location because
that's what you told it to do well now
if I want to go and actually create
these new files I have to be prepared to
catch an exception called the IO
exception it must be caught and I'm
going to throw it inside of a try block
give myself some added space and then
I'm going to go random file create new
file now we know the file is going to be
created on the hard drive and then we go
random file to create new file call that
method again and we know that's going to
be created and then if you would want to
get the path for one of these files like
the whole entire long path like I just
showed you up here like I was cut and
pasted inside of there you would just
come in here and go get and on coal path
and that's how you would be able to pull
in the path for this file even though
you didn't define it like I did with
this file right here so by not defining
where you want this to be saved you have
to use this get canonical path to be
able to find that location otherwise
it's going to return null for you then
of course we have a try block we're
going to have to create a catch block an
IO exception e is going to be what we're
going to catch and then in this
situation I'm just going to say print
stack trace which is just going to
execute and print out the error on the
screen so I just keep that simple of
course I've covered all those air
catching in the past now if you want to
go in and check if a file exists you
just go if random file exists like that
and then if it does exist we can go and
train out all kinds of other things
about the file so let's go
system.out.print line and one thing we
can do is type out file exists which is
nice if we execute this just for the
heck of it you can see that that works
and there you see file exists pops up so
let's get some more information about
this file if you wanted to find out if
the file is readable for example pretty
simple let's go in here and type in
random a file can read that'll tell you
if you're able to read from that file
and in the next tutorial when I get into
actually reading from files itself a
little bit more room you could also find
out if a file is writable and then
you're just going to change this to
write of course those print out boolean
values so you could use them in an if
statement or something like that it also
go file
location and all this code is available
underneath the video you should
definitely look at it because it's
heavily commented and then we can use
our file path that we created up above
to print that out to screen and then of
course we could go file name and then
just type in get name and if we execute
that you can see all that different
information just print it out there on
the screen which is all very very useful
however now I'm going to get into things
that you can do since you defined the
path like we did when we created this
file versus things you cannot do because
you did want to find the path one thing
you cannot do just paste this out here
if you wanted to get the parent
directory for this file object that you
did not define its full path you're not
going to be able to so if we go in here
and go get parent this is always going
to print out null to the screen and it's
just going to do that because you did
not define however let's say you
wouldn't want to go parent directory is
equal to random file to get parent this
is sort of the long way around doing
this but you could do it just like we
did it up here as well because I did
define the parent for this guy it's
going to be able to print that out the
screen and let's just say file to parent
and then we'll just go parent directory
and if we execute that you're going to
see that one of them prints out null and
one of them prints out the actual parent
directory and now as you can see file to
parent here's the long list and here you
see just not that's important to
remember that that's how that works
it could also go is it a directory and
then in this situation you go random dir
which is a directory and then just type
in is directory and this method is going
to print out that of course yes this
directory that you created is indeed a
directory you could also create a string
array call it files in the IR is equal
to and then if you go random di r dot L
is T call that method that's going to
return a string list of all the files
that are inside of the directory that we
called random dir then we could print
this out and say files in rectory throw
in a new line just to make that make a
little bit more sense divide everything
up and now that you have that list of
files you could use an enhanced for-loop
to cycle through those files so we'll
just go for and it will go string and
we'll say file name which is going to be
the temporary holding cell
files in dir like that and do a system
out and in this situation we're just
going to say file name and then follow
that up with this and then throw a
newline inside of there so everything's
all divided up and we can execute that
to see how that works and I'll show you
in a second how you can actually pull
the actual file objects out say files in
directory and here you have random - dot
txt so that all shows up if I open this
up as well you can see here there's
random - text and if you can't see this
you can view a full screen alright so
let's go in here mess around with a
couple other methods that are available
you could also check if something is a
file oh we go is a file and then you
could just come in here leave random
file as it is and then just simply type
in is file as you play around with these
you're going to get to remember them a
lot easier you could also check if it's
hidden is hidden random file again and
then guess what you're going to type err
you're going to type in is hidden so as
you use these methods more and more and
more you're gonna be able to memorize
them just by using them you could also
do another method here like let's say we
wanted to find out when this was last
modified well this is going to return
for you millisecond since January 1st
1970 so the actual time from that point
in time I like that you're going to be
able to find that information out and
then of course you can change the
milliseconds to actual something that
would make sense to you and another
useful thing you could find out file
size for example in bytes and since
there's nothing in there this is going
to return nothing but you could just
come in here and type in length and
that's going to return the file size we
can execute this and see all this
different information pop up here on the
screen and there it is there's
millisecond since January 1st 1970 is it
hidden false is it a file true and file
size equals 0 because there isn't
anything in it of course nothing shows
up so what would happen if you wanted to
actually change the name of a file
that's pretty easy to do as well just go
random file let's say that I wanted to
rename it rename it type in 2 and you're
going to type in new file and then
you're going to want to put in here
exactly what you want it to be called so
let's just scroll up here so I can save
myself some time to this guy right here
copy that and then let's say that we
want to come back down here
when to semicolon paste that inside of
there and let's just say we wanted to
name this random 3 dot text that's
exactly how you would do it you just
use the rename - method and then if I
execute this just to show that it
actually works and it has been renamed
we hit proceed you're going to see all
that information pop up there but random
three text also shows up here so that's
also very useful so let's do something a
little bit neat let's say we want to go
and call another method let's just say
I'm gonna go lesson call the constructor
for this guy probably not a good idea
but I'm gonna do it anyway
and of course also I should probably go
else and print out a message if by
chance something doesn't exist print
line file goes on exists so that's going
to handle in that situation where the
file doesn't exist the Entenmann's come
outside a main and just type in public
lesson 31 this which means and I have to
actually change this to Java lesson 31
you should never do this by the way I'm
just doing this out of my head I don't
know why I'm doing it this way but what
the heck let's say that you wanted to
pop up some what's called a J file
chooser this is the reason why we have
the frame above so I'm going to go J
file chooser and I'm just going to call
it file chooser like this is equal to nu
J file chooser and I must say that I
want to open up the random directory
which is a directory that we already
created and then I'm just going to go
file chooser dot show open dialog this
is something that I didn't show you
previously but it would allow you to
open up a dialog box it's going to show
you all the files in this directory here
and there you can see that's exactly
what it did and of course you can use
this just like any other little dialog
box and jump around inside and look at
all the other different things that we
have there inside of the filesystem just
popped into my head to cover that
because I hadn't covered it previously
some will definitely get more into in
the future so now you know how to create
files and open them up and look at them
in nearly any way imaginable well how do
you delete them well you just go F
random file delete you technically don't
have to go and use an if statement but
probably a good idea in this situation
just so we can check to make sure that
the file was actually deleted here we'll
go file delete it and just execute that
out on the screen now one other thing is
if you go in and you try to delete a
directory however there are files still
inside of that directory you won't be
able to delete the right to the
directory you need to delete it first
eat all the files in the directory that
is so one way you can do that is
remember I said you could get a listing
of file objects for all files inside a
directory files and dir you just go
random just the name of your file
directory and type in list files and
this method is going to shoot out an
array of file objects now if you wanted
to real easily go in and delete all
those so that you could delete the
directory itself just going to go in
here and then go files in dir that's a
cycle through every single file or
directory inside of there as long as
those directories are empty and delete
them all we're going to call the delete
function or method and there you go
that's a way of deleting all those guys
and of course after you delete all of
those and you want to go in and delete
the directory itself of course you can
come in here and go random dir delete
and then in this situation want to go
directory delete it and execute that and
in this little dialog box is going to
open up and we hit cancel on that and
you can see over here file deleted and
directory deleted so that is a whole
bunch of different ways to work with
files and directories inside of Java up
next I'm going to show you how to
manipulate and read and write to files
leave any questions or comments below
