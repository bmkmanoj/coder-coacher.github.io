11 of my blender video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to show
you how to 3d print all of your blender
models as well as how to work with
either SVG or vector files inside of
blender like always you'll find a link
to some shortcuts that I talked about in
this tutorial as well as some links to
some other information that I will bring
up as URL continues and I have a lot to
do so let's get into it
alright so I'm gonna be using all free
software of course you're going to be
able to use things like illustrator to
create vector art no problem but here is
Inkscape which is what I'm using in this
tutorial and if you want to get it it's
basically illustrator for free and you
can get it at Inkscape dot org and then
just click on download and you can use
it on either Linux windows or on Mac so
it works on every single platform
exactly the same and in the description
I have a link to my Inkscape tutorial
that you can watch if you want to learn
how to create open as a vector art then
I'm also going to be using another free
piece of software called the Ultimaker
cura program and you can also download
that for free and it is available for
free on every single operating system as
well and as the tutorial continues i'm
going to show you how to use both of
these pieces of software ok so what I'm
gonna do in this tutorial is I'm going
to show you how to make a board game
that is called Settlers of Catan and
basically it just has a whole bunch of
tiles on it and I'm going to show you
how to take this vector art and put it
on a hexagon tile and then I'm going to
jump over into the cura program and
you're going to be able to actually
convert it into a file that you're going
to be able to print on a 3d printer so
you can see here I went and drew this
these are going to represent the wood
inside of the Settlers of Catan game and
I went and just created this using the
Bezier tool and all this stuff over here
like I said there's in the description
there is a link to how to use inks game
and of course I will provide all of
these files for free this vector art so
you can just go to my website and
download it all and you know print out
this stuff and if you want to know what
all those files look like here they are
so inside of settlers of catan you have
bricks and you have this is actually or
this is gonna represent the see the week
the tree is the sheep and the desert so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to jump
over into blender and show you how to
import all of these files and these are
all SVG files inside of Inkscape you're
gonna want to save all these files as
plain not Inkscape SVG files but as
plain SVG files so for example inside of
Illustrator if you want to save this all
you would do is go file and save as and
then you would come down here and choose
just basic SVG file okay so I'm gonna
call this trees to just so I can show
you everything so trees to SVG safe and
this is gonna pop up you're going to
want to make sure that it is SVG 1.1
that's perfectly fine
type SVG not adobe CS whatever that said
CEF no SVG that's what you want just
want to make sure you knew that and then
click on OK and then likewise inside
make say if you just go file save as and
then you're gonna get the option to save
as an SVG file say there's Inkscape SVG
I always just save as plain SVG okay so
there you go and you click on save
alright so here we are inside a blender
man I'm just going to delete the cube
very first thing I want to do is I want
to create my hexagons that I'm going to
put those vector art on to okay so the
very first thing we need to do is I'm
gonna first switch to millimeters so
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna come
over here and click on scene and you can
see I have camera here unit presets I'm
gonna change this to millimeters like
that and that's all that I need to do
I'm not gonna change absolutely anything
else and then what I need to do is I'm
gonna create a circle so I'm gonna go
shift and a and we're gonna create a
circle and then over here to turn this
into a hexagon I'm going to of course
change this to six of vertices and then
I know that the tiles that I want to
print see you down here is what I'm
doing everything the tiles that I want
to print are going to have a radius of
45 point 75 if I want them to match up
to what I have inside
you know the actual game of Settlers of
Catan okay so we got that and then I can
zoom out and you're gonna see right
there there is the hexagon I'm going to
click on where it says Phil type and it
says nothing I'm gonna change that to
triangle fan so there we go now that is
all filled in I'm then gonna rotate this
I'm first off gonna hit N on here and
then the rotation for my Z is gonna be
negative 30 so there that is and then
you can see the hexagon that I have all
set up inside of there I'm now going to
jump over into edit mode so I'm gonna
click on tab and then I'm going to
extrude this guy so that it has some
thickness to it so I am going to come
over so I'm gonna press on E
and then I'm gonna hit enter and then
over here in the bottom left hand corner
in the Z area I'm gonna change this to
six point three five six point three
five and we can see here that it added
some depth to that and then I can keep
it in this perspective so that I can see
some more then what I want to do is I
want to go E and s I'm gonna move this
in a little tiny bit and because the
hexagons that are inside of here are
going to basically it's going to be a
hexagon and then it's gonna be an inset
and another hexagon and then we're gonna
have the image printed on top of it so I
went and did that and I can change this
to something more specific of course I
can change it to like 0.9 and it's gonna
automatically update but you're gonna
want all these to be the same so 0.9 and
0.9 okay so you can change that after
the fact if you want to be very very
precise with the editing that you're
doing then I'm gonna go E and s once
again and then I'll hit enter again and
then I can either move this guy here or
I can come down here once again and
change this if I would like so let's
just change it to three for example then
I can also come in and change this value
over here so let's say I just wanted to
increase the value on this extrusion I
could do the so let's just change the
nine and that looks about right 925 just
showing you multiple different ways we
can edit this and hit a to deselect it
and then that's basically what I'm
looking for tile wise okay so now what I
want to do is show you how to import our
vector art inside of here and then cut
into the face
of this tile and then convert it into a
file that we're gonna be able to print
so cool stuff so what I want to do is I
want to go and import my SVG file so I'm
gonna go file and I'm gonna go import
and SVG is an option right there and
let's just go and use our tree you can
see there's a listing of everything I'll
just go import SVG I'm gonna then need
to upgrade or increase the size on this
guy so I'm gonna come over here to scale
and going to change this to 400 and then
whoops I have to undo that so let's just
go like this the guy that I just
imported in it is set as curved so I'm
clicked on curved that's the trees you
know the vector art that I just imported
so I want to scale that I don't want to
scale anything else so 400 and 400 and
you can see right there is our tree and
you can go and move this guy around and
let's go ahead and increase this and
move it over here and let's change this
to top and then we're gonna be able to
move this around it's sometimes a little
wonky it's just part of the SVG file I
don't know why it doesn't always put it
exactly where you would think all right
so basically what we're gonna do is
seven once again that gives us our top
perspective I can change this to
orthographic there it might look a
little bit better you know what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna keep my tree
selected and I'm also going to select
the hexagon underneath of this so get
both of these at the same time there we
go got them both I'm gonna go into tab
mode I'm gonna go seven again then what
I'm gonna do is do a knife project and
it's gonna cut through the hexagons
that's underneath so just come over here
and knife project and you're gonna see
that it cut right in there exactly where
that I wanted it to I'm gonna hit tab
I'm gonna jump out of that out of this
guy right here and I'm gonna go and get
rid of this curve all together so let's
just delete that there it is it's gone I
also want to get rid of anything else
that could cause problems I'm gonna get
rid of the camera also and let's just
come over here and delete that and get
rid of our lamp as well delete that and
then go tab back over into edit mode
whoops I accidentally put that thermal
shift s and cursor to Center and tab
back over and you can see that we still
have our tree pattern there now what I
want to do is
just move that inward so that it will
print so I want to select the faces on
all of this and I'm gonna deselect it
just so you can see how I do that down
here I'm going to click on faces like
that and I'm gonna come in and select
all the faces and I'm holding down the
shift key and clicking with the right
mouse button to get all these in place
okay got all our faces and there we are
hit seven again to see them and this one
then gonna click on e and I'm gonna move
it down a little bit and then I'm gonna
left click on it and then over here in
the left side I can go and change the
actual position of this if I would like
to have it be more precise as you can
see as I'm clicking that is moving it
down here I'll zoom in a little bit so
there we go
move down a little bit and let's just
say that I want it to be negative one
boom there we are and one mistake people
can make is actually go through the
bottom you want to make sure that you
don't do that and you want to also make
sure that you're only selecting the top
faces whenever you're extrude and see
the bottoms not coming through there
that would have been a disaster and you
can go and double check that just click
on Z and then you can see exactly where
the extrusions are if that works out
better for you and I'm gonna go Z to
jump back to just show the solids once
again because I like the way that looks
alright so now that I have that all set
up I'm actually going to jump back over
into regular object mode you can see
that we have our cuts in there exactly
like I want and I'm going to actually
scale this down a little bit you're
gonna have to scale it this is actually
the the right size for Settlers of Catan
but I only have a 3d printer that can
print 4 inches by 4 inches so I need to
actually scale it and I thought well I
might as well just show you how to do
that all you would do is you come over
here and select this and go to point 9
like that and then select this one and
go point nine like that and there you go
that's how easy it is to scale it if it
doesn't fit on the bed of your 3d
printer and I think I've covered just
about everything else so the only thing
I haven't done is how to exports I'm
going to go file I'm gonna go export the
you're gonna use an STL file with
Curacao just change this to STL and I'm
just gonna call this wood katana and
export STL and then you can save this
file or do whatever you want with it and
then this is ultime Corcyra
and you can see over here the settings I
have
these work really good for my mana price
printer 3d printer that I have but it
might be different for you you can just
try these settings and hopefully they
work they should work for you and you
could do like a smaller test print so I
got puro up and I'm gonna end gonna go
open files and then would Katan STL is
what I just saved that ass I'm gonna
click on open and you can see it's
unable to slice it just means it needs
to be positioned so I'm gonna right
click with my right mouse button and
that's gonna allow me to grab this guy
and I went and selected him and then I
can move him into position and then all
I need to do is just move it into
position on the bed where it's going to
fit and everything's going to be
perfectly fine here really good stuff
and then it's gonna say ready to save to
removable drive and you're gonna come
over here you're gonna select your
removable drive and you're gonna click
on save to removable drive and that is
it and you're done and it will give you
a file that you're gonna be able to save
on to your 3d printer and you'll be able
to print out all of your tiles so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this like I
said all of the files that I use here
are available in the description
underneath the video and like always
please leave your questions and comments
