positioning of them just simply by
dragging and dropping them and they'll
automatically update for you and there
are a number of them here I'm going to
briefly go through all the different
widgets that are available for you these

the most common widgets that most
everybody uses now let's explain some of
the ones you may never have heard of or

you to find any large list of themes go

pointing arrow to the right of the total

text box where it states enter the RSS

money for charities the bod pod videos

your favorite videos from around the web
in your sidebar to use this tool you
must sign up for a month of a a pod pod
account then paste links to videos
within the one bollock pod drop down in
your right sidebar now if we go back and
I covers just about everything that's
not self-explanatory in the widgets area
now we're going to go into the extras
area these are general extras that you
can enable for your entire blog there
may be an extra that will put a snow
animation on the list which is seasonal
it's here right now but it's going to be
gone soon the extra labeled enable empty
shots site previews on this blog is a
bit complicated media of shots or M
shots enable anyone visiting your site
to get a glimpse of the site's you're
linking to without having to leave your
site and by rolling over a link a visual
preview will pop up showing the link
site without requiring any clicks or a
visit to the link site this is a nice
text wrap hence it is checked by default
the display a mobile theme extra should
also be checked in automatically
creating mobile Bossier version of your
site for smartphone owners another
reason wordpress is absolutely amazing
finally leave the last box unchecked by
leaving the hide related links extra
unchecked you will increase your overall
traffic one bad thing now we're going to
go back here check your back button or I
could have click there
and we're going to go to the customary
header area by clicking on the custom
header link you can choose to hide your
title change the tags color change back
to the default color or rough leather
around custom pattern as it states if
you choose to upload a custom header
image make sure the dimensions are 740
by 192 pixels if you click the header
colors link which is right here you will
be able to select your text colors or
you can slick click back and use your
originals or any number of other things
and that's basically all there is to
know in regards to how do you use the
custom header under your appearance tag
and off by the way here's the header tag
colors if you want to change your font
color you are upper color what that's
referring to is this area where your
lower come or revert back to the
original and advanced actually allows
you to select I want to close that
version if you want to enter in hex
codes for the colors of the different
text and so forth and so on you can what
I always tell people is if you don't
know what a hex color is don't worry
about it if you do use it that's about
it and the edit CSS area I don't I
didn't pay the additional money to be
able to to do this I haven't quite
decided if I'm going to or not
if you want to you could pay 1497 per
year to change your CSS and that's up
December 2009 and you can do that here
if you know understands the cascading
style sheets and will allow you to
change text and all overall formatting
on your website and you're probably
saying we'll just change the appearance
all right this is how simple it is you
just basically click on preview to see
if you like the way the template changed
design change what have you looks like
if you decide that you do click on
activate and it is done for you
if you decide that you do not click on
this X and go back to your template
picking area and there are 77 current
themes available to you and you can
select through them either
alphabetically or if you want to see
what the most popular themes are there
you go and they all work precisely the
same way click on activate or preview
and it is that simple it's literally two
clicks and you have a brand new website
that's basically all there is in regards
to appearance it's amazing that the
hardest thing to do in web design is
done in two clicks any WordPress but
that's basically everything your
comments are welcome you have yourself a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
