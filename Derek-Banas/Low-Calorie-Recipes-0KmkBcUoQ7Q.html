out there have shown some interest in
the foods that I eat so I decided to
share with you some low-calorie recipes
that I use to drop 85 pounds in five
months what you see here is 550 calories
and in this video I'm going to show you
how to make cheesecake potato chips
mayonnaise and sour cream
everything is low-calorie and low-fat
and the meatless meatloaf recipe is in
the description so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it my potato chips taste
exactly like regular potato chips except
they have 1/4 the calories and no fat my
cheesecake is even better it's only 16
calories and only has 1 gram of fat
my mayonnaise is only 6 calories and no
fat and it tastes exactly like
mayonnaise and the final recipe I'm
going to show you today is a 14 calories
zero fat sour cream so let's get cooking
potato chips look just like this and
they come out to about 1/8 of an inch in
here I'm just cutting them with a
regular knife but you could use a
mandolin that would be much more
efficient unconventionally I then put
the slices on a paper towel and
microwave them on high for 4 minutes as
soon as they're out of the microwave I
quickly remove them otherwise the paper
towel will stick and then I just throw
them in a pan no oil or anything else
needed I throw the chips in the oven at
400 degrees for 7 to 10 minutes just
watch until they're brown and then I
take one and a half cups of graham
crackers and I throw them in a bag and
roll over them a couple times with a
rolling pin until it nice and fine I'm
then going to take either 0% fat plain
yogurt 3 tablespoons of that or 3
tablespoons of margarine and add those
to the graham crackers in a blender go
ahead use the margarine the smidge of
fat you're going to get out of that is
definitely worth it I'm then going to
blend blend blend blend blend and then
take it out and put it in the bottom of
a pan I'm then going to take 2 cups of
Chobani Greek yogurt this is strawberry
zero-fat and I'm going to throw those in
my blender you of course can be free to
put any other type of yogurt in here you
want flavor wise I've tried a couple of
them
I'll turn out really good then add two
thirds of a cup of granulated sugar
that's 2/3 then add a half of a cup of
egg substitutes or egg beaters or
whatever you prefer
two teaspoons of vanilla extract of
course it doesn't matter what brand the
add now to make sure that the cheesecake
is nice and thick we're going to add
three tablespoons of cornstarch very
very important we are then going to of
course blend all of this stuff up you
might have to wipe it down on the side
and blend blend blend a couple times and
then we're going to get our graham
cracker crust and we're going to pour
our mixture over top of it and this is
going to cook at 350 for approximately
30 minutes and now I'm going to make
some zero fat mayonnaise with 0% fat
plain yogurt I'm going to get three
tablespoons of that yogurt throw it in a
mixer and then I'm going to get one
teaspoon of Dijon mustard you can use
Grey Poupon or you can use pretty much
anything else now I'm going to add a
half of a tablespoon of fresh chopped
parsley and then I'm going to add two
teaspoons of capers and if you say you
don't like capers try them anyway
they're really really good one teaspoon
of garlic powder is then going to be
added and then we're going to add a dash
of paprika it's basically just going to
depend upon how much you like paprika
and then we're going to blend this until
everything's combined and then you'll
have 0% mayonnaise low calorie zero fat
sour cream is easy just get fat-free
cottage cheese get a cup of it and then
turn your blender on so the consistency
is good and then pour the cottage cheese
through the spout on the top then get
yourself one tablespoon of lemon juice
and add that to the blender and
everything will go sweet together and
you'll have yourself some sour cream and
here is everything finished there's the
super crunchy potato chips there's the
mayonnaise sorry it's not white but it
tastes like Mayo there's sour cream and
there is the final cheesecakes or it's
hot that's why I didn't pick it up so
