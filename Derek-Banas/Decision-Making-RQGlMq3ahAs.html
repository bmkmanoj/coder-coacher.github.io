meta programming tutorial today I'm
gonna talk about how our brains store
information and then how everyone
reasons gathers additional information
reacts to situations and makes decisions
that's a mouthful NLP is used in nearly
every form of professional marketing you
consume on a daily basis it is a branch
of psychology first created by Richard
Bandler and John grinder basically what
they did was they studied the top
psychologists of their time and then
labeled step by step exactly how they
were able to become successful in
treating clients so that's basically
what NLP is it's a study of
communication and ways to change the
mind very fascinating and I cover tons
about NLP in a bunch of different videos
meta programming is the programming in
your brain that you use to react in all
situations in NLP it's often said that
the map is not the territory what
exactly does that mean well every time
we experience anything in life we leave
out a large portion of the information
we ignore and generalize because there's
just too much information to take in the
information that we do store makes up
our own personal version of what
happened during any point in the past
what we actually store in our brands are
fragments of either images or we
actually replay the whole entire process
in our brain or we remember things that
we heard or metaprogramming deciphers
these personal Maps or these images
sounds what and videos when you're first
trained on how to apply NLP techniques
you're asked a series of questions that
tell you how your brain actually works
in this video I will show you exactly
how my brain works I'm not supposed to
do this and I was warned a bunch of
times not to do this because this
information is extremely valuable to
marketing companies and whenever you're
answering these personality questions on
facebook this is the actual information
that the marketing companies are
gathering so those are quite dangerous
if they are used properly in this video
I'm going to go through exactly how our
brains process information I have no
idea if this information is boring to
people or not so leave a comment below
if you want to see exactly all the
different ways
that our brains process information I'm
gonna start off with reasoning style
people will either want details or the
general case
I specifically prefer the specifics and
not too general I'm more of that give me
the details and I'll see what it means
to me not a give me your general concept
and I'll figure out how it applies to me
if you want to find out what type of
person you're dealing with just ask what
do you prefer first the big picture or
the details under the category of
relationship style what I'm referring to
here is how you relate one thing to
another being that you would relate
what's different between the two things
or what's similar I prefer to sort the
differences when I attempt to understand
something new I love change variety and
newness I'm not a person that likes
regularity conservatism and security
those are people that like what is
similar you want to find out what
somebody is just ask them to tell me
what you think about these two things if
they start giving you a bunch of
differences or what's similar then you
know what type of person you're dealing
with I've talked a lot about
representational systems in the past
people are either strongly auditory
being that they remember what they heard
visual remember what they saw
kinesthetic which is jargon basically
means remember what something felt like
or remembering something like a texture
or on a different level of feeling what
an experience felt like in actually
performing a certain action or internal
auditory which means they basically talk
to themselves a lot I'm strongly visual
when remembering past events however I
make decisions by talking my way through
the decision you want to find out what
somebody has just asked them what lets
you know that you can believe something
feels right for you or do you believe
something because it sounds right makes
sense
looks right or feels right and again
makes sense would refer somebody who's
strongly internal auditory in regards to
information gathering people are either
in uptime or downtime I operate in an up
time state when talking with people in
that I analyze everything they're saying
verbally and non-verbally a person who
operates in down time would seem
unfocused because they're constantly
going inside of themselves to deduct how
the information they're hearing affects
their thoughts and feelings to find out
what somebody is ask them do people say
you are a good listener
or do you find you daydream a lot or you
could also go ask do you sometimes get
lost in your own thoughts during
conversations another information
gathering styles in regards to whether
somebody is a fact gatherer or if they
rely heavily on intuition I operate as a
fact gatherer when gathering information
I spend more time working with facts
rather than trusting my own intuition
you want to find out what somebody is
just ask them when evaluating something
do you want proof and evidence or would
you prefer to take a small amount of
information and think through the
applications on your own
or more simply you could just ask do you
make decisions based off of practical
facts or possibility or gut feelings in
regards to perceptual categories styles
you either have people who believe
there's definitely right and wrong
answers to every question or that the
world is made up of a multitude of great
answers when making decisions I operate
more as a black or white thinker I
believe that most questions have a
definite right or wrong answer great
thinkers believe that there can be many
possible right answers and that one
should think very carefully before
making a decision I want to emphasize
here that it between these different
styles there is no right and wrong
you're either one way or another and for
the most part one is not better than the
other to find out what somebody is ask
them do you find it easy to make quick
decisions or do you prefer to take your
time making the best decision possible
or you could ask do you think of the
world as black and white or a multitude
of Gray's then you have people who are
either optimists or pessimists I operate
as an optimist in that I am led most by
my focus on visions and dreams when
approaching a potential problem I think
about solutions ideas and suggestions a
pessimist would focus more on dangerous
threats or potential difficulties here
to again emphasize on the fact that
there is no right or wrong optimists who
are often thought of as being better
than pessimists often gloss over things
and make a lot of mistakes while
pessimists while they take a lot longer
to get things done they often get things
completely done meaning that there were
very few mistakes we want to find out
what somebody is asked when you are
presented with a problem do you first
consider worst-case scenarios or
best-case scenarios or do you spend more
time thinking about problems or
opportunities then you have whether
people prefer new options or prefer old
solutions I operate with a permeable
attitude in that I'm open to new ideas I
don't believe that just because
something works you shouldn't be open to
an idea that
might work better people who are
impermeable process ideas and beliefs
and stick with them in a way that they
don't welcome new information if you
want to find out what somebody is just
ask are you more attracted to new ideas
or ideas that have stood the test of
time people are also either focused or
unfocused I'm an unfocused person in
that I find it difficult to read or
screen out my surrounding environment
people that are naturally focused find
no problem screening out most any
environment when concentrating I believe
that this backs up my belief that I'm
more attuned with my auditory mode over
the others to find out what somebody is
simply asked do you find it easy to
concentrate in most any environment or
do you get distracted while reading in
some environments or to make it simple
do you find some places are too noisy to
concentrate it then you have the
philosophical direction meaning whether
somebody is a why did it happen or a how
did it happen type of person I'm more
interested in what I can do about a
problem I'm more interested in the how
then I am about the why it happened
again just ask when approaching a
problem will you first ask why it
occurred or jump in and respond to it or
you could also ask do you prefer to
think about why things happen or focus
on solving issues then you have the
people that believe the earth is fairly
constant or constantly changing I see
the world as pretty constant things
change but in the grand scheme of things
everything is pretty much the same non
Aristotle II and people see the world as
not being full of people and things but
instead see the world as actions those
actions for example being changes in
weather activities and so forth you
could ask somebody do you think the
world is pretty much the same or
changing dramatically day to day then
you have channel preferences being
either verbal or nonverbal I lay more
importance in how a person says
something than what they say this is
mainly because I've spent a great deal
of time studying body language people
that focus on the verbal channel trust
more what people say they believe body
language is not important to find out
just ask do you lay more importance in
what someone says or how do they say it
or you could also ask do you trust more
what a person says or their body
language I could go into a lot more in
regards the meta program but but again I
don't know if this is of interest to
people or not I get lots of questions
that sort of tell me you're interested
in meta programming but it's totally up
to you guys so leave comments below if
you want to
how we input process and output
information based on emotions how we
decide to vela preferences and focus
attention how we decide how to respond
through communication and work with
others what we value how we see
ourselves and the world till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
