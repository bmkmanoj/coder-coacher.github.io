part of my how to lay out a website
tutorial in the previous parts which I
have links to above we created this
which works really great as an opening
page but works absolutely horrible if
you want to actually show articles so in
this tutorial I'm going to create the
article part of our website what I'm
going to do is this is totally out of my
head 100% this time I have no guidance
at all what I know I want to do is I
want to replace these two columns here
with one big column and I'm going to put
articles inside of it I'm going to lay
out everything to the point that it
looks nice to me now I know right here
and on the left side of the screen if
you can't see this you can watch it
fullscreen hi-def what I'm going to do
is just get rid of these middle two
columns so I'm just going to select it
past the second middle container and the
whole way down where it says beginning
of right sidebar as you can see right
here on the screen I'm going to delete
all of it it's all gone so I have
beginning of middle bar I'm going to
change that to beginning of article so
now I got to create everything inside of
this guy so again I'm going to create
another div and I'm going to call this
give it class type is equal to content
column and then I need to close it off
of course and throw in a comment here so
that I know where it's been closed off
then I'm going to focus in here because
I really don't know how this is going to
adapt or look I'm going to create
content container this is going to hold
all the content for the article and I'm
going to close off that div and I'm
going to call minute
of course alright so I got those two
divs created so just remember content
column and content containers and I'm
going to scroll up to the CSS code and
start laying this guy out alright so I
put a column in in here beginning of
article styling and this is where I'm
going to start off styling this guy now
remember I said content column and it's
a class so there's a period in front of
it it's going to style this guy all
right so my width well I know from
previously looking at this guy here the
width of just one column is 260 so I'm
just gonna guess that my width for this
guy is going to be right around 540
pixels just a guess don't need to be
exact up front and of course I'm going
to float it to the left so that it butts
up next out of the column and for now
that's all I'm going to put inside of
there then we have content container and
for this guy we're going to borrow
heavily from the middle
container that was used before and just
move some things around change a couple
things where it makes sense to change
the background colors still going to be
white we're still going to have exactly
the same border margin I'm going to
leave it at 10 pixels see how it works
out I'm going to change this to 540
because that's what we did previously
height I'm going to let this be Auto
because I don't know how long the
article is going to be and padding I'm
going to take it up to 5 pixels just so
we have everything laid out real nice
inside of that and then just for now I'm
going to put a height for this guy
so I increased my height down here I'm
going to make this Auto of course but
I'm going to increase it just so I can
lay out everything here right on the
screen so everything looks nice and
tight alright so this is pretty much
lined up inside of here except for the
fact that the margin isn't good so I'm
going to have to put a margin inside of
there so I'm going to go into content
column and I'm going to say margin right
is equal to 15 pixels I'm lining
everything else up so that I have that
right don't have to worry quite so much
all right so that's moving that over so
that's a little bit better but you can
see the margin right on here is pretty
much exactly the same as that so what
that tells me as this guide actually
needs to get bigger and I would say it
needs to get bigger by about 20 pixels
so what I'm going to do is change this
to 560 and we'll see if we're right 560
file saved if that looks a little better
it looks pretty good but it actually
could go a little bit further so let's
change this to 570 and we'll change this
to 570 these are just two divs inside of
each other
reload and that looks just about perfect
okay so now we know this middle
container is great alright so we can
worry about the content that goes inside
of it so content container because it's
going to contain articles we want the
height to be Auto and ton 10th column
actually doesn't even need to have a
height so it's going to stretch as all
the content goes inside of it but we
know that we have this all pretty
tightly one together here so we'll
scroll back down till we get to
beginning of article and we're pretty
happy about the fact we have pretty much
everything lined up so now what we're
going to do is going to need to put in a
div that's going to have these little
purple title blocks in the upper right
hand corners just create another day of
class is equal to and we're going to
call this content title very much like
we have with everything else we're going
to put h4 tags inside of here no reason
to change it and we'll just put article
inside of there just to denote that it's
an article we'll close off the day of
because so short there's no reason to
put anything else inside of there then
what I want to do is I want to actually
put the article name and I'll put a
little bit more emphasis on it this time
so we're going to create another div and
it's going to be class is equal to and
I'm just going to call it content art
title and I'm going to bold it just so
it stands out and I'm just going to
stick with this whole Facebook marketing
those those bold tags and div it alright
so now we got that then what I'm going
to do because in the next part of the
tutorial I'm actually going to turn this
into a wordpress site thinking about
that create a div and the class type
here is going to be equal to I'm going
to call it content art date I'm actually
going to put a couple more things in
there than just the date but for now
this is going to stand because the dates
going to be the most important and I'm
going to bold it as well and then I'm
going to put something like posted by
admin September 22 2011 in Facebook
marketing what this is I'm thinking
about the fact that inside of WordPress
it's very often smart to put a category
that the articles stored inside of
course you can still do this sort of
stuff with a plain website so don't
think that you can't and I'm going to
put 18 comments which we're going to
pull dynamically from inside of
WordPress or just get rid of it if
you're doing a regular old website so
then we got all that well then I want to
put in horizontal rule as well and in
this situation I want my horizontal rule
to be longer so I'm going to create a
new horizontal rule I'm just gonna call
it content roll like that and a div and
then we have our actual content so I'm
gonna put I always do I always put the
content inside a paragraph tags why did
you have to put it in a div just the way
I do it and even though it's not an
excerpt I'm sort of just doing it that
way doesn't matter you can change the
names do whatever you want and then I
want to put an image inside of there and
I know I have an images folder whoever I
forget what the image name is oh it's
biz woman so let's just copy that and
it's a JPEG and this is 150 550 I know I
did check that all right so just put be
his woman dot JPEG and then close that
off so that's the location of the image
and I'm going to say alt is equal to and
I don't know I'm just going to put
featured image for now and I do know the
width is equal to 150 pixels because I
look and height is 100
I just think that looks nice class is
equal to a Content image so that I could
style that image then I need some lorem
ipsum to throw inside of there and I
always have that just sitting around
here looking awesome got it so I'm going
to jump over inside here I'm going to
paste some lorem ipsum inside of it and
just so that it's more like a regular
sort of guy meaning an article by kind
of guy I put a little break statements
inside here so it's just going to have
take up some space inside of this guy
all right so that's fine and then I'm
gonna close off my paragraph tag which
surrounds everything and that is pretty
much gonna do it I mean I just have to
style this of course but that's in
regards to the HTML that's all that
needs to be done so let's scroll up and
a long way we're gonna pretty much do a
lot of copy in here here's middle title
I know I'm going to borrow heavily from
that so let's just copy it right now and
we're here in the beginning of article
styling no I told this content title
down below this is the little guy in the
purple box here if you don't know this
guy right here is what we're going to be
putting inside of there stroll it over
here so we can see it right here on the
screen you can watch it being built its
pasted us inside of there okay so I know
I'm using pretty much exactly the same
sort of things now we're gonna have to
be moving things around a lot more the
width the height all that should be the
same it's going to be text aligned right
because it's going to be on the right
side of the bar padding right oh I'll
keep that at 7 pixels that should be
about right and then I got to position
it relative so this increased quite
dramatically let's change this to 350
pixels that means I want to move at 350
pixels from where it is and we'll leave
everything else the same just see what
it looks like
reload yep look at that all right see
just that little bit now obviously need
styling here but looking pretty tight
all right so I kind of like the way that
this has this a little bit of space it
makes it set out a little bit more than
the other ones I want to try and do that
with the same thing so let's move it
over just a little bit let's try let's
try 70 reload okay it's not quite there
let's take it to 575 that is really
tight I'm quite right though all right
let's take it seven reload that is
perfect okay so there's all the styling
I need to put that together now I need
to style these guys now remember I want
to put more emphasis on these guys so in
the name of this Facebook marketing
that's here on the screen is content art
title content art title that's the
Facebook marketing that you see right
there and will come in here I'm going to
actually
copy this font but I am going to change
it alright so I want to put more
emphasis on it so let's say I want to
take it up to I don't know 28 and I have
a little handy chart that I look at all
the time and it gives me line spacing
based off of pixels but either way all
right so I just know that it's going to
be right around that position and then
aside from that I want to put a little
bit more emphasis on this guy so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to put a
little bit of padding on the left and
let's say just more pixels just to make
it stand out if I'll save it reload it
alright now there's more emphasis on
that article that's looking tight and
now what we got to do is the content or
dates content art date having a good day
here and I kind of like the way that
looks of course we're going to have to
put some padding on the left and let's
make it 4 pixels because the other one
what worked really good however I want
to move it up a little bit so I am going
to position it relative to where it is
and I want to move it up say 10 pixels
see how that looks if we want to move it
up we put negative inside there and
let's see how it looks pretty tight
alright so that's all coming in line
there all right so now let's jump in
here and start looking at this image
that we have let's go content image and
let's say we want to float it left
reload okay so all of the text went up
there real nice and tight
we like that alright so would also want
to do a well and I'll put some padding
on the right so I don't want the text
right next to my image I'm looks
horrible so let's say 5 pixels oh and
all the code that I have here on the
screen is available underneath this
video and padding bottom let's say 5
pixels it looks good kind of like the
padding on the left let's say that I
want to change that and I could do short
CSS I didn't do that but whatever I just
want to put a little bit on there
padding left and padding top I don't
know let's just say 5 pixels just in
case this image was not up here so that
it would line up nice I'll say reload
now the image is laying in there a lot
nicer a little bit of padding it really
really really helped so what do we have
left now we need to put a horizontal
rule underneath of the date so let's go
horizontal content role and I'm going to
go find the other horizontal roll that
was used use it as a guide so there that
is
pretty much what we're going to be
changing with this guy not much
background color is going to stay the
same the heights going to be the same
the width is going to change margin
left's probably going to be the same and
I don't know what we're going to do in
regards to positioning it's all going to
depend upon how it goes on screen so I
know that the content of this guy is 570
pixels so that means this horizontal
rolls definitely have to get a lot
bigger let's say five hundred and sixty
pixels I'll say reload it alright so
yeah we definitely do not need to have
that the height is almost perfect let's
change it to two I'll save let's see
what it looks like if we just don't
position this at all so delete it I'll
say reload that's perfect
okay ah yeah I'd says that's perfectly
centered without any positioning okay so
I don't really have to do anything with
that so now we have our excerpt part we
just want to make sure that everything
that surrounds all this text and
everything that's here all looks real a
little nice down here and I called this
content excerpt probably should have
chosen a better name but hey you guys
want to see what it looks like when I do
something on the fly and it's a little
looks like and I'm actually gonna copy
this guy right here
copy back up inside of here paste that
inside of there I don't really know that
anything's gonna change I kind of really
like the way this looks this is a ticket
to ten for positioning it's really
amazing it all came together this easy
doesn't always happen this way um you
know what I don't need that I don't need
to position it all it looks so tight
file save reload all right everything's
centered so didn't expect it to be quite
so easy but that is how I created that
center part and if we zoom out of this
you can see that it looks really really
really really tight like I said next
time I'm going to convert this whole
entire thing into a WordPress theme it's
gonna look really tight real nice you
have any questions or comments leave
them down below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
