final HTML definitive tutorial all
that's left is forms if you missed the
previous two videos you definitely want
to watch them first you will be
completely lost now on to forms forms
where you allow people to interact with
your website send you information so for
that someone basically this is what an
opening form tag that looks like this
part tells the browser a form is a
common here you are telling the browser
that all of the information the person
enters should be sent to this
application for processing and you're
telling the browser that you want to use
the method of coasting rather than
getting I'll explain what that means
when you post you have to understand
what you are sending form and data the
variables are created which are names
that you will associate with whatever
information the user enters now if you
do not want that information to be seen
in the link to the web page then you
would use the posting method if however
you would like the information like here
you see email is a variable and there
would be an email address
probably by subject and the information
that a user entered was the word hi not
very exciting but either way if you type
get this information will be sent to the
browser and everybody will be able to
see all the variables and their
associated data and if you do not want
it to be included you would use post the
only reason people used it is whenever
they want to allow a person to favorite
or bookmark a link so you don't want
that use post and that's basically the
opening tag performs what we got here
you can see down here all the code
that we have up here create so what this
is it's just a simple text input area
how you create one of those is input
type and to put in text name email is
going to be the variable that you're
going to associate with whatever data
they put in and size tells the browser
how many characters length you want this
box debate break creates a new lon
I suppose you know what this means
because we've talked about this in
previous videos and here is another
input text box now let's move on to text
areas let's say you want to create a
very big giant box like this what you do
instead is create bracket text area and
then define how many columns long more
characters and how many rows deep this
is going to be the variable where that
information is stored and if you put any
text in between here and the closing
bracket for text area or closing tag it
would appear right down let's move them
here is another text input and here is a
password input if you type in a password
box you're gonna see dots instead of
your normal text like you would see here
now if I want to create a radio button
what I would do is enter input type
radio' and name is the variable I'm
going to store this value in if the
person chooses to select it difference
between a radio input box and a check
box is you can only check one radio
button at time you can check both
checkboxes and as you can see up here
love radio buttons that's where this
text comes from it doesn't pull this
text it goes
and that's radio buttons and also pretty
much checkboxes the only things gonna be
different
is you put a checkbox in here and and
here is your variable and here is the
data you would store in it
what we have here are two different ways
to create drop-down menu selection tools
on a browser close operate pretty much
the same way what you need to do is
flick select name selected foot tells us
a selection tool needs to be created and
then you put all of your different
options that you want made available on
they have to but you can put it pretty
much a major one it works out the same
way of course close it line break and
this is identical except you put option
input now if you want the information to
be sent you need to create a submit
button or a set button as I have here
all you do put input type submit' value
send this value is what is going to be
displayed on the button and when the
user clicks on that that information is
going to be sent to them what we're
gonna do here also is create a hidden
text frame and this will not be shown to
the user you would use this if you
wanted information to be passed and the
user would not be able to see it
submitted would be the variable name
true in this case would be the value so
what happens if we click send I jumped
over to mail dot PHP and here's all the
information I selected I set this up so
that I could jump back to the previous
page that's actually JavaScript sort on
cover enough today and that after you
end the form area is basically every
single thing you could ever want to know
about HTML
aside from cascading charms but
cascading style sheets about HTML we'll
cover that in future tutorial you go to
the website you can download or just
copy and paste all of the HTML - my
comments hope you enjoyed this tutorial
catch you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
