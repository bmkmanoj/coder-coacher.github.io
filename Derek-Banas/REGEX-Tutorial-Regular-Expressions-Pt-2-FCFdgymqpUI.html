2 of my regular expressions tutorial
where I will to true everything you want
to know about regular expressions and
really focus in on how to use regular
expressions with the programming
language called Python if you didn't
watch part 1 you have to because I'm
going to continue onwards and I'm not
going to review anything that I covered
in part 1 so definitely watch that
instead okay
well remember in the last tutorial how
we were searching through thousands of
pages of documents to find the name
Jennifer well if you did what I showed
you to do you almost definitely missed a
few of them that reason wise because
some Jennifer's refer to themselves as
Jen some refer to themselves as Jenny so
you're going to have to create a new
regular expression that covers or those
people who use a different name and how
we're going to do that is with the or
code that is inside of regular
expressions and if you wanted to search
a document for all Jennifer's or Jen's
or Jenny's and also receive their last
names and remember the B will match for
any space that precedes or follows a
whole word and this B will match for
when there is no space separating
characters just so you know we're going
to use the lowercase B in this situation
and surround this with quotes and then
if we're looking for the last name we
just use the backslash W meaning
character and the plus sign meaning one
or more characters followed by another
ending of that word and if you do this
this will return
Jennifer Jen or Jenny from any document
that you search within and I'm going to
get into coding here in just a minute
now you could be really funny about this
and actually get the same results by
doing this and I'm just going to show
you this say you wanted to search for
Jennifer or nny or n like this and then
you want to signal in on any word that
begins with je followed by one to six of
these characters that precede it so this
is me being funny but I'm going to show
you really the shortcut isn't really
going to get you anywhere and again I'm
using I have to
been exactly the same code again so this
would be kind of a catchy way of doing
what we did previously which again I'm
going to show you Jennifer or Jen or
Jenny backslash be looking for the last
name followed by another one you can see
that being kind of tricky with this and
I could actually be more tricky I could
actually cut out all the letters that
are used multiple times here and you can
see I saved myself a little bit of space
but this is why regular expressions get
really complicated because a lot of
people try to do tricky things like this
and do they work yes are they extremely
hard to understand for some people so
you can see it saves you a couple
characters but it's a lot more confusing
so I like to err on the side of being
understandable rather than being
confusing so that's how I why I do think
a lot of times I could do things a lot
shorter but I choose not to so just so
you're 100% certain this will match with
any of these words in text and that's
exactly what that regular expression
there does now do you see how I surround
this these three words that I'm
searching for with these braces well if
I wanted to actually perform this
specific search again later on in this
regular expression I could do so by just
going back slash one this would actually
call this is another thing confuses
people about regular expressions this
reference here backslash one would
actually redo this code as if it was
already there so to elaborate if I would
take this and put this there that is the
same as if I would go in here and redo
it again okay so and if I had
additionally if I had brackets the
reason why that's one is because that's
the first time I use these brackets now
let's say I also use those brackets
right here well I can pay reference to
that by going back /to so that's how
that little tool there works again it
shortens up your regular expressions and
a certain extent makes them really
really confusing but either way that is
another thing you can do with regular
expressions you can also reference the
beginning of a line of text with a
carrot
cymbal so let's say I wanted to find all
sentences that begin with the word cat
well I just simply put it in a caret
symbol like that followed by cat and
then backslash s because I want to
reference cat not cats or whatever so
and remember this reference is a space
in code and then if I wanted to be able
to capture the entire sentence that
begins with cat I would follow this up
with a series of characters and then a
dollar sign which signifies the end of a
sentence and probably to be safe because
of punctuation I want to use this
character meaning the period because it
will match everything except new lines
so basically any character so this is
exactly what you would do if you are
looking for sentences to begin with the
word cat so let's do some real code
though now if you want to use regular
expressions in Python you need to import
the re library and that is exactly how
you would do that now I have a file here
save hold random characters if I open it
up you'll see it right there
and I'm going to show you real quickly
here exactly how to access that so I'm
going to jump in here I'm going to
retrieve that all of the information in
that file dot txt if you don't know what
I'm doing here go back and watch my
Python tutorial it explains how to work
with files here I'm just creating a junk
string file that's it but I'm going to
store some information in here in second
and now I'm going to cycle through all
of the lines of text that are in this
file that I imported here and I'm going
to assign those lines of text to this
string that I created and then I can
print this to the strain finally jump up
here goink say it grabbed all the
information from this file name random
characters well now I'm going to use
regular expressions on this stuff I'm
going to create a new function called
Pat finder one meaning a reference to
pattern finder and inside of Python you
use the compile method to define the
regular expression that you
you want to search for in this case to
keep it simple I am going to look for a
literal line of text being this guy
right here so I'm looking for this in
this file and it's right there at the
very beginning and then I'm going to get
into a bunch of these different methods
that are available but then I'm going to
use the search method from inside of the
re library that we imported here to
search for the regular expression that I
defined above and all I'm doing is
referencing that regular expression here
and then I'm going to reference the
string that I created from that file and
then I can print to screen just like
this boink
this was from the original file and this
is the string of text that I was able to
locate that's what the group method does
for you and you can also use this
historic method these are a whole bunch
of different methods that are available
in this library and I can print all the
information out and you can see
basically what the group does is it
prints out the entire string that it was
able to find inside of this file and
start will tell you the index position
where that string first starts and
remember it would be 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so
on and so forth then n prints out the
index for the ending of that string so 0
1 2 3 4 and it always goes one ahead
from what you're searching and if you
span it prints out both the initial
index as well as the last index and if
we jump in here again show you the find
all
and with the find all function it's not
going to give me a whole lot but
basically in this circumstance is going
to create a way for me to iterate
through all of these little guys that I
was able to find in here boink and you
can see it was able to return not only
the first one remember I did find all
method because it's located right there
and it's also located right there so it
printed those out both of the locations
both of the patterns that matched my
regular expression that I define and I'm
basically going through all of the
methods that are available to you with
the re library here most of the useful
ones I'm not going through every single
one of them I can also split these guys
or I could substitute values that I find
within here so what I'm going to do is
put real text in the locations where the
regular expression matched as you can
see there and I'm going to print the
screen sub found and if I run this you
can see exactly that I created a list
right here with this split function what
it did was it located all of the
locations where the regular expression
matched so here that's what this blank
space is designating and then it's split
everything until it got to the point
where the regular expression matched
again and it's split the whole entire
document into these individual pieces
and then you can see using the
substitution I was able to import real
text where a a 1 B used to be at the
beginning of this string and at the end
of this string so that's a basic rundown
of how to manipulate regular expressions
inside a Python and a whole bunch of
other things about Python so hand
regular expressions if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below if anything's
confusing I will do whatever I can to
explain it and there will be more code
examples coming up till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
