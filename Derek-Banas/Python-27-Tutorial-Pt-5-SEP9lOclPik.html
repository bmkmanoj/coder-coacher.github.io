Python 2.5 through 2.7 tutorial where
I'll teach you how to program with
Python if you haven't checked out the
other tutorials you should definitely
watch those otherwise you will be very
confused in a previous tutorial I taught
you how to create lists and we're Bailey
going to go through looping in this part
of the tutorial but I'm going to explain
the in operator first because you can't
really understand how looping is
operating inside of Python without
understanding the in operator so let's
create a list and let's just give it
some numbers and we'll create a string
also okay now with the in operator I'm
actually going to be able to check
whether a value is in either the list or
the string and how I'm going to do that
is I'm going to print the screen the
answer here so we'll say is 4 in this
list right here if we execute this it
says true now let's change this to a
value that isn't in the list and you can
see it prints out false so that's what
in does and it also can work with
strings just check if the word string is
in string X and you can see that it
prints out true so that's what the N
operator does it searches through a list
or through a string or whatever to see
if that value exists in there now why
that is important is because of how the
for statement works which I'm going to
show you right after I show you how the
while loop works with a basic while loop
what you're basically doing with any
looping is saying you want certain
actions to be performed while certain
conditions are being met and remember
you have less than greater than less
than or equal to greater than or equal
to not equal to or equal to so those are
the different operators you can use and
you could use the and statement or the
or statement also within those
conditions like I talked about
previously and I talked about boolean
values with the while statement you're
going to create what you call an
iterator where this is going to be a
value that's going to continually change
as the looping procedures continue and
you just follow that with the word while
so let's say I want to execute certain
conditions as long as X is less than or
equal to 30
followed by a colon and again the
obligatory whites
bass that I went over in the previous
tutorial let's say I want to print that
to screen and then I want to increase
the value of x by one and this is
shorthand notation for how to do that I
could of course split x equals x plus
one but this is shorthand I just put a
plus sign followed by an equal sign so
that's what that guy does and if I
execute it you can see that it prints
that out to screen something else I
didn't show you previously with the
print function is if you want everything
to show up on just one line just put a
comma at the end of that and you can see
here now that it printed all the numbers
on one line so that's another thing you
can do with the print function and
that's basically what you do with the
while statement that's pretty much it so
understanding how the while statement
iterates through a bunch of different
statements as long as this condition is
met and of course you can put braces
around here to keep this neat but you
don't need to and you know how the in
statement or the N operator works I'll
now show you the often confusing for
statement so I'm going to create here a
list of customer numbers and then I'm
going to create a list of customer names
and basically what the for statement is
used for is for iterating through lists
or dictionaries and then I'll also store
their ages these are just random names I
just made up for I in list customer
number and you know what the end
operator does basically it's going to
continue to do whatever I tell it to do
in here as long as there are values
inside of here doesn't have to be any
specific item just that has to be some
item and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to print to screen I'm going
to store the value of I in here and if I
print that out you can see it prints the
screen Bob Smith it's 23 Alan Jones is
70 and mark summers is 45 so that
iterates through these lists that I
created up here and outputs custom data
based off of the value of I now I could
use the for statement ways very very
similar to how I used the while loop
like let's say I wanted to print a
screen digits 1 2 3 4 I'm going to
create a list again I'm going to show
you a shorthand way to do this here
right after I do this simple way then I
can go
for I in lists e^x : friend of high and
you can see it printed out 1 2 3 4 so
that works very similar to other
programming's for statements but
implements how you can use a while
statement in Python with a for statement
now let's say I wanted to print from 1
to 32 the screen let's put a comma in
here you already know what that thing
does if I wanted to do that I could
actually use what's called the range
function and this would allow me also to
print a range of different values
meaning from 1 to 30 it's not going to
print out 31 here on the screen and if I
run that you can see it printed all
those values out there for me then I
also could take the range function and
store it in a list by defining it
outside of the for loop which might keep
things a little bit neater sure you have
your braces in the right place now I can
call for I in list e^x : print I and put
a comment in there and you can see
there's another way that I would be able
to print those digits out to the screen
now let's say I want to do something a
little bit more complicated like for
example or only print out to the screen
odd numbers now you saw the previous
tutorial you know how to use the if
statement basically what I'm going to
say here is if a number is divisible by
2 I want to use the continue statement
and what the continue statement does is
it jumps out of this if conditional back
to the for statement and continues on
where it left off which means it's going
to skip the else statement which is
going to be right here and it is not
going to execute it so let's execute
that and you can see here it print it
out only the odd numbers well let's say
that we don't want anything past the
number of 25 to show up now of course
you come up here and change this but I
want to demonstrate the break statement
and how I'm going to do that is with an
a lift statement let's say if it does
hit 25 I want to break completely out of
this for loop and not continue executing
and we run that you can see that
whenever it hit the 25 it jumped out of
the for statement so the continue
statement jumps you out of the current
iteration but continues running and
looping through the fourth statement and
the break statement if it is hit jumps
you completely out of the force
Ament all2gethr so there's a bunch of
different ways to loop and how to use
the anti operator if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below and don't worry we
will get much more complicated very soon
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
