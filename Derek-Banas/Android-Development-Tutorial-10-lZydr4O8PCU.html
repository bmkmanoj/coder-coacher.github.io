10 of my android development tutorial
today and in the next couple of
tutorials I'm going to show you how to
make an address app using Android and
SQLite and you're going to be able to
add contacts and delete contacts and
edit contacts and I'm also going to show
you how to create the whole SQLite
database using code inside of Android so
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so here I am inside of Eclipse and
I need to come over here of course and
I'm gonna have to create myself a new
project so I'm gonna go new Android
application project and I'm going to
call this address book app pretty simple
and I'm gonna change this to my web
address to avoid any conflicts of course
you could put your name in there if you
don't have one of those and I'm gonna
leave everything else here exactly the
same I'm down here hit next and then I'm
gonna leave all of these different
things also exactly the same as they are
and on the next screen I'm gonna leave
the logo exactly the way it is and next
and I'm going to leave blank activity
exactly the way that it is and then hit
finish and there you can see address
book app has been created and you're
going to see all the folders that we
were used to seeing inside of here and
the very first thing I'm going to do is
come down here there you can see layout
I'm going to get to that in a second but
first I'm going to come down into values
and the very first thing I'm going to
open is the dimensions dot XML file and
also the strings dot XML file and of
course whenever it opens up it looks
like this I'm going to go into
dimensions dot XML first and come down
here and hit dimensions XML so we can
actually play with this and I'm going to
come in here and just start I'm
basically just going to add one
dimension inside of here and it is just
going to be defined as padding
underscore 5dp and this is just going to
be a type of padding let me use all of
the time and that's all I'm going to do
with the dimensions file and now I'm
going to go into strings.xml again we're
going to come down here into strings.xml
at the bottom hit that tab then we have
to think about some things that we're
going to need inside of an application
it's going to have contacts so I can get
rid of hello
that's gone if you want any of the code
that's in this video there's a link in
the description
all right so app name I'm going to come
in here and I'm going to call this
contact list instead I'm going to leave
settings exactly the way it is and I'm
just going to copy a whole bunch of
these different things here and we're
going to define all of the different
strings we're going to use in our
interface so that we'll be able to use
them both for translation and also this
allows us to really be able to come in
here and make some easy changes now what
did I say I said we're going to be able
to add a contact so I'm going to need
something that says add contact on it as
a title another thing women need is
first name cuz they're gonna be able to
enter their first name and I'm just
gonna put first name inside of here and
I'm taking it a little bit slow because
some people asked me to do a little bit
slower tutorial than what I normally do
just to make sure all this stuff's
ingrained last name and again this is
are going to be used on the interface
here in second I'm also going to need
phone number and here in type phone
number also going to need email address
and home address and all this
information is going to be stored inside
of the database and for this I'm just
gonna put address just plain and simple
okay some other things I'm gonna need
well if I want to be able to list my
contacts out on the screen I'm going to
need a title for that and I'm going to
call this contacts title and come in
here and just type in contacts another
thing if I want to be able to add a
contact well I'm gonna need some sort of
button that I'm going to click on or the
users gonna click on when they want to
add a contact so I'm just going to call
this the Add button and I'm gonna put ad
in uppercase letters and I'm also I know
I'm gonna need to save the contacts so
I'm just gonna call this save data and
here I'm just going to type in save and
some of these things might change I'm
going to try to keep this nice and loose
so that you really get a feel for how
all this stuff's being put together so
you'll be able to do it right out of
your head another thing they're going to
be able to come in here and edit
contacts so I'm going to call this edit
contact title and I'm going to put
edit contact and then also if they're
going to be able to do all those
different things they're probably going
to need a button that is going to be
clicked on to edit the contact I'm just
going to call that edit and finally I'm
going to also allow them to delete
contacts so I'm going to call this
delete button and then just put delete
and for now that is enough information
I'm going to save that again we're in
strings.xml and that is in the values
folder over inside of this guy here
inside of the resources folder alright
so we got that out of the way but I'm
gonna keep strings open because I think
I'm gonna need it
well now we're gonna get into activity
main and you can see it's throwing some
errors but that's okay
let's get rid of that well we definitely
want to get rid of hello world that's
gone that's the reason why I was
throwing an error anyway and we
definitely don't want to print that now
for this guy I'm going to use a table
layout so I'm going to type in table
layout there instead of relative which
is what it was previously and the reason
I'm using table outs us I think for
beginners they're a lot easier to use
and I'm going to leave a lot of this
exactly the same except I'm going to
come here and get rid all this padding
nonsense and whenever you're going to be
using a table layout you're going to be
creating a whole bunch of table rows so
I could do it in a couple different ways
I could actually create it out here come
down click on graphical layout and there
you can see that it opened up for me and
then come down here where it says
layouts and open that up and then you're
going to see table row is going to be an
option for that and I'm just going to
grab that guy and drag them over here
and drop them inside of the table layout
and let's make sure an activity main it
actually went in there yes you can see
table rows right here now I could have
typed all this out but that would have
taken a lifetime and normally when I
define these table rows I don't really
worry about giving them a distinct name
because I never go in and actually
change any of that stuff but I almost
always come in here and change this to
match parent that way it opens up and
looks nicer on more and more different
devices
well then inside of this I'm going to
actually create some text views so I'm
going to jump back over into the
graphical layout again Here I am again
and I'm going to come up into text
fields or actually form widgets and then
I'm going to come over here you can see
text view and on if you can see that or
not I'm going to drag it again and drop
it inside of there and there we go
off of that I'm going to put in a button
that whenever it's clicked is going to
allow them to add a new contact to this
guy so I'm just gonna grab button right
here and drag it over and drop it inside
of there so there we go
it's kind of a mess right now but I'm
going to fix it so I'm going to go back
down into activity main.xml
and you can see all this stuff all over
the place well I'm going to come into
text view and this guy's going to do
quite a bit of different things this is
going to be the title that's crossed the
top of the screen so I'm going to call
this contacts title text view give it a
nice descriptive name so I know exactly
what it is whenever I look at it I'm
going to leave these both as rap content
that works perfectly because I have my
table row that's handling matching the
parent making ensure that everything
fits inside of it but I'd also like to
be able to come in here and put some
text inside of it jump out into the
graphical layout again and I'm actually
going to do a couple other different
things like for example you can see that
this is budding up next to this so I
want to add some padding to it so what
I'm going to do is go in here and look
for margin left over here on the right
side of the screen and you're actually
going to be able to find that by going
into layout right here and clicking on
this and then coming in to margins and
clicking on that and there you can see
and margin left I'm going to click on
this and I'm going to switch this over
to the padding 5dp just it's a little
bit sloppy but whatever it works and
there you can see now it looks perfectly
fine next thing we want to do is
actually put in a title for this guy and
to do that and collapse all this stuff
and you can see right here text textview
I'm going to come in click on that and
then all this stuff is going to open up
inside of here and the thing that I'm
going to want to use is contacts title
which I already created and there you
can see contact shows up in there real
nice now the one thing I don't really
like about this is it's you know you
can't really see it the buttons as big
as that it just looks like a mess so
what I'm going to do with contacts is
I'm going to actually come in here jump
down into activity main and I do this a
lot where I open things up and close
them over and over again and I'm going
to come into text view which is where I
have that title and then I'm going to
change the text appearance so to do that
I'm going to go Android text appearance
is equal to now I'm going to put in
quotes and a question mark and you can
see that Android
attribute pops up here I'm going to
click on that and then I'm going to type
in text appearance large and that's
going to enlarge that for me and then on
top of that I'm also going to come in
and make sure that my text color and I'm
just going to do it inside here because
this is something that I remember and
then just type in text color is equal to
quotes hash sign FFF which is going to
represent white and then on top of that
I'm also going to come in and make sure
that this guy stretches to fill as much
of the screen as possible and to do that
I'm going to go lay out weight is equal
to 1 now the only problem is is the
button isn't fitting in there and it's
actually jumping down to the next row so
how exactly you fix that well there's a
couple other things I want to do as well
I'd like to change my background and of
course you can do this on the other
screen it's just if you remember
background why not just type it in which
is what I find myself doing a lot and
then inside of here I'm going to just
use like a gray so just a whole bunch of
fours then on top of that I'm going to
want this button to trigger a function
or a method to be called whenever it's
clicked rather than putting that all
inside of my code like I have done
previously and to do that you're going
to go on click just like that and then
you're going to reference a method that
is going to be called when this button
is clicked and I'm just going to put
show add contact inside of there and
I'll create that later on and for layout
width and height I'm actually just going
to come in here and delete all this all
together don't need those
and then for text I'm going to change
that to one of the guys that I had
previously defined and then I'm also
going to just save myself some time copy
the text color from this base that in
there and then let's jump over into
graphical layout see what we got and now
you can see the button fits right inside
of that so I'm going to select my button
and come over here in my text area click
on this where it says button and then
I'm going to come inside out of here and
I must look specifically for add button
you're going to say that change to an
add I'm also going to bounce over here
to activity main.xml come down into the
button area and I'm going to change the
text size on this guy just go Android
text size is equal to 20 SP and that's
going to allow it to change and grow as
the screen size grows on it and actually
I want to go in here and actually move
this pad
down out of this guy and put it inside a
text view I think it feels better there
put that right after wrap content and
I'm also going to copy and paste this
guy right here jump up here inside a
table row and change the background
color to this whole entire thing to
black one two three and file save and
there you can see contacts and add have
been added to our table layout so now
what I'd like to do is to be able to
list all these contacts out on the
screen and this time what I'm going to
show you how to do is how to create what
is called a list view and then what
we're going to do is populate that list
view later on with all of the contact
entries that we have in our database now
to create that of course we're going to
come into layouts again click on that
and open that up then we're going to go
into table row and I'm just going to
grab that table row again drop it inside
of there and then come down into
activity main again just to make sure
that everything's sorted out and there
you can see table row is again and I'm
going to change this to match parent so
that it stretches across the whole
entire screen and we'll leave everything
else exactly the same jump back into the
graphical layout and then I'm going to
come down here to where it says
composite click on that I'm up here and
then you are going to see list view and
I'm going to drag list view over inside
of that table row and drop it inside of
there and you can see it populates with
some garbage sort of content I'll save
that bounce back into activity main come
down inside of here make sure everything
lines up beautifully I'm just gonna
change this to list just get rid of that
match parent wrap content all look fine
to me except I want it to stretch the
whole way across the screen and anytime
I want to do that I'm going to go and
set the layout weight to one right like
that so now it's going to stretch cross
screen if we file save you're going to
see see fills the whole entire screen
blue dot blue dot before the ListView is
kind of constrained come back inside
again and that is basically all that we
need to do with that guy so there we go
we have our activity main.xml file setup
we have a whole bunch of string setup
and some dimensions as well the next
thing I'm going to do is come over here
inside of layout and create another
activity now this activity is actually
going to be all of the entries that are
going to go in the ListView so new
and I'm going to come down inside here
see if I have a Android XML file yes I
do click on that and there it is and I'm
going to call this guy contact
underscore entry and this guy is
actually going to be a table row so I'm
going to scroll through here until I see
table row and select that click on next
don't worry about any of this and click
on finish and there we go we have this
brand new contact entry XML file and
like I said all of these guys are going
to be inserted into our ListView so we
come in here and see what we need to
change table row that's all fun that's
all fun with I want this to be fill
parent to make sure that it fills the
ListView whenever we put it inside of
their height I actually want this to be
wrapped content
got that stuff and then inside of it
what I'm going to put are all of the
text views that are going to contain
information that I pull from my database
so I'm actually in the graphical layout
and I'm going to come in here again
there's text view we're gonna drag it
down drop it inside of there and then
we're also gonna grab another text view
and throw that inside of there what this
is going to be whenever it's all done
it's just a list of your contact names
but for now I'm just gonna leave it that
way
now let's say that I wanted to go and
put some information here on our screen
like the contacts ID but I didn't want
it to show well first what we're going
to do is get the busywork out of the way
and that's going to be a fill parent and
wrap contents perfectly fine and then
whenever we come down here to the text
area well it's not going to show on the
screen so we don't even want that there
instead what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make the visibility equal to
gone and that way it won't show on the
screen but that information will still
be there so that's one way to put some
information there without having it
actually display on the screen I do
however want my contacts name to show up
on the screen so I'll be able to sort
through and find the right contact so
for ID here I'm actually going to change
this into contact name layout width
again I'm going to change this to fill
parent and then wrap content is going to
be perfectly fine and if I want to come
in here and change my path
again that I'm actually going to do over
in the graphical layout and you can see
there's only one textview here now we
click on that textview we can come over
here and look for our padding and
there's padding right there come over
there click on it and let's just change
this to padding 5dp just like before
so that moved it in off the left side
screen a little bit also come in here
and let's say I wanted to change my text
color well there's the text color option
but I'm actually going to come over into
contact entry and just change it inside
of here because I don't want to have to
define the color for it this time
and we did this before Android text
color is equal to our Sun and make that
the gray like I had before text size and
some in here what the heck you might as
well change that as well I'm going to
change this to Android text size is
equal to and I'm going to change this to
20 SP as well and then if I also want to
come in here and define my text style
and make it bold so that the contact
show up a little bit better just change
that the bold and that actually isn't
going to show anything at this time
because I don't have any content there
and I'm actually going to get rid of
text view altogether so that nothing
shows up inside of there because like I
said before contact entry is going to
contain all of the contact entries that
are gonna go into the activity main
ListView that you see right there and
that's all I'm gonna cover in this part
tutorial I just want to keep this very
easy and understandable please leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
