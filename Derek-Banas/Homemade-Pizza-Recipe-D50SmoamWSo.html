there everybody knew how to make
homemade pizza right in their own oven
with nothing but a spoon and a ball in
an oven after this tutorial you'll know
as well the first thing you need to do
is get one and three fourths cup of warm
water just warm to the touch then you're
gonna have to get yourself not one but
two teaspoons of active dry yeast for
bread machines then you're gonna get
yourself a teaspoon of sugar and then
you're gonna stir this up and then once
everything seems to be stirred together
you know let this sit and it's gonna get
a little bit frothy then you're gonna
want to get three cups of unbleached
bread flour and I prefer King Arthur's
flour but really when it comes down to
it doesn't matter all that month and
then you can call this a secret if you
want I use soft as silk cake flour no
I'm not paid by any of these people and
I throw a cup of that in so it's a total
of four cups of flour that we have right
here to that I'm going to throw in about
2 tablespoons of nonfat dry milk and
then I'm gonna throw in about a
tablespoon of margarine and if we check
on our yeast you can see it's starting
to get frothy in there and we gotta dump
that in there try to get consistently
over everything that's in the ball and
then i'm gonna use this guy right here
for stirring and i'm just gonna stir
this all together no bread machine no
nothing this time it's all gonna be a
hundred percent am-8 something obviously
gonna have to cook in the oven you can
just see as I'm stirring this together
it's going together real nicely here and
I'd like to have a real nice wet dough
good rate of pizza it was all dry
guarantee of the reason why is they got
irritated with their dough or they got
lazy with making it and they just kept
adding more and more flour that tries it
out there you go looks like it's a
pretty good consistency now here's a
secret you want to get yourself prepared
so that your dough doesn't stick to your
hands get yourself some flour on your
hands and heat them up and you want them
to basically be about the same
temperature as that though remember we
put hot water in there so if we want
this to not stick it's one way to do
just that I'm just gonna put a little
bit of flour here can't keep my hands up
real nice I'm gonna flop this dub
directly inside of there hey I need to
start kneading it hands nice and warm
you can see my hands aren't sticking a
little secret
this dough is what but because my hands
are a nice temperature and they have
flour on them the dough isn't sticky you
can see what I'm doing here basically
pressing down inside and roll me some
people press forward and roll it you can
roll it however you want the whole goal
here is to just keep it rolling and
consistent not adding tons and tons of
flour if it ever does start stick hands
nice and warm with some flour and go
back to my basically been rolling it
here for about two minutes adding maybe
one tablespoon of total additional flour
to my hands and the dough is just about
perfect it's not sticking that much but
it has a little bit of tackiness to it
which is what I want remember I don't
want this to be all dried out perfect
then I'm gonna give myself a little bit
of olive oil dump that in there take my
flower throw it on top the olive oil and
mix it around until its covered on all
sides then you get yourself to town run
it through some hot water wring it out
put it over top the dough to let it sit
for about four or five hours as long as
you can but i'd say at least four hours
that I've got a big pan on high from a
sauce so throw in like that's about a
tablespoon of olive oil give her own
favorite tomato sauce recipe by all
means use that instead that I went and
minced myself some garlic throw that on
there that's about 2 tablespoons stir
that up it's looking good then I got
myself two cups of skinned and diced
tomatoes with the seeds removed and most
of the juice throw that inner let them
get acquainted with each other stir a
little bit remember I got the oven on
high but I have another cup of tomatoes
again just like this except i blended
them I'm just throwing that in there is
a little bit of a thickener you don't
want to do that don't cook got a
tablespoon of dry regular nothing wrong
with the dry stuff then I got myself a
tablespoon of pesto what's pesto pesto
is basil parmesan cheese and olive oil
that's all I just think it gives a real
fresh taste of this sauce and then I'm
gonna mash it make sure you make your
tomato sauce well before you plan on
putting this on top of a pizza why
because if you put it on a dough and
it's hot it's going to just make the
dough all soggy and nasty so you
definitely want to refrigerate this I'm
gonna let this cook down for about two
minutes stirring it occasionally has
needed okay there you go two minutes
exactly I got my sauce here I'm gonna
dump it back into my bowl
a reason to make more dishes than you
need yes that's heating pull that off of
there I'm going to throw in the
refrigerator ok so the dough's been
rising for four hours and I have my oven
heated up to 550 degrees I'm gonna get
myself some mozzarella cheese now cut it
up real nice I want to have everything
prepared before I try to cut everything
up on mess around that are extremely hot
oven and dough that could potentially
fall apart and all kinds other different
problems so there we go and that should
be more than enough cheese for two
pizzas and give himself some Parmesan
cheese and shred all right there got
parmesan that looks like that's going to
be more than a parmesan for two pizzas I
personally prefer smoked mozzarella over
pretty much anything else but I don't
have that today so na dena I'm gonna get
himself some jalapeno is this is about
the only thing I'm gonna do with this
it's a little bit weird and this is what
the dog is gonna look like after
approximately four hours I'm just gonna
cut this in half out of their work with
one at a time of course take a little
bit flowers throw it down it this is
gonna wipe this up man make sure it
doesn't stick I'm gonna roll it out and
a lot of people who really gets rolling
out I see no problem though doing that
let me put down our dough here we'll
roll it 1 x far as possible then I'm
gonna do a 45 degrees sort of like turn
here too it's another sort of secret
then I'm going to turn it this way there
you go just about a perfect circle and
getting a pizza peel i'm going to show
you the secret to be able to make the
pizza you could actually overload this
pizza doing what I'm gonna do next more
ingredients than you could ever imagine
got my pizza peel nothing fancy pick
this up for next enough to drag this on
there no semolina flour none of that
nonsense some of this thing be real nice
light and airy and as you can see just
rolls real nice on there it's not gonna
be all dried out like most pcs you get
ever gonna and I'm gonna go in here my
450 degree oven right there I got myself
a little stone cell nice knees that
rolls off there and no I meant to not
put any toppings on alright pizzas been
in here for exactly three minutes and
don't worry about all the big bubbles
make sure you close your oven again now
you can conveniently take as long as you
want to put as many toppings as you want
on top of this be
britta that I just drop them on air this
is real nice remember the sauce is cold
it's not gonna seep through and make
this nasty take some mozzarella throw
that around take some parmesan throw
that around and then I'm gonna take
somehow panies heat it up a little bit
weak I said because you cook dinner for
three minutes you should have no problem
and then you open your open up again to
throw it in there for an additional
eight minutes and to make this extra
good i'm gonna take two tablespoons of
butter yeah I'm gonna take I like garlic
I you don't see really any point Tony
how much to put in are you the lover you
don't that's about a teaspoon of garlic
that I just dumped it or garlic powder
that is again garlic powder definitely
works a lot better than like minced
garlic and that's some oregano dried
oregano I'm gonna bounce that guy in the
microwave for about 30 seconds alright
our time is up and my piece was looking
awesome wrote down on a cutting board
and slather the dough with your butter
and your garlic and you go next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
