you how to layout a website this is the
most common skill that I see you guys
asking for and today over the next
series of videos I'm going to show you
how to create a pretty complicated
layout I did this in cooperation with
somebody else that had wanted it a
website a layout and this was my first
concept and this is extremely
complicated as you can see here but I
created this all inside illustrator and
all it is is boxes and lines and text
and all these other different things now
of course if you can't afford
illustrator you should definitely check
out
Inkscape that Inkscape org it's free and
it is very very very similar to
illustrator and you could definitely
create anything I'm showing you here
inside of Inkscape I started off with
this basic design you see here on the
left side screen and after a bunch of
different changes we ended up coming to
this final design that you see here and
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how to create all of this from scratch I
haven't done any of the HTML or anything
from it so this is all going to come
straight from my head basically the only
things I've done ahead of time is I've
taken this one picture here this picture
this picture of this picture and this
logo up here and I save them in a folder
right like that and then I added this
one little image right here and then I'm
going to show you how to take just these
couple images here and create everything
else that you see on the screen totally
totally totally from scratch now the
first thing I'm going to want to do is I
used a font here that isn't very common
and let's just blow it up here on the
screen so it's a little bit bigger
alright so I'm using this font right
here and just to check out what that
phone is it's open sans so if I want to
be able to use a font that's a little
bit nicer than normal what I do is I go
to Google web fonts and let's just put
our little image here on the left side
of the screen and then here what I'm
gonna do is I know this is a sans serif
font so I'm gonna get rid of serif as an
option and I'm gonna get rid of
handwriting as an option and then hit OK
and this is just a google.com forward
slash web fonts and then what I'm going
to do is I'm just cycle through all
these different images that are here on
my screen all these different fonts
until I find one that I like once I find
one that is very similar to what I have
here on the screen actually it's going
to be even cooler and nicer the one I
have
on the screen I come to Petey Sam's
narrow now if I want to be able to use
this font on my website I'm just going
to come over here to quick use and click
on that and I'm going to come down here
to where this link is I'm going to
select it and copy it and then I can
exit out of illustrator because I don't
need that anymore and then I'm going to
jump into my basic text editor this is
where I'm going to be building the
entire layout that I just showed you on
the screen and I just have all this text
so there's a link to all of this
underneath of this video you can get
ahold of all this text but this is the
standard way that I always start a
website so there's no reason to type it
all out I just copy and paste it myself
so you should do likewise I'm also going
to have all of the styling for the style
sheet inside of this one thing I'm of
course going to change that later on but
I'm doing this just so I can show you
everything on the screen all at one time
now I'm going to take that piece of code
that I just grabbed from Google web
fonts and I'm going to paste it inside
of here right like that so now I'm going
to be able to use that font anywhere I
want inside of my web page and over here
on the right side you're going to see
everything developed and then I have the
actual web page I'm going to be trying
to create over here and stick it over
here for now and what I do is I have all
those images and everything saved so
what I basically have to do is just
create a whole bunch of boxes and then
put all the images and all the different
things that I want into the proper box
that's it that's what website design is
so down inside of body and I'm going to
give myself space here jump down inside
here and I know that I want a giant box
to go around everything here on the
screen when I use boxes I normally use
what's called a div which is just a box
it's all it is I'm going to create div
and I'm going to give it an ID because
there's only going to be one page
wrapper that's going to go around the
whole entire content of the entire web
page so whenever you're only going to
use something once you give it an ID
whenever you're going to use something
multiple times you're going to use a
class okay we'll get more into that so
don't worry about it if that's a no all
confusing now whenever we create a div
or a box we have to close the box to
keep everything inside of it so there is
your page wrapper and that's just what
goes around every single thing that's on
the page now I'm going to indent and
over here on the left side of the screen
you can see we have what is called a
header that's this part up here so what
I got to do is I got to create a box for
that
so what am I going to do I'm going to
create another div and there's only
going to be one header so I call it an
ID and I named it header right like that
and then every time I create a new div I
of course close it off and another thing
that's really good to do is to put a
little notation here so that you know
whenever the div closes which div it is
so I'm going to say end of page wrapper
and that's how you make a comment inside
of HTML and I could also copy this and
put it at the end of this guy and of it
will just say header all right so now I
know where all my divs close okay so now
what do I got to do it well I have an
image here and I have a slogan here and
I have a little search box so I got to
create all of those things first well
I'm gonna first put this image in here
this logo so I'm going to say image
source is equal to and I'm going to say
where it is located it's okay to Dinn
the images folder and it's called logo -
it's a ping file all I got to do there
I'm going to give it all text and I'm
going to call it social voice logo right
like that and then I'm going to find
that I want it to have a width equal to
and I figured this out inside of
Illustrator by measuring everything out
but I don't measure everything exactly I
just pretty much just jump in here and
start creating things so this was the
basic size for this logo so I'm just
sticking to the sizes that I have and
I'm going to give it an ID because
there's only going to be one logo and
it's going to be called a logo and then
I'm going to close off the image tag
with a forward slash and this is all
HTML strict as you can see here and it's
going to validate as HTML strict
whenever I'm done with everything if you
don't know what that means don't worry
about it well what's another thing that
is very common on a webpage well there's
a title in this situation we don't have
a title I don't like that fact but
either way in the future we may add a
title so I'm going to create a blog
title and I'm eventually going to turn
us into a wordpress theme also but I'm
going to create a basic website
beforehand so I'm going to give it an h1
tag because it's going to be the biggest
screen thing on the screen I'm going to
call it blog title but if I wanted
something to be here that's where it
would go but in this situation I don't
have it I don't need it but I'm still
going to create it because eventually I
think I might use it then I need a slow
again so I'm going to create a paragraph
ID is equal to blog slogan right like
that and then I just type in my slogan
your source for mobile social yeah
marketing so there's my slogan that's
what's up here in the right side of the
screen if you can't see this view it in
full-screen HD it's an HD movie alright
then I want to put a search box inside
of here now this is actually just going
to be a placeholder for now but either
way I want to create it just so I have
everything laid out so I'm going to
create another div and because there's
only going to be one search box I'm
gonna give it an ID search and I'm going
to go box like that and then if I want
to put a text box inside of here I'm
going to go input type is equal to text
and let's say name is equal to let's
just say search and size is equal to 25
pixels then one close off that input box
and input and I'm going to say tight is
equal to and it's going to be a submit
button it's going to send in for the
search and value is equal to search
which is supposed to be in all uppercase
letters then I close that off and then
whenever I'm done with that I close off
my day of saying if div div paragraph
tag everything's closed off and
everything's in a nice little block and
the header section is all set up to be
working here and just keep this in your
mind as how that is all set up and now
I'm going to show you how to build
everything here right on the screen
using style sheets so jump up here into
the Style section and I know this isn't
good form to do everything on one page
but I'm doing it this way so you guys
can learn now the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to define anything
I'm going to do with page wrapper
because that wraps the whole entire
website and this is how you do this in
cascading style sheets because it is an
ID I'm going to put a hash symbol in
front of it if it's a class it's going
to be a period but it's not so it's a
hash symbol just through watching this
and you'll eventually digest it and
really understand it well I wanted to
find the font that I want to use on the
whole entire webpage so I'm thinking
it's going to be 14 pixels by 1.4 that's
line height distance between the
characters and then I want to say PT
sans narrow and why am I saying that
because that's the name of it PT sans
narrow that was defined by Google that's
its name but since there's spaces
inside of here I got to put it inside of
quotes and then sans-serif is going to
be the default that every single browser
has and then I'm going to say that I
want this to have a width equal to 1000
pixels that is how you do that that's
going to be the width the entire web
page and I'm going to say that I want my
background color to be equal to white so
that's defined now if I want everything
to be centered on the screen all I have
to do is say margin left colon is going
to be auto in essence that's telling it
to be in the center if margin right is
equal to Auto also and there you go
that's all I'm going to define for the
whole entire webpage at this point in
time so now I'm going to jump into the
header section and let's say that I want
to make the header again close these
curly brackets and I want it to have a
height that is equal to 127 pixels
because that's what illustrator told me
it should be and I'm going to make the
width equal to 1000 pixels because
that's my page wrapper and I want
everything to fit well the next thing I
need to do is place my logo as you can
see right here I'm going to use this as
a guide this is just a JPEG of this
whole entire thing now remember there's
only one logo and I have to try to make
it fit where it should fit so I'm going
to say that I want to position it
relative to where it is right now
now let's just look and see where it is
right now so if we jump over here and
you can see that everything is right
here in not the proper order so what
I've got to do is move these things
around so again let's jump into logo now
I want to position it I'm telling it I
want to tell it where to go and I want
to position it relative to where it is
currently well I don't really hate where
it is currently so I'm not going to have
to change that many things let's say I
want to indent it 15 pixels just for the
heck of it file save it reload and it
moved just a little bit so I indented it
a little bit from the outside of the
page that's all I did right there now
the other thing is going to be a little
bit more difficult because now I'm going
to change the blog slogan and I got to
position it in the upper right hand
corner in a way that's going to look
nice so what I'm going to do I'm going
to say position because I want to
position it relative to where it
is currently and I have no idea what
this is going to be but I do know it's
going to have a width of 240 pixels
cause I measured that inside of
Illustrator and then I need to define
both its position from the left side of
the screen from here I'm going to
position it and then also I need to know
how I want to position it from the top
of the screen I have to define those two
things right here on the screen so let's
shrink this down so I can fit it on the
page and let's say from the left I want
to put it in there
I don't know 800 pixels so this is just
me guessing and this is how I design web
pages and just guess a lot and then
let's say I want to take it a hundred
pixels from the top so let's see what
that looks like so you could see that
it's off its down too much and it's not
looking too good here let's jump over
here and let's try to fix that up so
let's go blog slogan and left let's say
700 and then from the top let's say 120
I don't know I'll save it up okay so
it's looking a little bit better here
it's kind of lined up nicely with this
guy and I'm putting negative 20 in here
remember because I was trying to move it
upwards if you want to move something
upwards relative to where it was
you have to use negative numbers gonna
move something downwards you have to use
or to the right you have to use positive
numbers okay so from the top it's not
looking too bad I just want to nudge it
up just a little bit more so if I'll
save and it's looking pretty good right
around there let's maybe even 24 idle
and another thing that sort of helps
sometimes is if I go page wrapper and
just temporarily put in a border so that
I know where that's at
and I'm gonna say five pixels solid and
then black as my border for my page
wrapper file save reload it and then you
can start to see where all this stuff is
splitting itself together alright so
this is kind of making me think I'd like
to move this farther to the right but of
course internet explorer is such a
broken piece of garbage that if I move
this too far to the right it's going to
clip it off even though it should fit
Internet Explorer doesn't know how to
work so I'm going to have to leave some
space here let's just say for now that
I'm going to increase this to 715 and
see how we work out
all right so leave it in that general
vicinity well what do I have now well I
have my search box down here so I have
to define what that's going to look like
I just type in search box and what I'm
going to try to do here is I'm going to
move this guy up into here
I want to position it again relative and
from the left side of the screen let's
say I look at what 700 looks like and
then from the top of the screen it's
basically I want to put it up here so
that looks like that's right around 100
pixels and I do know the width because I
checked that inside of illustrator and I
think it's about 200 pixels my guesswork
well that wasn't right at all because
why top this should have been negative
instead of positive so let's just type
in negative 80 file save it look look at
that starting to look pretty sharp
except search button is down here
instead of next to the search area where
I want it to go so what's that mean I
got to increase the width a little bit
on this guy so let's just say I change
this to 230 file save reload
there we go now it's starting to fit in
here a little bit better and then from
the left side of the screen let's say
that I want to move it over or 20 pixels
so that's lined up real nice with what's
up here let's reload it and it needs to
go a little bit more so let's say 7:30
reload it and it's starting to look like
it's just about perfect here
I'll save reload it and there it is
perfect I got my header section all
defined and everything's all lined up
real nice and neat inside here so what
do I have to do now well I have to put
my menu in which is right here I already
have a menu system that I always use all
of the time and I'm going to continue
using it in this presentation and I just
have that saved over inside of here and
I'm just going to copy it because it's
going to be a temporary placeholder that
I'm not going to use in my final work so
I'm just going to copy this menu it's
all finished up here down to the div of
course again it's a box just like
everything else and I'm going to scroll
down here right where it says end of
header boink paste that in there
reload this and you can see that it
showed up there on the screen but it's
missing the CSS code that is needed here
so what I'm going to have to do is
scroll up a little bit
and I have all of the CSS code saved in
a CSS file which is the way it you
should always do it and I'm just going
to link to it like that and then you go
style sheet H reference and that's going
to allow me to point at the style sheet
where it's stored and I have a tutorial
then which I show you how to make this
menu I'll provide a link to it on the
screen so why I'm not getting into it
and then also there is a JavaScript file
that's associated with this so I'm going
to get a text forward slash JavaScript
source is equal to includes board slash
menu js4 slash script make sure you
always close off all the different tags
and if we file save that and reload this
you can see that nothing happened that's
what happens whenever I do all this
stuff completely out of my head what I
forgot to do here is put this little
forward slash in there so if I'll save
it
reload and now you can see there the
whole entire menu system is set up
inside of this guy well that's all I
have time for today on in the next part
of the tutorial I'm going to show you
how to create this whole entire Left
sidebar and then we'll move on to create
all these other different things and
then provide a footer and fix things as
problems come about as I lay this all
out leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
