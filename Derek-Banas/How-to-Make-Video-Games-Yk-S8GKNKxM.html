how to make videogames tutorial what
we're going to do over the course of a
bunch of videos is we're going to make
the game pong and then I'm going to make
a whole bunch other different games but
I thought pong is perfect because with
pong I'll be able to teach you the unity
5.6 interface I'll be able to show you
how to set up everything we'll be able
to talk about cameras and sprites and
scenes and physics and how to get input
from the keyboard and joystick how to
handle collision detection ricochets
sound effects user interfaces splash
screens music whole bunch of different
things and I'm going to try to keep
these into bite-sized videos so I don't
overwhelm anybody out there you don't
really need any real programming
experience of course a little bit of
knowledge and c-sharp would help and
I'll put a link in the description if
you want to take a look at my c-sharp
video but you don't really need it and
like always all the code is going to be
available in the description underneath
the video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so the very first
thing you need of course is unity and
I'm using the free personal version of
unity it's super awesome and you just
click on that and install it and
everything is the same whether you are
on Mac OS or you are on Windows
everything I do here is going to work on
either operating system and then after
you get unity installed you're going to
want to open it up of course and you can
see here are a whole bunch of different
applications I'm working on and you just
click on new and then I am going to call
this guy pong too so I'm just going to
appear and pong - and it's going to be a
2-d application and you can have this
enable unity analytics on or off or
whatever you want it to be and then
here's where you're going to store all
of this information and I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to create a
new folder and I'm going to call it pong
- as well and create and then click on
open and then you're going to click on
create project I'll ride so over here is
going to be your scene area and these
are all the different tools that are
going to allow you to manipulate the
scene you can see the hand tool allows
me to move everything around over there
this guy here is going to be what you're
mainly going to be using especially with
two-dimensional development and the
scene is going to be where you take
things from your hierarchy which are
going to be
game objects like we're creating pong in
this tutorial so it's going to be things
like our paddles and our balls and our
walls those things are going to be in
the hierarchy and if you whatever is in
your scene area is automatically going
to show up in the hierarchy and as you
can see right now all we have is our
camera and we'll be doing all kinds of
different things with that so the
hierarchy is whatever game objects you
have drugged into your scene area okay
that's all that is then you'll have the
main game down here and this is where
you can test as you are coding
everything and I always have maximise on
play selected sup to you rather than
playing around that little screen over
here in your project window is going to
be where all your folders are and all
the assets are going to be using and
then those assets are going to have
properties which will show up in your
inspector and you can also have the
console window open to test for any type
of errors that are occurring and so
forth and so on now the very first thing
I like to do my hair will click on the
camera just so you can see that see
there's properties over here and why
don't I jump over and actually show you
the finished pong game just so you can
see exactly what's what you can expect
from this tutorial okay so here's the
pong game we'll have at the end and
there's the loading screen and there you
can hear the sounds and how they change
and you can see also the score changed
over in the pop screen look it's changed
a whole bunch of times now and there it
goes and I'm controlling the guy on the
left side and then the AI is being is
the control paddle on the right side and
you can see it's pretty good and works
pretty much exactly the way that I want
it now we're going to jump over and
we'll start creating it alright so you
saw the finished game now what I'm going
to do is while I'm inside of here in the
camera section as you saw the background
was black and I want to make my
background black as well so I clicked on
that and whenever I did this got popped
up and I'm just going to grab these
little guys down here and move them down
until they are black alright so you can
see I just drug these little arrows down
alright so now our background is black
and you can see the game is right
here but the scene is unaffected which
is a good thing another thing that I'm
going to want to do is I want to change
the sizing on my camera so that I can
have everything I'll set up here and so
everything lines up well so I'm just
going to set this to 40 I'm not getting
again into specifics of everything here
right now because we don't need that you
just get overwhelmed so just set that to
40 everything is going to work basically
what that means is to give you a rough
overview is it's going to the size is
going to represent one half of the
vertical size for our camera view and
tweaking and playing around with things
40 worked out here so now what I want to
do is I want to keep everything nicely
organized and in the project area that's
where you're going to have everything
deal organized so I'm going to create a
whole bunch of folders so I'm going to
go create folder and just put some
things in here like you're going to want
so I'm going to have scenes now what are
scenes well your splash screen whenever
your game first starts and it opens up
and it shows the name of your game and
then the Creator and it might play some
background music or whatever that's
going to be one scene another scene is
going to be your actual game like you
saw the game being played there's
another scene so you're going to divide
your game up into different scenes to
keep everything organized I'm going to
create some more here let's go what else
are we going to need what we're going to
need sounds those are going to be sound
effects and music and things like that
what else are we going to need we're
going to need sprites those are going to
be your graphics you may need in this
game probably not but you may need
something called a prefab and you use
prefabs this might be confusing if it is
don't worry about it
but basically let's say you had well you
had multiple rackets multiple balls
things like that multiple things in the
pong games lits
what a prefab would allow you to do is
to have multiple things in your
hierarchy but actually because those
game objects basically do the same thing
we want to save them into our prefab
folder and that would allow us to
basically change multiple different
things there in the game all in one
place don't worry about it that's
confusing arm I don't even think I'm
going to cover prefabs in this part of
the tutorial anyway so we'll get into
that later on what else going
so we have scenes we have sounds we have
sprites of scripts to make our game
objects actually do things we are going
to write scripts and those are going to
be c-sharp programs that are going to
allow us to interact with our game
objects so there you go I have all that
organized and those are going to be all
the different types of things we're
going to have in our game now what I
want to do is I'm going to go and
actually create my sprites for my pong
game okay so I'm going to do this in
Photoshop but you'll be able to do this
on a whole bunch of different programs
actually I have a whole bunch of them
down here and if you want me to do pixel
art and other things just ask me so you
can use GIMP you could use a sprite you
could use whatever you can create a ping
file in that'll work but I'm going to
use Photoshop from right now so I need
to create these different files so I'm
going to go new and I'm going to come in
and okay so I have this set for 1 and 1
that's what my ball is going to be my
ball is going to be a 1 in while 1 pixel
by 1 pixel thing and the resolution
doesn't matter and that's all perfectly
fun so I'm going to click on OK
there you go you got a one pixel by one
pixel ball I'm then going to come in and
create some more stuff I'm going to
create a our paddles so I'm going to go
call this paddle and our paddles are
going to be a width of 2 pixels and a
height of 4 pixels and click on OK and
let's go and create some more things new
and we are going to need a horizontal
wall and our horizontal walls are going
to be have a width of 50 by 2 that
sounds ok click on OK of course you're
going to tweak all this stuff over time
file new and you're also going to need
your vertical walls so there's a
vertical wall and let's just go and have
this be the opposite so we'll say 2 by
50 so let's say our our pong game is
going to be roughly you know a square or
whatever click on OK all right so we got
all those all set up now what I'm going
to do is just going to go select all
edit and I'm coming down here to fill
and I'm going to fill those with white
so just basic white like that and click
on OK I'm going to do that with all
these so the
edit fill and white and the paddle edit
fill and white and the ball edit fill
and white fill and white so pretty
simple stuff then I want to save all
these things so I'm going to say save as
and here is the folder I'm going to put
them in my pong sprites folder this is
completely outside of unity and that all
looks good it has set of save as copy
don't want that and I'm going to click
on save that's good so I got my ball
says it's go to the paddle file save as
and we'll change this that let's shut
off the as copy part right there and
click on save
so we have the paddle setup look make
sure this is like that ok good
horizontal wall file and save and then
horizontal wall ping make sure as coffee
shutoff thank lacan save and interlace
none and then we'll do this for our
vertical wall file save as brick wall
shut off this coffee and then click on
save so anything that says that is a
ping file we're going to use all right
so all our images are all setup and now
let's go and drag them over into unity
so you can see right here I have all the
different sprites I just created and
here's also my sound effects so there's
a whole bunch of sound effects and
sprites and I will put the sound effects
on in the description there will be a
link to the code as well as all the
sound effects added and I'll also throw
the pictures inside of there so
everybody will be happy
alright so I want to get all of these
sprites and drag them and put them in my
sprites folder and they should be in
there now so sprites and you can see
there's ball Wars on a wall paddle and
vertical wall everything looks good and
let's go and get our sound effects as
well so I'm going to have my gold bloop
and my hit paddle bloop and my loss buzz
and a whole bunch of different things so
I'm just going to select all those
different guys and I'm going to drag
them and drop them in my sounds folder
okay so they'll all go in there and
everything will be wonderful alright
good and if I click on sound you're
going to be able to say they'll show up
alright so we've got a lot of stuff
going on here looking pretty good now I
want to set up my sprites so that they
are
looked upon as one pixel being one pick
one unit inside of our game so I'm just
going to come in here and I'm going to
select my sprites so I'm going to select
all of them like that there you go all
selected and I'm going to come over here
and what I want to do is I want to have
tools per unit so I want one pixel to be
looked upon as one pixel unit inside of
our game so change that to one and click
on enter and the only other thing I want
to change here is the filter mode I want
them to look like pixels so I'm going to
change this to point so that means as
they are zoomed in on they're going to
have the rough edge of a pixel you know
they're going to be blocks and then
after that I'm going to come down here
and click on apply all right so now we
got all of our images all set up
perfectly well now what I need to do is
actually drag these guys over onto our
screen and everything all line up good
there so I'm actually just going to grab
a horizontal wall and drag it over into
my scene area and I'm going to drop it
so roughly in the middle and I'm going
to get another horizontal wall and I'm
going to drag it in here and I'll worry
about lining it up later and drop it and
I'm going to get a vertical wall and
then a way I want these to be set up is
I want them to overlap each other so
whoops let's zoom in here let's grab a
little hands you can see these are going
to be overlapping click on this guy see
there you are I'm going to sort of drag
him so that they overlap and you know
it's not dead-on perfect but it's pretty
good you normally are going to be doing
things like selecting horizontal wall
I'm playing with the positions and so
forth but I'm just trying to keep it a
little bit simple here because this is a
pong game and just the beginning
tutorial for now okay grab the hand and
move over there and grab this guy oops
let's grab this guy and let's move him
down he is roughly in the right position
and we're going to make sure this as
close as possible so that whenever there
are collisions and things like that that
we don't have any problems and we need
another vertical wall or
that in and we're going to drop it right
like that oh look right there
alright so now we go out our walls set
up and what we're going to want to do
now is let's have our walls set up so
that it's in the center of our camera
but I can just come in here to select
them like that all right so I got and
now all of them are in the center of the
screen so there you go we have all our
walls set up for us to be able to work
with here well now I need to give them
names so that they actually make sense
so let's select this guy up here and I
am going to give him a rename ham wall
top and that's good and then this is
going to be select that guy wall bottom
and then this is going to be this is
going to actually be a goal in the pong
game whenever they cook hit the ball
there so this is going to be left goal
and this is going to be right goal and
then we are now if I want the balls and
the paddles and things like that
to work properly in my game world you
can also right-click on your scene and
drag it around you don't have to use the
hand thing if I want these to basically
handle collisions on their own with
balls and paddles and things I can just
select all of them and then come over
here and click on add component physics
2d and what are they they're rectangles
they're boxes so I'm going to use a box
Collider and there you go it works
that's all I needed to do to make those
handle collisions so pretty cool stuff
and now I want to set up my paddles so
I'm going to go over here and I'm going
to grab a paddle and I'm just going to
drop it right about there and let's go
get another paddle and ring it in here
and robbed it so there you go we got two
paddles on our screen now it makes sense
for me to come in and give them good
names so I'm going to have this you can
see right here it's selected see it's a
little bit hazy I'm going to call this
left paddle so let's just go in left
paddle and it's a good name and this
one's going to be the right paddle so
prefer that and right paddle
okay so left and right paddle we're all
set up these guys are also going to have
colliders on them you can see also if
you double-click on those that it sort
of zooms so I don't want to zoom right
now so I'm going to select that and I'm
going to select that and I want the
paddles to be able to collide with
things and do cool things so I'm going
to click on add component physics 2d and
these are also boxes so I want those to
be box colliders and that's all I need
to do with that the only other thing and
really need to do with since I am going
to be moving these paddles around on a
screen is I need to add another
component which is called a rigidbody
you add rigid body components whenever
you want to be able to move things so
I'm going to add rigid body on those and
those are both selected I'm going to
change them in exactly the same way so I
have to think about some different
things that we want for these so one
thing is we want no gravity because we
don't want the paddles to be moving on
their own and falling down off the
screen that would be a nightmare so
we're going to set our gravity to zero
we also are not going to want them to
rotate we want them to stay straight up
and down so we want to freeze the
rotation in regards to that we want
collision detection to be continuous so
that we catch all that and I'll get more
into this later basically this is just
going to make our physics exact so I'm
going to change that to interpolate and
now what I need to do as the last part
of this tutorial for now is I'm going to
set it up so that you can see how we can
accept input from the keyboard as well
as joysticks to move just the left
paddle around this is going to be a I
control this is going
it can be controlled by us what we're
going to need to do is create a script
so we're going to go into our scripts
folder create c-sharp script and we are
going to call this guy move paddle
because that's what it's going to do so
let's go and create it and we'll double
click on it and you can see the guy
opens up here looking nice so this is
monodevelop what I'm using here you
could use Visual Studio you can use
whatever you want to do alright so this
is just a class that represents how we
are going to be able to move our paddles
around on the screen and what you need
to think about here it's just an object
just like anything else so what are we
going to want to do in regards to moving
our paddle what we're going to want to
be able to move it at different speeds
so we're going to go public and float
and speed and I'm going to have my speed
set at 30 just as a default and is there
anything else going to want to do with
this not as far as I know all right so
we have a paddle that's going to move at
the default speed of 30 and since it's
set as public that is going to allow us
to change it inside of unity and tweak
it and play around with it until we get
it exactly the way we want it now let's
get into what these functions do now
basically whenever a paddle is going to
be created it is going to call the start
function at the very beginning of that
creation it's going to initialize or set
up things and then it's not going to be
called ever again the update function on
the other hand is let's say you have a
60 frames per second game it is going to
be called every single time the frame
changes so that's a good thing however
we're not going to need either one of
these guys because we're going to be
using something called fixed update why
are we using fixed update basically
fixed update is going to be called just
like update does every single time a
frame is called however since we are
using the rigidbody to move this guy
around on the screen move the paddle
around on-screen in those situations use
fixed update instead of just simply
update so we're going in here and we
were doing it so we'll go fixed update
and there's that and there's this cut
that over there and if we want to be
able to get input from
the keyboard or a joystick we're going
to be calling a function called get axis
raw so we're going to go float and we're
going to be getting a vertical press
because our paddles only move up and
down so we're going to go call that
vertical press I don't know call it
whatever you want to call it and to get
whether they are pushing on a button
that goes up or goes down we would then
go inputs and gets axis bra and what we
are specifically interested in is the
vertical movement commands so that's
what we're going to put inside of there
and what this is going to get assigned
and in regards to a value is if they
press W on the keyboard or up on you
know like the UP button on the keyboard
it is going to get a value of 1 if they
press S or or the down button on the
keyboard it's going to get a value of
negative 1 and if they press nothing
it's going to get a value of 0 all right
and we're going to react differently
depending upon what they are pressing
then what I want to do is I want to
change the velocity of the paddle to be
in the direction of you know what
they're pressing on the keyboard now
what I want to be able to do is I want
to use the rigidbody component to change
the velocity and the direction of my
paddle and how I do that is I go get
components like that and then rigidbody
and this is going to be tied to the
paddle so it's going to know that I want
the rigidbody
a taut you know that's already been
attached to the PATA to our paddle that
we have on our screen so we go
rigidbody2d and velocity and to set its
velocity I just go like this
and then I give it a direction and it's
going to be a direction in the Y on the
y axis or up and down so I'm going to go
vector two and I'm not moving in the X
direction so I put a zero right there
and then I'm going to go vert press some
pretty simple stuff and then I just
multiply that times speed so if I get a
value of negative one and my speed is 30
well it's going to move down and
I get a value of one is going to move up
okay so it's pretty simple stuff alright
so there we go so we've just set it up
so that we will be able to move our
racket around on the screen now I'm
going to jump over into unity and I'm
going to show you how we accept input
from keyboards as well as our joysticks
okay we are back over inside of unity I
have moved paddle already set up let's
go and set that up actually so I'm going
to select left paddle here remember
right paddle is going to be AI
controlled the left paddle is going to
be me controlled so I'm going to get
moved paddle and I'm going to drag the
script over here and just drop it on
there all right so that's going to allow
me to play the game and actually you
know move the paddle around on the
screen so the next thing I wanted to do
was I wanted to actually show you where
you can set up or change you know your
input settings so what you're going to
do is you're going to go edit and you're
going to go down to project settings and
input click on that and over here in the
input manager in the inspector area
you're going to be able to click on this
and remember we're moving in the
vertical position well see I said up and
down arrow keys and snw those are the
defaults you can come in and change
those and this is joystick and there's
also horizontal and that's how you would
change or define all of the different
things that you would like in regards to
input inside of your game
so I'd once again I selected the left
paddle here and then I took that script
that I just wrote the move paddle script
and I drug it over into well let's just
select left paddle and I drug it over
and put it right here you can see right
there where I'm able to change my speed
I don't like the speed of that so let's
go and save that and whenever I go to
save it it says save scene I'm going to
call this main scene like this and I'm
going to save it in my scenes folder so
select scenes there it is click on save
and you're going to see if I click on
scenes right here main scene is going to
show up right there there we go we got
everything all set up and let's test to
see if our paddle works and there it is
and if I press up on the W key OOP it
goes up you can also see the collision
keeps it from going through
the wall and there it is it works
alright so pretty cool stuff and if you
want to shut it off you just press on
that play button once again and you're
back to where you are alright so there
you go guys that was a lot of
information getting started with
developing and making games using unity
and in the next part of the tutorial I'm
going to continue on to set it up so the
ball works and I'll show you how to set
up the paddle so the AI works and the
scores and the music and the sound
effects and a whole bunch more and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
