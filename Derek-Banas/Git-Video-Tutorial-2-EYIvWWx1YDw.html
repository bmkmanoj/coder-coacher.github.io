two of my get video tutorial series
today we're going to focus in on remote
repositories github pushing polling
aliases and tags so basically we're
going to cover everything except for
branching and general workflow
operations which I'll cover in the next
part of the tutorial and of course if
you didn't watch part one you pretty
much have to watch it because you're
going to get lost here otherwise I have
a link to it in the description under
the video as well as in the upper right
hand corner now basically the reason
you'd want to use github is it's going
to allow you to host your code
repositories online and in this video
I'm going to set everything up and go
over pretty much everything that I do
now of course the very first thing
you're going to want to do here is go to
github.com and create an account for
yourself
and remote repositories are normally
read-only however since this is going to
be your account it's going to allow you
to both read and write since you will be
authorized to do so then basically all
you're going to need to do is either
push or pull updates to this remote
repository so after you go and you
create your account on github you're
going to come up here and you're going
to click on this little plus sign
whenever you do you're going to see
create new show up on the screen and
you're going to click on that and then
whenever you do you're going to see new
repository so of course click on that
that's going to take you over to this
screen and inside a repository name
you're going to want to give yourself
some type of name that's unique and then
you're going to want to type in a
description here now I'm basically just
using a junk directory I have from an
old Android video tutorial I did and I'm
going to leave this public and I'm not
going to do anything else here except
come down here and click on create
repository and that's pretty much it now
what you're going to need to do is set
everything up on the local side and
you're going to see a couple little
things down here in regards to what you
would type in your terminal I do things
slightly different I just want to make
sure that you completely understand
basically I'm going to do this down here
with a couple added things so let's jump
over inside of the terminal alright now
just like before we're going to come
into the terminal we're going to go to
the directory that we want to use we're
going to type in get in it right like
that and then you're going to type in
get
add an in a space and a period and that
is basically going to stage the entire
directory for you and then we're going
to come in here and type in git commit
dash M and then I'm going to type in
initial project version you can type in
anything you want though then we're
going to jump back over inside of github
and we're going to come right here where
we see this get remote add origin this
guy right here and we're going to copy
that and then basically this is going to
be known as origin thereafter but I'm
going to show you how to change the name
then we're going to jump back over in
our terminal and we're gonna paste git
remote add origin that thing that we
just copied from github and then hit
enter of course and then to push that
whole entire directory of information
over to github we're going to type in
git push origin master and then it's
going to ask you for your user name my
name is Derrick Bannon so I'm going to
type that in and it's going to ask you
for your password and hit enter and then
it's going to do all the work for you
and upload that to github then if you
jump back over into github you're gonna
see that that whole directory full of
information is showing there so
everything's working good and then what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to
cycle down to the end of the screen I'm
going to click on add a readme little
windows going to open up and here I'm
just going to type in code for my
Android fragment tutorial because that's
what this is and I'm going to show links
here to the videos if anybody wants to
see them like I said this is just an
example and then after I type in a
readme I like I'm going to come down
here and click on commit new file there
you're going to see inside of here
you're going to see readme dot M D now
basically what we're going to do is
we're going to pull this updated
information inside of the terminal I'm
going to do it live this time so you're
going to see how to pull files inside of
github down to your local server okay
and here we are inside of the terminal
and if I would want to list all of these
remotes and their URLs that you know I
have connected here I would just type in
git remote dash V and you're going to
see there is simple fragment dot git and
then if I would want to get the data
from the remote but not merge the
changes that are there with my work I
would just type in git fetch origin and
there you can see it worked but however
if I would want to
actually pull all of those directory
files down along with any changes I need
to do something a little bit different
I'm going to type in get pull and then
I'm basically just going to come up here
and I'm going to copy this guy right
here copy and paste that in there and it
went and updated everything so the
directory that is on or all of the files
that are on github are now here and if
we type in LS you're gonna see there's
readme it shows up see readme now let's
say that I would want to put a file on
my local server and then have it get
uploaded on the github well basically
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to type in a series of ignores that I
want to upload to github and like I've
said I'm on my local machine right now
doing this so then I'm just going to
come in here and I'm going to save this
as get ignore and of course make sure
that it's saved in simple fragment the
same directory that you are using on get
up and then you're going to of course
hit save and then in the terminal you're
going to type in git add and then you're
going to type in git ignore this guy
right here don't forget to put the
period inside of there and then you're
going to type in git commit dash m and
then here I'm going to put a little note
that just says added get ignore for
Android and all that information is
going to be uploaded to github and if we
jump over to github you're going to see
it shows up or we could refresh the page
you're gonna see that get ignore is
indeed there now if you'd like me to
come in here and actually do all this
live I'm gonna go into the Android
manifest and this is all 100% live right
now I'm inside of github and I'm gonna
click on Android manifest and I'm going
to click on edit so there that is and
there that is now inside of here I'm
just going to put a junk comment
random comment right like that and then
I'm gonna scroll down here and I'm going
to say commit changes and of course I
could also come in here and add in
information in regards to this commit
right here click on commit changes there
we go now let's go into the terminal and
let's go pull down those changes so get
pull and then I'm going to well rather
than typing all that out I'm gonna go
get remote - V there we go and I
normally use all kinds of aliases aside
out here but all that stuff off just so
that I could
have exactly the same things on my
screen as you say and then I'm going to
paste the URL inside of there da da da
da and then I'm just going to jump into
a basic text editor here simple fragment
androidmanifest and there you can see
random comments showed up so that's
pretty useful now of course the next
logical thing is how to update to github
and let's just put two inside of here
just like that
I'm going to save file save and then I'm
going to jump back over into my terminal
and I'm going to type in git add Android
manifest dot XML if I want to push this
over inside of github git commit dash M
and then I'm going to say changed
Android manifest comment whatever
doesn't matter and then if I want to
push this over to github I just type in
git push boom jump back over and to get
up going simple fragment here and
there's Android manifest open it up and
you can see random comment to is right
there so that's how to save in both
directions and now I'm going to jump
over into the terminal and cover a bunch
of the other different things
if for example I decided I didn't like
the name origin for this say origin
right here right there let's say I
instead since this is simple fragment I
wanted to shorten the name to SF for
example basically to do that we just
come in here let's play scroll backseat
yeah let's leave it there get and if I
want to change the name I'm going to
type in remote and I'm going to type in
rename and then I'm going to type in
whatever the name of it is right now and
then I'm going to type in our self there
we go
and you can see now it's no longer
origin like it is here now its SF so
that's just a little weird thing that I
just thought I'd cover now let's take a
look at tagging now tags are basically
used to tag files at any point in
history in which you would want to add a
tag and if you wanted to see all of the
tags that you currently have on your
system you just type in get tagged and
there you can see I have three of them
right there if I would want to come in
here and create a tag for my previous
commit the commit that I just made I'm
going to do is type in get tag - a and
in this situation I'm going to type in
version ODOT - I don't know just
anything and then I'm going to type in
em and then I can come in here and go
version 0.2 and hit enter and then let's
clear our scroll back here and type in
get tagged again and you're now going to
see that version 0.2 is right there if I
wanted to see the details in regards to
this tag I would just type in get show
and then I would type in version 0.2 and
there you can see all that information
and of course to get out of it well you
can scroll through and see exactly
what's going on here
and to get out of it I'm just going to
type in Q clear scroll back then let's
say that we have a previous commit but
we do not have a tag for it how would we
go back and change that well basically
what I'm going to do here is I am going
to open a text editor and I am going to
make a change to this and then I'm going
to cycle through my little things here
and add or stage the Android manifest
file that I just changed and then get
and commit this guy so let's just say
change coma to 3 now of course since I
just made this change I could add the
tag immediately and would take effect
but let's do it another way and let's
list out all of our commits on the
screen and there you can see all of them
and here you can see change comment to 3
now let's say that I wanted to come in
here and I wanted to actually change or
add a tag to this commit right here well
I'm just going to come in and I'm going
to grab let's say the first six of these
hash codes that we have right here so
that it'll be different I'm going to
copy that I'm gonna hit Q to get out of
that again clear scroll back and then
I'm going to type in get tag - a and
let's say that I want to mark this as
version 4
I can just come in here and go V 0 point
let's change it to 5 and then I'm just
going to paste in the beginning of that
hash and you can see a little editor
pops up here and I'm just going to type
in a message like of course hit I I
changed the comment to in cool
food number three and then of course hit
enter and then of course it escaped and
then hit call 1wq right like that and
then hit enter and then that's going to
be saved for you if I tap you can get
tagged you're going to see that there it
is right there okay so that's pretty
much most of the things you'd want to do
with tags the only other thing and think
of is you can also push your tags up to
github and to do that it's just get push
SF and then let's say that you want to
push version five up there or 0.5 just
type in V 0 0.5 like that and that's
going to push that to github or your
remote repository doesn't really matter
how you think of that
if you jump over into github and click
on simple fragment and then you click on
releases right here you can see there it
is right there
and you can see a minute ago say work
seamlessly right inside the terminal and
another thing you might want to do with
tags is let's say you want to push every
single one of them you could go get push
SF and then - - tags like that and
that's going to push every single tag
all at one time
and you can see the ones that went up
there and if we come in here and refresh
this you're gonna see all of them that
are on the screen and I basically just
leaves us with aliases and how to create
them um basically they're just going to
provide you shortcut ways to do all
sorts of different things so let's say
that I wanted to change my commits from
having to type in get commit to CEO
instead all I would do is just go get
config right like this and then I would
type in global alias and then here is
where you're going to put what you want
to change it to so if I want to change
commit to CEO I would just type in CEO
and then this is going to be the thing
you're going to be replacing so just hit
enter now what I can do is come in here
and go get add and this situation just
hit a period inside of there and then
I'm going to say get CEO since I added
that alias on there - M and then I'm
just going to say demonstrate alias
there we go
and you can see that that was changed
and the last thing I'm going to show you
how to do is how to clone a git
repository alright so we are on get and
going to click on the little guy up here
and then I'm going to go and find myself
a repository I'd like to cologne so I'm
going to click on explore right there
explore and then inside of here I'm
going to type in I don't know it's type
in Google just to type in something and
there we go we can see all kinds of
different repositories that we could
clone let's say I want to get to the
Google pac-man basically I'm just going
to click on this and then I'm going to
come up here where it says fork and I'm
gonna click on Fork this is inside
github and you can see it's building it
right there
and there we go and if I want to clone
this guy I'm going to come over here
where it says clone URL and click on
this copy to clipboard popped up for a
second and then I can jump back over
inside of my terminal and to get all of
those files I'm just going to type in
git clone and then paste in URL that I
got from github actually I'm not gonna
want to do it here though let's go and
make directory pac-man and change
directory to pac-man there's nothing
inside of there and then I'm going to
clone it by going git clone paste the
URL inside of there and then enter you
can see it's cloning everything and if I
do LS Google pac-man change directory to
Google pac-man LS and there are all of
the files so that's how to do a whole
bunch of things with git and github like
I said before in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to cover branching
and pretty much all the general workflow
sort of operations that you want to do
with get well I wanted to end this video
by telling you guys that I'm giving away
another samsung galaxy note 3 smartphone
and to enter all you need to do is make
a two minute or shorter video telling me
why you should win and the funniest
video is going to win there's more
