very very first maker Monday and this is
a live stream so thank you for everybody
who came to see me and what I want to do
here today is a couple things I want to
talk about some low price 3d printers
what I found about them the one that I
found to be the best and then on top of
that I figured well if I'm gonna you
know to a 3d printer tutorial and this
is all about making things I'm gonna
make stuff so I'm going to make
something so I'm also going to build or
paint show you how I personally paint
really cheap a D&amp;amp;D terrain they had just
figured it's just something to do is
just some painting techniques so I just
want to jump right into it so thank you
very much alright so what I did was I
tested the top three what are considered
inexpensive 3d printers the monoprice MP
select mini the XYZ printing da Vinci
mini and the Printrbot play and you
could see all the information about them
on the screen and I'm just looking at
your at your chat messages okay so what
I found about the monoprice MP select
and move my microphone here a little bit
closer yeah the this is mainly the
negatives um it had some issues
adjusting the leveling and I'm going to
show it to you here on video it's not
just going to be a slide presentation
it's not going to be boring we're going
to get exciting quick but once I
adjusted it I pretty much had no problem
leveling it and one time I had a nozzle
clog which was pretty easy to fix the da
Vinci
on the other hand and this is just based
off of my personal experiences with all
of these I had some issues being that
the filament on the 3d printer is
actually DRM filament which is something
I didn't care for I also had that
filament break which is also not good I
had some issues connecting it to my PC
and also on top of that you're going to
notice here the mana price is the
only one with a heated bed that causes a
lot of problems because the mana price
is the only one I have never had an
issue with the print moving while I am
printing so I have so far had none with
the mana price I had zero printing
errors so far and take a look at the
price it's $1.99 it's considerably
cheaper than the other two actually it
is a half the price of the printer
bullet so mm you know I had some nozzle
jam issues with the da Vinci and like I
said before the print moves on the bed
unless it's glued I even had issues with
that the Printrbot play had a whole
bunch of issues I had prints move like I
said before there's no heated bed that's
the reason why I had to adjust wiring
around the extruder because it wasn't
put together right
I had to update to software I didn't
update the software on the select on the
mana price or The Da Vinci had to do it
with the printer OTT which is a pain who
wants to do that prints were slightly
better but yeah I don't know there was
kind of hard to notice I was almost
wondering if I was imagining that my
brain that the prints were better they
were very very similar I had to figure
out how to shut off the fans with the
Printrbot and auto-leveling didn't work
for me so there's a quick rundown the
mana price which is the cheapest 3d
printer that I tested was by far the
best I didn't try a I don't know how you
pronounce that
bruza I've read a lot about it they are
considerably more expensive I've heard
they are fantastic three overnight or 3d
printers but they cost like $800 a big
difference between this is about cheap
3d printers this isn't about the best 3d
printers I'm going to show you the
results from this 3d printer I think
they'll impress you so um let me just
pull in some more information here so
that is my comparison slide the setup
for it let's go and do this over here
sorry I'm messing with a whole bunch of
things you use cura with it to set up
everything and you can see right here if
you go preferences and printer this is
the exact what I
what I showed or what I set for the
printer I've had zero problems so you
could just pause your screen if you have
that and have any interest in the
settings that I use if you're having any
issues and then also I had whoops that's
not right
there will be technical difficulties
alright and here is the cura settings
that I actually used and just making
sure you can see that yes it works on
Mac OS I had two row works on Mac OS
obviously I use the Mac and I also use
the PC yeah it it actually doesn't
matter
well Kuro works that's the software
basically all you do is you load the
model into cura you set all this stuff
you see here on the right side of the
screen and then you save the file to an
SD card and then you stick it in a
printer and I'll show you exactly I'm
going to do a live shot of the printer
here in a second and I'll show you
exactly that works it's like a dream and
here I'll move out of the way so you can
see the rest of the settings see there
you go that's all the settings that I
have very very important to have your
raft set properly because that'll make
it very easy to pull off the print
alright so I think you had enough time
to look at that and I'll show you the
raft I have a raft right here what I
think the raft should look like see it's
real nice thick see here
whoops sorry hopefully didn't hurt yours
so so let's see here or what else do we
got yeah feel free to ask me questions
about 3d printing I'm not a super expert
at it but I think that you know I know
what I'm doing here so this is the 3d
printer there you can see it right there
and I'm going to show you how easy it is
a set up and also give you somewhat of
an idea what it sounds like so to set it
up first you put this blue painters tape
down on it and I've used the same pray
if you're careful with prying it off you
can use the same tape over and over
again because it has a heated bed and
when I first started of course I messed
it up so let's move it into this is how
easy it is to do everything
you save the file in a on an SD card you
plug it in the side of the printer and
then well that wasn't a spectacular idea
I think you kind of got the idea how
loud it is it's like this is that that's
not even that loud because I'm right
next to the microphone I just in regards
to leveling it what you do is there are
little allen keys and you just level it
and then what I do is I get a piece of
paper and I try to get the nozzle as
close as possible to the bed and be able
to slip a piece of paper underneath of
it so that there's a little bit of
tension just the slight amount of
tension and then you have to play around
with the allen keys up and down until
you get it just right but like I said
that's the biggest negative I've had
with this with this printer and I only
had to level at once my wife tried to
level it because my wife plays around
with a lot and she had some issues and I
laid with it for probably 10 minutes and
I got perfect prints and like I said
I've print printed lot of things I came
and imagine how many things I've printed
probably about 40 different things I
haven't had to level it so that's what
you do you you level or you move it into
the home position and you get X out of
that I think you can see this yes and
then you get a temperature like that and
then you go boink and boink like that
and it's set for 190 that's what works
with my type of filament and then you
set to the the platform the bed the heat
for that and just press it twice there
you go
it starts raising temperature you hit
exit then I hit exit exit here we are
and then you come over to print and
click on this
let's say I want to print this wall
whatever I just click on that and it at
the very end of the video what I'll do
is I'll I'll play it so that you got or
all I'll have it print something so that
you guys can hear all loud it is oh I'll
show you a bunch of things I print it
here well this is the print of the I
don't know how well that sounds how well
that shows up but there you can see I'm
going to show you another view of it so
this is the D&amp;amp;D terrain here here's a
trumpet you let's see if I can get it to
sort of level better not really but you
can see that is extremely smooth that is
very very very smooth hopefully Donald
Trump isn't insulted by that and do
something bad to me so basically you
might be able to see how detailed it is
based off of this being painted see it's
painted looks a lot I mean there's a lot
of detail there it's hard to do it
through this but mmm let me see and
that's basically it you have any other
questions I mean that's how simple it is
it's you've just plug it in you stick
the filament in it and I had one printer
Jam what I actually did the fix our
nozzle Jam whatever was I just took the
filament and I turned it on I removed
the filament and then I pressed the
filament until it started oozing out of
the bottom of the printer bed or out of
the bottom of the nozzle and that
cleared it that was it that's how hard
it was I'm actually I have I bought this
this I'm I'm working on other models
with blender right now but I'm going to
do tutorials about actually make your
Monday's going to cover some blender
tutorials um but this stuff actually
bought and you can get I put a link in
the description underneath this video I
don't know if it's showing right now
that you can go and get it I think cost
me like nine dollars but the company
that makes it it's called dragon lock
they have free terrain and then they
have terrain that you have to pay nine
dollars were so any other questions to
do it
yes it's Pikachu trumpet did I play with
the settings there's really nothing I
got those settings that I showed at the
beginning of the video off the internet
I mean and they work perfectly so can i
resume print when stuck yes you can
pause the prints and you can resume yes
I've never shut the Machine off and
tried to print that might not work the
obviously more more complicated more
expensive printers are going to be
faster than this guy but like I said for
$1.99 this is all about cheap you know I
don't like spending a lot of money I
mean it's basically what I'm giving up
is time if I want to print something I
just turn it on the middle of the night
or whatever I'm working or whatever and
I come back to it it's done anything
else you guys are asking about no you
can model things in a 3d application and
it will print it what material did I use
I use PLA this guy oh this is that's
another thing is the mana price can use
ABS PLA XT call copolyester PE te t bu t
bc f PE PVA jelly phone fealty and the
other two models that are more expensive
can only use PLA so that's another N
done and I guess that's about all the
questions you guys have right now so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
switch the camera around what 3d
software I'm using cura
for this and I am modeling with blender
anything with it have I made anything
with it yes I'm going to show you right
now so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to jump over and I am going to is the
Trump Hollow
yes it's hollow in the middle it's not a
solid fun I thought I would do you guys
would think that was funny that's the
first thing I think my wife printed on
it to test that it would work and yes
I'm working on making 3d printing and 3d
modeling tutorials those are going to be
found on the maker Monday videos and
some of them will be live and some of
them won't be live so you know for this
one I just thought would be fun to do
that so what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to pause move my my camera around
and then I'll show you how I print the
or how I paint the 3d terrain so just
hold on one second and I'll set all that
up and then we can do a little pate
tutorial because I thought what the heck
some makers you know video with let's
not uh make something you know so I'm
going to make some alright so just give
me one second and I will do it done and
there
you
you
alright I'm back okay I wasn't to longer
wait okay so this is my desk that's all
burnt up from soldering on it and this
is what hopefully it turns out pretty
good I think you'll get the idea the way
this is a model that hasn't been
nothing's been applied to idea what I
did and this works for anything this
isn't just D&amp;amp;D it's just something I was
working on because my daughter's
addicted to two board games and
everything so this is what I prime it
with that works a little bit better just
krylon gray primer and that makes it
very easy to paint on top of it and I'll
show you all the different steps I got
well I guess I should whoops that's bad
I just spilled some water on my keyboard
not good thing to do that's what's fun
about live streams I mean it's like why
aren't more people doing live streams I
mean it's fun you know you can spill
things there's water everywhere there's
things exploding all right so this is
what I use I mean for this project you
don't need expensive paint and things
like that
I just got regular old crafters acrylic
so this I think this costs fifty cents
for this and this is tan whoops here
I'll show it to you so it looks a little
bit better there's tan and I got country
maple and I got cafe mocha and I got
golden brown all right so I got all
those colors so let's put that aside and
yes thank you for that compliment this
live stream is one of a kind that is my
goal that's what I've been working on
since the beginning of the year is to
try to figure out how to do really cool
live streams okay so what I want to do
is I want to get this paint as wet as
possible so I I just sprayed it with a
spray paint
that's what then this is what it looks
like at that point and then I'm just
going to come in here very very watery
even wipe it on a little bit and then
I'm going to come in and just paint over
it a little bit and I'm not going to
paint the whole entire thing here just
paint it and
there and I'll show you how to dry brush
and all that stuff
pretty simple stuff but it's something
that some people don't know so if you
don't know something that's simple then
it's something new learn in it I know
there's a lot of things I don't know so
sir I just mix a match and then I want
to mix it so that it it looks a little
bit random because random looks nice
because the world is so random all right
so I got this in there and let's do a
little bit more maybe the sky day maybe
this happy little guy down here this
little rock look looked a little bit
lonely look like it needed a little
color in its life and so I'm going to go
and put some in there okay and then I
don't know let's put it out here let's
go and be reckless and break some rules
of painting maybe have it a little bit
see I have this brick painted right here
and this brick painted up here and
that's you know probably something you
thought I shouldn't do that but I did it
so and we'll paint this one right here
and I'm just blocking it off to be
awesome by any means I'm just trying to
color that and then the next one so
here's a little bit lighter brown just
get some water I skip some water spray
it in there a little bit or whatever and
yeah let's have this one right here and
I want it to be really watery and I'm
not going to paint all these I'll paint
all these after you guys go away and
that's what I do for fun this is what I
do you're ever wondering okay so there
you go so there it is I went and painted
those they'll dry up and through the
magic of camera work when it dries up
it's going to look basically like that
see what flatter than what it looks here
there it's Johnny there it's flat so now
to make it look really awesome like this
that's you know that's like next year
like people actually pay like seventy
dollars for a bunch of these Oh
just cost about 40 cents to print 35 40
cents the prim like I said I have a link
in the description if you guys want to
look at that and there's a free thing
dragon lock it's what it's called and
it's it's yet there's a whole bunch of
free models you can play around with if
you sign up for their newsletter I'm not
sponsored by anybody so and like I said
like I always say if I tell somebody
that I'm not sponsored by something and
I am sponsored by it I can be sued so
just let me tell you that okay so try
brush I got the where's the paint out I
go for this there it is
this is basics and it is basics
unbleached titanium is what it's called
so there it is this is what I'm going to
dry brush with so I got this guy over
here that's all dried up and I'm gonna
get some paint on this and then I'm
going to wipe most of it off onto this
paper towel alright and then I'm going
to test down here first and what I'm
going to do is just very lightly just go
over it see look at that look how it
comes to life it looks three-dimensional
already just simple just very very
little a couple little hairs area you
can see how simple this is to do of
course I let it dry a little bit and I'm
just going to let it glide over top of
those rocks and it just all of a sudden
is coming to life and looking a lot
better and there's this there's that
beautiful trying to imitate somebody if
you weren't if you were wondering okay
and there you are and their yarn got
that in there let's get a little bit
more for the other side and let's go
like that and paint an honor and there
you go and in no time flat
you have yourself some really cool and
you can do this with anything I just
thought that stuff and it looks pretty
cool looks three-dimensional you know it
looks like real wish weather-beaten Rock
he's both
being sponsored uh believe it he's
sponsored by being not sponsored so and
that's it so any questions you guys have
anything else I wanted to cover I mean I
did a review of three 3d printers I show
you how one of them operated I show you
how the settings are set up oh one other
thing to let you hear what it sounds
like if I print it so all that means are
you guys going to require me to to go
and do a thing here let's see it's good
like this and just do that let's get our
paints out of the way this is something
to do tonight after you guys go to bed
there go away and this is the little
water thing I had I don't know why
should I do that that was dumb
okay so what I'm going to do um what
printer do I use yeah I use this one I
tried the other three and this one is
half the price and better so you know
I'd I haven't tried maybe I'll do a
video about that later
I've tried pretty I have not yet tried
to print something that is extremely
detailed like a figurine level detailed
um I'm actually planning on doing that
this weekend print a bunch of them and
I'm also working on some different
things in blender 3 my own 3d prints
that are extremely detailed and I
haven't tried anything ridiculously
detailed yet I mean this is you know
what it is are the fumes toxic no this
is acrylic it doesn't it's just no as
far as I know it isn't toxic mmm I've
been painting with curly I used to paint
in an enclosed room though well that was
really kerlick to I don't know I used to
paint with oil paints and everything
I've never airbrushed oils that could
probably be dangerous supposedly van
Gogh went nuts because he ate paint but
so don't eat paint I think specifically
he went insane because he ate cadmium so
don't do that
alright so we kind of
a file format does the printer take it
is STL what sto is what you load into
kura and then it you save it to the
printer so I wish I could show you the
maybe the next time I do a maker Monday
thing I'll show you cure and all the
different things that I set up inside of
that and you know how that looks and
that looks good okay so you guys want to
see it to actually print okay but I have
to pause it and let me see here so I'm
gonna have to pause it move my camera
around and then I will show you it
prints and you'll have a pretty good
idea of how loud it is as well so let's
go like this and let's go like this
you
alright I'm back again alright so can I
print more than one material at once no
can I print multiple materials yes
alright so I'm going to print something
hopefully I click done or anything there
you go now you're going to get to hear
how loud it is I mean it's kind of
irritating if you listen to it forever I
actually stick it in out of the room now
it's taking a little bit to heat up and
you get to see that I got it for $1.99
you can always I have a link in the the
vide or in the description for it but I
bought it off of Amazon only because I
like the fact that I can return cit
that's why I got three 3d printers and I
didn't like the other two I returned it
but if you want to just get the cheapest
price possible just go directly to
monoprice and buy it off of them and you
can always get it for $1.99 and just
taking its sweet old time here getting
ready but that's okay and any other
questions you have
yeah the the what's it called the
cruiser supposedly that's the best seat
it's an $800 printer I have a hard time
saying uh I mean you know a couple years
back saying you could get an awesome 3d
printer for for $800 was you know
amazing but yeah it's called the Prusa
i3 mk2 sorry I'm looking at my my
computer I believe that's what it's
called and here it is supposedly I have
not tested it but supposedly I guess
what you would call a mid tier printer
that is going to meet most of your means
your it's $800 Oh in it now you could
buy it as a kit for 700 or it is
actually 900 as of and yeah I I don't
know maker but this is I've seen
MakerBot prints and I've seen cheaper
cheaper printers make the same exact
thing
same exact print so I don't know I'm
extremely happy with this guy that's why
I decide to make a video about it hi
Brendan I think it's starting to Oh heat
up I guess it's not quite at it once the
targets 200 and there it is 198 200 and
it'll start there goes and now you'll be
able to hear all out it is
see there you go that's how loud it is
and I haven't a very very sensitive
microphone here so that's it yes I make
my living making it seem to say this
long list about 10 times a day making
shopping carts and mobile apps okay so
yes that's true and and that's it
I guess that's uh there you can see it's
pretty so pretty awesome stuff I thought
I was glad that I could share this with
you guys I'm glad you guys seem to like
it and I guess that's basically it so
I've always hang around after the live
streams and answer other questions that
come up in the chat system and I guess
that's it so like always guys please
leave any questions and comments you
have down below thank you for joining me
and till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
