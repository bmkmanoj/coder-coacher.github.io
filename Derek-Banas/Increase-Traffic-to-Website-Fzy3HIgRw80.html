I'm going to teach you how to
dramatically increase the traffic that
comes to your website and these are all
time effective ways that I use to drive
a lot of traffic to websites most of my
websites are ranked in the top 1% summer
ranked in the top point two percent and
I can show you here exactly how i did it
if you follow these plans and this all
came about because Tracy asked for this
presentation now what doesn't work for
me I have heard a lot of people are able
to generate a lot of traffic to websites
using facebook well I drove my facebook
account up to 5,000 friends not my
personal one but a business one and I
was only able to generate an increase of
three to four percent in traffic each
time i posted to facebook what i found
is people go on facebook to gossip look
at pictures and play games not for
marketing also people do not go on
facebook and then leave facebook people
go on facebook and sit there for hours
it seems so they do not want to go and
leave facebook to look at your stuff
hence the fact that facebook has the
worst click through ratio of any website
there is people don't want to leave I
also received similar results using
Facebook groups and facebook fan pages
and in my opinion all of the time it's
going to take you to generate all of
these friends in facebook is not worth
your time I created over 4,500 followers
on one Twitter account and receive
similar results to what I received with
facebook marketing on twitter is like
screaming come look at my stuff in a
stadium full of thousands of people I
also found that the more that I posted
on Twitter and Facebook the less friends
and followers I had why because they
were sick of my of all my posting and
because it started to look like
marketing and advertising which people
don't want to look at so from these two
social networks I do post to them
however I do it in an automated way
using a tool called WordPress which I
talk a lot about and will provide links
to throughout this presentation to the
best ways i have found to drive traffic
to my website is first off making sure
the website is made with wordpress
secondly through youtube seventy percent
of my tree
it comes originally from people who have
watched a video that I have done on
youtube videos like this and also I get
a lot of traffic by posting in blog
forums and i don't mean blitzing them
with tons of marketing and garbage and
comments that don't have anything to do
with the comments that are going on in
the forum but only commenting in ways
that add to the experience of those
people in the forum and I'll get more
into this in a bit why wordpress first
off it's free it's very easy to maintain
communicates very very well with search
engines most people who are successful
on the web use some form of wordpress
wordpress also makes you do a lot of the
right things with your website even if
you don't know you're doing them and
it's very easy to automate a lot of the
different tasks in wordpress why don't
people go to your website well i found
that a lot of times web developers do
not submit their clients websites to
search engines also you must have a
sitemap xml file and I'm going to get
more into these I'm not going to briefly
go over them going to explain them you
don't have content or it's very hard to
find your content people also go to
websites for information not advertising
and brochure where and finally you never
update or go to your website yourself if
you want to know where to go to submit
your website here are the three top ways
being Google followed by bein followed
by Yahoo you must submit your website to
these three locations you also should
submit to the yahoo developer network as
well as google analytics and ask.com but
you can only submit to ask calm by
pinging them and i have a video here
that explains how to do that and
numerous other websites just go to the
yahoo directory and type search engines
and hit search and it will give you a
list of every search engine on top of
that WordPress will also notify all of
these search engines every single time
you make any changes to your website so
again another reason use WordPress so
what is a sitemap XML file what it does
is it tell search engines that they are
welcome to look at your website it tells
them what's most important on your site
how often you change your site and
what's great again is WordPress creates
one of these for you and I provided a
link to an
another video that will explain how to
do this it's extremely easy you just
click a couple buttons and it's made
also your website might not have any
text this website on the right side your
screen is for a very popular restaurant
in Pittsburgh where I live is called the
little Mont restaurant and the entire
website is images all of the words you
say there are not really words they are
images words embedded in images on top
of that they're stuck inside of a flash
player making it almost impossible for a
search engine to read anything you see
here on the screen this is probably the
best example of what not to do with your
website what this does is it creates a
roadblock between search engines and
your text and search engines care about
text not pictures you must also provide
information you must spend at a bare
minimum 10 minutes per day posting
interesting content on your website I'm
not saying you have to spend any more
than that but if you want to get ranked
in the top 1% you need to spend at least
10 minutes wordpress makes it extremely
easy to use other people's content as
well even though original contents the
best there is a very easy way to post
other people's content in a legal way to
your website using a tool that I'll go
over here in a minute there's also
automated ways to post content to
WordPress such as the WP o matic plug-in
which I provide a link to a video on how
to use that here on the screen but you
must alter ultimately understand that if
you do not love your website nobody else
ever will either you must also have a
good domain name that is a keyword
phrase people use when they want your
info here are three examples backside
pain preschool baby limb prosthetic now
it would be better to have prosthetic
limbs but it was unavailable but this is
these are still very very good domain
names do not use your business name or
some catchy phrase you've made up you
must use phrases that people actually
search for how do you do that you can go
to the AdWords google com forward slash
select forward slash keyword tool
external this is a google keyword tool
what you do is on the left side of the
screen right here if i was looking to
create a website that it had something
to do with knitting or sewing i would
type those different phrases in
obviously i type in a lot more than
typed here and then hit get keyword
ideas I would then look this column
right here has to do with competition
this has to do with traffic per month
where all the competitions fairly low
I'd like to get one that's more like
down in this area but it's pretty low
and that traffic is really nice and then
what I do is I jump over to go daddy and
see if sewing needle work is available
and yes what sewing needle were calm is
available i'm just using this as an
example but this is a great way to get
good domain names and then what you want
to do is continue using this tool to
find out what your article should be
about and if you want to find even more
information on what people are looking
for go check out google insight where do
you get free contact well again original
timeless articles are the best but if
you need to get free content free
articles here are a whole bunch of
different places you can go to or you
could go to the yahoo directory again
and type in free articles and you will
get every website that provides free
content that you can use on your website
you then want to use those keyword
phrases in your title your description
your content you want to bold it
italicize it put it in lists put it in
links use it in incoming links if at all
possible coming from your friends
websites and even give the keyword
phrases to your images here is a tool
called press this I provide a link to it
here on the screen but I'm briefly going
to go over it basically what you do to
use press this it's a wordpress tool
that's built in is you save a bookmark
you go to WordPress you click on tools
you right click on where it says press
this you save that to your bookmarks
that's there's an example of it over
here then if you see an article that you
like you select it go to bookmarks hit
press this in your bookmarks this type
of things on a pop up with the title and
all the information in here this link
back makes this act that you're
performing completely legal you should
type in some keyword phrases here maybe
click on a category that makes sense and
hit publish all of a sudden that article
is sent directly to your website that's
why I'm saying 10 minutes a day also
Google thinks your site is valuable if
you have many incoming links this means
links from other websites here is an
example what is not a good incoming link
if you had a friend put Bob Smith web
design on their website this is terrible
why because this isn't a good keyword
phrasing only way somebody's going to
type this in
if they already know about walk Bob
Spence's web design company however a
good keyword phrase would be web
designer site followed by create your
own website this is great so you want to
go to your friends and say link to my
website using this exact link say
incoming links very important what you
have to understand is if other people
think your website is good and provide
links to it using keyword phrases that
are also good Google will agree but
never ever ever link form this is
whenever you get thousands of people
together that just say put links on your
page on output links on my page and so
forth and so on if this if it sounds
unethical don't do it if you do
participate in link farms know that you
will eventually get banned by Google so
don't do that also if you want to
automate the process of posting to all
the different social networks every
single time you create a new post on
your website you should definitely grab
the socialite plug-in and I provide a
link to a video because more in-depth
into this or the W ping FM plug-in and
what it does is it sends out to all the
different social networks I think over
48 of them every single time you create
a new article what does that do it also
generates a lot of incoming links you
also want to get involved in the blog
community meaning sites like dig
stumbleupon delicious and read it what I
do is I go on these websites and I post
normally 150 to 200 times other people's
stuff other websites other articles
other information that I have found that
I think is really good I post it on to
these different boards this is other
people's stuff okay I'm not just sitting
there posting my own stuff that's why it
becomes valuable and I also go to all
four of these different websites and
make sure that they are all aware of all
the other good articles that all of
their partners have or the I guess their
competitors in this situation and I have
found a lot of great websites in foreign
countries that I also post on to these
four guys so that's an example of some
places you can find some good
information I also go to technorati calm
and look for blogs that have something
to do with good posts that I have
recently created I look for to
technorati what it does is it ranks all
the websites based off of traffic so if
you type dieting in to technorati it's
going to pop back the top dieting blogs
well I can then jet go there go to the
forum sections look for people who
having trouble with their dining and in
post references to articles that i have
written so it's useful I'm not just
slamming them with garbage marketing
that will also get people to come to
your website and also use YouTube
chances are you're watching this video
on YouTube and what YouTube basically
does is instead of a cold and dead
website YouTube provides people the
opportunity to gravitate towards a real
person you're a real person now not just
a bunch of words and what you also have
to understand is over a third of time
spent online is spent watching video
that means that people are not using the
internet way they used to they are going
on and a third of the time they are
watching videos not reading your
articles also less than twenty percent
of traffic online goes to regular web
pages that means web pages do not have
video they're just a bunch of text
people are changing the way you use the
internet if you want to draw a traffic
you have to change the way that you use
your websites and I reiterate that
seventy percent of my website traffic
comes from YouTube so how do you do a
good YouTube video be funny or provide
original information i would not copy
what i do i know exactly what i should
be doing on youtube but i'm not doing it
because I'm unwilling to copy what other
people were doing that's really stupid
actually if you want to be successful on
YouTube you should really just copy make
as many videos as you can don't worry
about the quality of those videos either
I have one client who just posted videos
that they took with a telephone camera
which is terrible but they kept posting
them and post them and posting and they
dramatically increase their website
traffic just by putting these funny
videos up that they took with their
mobile phone if you want to know who to
copy copies a frank he is the king
almost everybody on youtube or anybody
who's successful at least to a certain
extent copies a frank and there's a link
here at the bottom of the screen to a
mash-up that i did of some of the best
things he's ever done and of course
obviously look at who's successful and
try to emulate them but don't emulate me
so i hope that helps i have a ton of
other things i could talk about in this
video but i'm gonna try and keep it
short hope that helps you out if you
have any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section below thanks
tracy for the good question until next
