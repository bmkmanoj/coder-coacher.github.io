typescript tutorial and this one
tutorial you're going to learn the core
syntax of typescript all in one video
and basically type scripts just going to
bring a type system as well as future
capabilities of JavaScript to you today
and anything you can do in JavaScript
you can put directly inside of
typescript and it's just going to work
so what I'm going to really focus in on
here is what makes typescript different
from JavaScript so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it now the very first
thing you're going to need to do is
you're going to have to compile
typescript into javascript so you're
going to need a compiler so what you're
going to want to do no matter what
operating system you're on you're going
to want to go to node.js org and you're
going to click on download I would just
go with this one right here recommended
for most users so just click on that guy
and click Next all a bunch of times
until that is installed on your system
then what you're going to want to do is
open up your terminal if you're on OSX
or Linux or your command prompt if you
are on Windows and you want to check
that NPM was installed at n p.m. so if
you are on OSX you're going to type in
sudo npm install NPM - G like this and
if you are on Windows you are just going
to knock the sudo port off right there
and you're going to run that guy the
only difference is is if you are on
Windows you may have to go in there and
log in as the administrator now it's
time for us to install typescript and
this is the same on every operating
system you're going to type in and PM
and install - g typescript and if you
can't tell them a little bit sick today
so that's why I sound weird so I
apologize for that and you do this on
every operating system and you will have
typescript installed now if you want to
be able to compile from typescript to
JavaScript what you're going to do is
type in TS c and you're going to do this
in the directory where you're going to
be saving your typescript files so let's
say you have a type script file called
Tut dot TS and for this tutorial i'm
going to target ECMAScript 5 because
this has compatibility everything I'm
going to do here is going to be
compatible with all browsers so you're
just going to type in es5 exactly like
that and whenever you do that that it's
going to compile all of your different
scripts and on OS x and on linux to
automatically compile every single time
i change a file what i'm going to do
this may work on Windows it may not so
you just have to test it out you're
going to go TSC star dot TS which is the
extension for typescript files watch and
then target es5 exactly like that and
whenever this runs it's automatically
going to compile everything from
typescript into JavaScript alright so
now we got all that set up let's jump
over and start writing some code okay so
I am using sublime text on the left side
of screen and just a regular old Google
Chrome browser on the right side and I
just have the files open up here inside
of the browser's I'm going to be making
changes to now the very first thing I'm
going to talk about is the typescript
way of handling variables now variables
are going to start off with either a
letter an underscore or a dollar sign
you're almost always going to start off
with a letter though and then after that
point you're going to have the ability
to put numbers inside of there now
declaring variables as statically typed
is going to be optional and if you only
provide a value like you normally do in
JavaScript it's going to automatically
figure out what the type is however if
you'd like to come in here and define
the type for your variables because
that's one good thing about typescript
just going to go VAR my name and then
you're going to follow that up with
string for example and then you're going
to type in something inside of here like
this and then put a semicolon
likewise if you want to go and use a
number just like you would with
JavaScript you're going to type number
and 41 for example you're going to be
able to create boolean so I could say
can vote olan boolean is equal to true
and boolean czar only going to be able
to have values of true or false
another option you're going to have is
to mark a variable as having any type
and in that situation it's going to be a
dynamic
type that's going to change based off of
the data you provide so if you type in
dog it's going to be a string however
you're going to be able to come in here
and put a number inside of it and it's
not going to throw an error if you would
try to throw numbers inside of strings
and so forth they will throw an error
otherwise so there is a rundown of the
different data types and like I said if
you do not provide a data type it's
going to infer based off of the value
you are providing I went and created
just a basic sort of HTML layout that's
what you see over here on the right side
of the screen and you can pause the
screen and type all this and also all
the code as well as a cheat sheet for
this video is available in the
description underneath the video
basically I'm going to show you how to
put information directly inside of this
paragraph element and then also you can
see right here is where all of my
typescript code is going to execute so
that is where you will see everything so
let's jump back over here so let's say
that I wanted to print in the defined
element once again
ts stuff so if I want to print inside of
there you're going to do that the same
way you do it with JavaScript so you're
going to go document.getelementbyid d
and I call that TS stuff and then we're
just going to go enter HTML
equal to and then I can say my name is
and then plus and my name and if I save
it let's bounce over here for one second
you're going to see that it compiles and
you didn't get any errors and you can
see 10:23 you know it just did that and
if I come over here and reload this
you're going to see my name is Derrick
pops up and it got that from right there
all right so that's one way you can put
information on your page another thing
it's important to understand is a
variable that does not get a value
assigned to it automatically gets the
value of undefined very often you're
going to assign a value of null if you
as the user want to show that a value
doesn't or a variable doesn't have a
value but you don't want to use
undefined null is very commonly used and
let's come in here and let's put some
more in
mention on our page so we can use
document.write just like we always do so
they go document and writes and if I
want to print directly inside of the
page I can say something like my name is
a and let's go and explore the different
data types you can see what the data
type is for a variable by just putting
type of and then throw in whatever you
want inside of there
and if you want to have a newline show
up inside of here you can just go and
throw a break statement inside of here
now let's go and get the different data
types for the other different variables
we defined here so let's throw that
inside of there and let's throw can vote
inside of there and let's throw can vote
inside of here as well as right there
and what's also throw in anything to see
what anything looks like whenever we ask
for its type anything and anything and
reload it and you're going to see can
vote comes back as a boolean my name is
a string and anything is a number again
it's going to change the data type for
this since it's in any depending upon
whatever data you have in here the last
thing you assigned is a number so it is
a number you're also there's a couple
different ways to convert strings into
numbers and numbers into strings I'm
going to show you all of them as the
tutorial continues but I'll just show
you one here string - nom and let's have
this be a number type and I can say
parse int like that and throw a string
inside of there and that's going to
convert that string into a number
likewise if you would like to come in
here and convert a number into a string
let's go and create var let's call this
num - string and number is equal to five
let's whip that up a little bit and then
we'll come down and convert this to a
string so we'll say document right num -
string is a that's out of there and
we'll say type of and then go
to string and you can call the to string
function and it's going to convert any
data type into a string for you break
statement I mean and before it run it
I'll just show you you can create
constants and so let's say we wanted PI
to be a constant you just go like this
and that just means the value is not
going to be able to change all right and
run it and you can see right there num2
string is a string and that's what we
were checking for right there so there's
a rundown on variables like I said as
the tutorial continues I'm going to show
you how other different ways to convert
strings and the numbers and numbers and
strings and things like that but now
let's briefly talk about interfaces now
interfaces can be used for a couple
different things what I'm going to show
here first is a way to create complex
data types since we were talking about
that ax types here a second ago so how
you do that is you go interface and you
could say superhero would be a complex
data type I'd like to create and let's
say that well I'm going to define what
data type it is it's going to contain
the real name as well as the super name
for our superheroes there that is and
make sure you put semicolons here at the
end alright so there's a complex type
that we can work with now what I'm going
to be able to do is do something like
Superman and say that it is of type
superhero and then I can define the
different things so I can say something
like Cora Clark Kents and super name and
to find that as Superman and then if I
want to go and get that information out
of this data type I can just say
Superman and then
real name and you're more than likely
always going to want to separate your
strings with plus signs is plus Superman
and I'll throw real name in there but
actually what I want is the super named
super name and reload it and Clark Kent
is Superman pops back there and like I
said there's going to be more on
interfaces below but now I'm going to
talk about arrays let's say we want to
create an array of strings how would we
do that well we'll just go our Louise
and string and then you would just
assign the different string values you
want assigned to your array so say we
want it Bob and Sally and Sam we just do
it like that
now if you would try to then push on a
value that was not a string onto the
array so for example if you would go and
do something like push and 5 that would
actually trigger an error and if I
compile it let's just compile it just
see what happens you're going to see
down here dah dah dah dah
error you see right here argument of
type num is not assignable to parameter
of type string okay so we're not going
to be able to do that so you're going to
have to make sure that anything you put
inside of this array is a string and if
we would want to come in here and print
out all of the different things that are
in our right just go employees to string
and we could do that load this and there
you can see they all print it out and
once again you could also go and store
your special interface types that you
created inside and rank it store
anything inside and write like I said
anything you can do with JavaScript you
can do with typescript so let's say that
I wanted to throw in superheroes
and this guy specifically is going to be
superhero Ray type I could then easily
push on a new superhero with push and
then define all these different things
that I want to throw inside of here
Bruce Wayne and the super named property
also and in this situation it would
Batman inside of there and likewise if I
would want to print out the information
that is on there or inside of there like
just go document right and superheroes
and since I want the very first item
inside of there I would do and get the
first index real name and follow that up
with is superheroes and once again we're
going to get the first index value
inside of there and to super name and
then of course throw a break statement
inside of there just like we did before
and reload and you can see indeed that
that worked like I said quick
run-through of a raise and how we can
work with them inside of typescript and
everything else we do in JavaScript is
the same now let's go take a real brief
look at how we can do some things with
math all right so just a couple little
things here if we want to go to a
document right and let's say 1/2 5 + 4
is equal to if we want to go and put a
math function inside of here you would
go and put your parentheses like that
and you go 5 + 4 and throw in a break
statement and of course you're going to
be able to use all of the different
calman math types
- and - of course for subtraction
multiplication publication division and
then modulus which is going to give you
the remainder of a division and there
you can see all those answers right
there it's so ever very important to
understand that if you would go in and
try to add anything to a string that
everything will be considered a string
let me show you exactly what I mean by
that so if I would say something like
five plus string - is going to be equal
to and I would do something like five
plus and there's a string - whenever I
run that guy you're going to see that 52
comes back so anytime you add a number
to a string it's going to consider that
five that number to be a string and the
one thing that comes up almost every
time I do one of these tutorials is a
misunderstanding of how plus plus
increment or
at work so I'm going to show you another
example here so let's just do document
right I'm going to define this variable
first I'm going to go random number and
number is equal to 1 now what I'm going
to do is go random number plus plus is
going to be equal to and then plus
random number plus plus plus and then
throw a break statement inside of there
then I'm going to duplicate this to show
you the multiple different ways this
works and all this does is increase the
value of random number by one or
decrease the value by one ok so that is
all we're doing right there so of course
we need change of this guy right here
put the plus plus in the front negative
negative
and then negative negative and run it
and there you can see the value here is
one why you're probably saying yourself
well you added one to it if I didn't
make this clear this is exactly the same
as if we would go random number is equal
to random number plus one these guys are
exactly the same so random number plus
plus there's only one thing that
differentiates them whenever you put the
plus plus at the end what is going to
happen here is it's going to call the
document right to print it out on the
screen and then if it's at the end here
it's like it doesn't exist
it's going to print out whatever the
current value of random number is which
is one just like we defined it right
here then after it prints it out on the
screen then it's going to increment it
if however you put the plus plus in the
beginning it's going to first increment
it and then print it likewise it's going
to print the current value after it's
done then it's going to decrement it
down here it's going to decrement it
first and then print out the new value
and that's the reason why you see the
odd incrementing and decrementing there
hopefully I have cleared that up and now
let's jump over and take a look at some
conditional statements now if and switch
and the ternary operator are going to
operate exactly the same way inside of
typescript as they do with
the script one thing is a little bit
different however is the let operator
and basically variables defined with let
inside of blocks don't change the value
of variables outside of the blocks so
that didn't make any sense let me come
in here and I will demonstrate so let's
say we go sample let 1 2 3 and then
inside of an if statement we say
something like true and in here we go
let's sample let's and we try to change
the value 2 4 5 6 and then outside of
here we go and try to print this and we
want to see if the value has changed for
this plus break statement right normally
whenever we do this you would expect the
value to change to 4 5 6 however as you
can see right there it did not and that
is because of let let's come in here and
I'll do exactly the same thing but I'll
use var just to show you the differences
between the let and var we're going to
do exactly the same thing here so let's
just copy all this paste that inside of
there and like I said change this the
bar and nothing else has changed so this
is basically the difference between let
and var and I'm going to demonstrate
here that when you reload it if you use
var inside of a block statement whenever
you change the value of it that it is
going to change the value outside of the
block statement if however you use let
and you change the value inside here
using let it will not change the value
for that variable right so that's the
major difference between the different
conditional statements inside of
typescript versus inside of JavaScript
and now let's take a look at looping
alright so looping also is going to work
the same in typescript as it does in
JavaScript however there is another
operator called for of and I'll show you
why it's useful so it's very common
let's go and create ourselves a random
array which is going to have the values
of 5 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;amp; 4 in is a
function we're very used to using inside
of JavaScript so we would say something
like and define a value in random array
and then let's decide if we want to
print this out so we'll say something
like value and our burg statement run it
and you're going to see whenever you go
to print that out what did it do it
printed out the indexes for the array
remember arrays start is 0 1 2 3 now
what we're going to be able to do with
typescript is use something called for
of and I'll demonstrate something else
for it let's say that you would want to
convert a number array which is what we
have into a string array how easy is
that to do when you just go string array
is equal to random array and use the map
function and convert everything into a
string it's a pretty cool stuff and not
what we're going to do is use for of and
how you do that is you go var and the
value of and here I'll use the string
array and come in here and put exactly
the same thing so say value and the
break statement and run it and you're
going to see instead of printing out the
indexes in this situation they actually
print the real values so there is four
of and something useful the typescript
can do so now let's go and take a pretty
deep look at functions now with
functions you're going to be able to
assign the variables types for the
attributes as well as the return types
after the attributes which might be a
little bit weird and if you don't have
anything returning from a function you
would put void inside of there so I'm
going to show you a whole bunch so let's
go and create something called get some
this is our function and it is going to
receive a number and we're going to
define the datatype for that number and
it's going to rich also get another
number you can see how I'm putting the
datatype afterwards then after that it
is going to return a number so that's
where we put the return type and we can
just come in and go return m1 plus num2
and then if we want to call our function
now let's go variable the
some one and I'm going to define that it
gets a number value and we can go and
call get some and pass in the values of
five and two then if we want to print
out some information we could command
and do something like five plus two is
equal to and then inside of here we will
actually call the someone run it and you
will see that it goes and passes that
inside of there and we get the proper
value that we were expecting to get now
you're also going to be able to define
or assign a default value inside of a
function declaration and also if an
attribute isn't required you're going to
be able to show that with a question
mark
so let's come in here and I'll go
horrible our variable get difference is
equal to function once again we're going
to do the same type of thing we're going
to go num1 and define that that is a
number go in again two and define that
that is a number and in this situation
if we would like to assign a let's get
rid of that all together let's get rid
of the definition that that's a number
but instead define a default value we
can do so by just going numb two is
equal to two and like I said previously
if you do not know if you're going to
get a value or not you put a question
mark after at the very end of it and
then if you wanted to find the datatype
you do it after the question mark again
we can say number is the return type for
this guy and then if we want to check if
we actually received a value for the
number three we can say if typeof num
three is not equal to and here is
undefined that means nothing was passed
inside of it well in that situation we
can return num1 - num2 - um three and
then otherwise we didn't get a value we
can just say num1 - num2 and now we'll
be able to test how exactly those are
going to work for us let's come in
and do document.write and inside of here
we'll say five minus two is going to be
equal to and we'll call get difference
get difference and in this situation we
can just pass a five inside of there and
everything is going to work perfectly
fine because the default value of two is
going to be used in that situation
otherwise we'll be able to come in here
and we'll be able to go five minus two
minus three is equal to and once again
we will call get difference and in this
situation we'll pass a five a two and a
three inside of there save it
reload it and there you can see that it
works out perfectly fine another thing
that is very very useful is that we will
be able to come in here and receive an
unknown number of values and we'll be
using what's called the rest parameter
to do that so we could do something like
some all and here is our function and
the rest parameter is going to look like
dot dot and nums like this and then we
define that is a number of Ray and like
I said previously if there is nothing
returned from a function we type void
inside of there and here what I'm going
to use is reduce with our array to add
all the values together and to do that
we go sum is equal to gnomes reduce and
this is going to receive an A and B
value use our fat arrow here a plus B
and the default value that we're going
to start off with whenever we're summing
these so what it's going to do is reduce
is going to allow us to cycle through
the array that gets passed inside of
here it's going to get the first and
second value out of our array add those
together and it's going to continue
adding them together until we get to the
end of the array and this right here
just defines that the initial value for
our final value sum is going to start
off at zero and if you want to learn a
little bit more about reduce and also
the map function that I talked about
previously take a look
I learned a program part 12 tutorial
series I cover them in immense detail
and they are very very powerful
functions that are available in multiple
different programming languages alright
so now that I went and joined all those
together what I can come in here and do
is go document write and we'll just say
some and it'll throw some inside of here
and then outside of here we can call and
pass in a whole bunch of different
values and like I said it doesn't know
how many it's just going to store them
all in the number of RAC and if we run
it you're going to see that it was
automatically able to come in there and
sum all those values for us and the
final thing we want to talk about is the
arrow functions that are available for
you inside a type script and basically
arrow functions don't include function
inside of the definition so we can say
something like add 1 is equal to and
then say that we expect to get a value
passed inside of here then we're going
to have our fat arrow and we're going to
define exactly what we want to do with
that item passed inside of the function
which is add 1 to it and then we're
going to be able to do something like 1
plus 1 is equal to and then we'll call
add 1 + 1 reload it and of course it
comes in there and calculates that and
as the digital continues we'll also take
some additional looks at arrow functions
but now I want to jump over and talk
about classes ok so classes are going to
describe real world objects by defining
their attributes in this situation
attributes are known as fields and those
real world objects capabilities which
are known as methods so let's say I want
to come in here and I wanted to define
an animal class that I'm going to use to
model real world animal objects well
inside of here I would be able to define
class fields so let's say that every
animal is going to have a favorite food
I'm going to define that inside of there
and public just means that I will be
able to easily come in here and change
this value I'll show you what private
and how it
later on we would also be able to create
static fields inside of here and by
saying static fields this means that the
value of this you know this field inside
of here is going to be shared by every
object so let's say that I wanted to
keep track of every time I created a new
animal type I could do so and I'm going
to start off with zero because I haven't
created an animal type yet and very
often also static fields inside of
classes are going to be attributes that
don't make sense for the animal to have
but they are something still that we
would like to keep track of so animals
normally aren't able to count so in this
situation we are going to make that
static but like I said this is going to
be a value that is going to be shared
between every single animal object that
has ever created and that's what static
means and if you want to initialize or
set certain values every time a new
object is created you use a function
that is called
a constructor and something neat about
tripes typescript is if you mark an
attribute as private the value is
automatically going to be assigned to a
variable and the variables going to be
created in everything so let's say that
all of our animals are going to be given
a name value and also that we would like
a owner to be assigned to every single
animal that we ever create we'll put
that inside of there and then remember
we also want to increment num of animals
every sign every time a new animal type
object is created and to do that we have
to call animal num all the animals and
then let's increment it so anytime you
want to call for a static class field
you have to precede it with whatever the
class name is all right so let's keep
adding to the capabilities of this now
you're going to be able to find methods
or capabilities for your animal objects
using private but if you do so you are
not going to be able to see them in any
subclasses or classes that are created
from the
the animal type in this situation more
on that in a second I'll actually show
you how to do that
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
steer clear of using private in this
situation and let's say that I wanted to
create a function here that's going to
provide me some owner information and we
will come in and we'll get some owner
information so let's go this and this is
going to provide us with a way to
reference an object and get its name
property even though we don't know what
the object's name is so that's the
chicken or the egg sort of situation
since we create the class that defines
what all the objects do before we create
the objects we obviously don't know what
the objects name is so if we want to
refer to an object inside of the class
we use this alright anything that I say
here it doesn't make sense leave a
question in the comment section and I
will elaborate but I think you probably
know if you're learning typescript the
difference between all those so we'll
say something like this and get the name
of the animal is owned by and then let's
go and get the owner of this object so
we'll say this owner and once again
we'll call that and demonstrate how all
these different guys work here in a
second you can also have static methods
which are going to be class methods and
how you would create them is go static
let's say we want to find out how many
animals were created you can just go in
there and create that guy and here we're
going to say that it doesn't receive
anything but it returns a number and
what it's going to return is remember if
we want to access a static field we have
to precede it with whatever the class's
name is and we're going to return that
value and also you're going to be able
to define getters and setters so once
again we're going to make this private
and define a weight in this situation
let's say our animals are going to be
touchy about providing their weight
we're going to be able to then go get
weight and it's going to return a
number and then will say return this and
wait and also if we want to set our wait
it's going to have a wait past inside of
it that is going to be a number and then
we'll just go this and the wait property
is equal to whatever the wait they
passed inside of there and we use
getters and setters so that we in this
situation if they passed in a wait they
contain like a string that didn't make
sense we could just disregard it but
otherwise we're just going to leave it
the way it is all right so we just
created a class to define animal objects
let's go and create some animal objects
so if you want to create an animal
object in this situation we could create
one called spot and how we do that is we
say new animal and we get passed inside
of here the name of the animal as well
as who owns the animal we could then go
spot and we could call the owner info
print out that information let's go and
run it you'll see spot is owned by Doc
and that's what owner info does for us
and then if we want to come in here and
call for the setter for the wait do so
just like that don't have to actually
call a function we just put a dot at the
end of it and set it we then wanted to
come in here and get spots wait
we could go spots wait is and then just
type in spot wait there you go spots
wait is 100 let's go in there and call
our static method we created to find out
how many animals we have created so in
this situation we'll say num of animals
if we want to call that we have to
precede it with whatever the class name
is and then whatever the function is we
want to call and that's how many animals
and reload it and you're going to see a
number of animals is one because we
created one total animal object alright
so remember I said that we're going to
be able to create subclasses from these
classes so what what that basically
means is we're going to be able to
inherit all the methods and fields from
another class using an operator called
extends and of course you would also be
able to add additional methods and
fields as well as overwrite methods that
you would want to change in some way so
let's say we want to create a new class
called
and it's going to extend the animal
class so that means it's just going to
get all the methods and fields provided
by it we can then create a new
constructor and in this situation let's
just say that we're going to be able to
get a name and as well as a owner we're
not going to change that we could change
it of course and if we just want the
original class to handle the
initialization of this brand-new dog
object we would just pass in using super
that references the animals constructor
so this guy right here super calls this
that's what super does and then we can
just pass in name an owner and that
would automatically be created for us
and then we could go dog and we could
also go numb of animals because we are
going to get that by default and let's
go and create a new dog object just to
see what that looks like so let's go
ball create one called Grover is equal
to new dog Grover and let's say that
somebody named Jimmy owns Grover and
then let's go and see how many animals
we have so we say num of animals and we
will call animal dot how many animals
another thing is a little bit useful
here is we could find out if a dog is
actually inheriting from animal and how
we would do that is let's go and do
something like is a dog and animal then
inside of here go throw some parentheses
up inside of there and we could say
something like Grover instance of animal
and another useful thing is we could
check to see if a field exists for an
object so before we call it we want to
check to make sure to use this we could
do so so we say something like does
Grover have a name and how we find out
if that exists as we go parenthesis and
we go name which
is the field that we're looking for and
see if it's inside of Grover or not and
let's run that and there you can see
number of animals comes back as two
because we created a new dog object is a
dog and animal comes back is true and
does Grover have a name for a field or
property and that also comes back it's
true okay so there's a rundown of some
different things we can do with classes
with type script now let's take a second
look at interfaces now you can think of
interfaces as defining a contract in
which if a class is going to implement
the interface it must create all the
functions defined inside of the
interface so let's say that I wanted to
create a contract in which that's going
to apply to all vehicle types that we
create and the contracts basically going
to say if you're going to have a vehicle
you're going to have to have a drive
function inside of it and it's going to
return any type of data type all right
so how we can apply this is we could
coming down here instead and there's so
many awesome things we can do with
interfaces that I'm not going to be able
to really get into in this part of the
tutorial I have tutorials on
object-oriented design that gets enjoyed
very deep and design patterns and things
like that but I'm just going to keep it
simple here so what we're going to do is
I'm going to create a constructor and
this constructor is going to have a
property called wheels passed inside of
it and of course it's going to be a
number and that's going to automatically
initialize number of wheels for my
vehicle now since I implemented the
vehicle interface that means I need to
create our drive function and what drive
is going to do in this situation is it
is just going to print out some
information and that is all it's going
to do so it's going to do something like
simple stuff here the car drives
with and then we're going to just go and
get the number of wheels so I'll say
this wheels and then let's also come in
here and we'll say wheels
let's go like this rid of that all
together and then we'll say wheels and
put a space inside of there now we'll do
something very very similar with a
bicycle actually it's going to do almost
exactly the same thing paste that inside
of there create a new one called bicycle
implements vehicle it's also going to
get wheels passed inside of it and the
only real difference here is I'm just
going to say bicycle drives this wheels
nothing else changes everything's
exactly the same and then let's come
down here and we'll create a car and a
bicycle so I'm going to go our car is
equal to the new car and it's going to
have four wheels and I'm going to do the
same thing for bike is equal to and here
we'll say new bicycle and it's going to
have two wheels and now what I can do is
just go car and call for Drive to
execute and bike and have Drive execute
on bike we save it reload it you're
going to see the car drives with well
undefined wheels what did I do wrong
here oh this is wheel instead of wheels
so just change that to wheels change
that to wheels and reload it and now you
can see the car drives with four wheels
the bicycle drives with two wheels so
another example of what we can do with
interfaces and now we will take a look
at generic functions okay so we use
generic functions when we want to be
able to work with multiple data types in
similar way so ever and I'll just an
example here so let's say we have
something like function get type and
then what we're going to do here is to
create a generic function we're going to
place one or more data type markers in
angled brackets just as you see right
here and this is going to be after our
function name and then we're going to
use those data type markers instead of
actual data types so this guy is going
to be passed some value and once again
we're going to put in those data type
markers right there and then what it's
going to do is it's going to return a
string and for example we could say
something like return
then we could call type of and value in
this situation now let's go and create a
couple of these guys so we'll say we
have something like a string and we'll
just give it the value of a string
create another variable called a number
and let's give that a number value and
then we're going to pass two different
data types directly inside of this
generic function and it is just going to
work for us so we can go get type pass
in a string inside of there and then
we'll do exactly the same thing for our
number and the DA and wrote it and
you're going to say that these
completely different data types are
passed in their function handled them
perfectly however and print it out the
different data types depending upon what
data types for passed inside now where
this gets really useful is let's go back
to our example where we have our
interface with vehicles and the cars and
the bicycles alright so what this is
going to allow us to do with a generic
function is that it's going to allow us
to accept any class that implements an
interface and our interface in this
situation is going to be vehicle so we
could say something like function and
get wheels and then we can come in and
say W extends vehicle okay so it's going
to work with anything that is going to
have the vehicle interface and vehicle
and W in this situation is going to be
our data type marker and then is going
to return a number which is going to be
the number of wheels then we can just
come in and say return vehicle drive and
call that function and then just go get
wheels and pass car inside of there and
also call it whenever we pass bike
inside of there and run it and you're
going to see that we were able to pass
in those totally different types just as
long as they had the vehicle interface
that they implement it and it
automatically worked for those two
different completely different object
types now another thing you're going to
be able to do is actually work with
generic classes and they're going to
actually work with multiple different
data types so we could say class and
generic number put in
our marker inside of here and then we'll
throw another arrow function inside of
here that is going to add values so it's
going to go value one which is going to
be of some type of data we don't know
what it is and value two also some type
of data and then it's going to return
the same type of data that was passed
inside of it now we can come in and say
a number is equal to new generic number
and when this situation we will define
that we will be working with numbers
inside of here so now we know what T is
in this situation then we can actually
come in and define how we want ad to
work with our number type and to do so
we just go a number add is equal to and
pass in our function and we're going to
say that it's going to receive an x and
y value and it is going to return X plus
y by : n semicolon and we commanding say
five plus four is equal to and call a
number and the specific add function
pass a five and a four inside of there
throw in a break statement and there we
go
likewise we could come in and do define
exactly how a string is going to work
with this generic class let's come in
here once again this is a string no
comments by the way or like this so like
I said if it's works in JavaScript it's
going to work in typescript so in this
situation we're going to work with
strings instead so I'm going to call
this a string number again it's going to
be a generic number except it's going to
receive it's going to work with strings
in this situation for our data marker
then I have to come down here and decide
how strings are going to be treated
differently so it's still going to
receive two values just like we had
before of course it has to stick by the
role that we have here that it's going
to receive two values however in this
situation if we want to convert into a
string this is another way to convert
values and strings just put string in
front of it with the two parenthesis and
then we're going to be receiving strings
what I want to do is up I want to
convert a string into a number we can
just type in number
with parentheses and convert the X
string into a number and then add it to
the Y value that has passed the side of
there and then of course everything is
going to be converted into a string
after that to return that and now I can
come in here and do something like 5
plus 6 is equal to and here we're going
to call this a string num and then we'll
go add and here what we're going to do
is put and convert these into numbers so
let's convert that into five plus six
with two strings and if we run it you're
going to see that five plus four comes
back as being equal to nine and the
reason why this guy didn't pop up is I
didn't come in here and do this properly
let's go string number all right so now
that matches perfectly and run it and
five plus six is equal to eleven so
there you go that's how we can use
generic classes now what I'm going to do
is talk about destructuring which is
going to provide a way for us to assign
multiple values on one line so for
example let's say we had var and random
vowels is equal to and we'll have X
colon 1 and y1 2 and z : 3 now if I
would want to automatically take the
value that's assigned to x y&amp;amp;z and
assign those two separate variables it's
actually going to be very easy to do
what we're going to do just go var like
this and then put X Y &amp;amp; Z inside of
there it's going to pull those values
out of random values just as you had set
right there and come in here and print
this out just so you can see that that
indeed is going to work for us so we'll
say something like X plus y plus Z and
throw our break statement inside of
there and this is also going to work for
arrays so let's go and get XY and Z
inside of our array and let's flip them
so we'll say Z Y and X that's how easy
it is to flip an array and once again we
can go and call document write to print
out that information and here we'll say
switch plus and there's XY and Z and
save it and read
Oh tit and there you can say we put we
went and added those values together
right like this and here we went and
switched the values inside of the right
and printed those out on the screen
right so two more little guys I'd like
to show you the make typescript
different and one of the really cool
things or template strings and this is
going to allow us to create multi-line
strings so example we could say
something like var multi quily
and what we're going to do is do the
back quote like that's in the upper left
hand corner of your keyboard and you
could say something like I go on or many
lines and like I said you're going to
end that with a back quote and we can go
document right print that out but
something that's even cooler yet is
we'll be able to go document right once
again with the back quote and let's say
we wanted to do we want to throw like we
want bold this guy we come in and do a
dollar sign curly brackets and multiple
string multi-line string whatever come
outside of that put a bold tag inside of
there finish it off with a back quote
and run it and there you can see that we
were able to go in there and bold that
guy then I'll also one more thing is the
spread operator which is kind of cool
and this is going to allow us to
separate values in an array into
attributes in a function so let's say we
wanted to come in here and create a
function called the sum gets XY and Z
and doesn't return anything document
right and here we go sum plus and we'll
get X plus y plus Z and then throw in
our break statement and now let's create
an array args is equal to four five and
six and then we'll call the sum and we
want to pass these individual parts of
this array and have them go in XY and Z
instead of passing an array we just go
do some dot dot and go args and it's
automatically going to work for us and
you can see right there the sum comes
back is 15 some kind of cool stuff and
of course finally we can also use
numerator types and we go eeen um and do
something like emotion
and happy we could set the default
starting value it's going to start off
at zero otherwise or we could have it
set for 1 and sad and also helps get rid
of that sad and angry and just like we
would do with JavaScript we could set
those values in motion happy and that
would be equivalent to saying my feeling
is equal to one alright so there you go
guys there is a rough overview of a lot
of the different cool things we can do
with typescript like I said all the code
as well as a cheat sheet is in the
description underneath the video and
like always please leave your questions
