2 of my how to design a website tutorial
I have received a ton of requests from
you guys to take this basic theme that
we created in part 1 of this tutorial
series and then take the components that
I have created sense which are cross
browser and make them work inside of
that WordPress theme here's the featured
content tool and there's links to these
tutorials if you missed them by chance
and there is our little product slider
so basically the end goal is to take
those two components and combine them
into our final theme which is what you
see right here and I'm gonna try my best
to explain exactly what goes into doing
that the first thing you're gonna want
to do is you want to take those folders
that contain all the code for those two
separate components the product slider
just so you understand is this guy right
here and it's called JQ slider - that's
the name I gave it and then this is just
the Kota slider this is the featured
content tool what I want to do is drop
those two folders directly into my theme
in a zipped archive with all this stuff
combined is available underneath this
video so you don't have to worry about
that I got these two guys that I'm
dropping them directly into my regular
theme folder inside of WordPress and
this is the themes folder which is
inside of WP content and I just dropped
those folders to breakfast I'd of there
now I gotta go in and access that code
I'm gonna start off with the code slider
I'm gonna go inside of index dot HTML
inside of my code of slide or folder and
I'm gonna copy some of this information
from inside of here over into my header
file so I'm gonna need for link to my
style sheets for the code of slider so
I'm just gonna highlight those right
here this is kind of an advanced topic
but you guys asked for it so I'm gonna
give it to you I'm gonna copy all of
that this is blinx to all the style
sheets and all the jQuery code that is
needed to operate this guy then I'm
gonna jump over into my header dot PHP
file and right inside of the head
section right after title I'm gonna
paste that information inside it then
what I need to do is actually point at
these new locations where this
information actually exists to make this
guy work so then to do that inside of
WordPress I need to go inside of H
reference and I'm gonna type in PHP type
in blog info and if I want to point at
the template directory or the deck
directory for my theme I have to type in
blog info template URL
and then close that off and then close
off my PHP Section what this piece of
code is going to do is it's going to
jump out there and so I don't
automatically grab the reset dot CSS
file in this situation and place it
inside of there so that it grabs it from
the proper folder and I'm gonna have to
do this multiple different times and of
course I'm gonna have to put a forward
slash in there and type in coda
slider - to none another forward slash
and that's gonna get that file inside of
the folder if you don't know what I mean
let's take a look at so this is code
slide or - style sheets reset CSS well
we open this up we go code a slide or
two that's this folder right here style
sheets and there is reset CSS if you
can't see it there it is right there on
your screen so this is what I'm pointing
at so I just have to tell it where it
exists inside of my feet all right now
basically I have to do this over and
over again so I'm just gonna highlight
this and copy that and then jump down
here and paste that right in there it's
gonna work again and then for the java
scripts area i'm just gonna copy this
part right here which is gonna point to
my themes directory i'm gonna paste
directly inside of there forward slash
tota slider to and now it's gonna be
able to grab that information as well
let's just copy this and then we can
just paste it inside of there and paste
it again inside of there and pretty much
everything is going to be pulled in just
with those couple little edits there and
just to prove to you that it actually
works I'm gonna file save it then I'm
gonna have to jump into index dot HTML
again I'm gonna have to come down here
and later we're gonna make this 100%
WordPress meaning dynamic but for now
what I'm gonna do is jump down inside of
here and just grab what I need just to
prove to you that it's all working and
to do that I'm gonna come right here
this is the actual beginning of the code
a slider I'm gonna select everything
past nav thumbs until it gets to right
here where the code of slider wrapper
ends and I'm gonna copy that then I'm
gonna jump over into index dot PHP again
I'm inside of my theme right now and
inside of WordPress basically you're
gonna want to make all of your changes
in this situation if this is an artist
or template right around the art layout
cell area or right around in this area
this is called the loop if you haven't
seen any of my other tutorials I know
you're confused and you're gone so let's
just come in here and we're gonna
highlight this and we're just gonna get
rid of the loop because I've decided I
don't need the loop in this situation
and
come the whole way down here and then
I'm gonna paste in my new coat of slider
information and I'm gonna file save this
let's see what happened just so there's
a couple little changes reload it and
you can see the feature content tool is
there however the images are not oh the
reason why is I'm not pointing at them
yet
so I can easily fix that make this guy
go away I'm gonna scroll the code slider
up here and point at the actual location
for all of these images so what do you
think we're gonna do we're gonna cheat
and we're gonna go up to the header and
I'm gonna come right here where we were
able to point at the theme directory and
then down here where we go to code a
slide or two I'm gonna copy that and
jump back down into index tile PHP and
then I have to point at the actual
location for the images so we're just
gonna paste this inside of there get rid
of this guy scroll down paste that
inside of there paste that inside of
there I'm just pointing at the images
folder inside of the theme directory and
then do the same thing for the thumbnail
even though it's in essence the same
sort of thing that's it
file save it reload it and you can see
there it is there's the feature content
tool and it's gonna work perfectly and
later on I'm going to show you how to
make it more dynamic so that all the
images that show up inside of here are
really cool and dynamic well now let's
go and get our little product
information to show up inside of there
this is gonna be a little bit tougher
basically what I need to do for this guy
to work is I again need to drag the
folder jq' slider into the theme
directory just like we previously had
done so I'll just jump back there and
there it is Jake you slide or to so I
just drag this through it in my theme
directory and then what I'm gonna need
to do is go into jQuery to taught a CH
tml and I'm gonna take this information
in here in regards to the actual code
that we created I'm gonna put that in a
separate file so that I don't have this
junking up my whole entire WordPress
thing it's pretty simple I'm just gonna
come here gonna select all the code from
that component stroll down here don't
need to include script I'm gonna copy
that and I'm going to create a new file
called jQuery products slider and then I
just pasted that code inside of there
it's jQuery product slider dot J yes and
then I'm gonna make a little tiny bit of
a change I'm gonna put document dot
ready inside of here to make sure that
this function fires as soon as the
document has loaded so that's all I did
I copied my old code and I saved it in a
separate file in a JavaScript full
inside of the jquery slider you don't
quite get this leave a comment below
I'll try to explain it better okay so
now what are we gonna need to do well
we're gonna jump into our jQuery - dot
HTML this is where all the component
information is stored and again we're
gonna take out all the styling and save
it to a separate file so we're gonna
come in here and copy this copy it and
then in the CSS folder of the jQuery
slider - component I'm gonna create a
new file called jQuery product slider
dot CSS and I'm gonna paste in all of
that CSS styling inside of that guy and
I'm gonna file save it now basically I
took all the component parts out of that
one file and I'm gonna spread them apart
into different files in different
folders this is how you design websites
so that your theme and your whole entire
web design isn't all junked up with all
times of code there's like I said it's a
little bit more advanced than what I
normally do don't worry the next part of
the tutorial be much easier to
understand then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna come in here to the actual
component and I'm gonna grab all of the
required code to make this guy work I'm
gonna copy that and then I'm gonna go
back into my header dot PHP file and I'm
also coming gonna come here and say end
of coda JavaScript and beginning of code
style sheets kind of break that up a
little bit and come down here beginning
of jQuery slider JavaScript these
comments really really really help out
hey let's paste this inside of here and
then what I'm gonna need to do I'm gonna
steal this from up here where it's
pointing at my theme copy that and paste
directly inside of here so this is gonna
be the location for a jQuery slider so
I'm gonna go JQ slider to four slash CSS
and I'm gonna do the exactly the same
thing again down here paste that side of
there I'm down here
paste that inside of there and this is
the actual code for getting my web font
to work and let's just jump up there and
keep this out of the other mess and
paste it inside of there there's one
thing that I forgot in regards to jQuery
code and that would be the individual
file that we just created so I'm just
gonna copy this paste that inside of
there and then right here take this out
and I'm going to pay reference to the J
- product - slider AES file which we
created later earlier in the tutorial
and I'm gonna copy this and then put end
of jQuery slider JavaScript copy this
beginning of jQuery slider and then this
is gonna be style sheets I'll link out
to the style sheets and uh and let's
file save that and again just so you
remember I'm in header dot PHP that's
where I'm putting all this code then I'm
gonna link out to the one style sheet
that I have if you don't remember it's
called jQuery product slider we just
created this a second ago by copying and
pasting so jump back into the header
section and I'm just gonna copy this
save myself some time
good copy go down here paste inside of
there and then because I'm gonna be
pointing at the jQuery slider folder and
then I have my style sheets in a CSS
folder and like I said before it's in
jQuery prod slider dot CSS what's file
save that and then basically we've just
got a copy the HTML that we had
previously and it was inside of this div
called demo so I'm just gonna copy that
this is why it's nice to always put
comments I know we're demo ends so I'm
gonna copy that jump into index scroll
down here cut a slider wrapper and then
paste all that code inside of there and
there you could see it went and bounced
itself in of course they can't find the
images we're gonna fix that a sec and
now we're gonna do that basically
copying just like we did before so I'm
gonna go to my directory for my theme
just change couple things up here paste
inside of there and then we're just
gonna go J you slide ur two images and
then copy this down to the next images
for the next image paste that inside of
there I'm down to the next one right
patients are there jump back over here
reload and there you can see the
components are in place in the next part
of this tutorial I'm gonna show you how
to fix little errors that crop up like
for the fact this are gonna need to be a
margin on the left side of here and then
there's other little things that I'm
gonna play with to make it look all nice
and tight leave any questions or
comments below whether why still next
