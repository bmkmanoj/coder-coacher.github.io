tutorial on how to convert App Inventor
apps into Java Android apps or if you
have been watching my beginner's Android
tutorial basically I want to let you in
on a secret you already know how to make
Java Android apps you just don't know it
yet but after the next two videos you
will definitely know it so let's go and
take a look at the app we're gonna make
and here is my zombie app and if you
touch it it's gonna play sounds and get
latitude and longitude for eight three
seven four six four five some B's
longitude is minus seventy nine point
eight three five one six nine six one
and if you shake it it's also going to
react to that and play additional sounds
and now I'll go over all of the things
this app does it looks simple but it
does a ton of things okay so there it is
the zombie app we're going to be making
this guide and like I said what I'm
going to cover here is how to layout
layouts as well as components how to
catch events how to play sounds how to
vibrate the phone how to use the GPS to
get location data how to set the icon
how to open a pop-up how to start
another activity from your app how to
convert text to speech and most
importantly how to convert an app
inventor app into Java so let's go and
take a look at how we're going to do
this basically I have the finished app
right here inside of App Inventor and
then over here I have what is called
eclipse and inside of Eclipse this is a
very common tool for developing Android
applications you're going to see how
easy it is and as well in the
description underneath this video I'm
going to have a link to my tutorial on
how to install Eclipse but it's pretty
easy and we might as well just get into
this so basically what we're going to do
over inside of Eclipse and this is going
to be a two-part tutorial we're going to
come over here and we're just going to
go new I'm going to right click there
and go new and then you might not see
Android so you're going to come down
here and say other and then this guy's
going to open up
and you want specifically to create an
Android application project now we're
going to be doing some crazy things with
this but let's just click on next right
now and I'm gonna give this the name
hello zombie there it is and then right
here this confuses people all the time
I'm gonna type in new think-tank what
you're supposed to type there is a
domain name you own so that this is
unique if you don't have one just type
your name in there just do it in all
lowercase letters though and so that's
what that is and you can leave
everything else be exactly the same as
it is and hit next again and this is
going to pop up you don't need to do
anything here we're actually going to
destroy that part there hit next again
and this is where you're going to be
able to select your icon but like I said
we're not going to do that hit next
again make sure you have blank activity
selected but it really doesn't matter
then hit next again and then you're
going to get this guy right here you can
give it a name but I'm just gonna let it
be main activity don't worry about the
fragment part we're going to deal with
that and then hit finish and it's going
to do some stuff and then it's going to
create your little application here it's
also going to have a little X in there
that's going to say that something's
wrong don't worry about it we're gonna
fix everything we're gonna open this guy
up and I'm going to take a look at all
of the different folders here I'm not
going to explain them I'm just going to
start using them and of course you can
always leave a question below all right
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to open up this stuff and I'm gonna go
get all of the things I'm going to need
for my app to work and of course I'm
going to have all this stuff in a link
in the description for the video so
you'll be able to download it I'm going
to go inside my App Inventor folder and
then inside of Hello zombie right here
and here are all the things we're going
to need this is going to be the icon
we're going to use this is going to be
the library that we're going to use it's
called Lib simple Android runtime it's
going to make it easy for us to make
Android apps in Java
there's zombie there zombie attack and
there is on bemoan so what we need to do
is put all these different components in
the right folder in Eclipse
so the first thing we're going to do is
get this over here it's called a jar
file and we're going to drag it over to
our libs folder and drop it right inside
of there
we're going to say copy files okay and
now you can see Lib simple Android
runtime is inside of the libs folder and
that's inside of the hello zombie next
we're going to get our icon and we are
going to drag it over into what's called
drawable hdpi
we're going to say okay copy files again
and there is the icon that we're going
to be using and then we need all of our
stuff for our assets folder and all of
that stuff is going to be our splatter
background so there's the splatter
background grab that drag it over here
drop it in the assets folder hit copy
again there we go and you can now see
that it's over here and assets jump back
over here again we're also going to need
the zombie pang which is going to be a
background thing drag and drop that into
assets and then we're going to get both
of these WAV files and drop those into
assets as well okay and there we go all
the stuff is in the right folders and
that is all we're going to need to do
with this guy right here and just as a
refresher we'll come over here and
you'll see that we have the same sort of
things this is actually the zombie moan
wav file there's a splatter background
there's a zombie pang there is the
zombie attack wav file and there's a
zombie icon
okay so exactly the same sort of things
that we just did so now basically what I
have to do is come in here and create
the label the label is right here this
guy right there and also create the
horizontal arrangements the zombie
buttons a zombie moan sound attack the
accelerometer location sensor notifier
activity starter and the text-to-speech
in Java it's way easier than you think
it would be so what we're going to do
come back over into eclipse again and
you're going to be doing all your work
in mainactivity.java so you can just
come up here and close fragment main if
that's there and then you're gonna see
all of this stuff right here and we are
basically going to destroy it
so we're gonna come up here to import
we're just going to select everything
and just delete it I'm making a new
Android Java tutorial which is going to
use all that stuff but I think this is
the perfect way to learn how to start
making Android apps because you're going
to be using Java you're also going to be
using some of the techniques or the
names that you are already
well aware of so what we're going to do
is we're just going to start typing
we're going to go public class could
actually use what was there but I'm
going to delete it and main activity
that is the name of your file right here
and don't worry most of this is going to
make a ton of sense this is going to be
the part that might look a little bit
foreign to you and we're going to say
extends form implements handles event
dispatch Eng okay so there that is this
guy right here what it's going to do for
you is it is going to allow you to catch
events that occur on the application
okay and we're going to be doing this a
lot this is underlined so we are going
to put our little mouse over top of it
there we go and just click on import
okay and it's going to put that import
that file right there that we need then
what we're going to do is we're going to
put a little brace right here and there
you go we're going to come in here to
forum we're also going to import form
there that goes and then what we have to
do believe it or not that's one of the
most complicated things you're doing
right here and I'm not going to really
get too much into what's going on
basically what we're doing is creating
what's called a class and basically what
this is this is going to represent your
actual application or the screen that
we're so well aware of this guy over
here screen one that's what this is so
what we need to do is basically model
everything that's over here onto this
okay so don't worry too much about it
but basically what we're doing here is
defining what is going to be in the
screen and I'm really not sugarcoating
it that much that is what we're doing so
what's the first thing we need to do
well we need to create our label here is
the touch zombi label and that's exactly
what I'm going to call it over in Java
Android so here we are and to do that
I'm going to type in private because we
want to keep our information private if
at all possible label that's what it is
it's a label and we're going to call it
exactly what it's called in the other
screen touch zombie label and put a
semicolon and there we go we just
created exactly what you have over there
put our mouse on here and just go import
there you go all done now we're going to
create something else let's go back over
into App Inventor what are we going to
create we're going to create a
horizontal arrangement okay let's do
that so we're going to type in
horizontal arrangement and we're going
to call it exactly what it's called over
in App Inventor we're going to call it
or is on all arrangement not that you
have to use these names it is just my
choice to use the same ones as I had
before and of course we're going to
spell it right horizontal arrangement
one and put a semicolon and then just
come over here and go import again and
there we got our label and our
horizontal arrangement what's the next
thing we need well we need a Sambi
button to put inside the horizontal
arrangement no problem private button
zombie button same exact name
everything's the same come in here put
your mouse over it and click on import
and make sure you click on the column
google development tools simple runtime
that one there you go
I'm gonna move this thing out of the way
if you ever hear me talk about log cat
this is log cat right there
this is where all your errors are going
to show up but don't worry about that
and of course you're going to be able to
just copy and paste all this code and
for awhile that's what you're gonna do
until you just remember how to use this
stuff alright then what do we need we
need a sound I'm not gonna jump over to
App Inventor and it's just sound and
zombie moan sound there we go
created that we need another private
sound and this one's going to be called
zombie attack sound pretty neat and
we're gonna go and import these again
next thing we need accelerometer because
we want to be able to detect if the
person is shaking their phone just in
case we want to make the zombie moan
sound so accelerometer sensor and we're
going to call it accelerometer sensor
one there we go and then import this
again and then we're going to get the
location sensor so we can use the GPS
and that's called location sensor there
it is and then import it and all of
these names are exactly the same every
one of them so rahmanir sensor location
sensor notifier everything is exactly
the same okay we want to have no defiers
or pop-ups come on the screen no problem
just go to notify
are if you've used App Inventor a lot
you're going to be able to write this
stuff out of your head like I'm doing
right now so come in here import the
library spelled it wrong it's still
fixed it we're going to want to start
the settings window where the user is
going to be able to turn their GPS on so
to do that activity starter one there
that is course get the library and then
we're going to go private text-to-speech
so we can convert our text into speech
and it's called text-to-speech 1 and
import it make sure you get the right
one text-to-speech get this one right
here with calling Google development
tools that's what you're going to use
for everything alright so what are some
things let's go over into App Inventor
and think about some of the things we're
gonna need well one thing we're going to
need is how big is our zombie gonna be
all right over here we set it for 285 by
342 pixels because App Inventor
automatically goes and scales up images
depending upon the device well we don't
have that with regular old Java Android
so we are going to set the value for it
and I could use some fancy math but I'm
just going to keep this simple and I'm
going to multiply what I have over an
App Inventor times two and a half so I'm
going to call this zombie image height
and I'm going to say 712 pixels there
that is and then I'm also going to need
its width and integer just means that
it's a number that doesn't have a
decimal place on it that's all that
means
and this is gonna be zombie image wet
and it's gonna be 855 pixels so there we
go
what else are we gonna need well we're
gonna be storing over inside of here we
can look at the block section maybe that
would help us a little bit better all
right so what do we got here well we
have the latitude and longitude being
stored inside of here so we should
probably have that over inside of here
as well so we're going to go private and
I'm going to call this a string because
it is going to be a number followed by
decimals and more numbers and I want it
to be a string so a strain just means
arbitrary series of characters basically
so I'm going to go latitude and you can
also define multiple little things
inside of here and what do they call
those over inside of App Inventor they
call them variables right here okay now
the only thing is inside of here we
often
or to these as fields but don't worry
about that so there's longitude and
latitude we got those stored what else
are we going to need to store inside of
here mm-hmm you can see zombi latitude
and longitude right there something else
that I'm going to need to store is going
to be the provider name which is going
to be GPS so that's how we were able to
get our latitude and longitude so I'm
going to go private I'm going to make
this a string of course because it's
just GPS is what we're looking for and
I'm gonna call this GPS provider name
and there that is and that is basically
all I can think of at this moment that
we are definitely going to need inside
of here so that means it is time to set
up everything on our screen and we are
going to do that inside of here by going
define write like this and this is
basically like any Java main function
but the only thing that makes it
different is because we were using these
libraries up here makes it a little bit
easier for us to develop Java Android
apps okay so just stick with that this
is inside of define is going to be where
we are going to define our application
put everything together and make it work
so what are some things that we need to
do let's jump back over inside of here
go back into the designer and let's look
at the screen let's worry about that
right now well if we look at the screen
we can see a couple different things
it's not going to make any sense for our
screen orientation to be anything except
for portrait so we're going to leave
that portrait it's also not going to
make sense for it to be scrollable so
let's also go and have our Java code
handle that up inside of here I'm also
going to want the title for this to be
called hello zombie as you can see right
there so let's come over here and
basically also change the background
image all this sounds like a lot of work
but it isn't we have our background
color also set to none and for now I
think that's enough so how do you come
in here and do all that stuff with the
screen well remember I said this class
basically is going to represent the
screen well what we're going to do is we
are going to refer to the screen by
using the word this this meaning itself
basically so this screen what we want to
do is set the screen
orientation to portrait so just like
we're writing a sentence that is what
we're going to do the only thing is
important here is that we surround this
with quotes and there that is and there
that is there you just set the screen
orientation to portrait not that hard
what else are we gonna want to do well
we also want to set the title for this
guy
so title this title for this screen and
I want to call it hello zombie and
that's exactly what I just called it and
put the semicolon there another thing I
wanted to do is set the background color
this background color couldn't be much
easier and there that is and to define
none you're going to type in color
underscore none no quotes and put that
right there and there you go
and then finally to define the
background image we're going to go this
background image and then just call it
splatter background dot Peng and that is
inside of our assets folder there you go
and make sure you call this background
image with capital I and there we go
and if we look over on our assets folder
right here you're gonna see splatter
background dot pang there it is that's
what we're using and then the final
thing that we said we wanted to do with
our screen at this point in time is to
define that it is not scrollable so
scrollable and false and there that is
okay so what's another thing that we're
gonna want to do well we got to set up a
lot of these other different things the
code actually isn't that long so don't
get worried that I'm gonna type forever
all right so what else do we need to do
we need to set up the button the zombie
moan sound the zombie attack sound the
accelerometer the location we also have
notifier and text-to-speech how about we
do text-to-speech because that sounds
great
well basically what we need to do is
initialize all these things just like we
did in the block section so to
initialize the text-to-speech
we're going to go text-to-speech one
which is the name I gave it up here
where's text-to-speech see
text-to-speech 1 there it is to
initialize it it's actually pretty easy
we just type in the name of it and then
we go equals and we say hey we want a
new text-to-speech object is what it's
called and texted speech and then we
have to pass it this which is the screen
and there
what else are we going to need to
initialize here well the label at the
very top of the screen is very important
to initialize and you can see right here
touch the zombie so let's just select it
take a look at a couple things over here
what do we have well we have font size
is equal to 20 the text is touch the
zombie we come down here with is fill
parent text alignment is set for center
and if it is bold is checked okay so we
have to set all those things for the
label come in here scroll this up a bit
first thing we need to do is go touch
zombie label define that is equal to new
label and then pass it this because it's
going to go into the screen now we can
just copy this guy right here paste it
in there and then we're going to change
the text well it's real easy just type
in text and the text you want on the
screen touch the zombie come out here
put a semicolon there you go you just
set that now if we want to change the
font size we're just going to type in
font size font size and we want 20 so
let's type in 20.0 and then put an f'
inside of there just to keep this simple
that F says hey this is a decimal value
okay
so don't worry about that otherwise just
make sure you put it in there put
another one in here we also want the
width of the label to fill the parent
well we're going to type in width and
then this is a little weird we're going
to go lengths fill parent so that's what
we're going to type in anytime we want
fill parent to basically just do that
work for us text alignment is going to
be centered we just go text alignment
right like that and then in this
situation we're going to type in
component let's just say that component
always knows how to align everything to
the center and it's going to do some
work for us and all you got to do is say
hey component I want this to be aligned
to the center and there that is and then
make sure you import the component
library and there that is and then the
final thing we wanted to do with this
guy why do I keep spelling alignment
wrong there we go we also want to come
in here
and make the font bold we didn't do that
no we didn't font bold and yes it's true
I want it to be bold there we go we got
our labels set up now what are we doing
to do well we want our horizontal
arrangement to be set up because that's
where that is and this is going to be
very easy basically we just have to
create it and then say that we want the
width to be fill parent as well as the
height okay
so horizontal arrangements if we want to
be lazy we can just come up here we can
just copy this or is on our arrangement
one come down here and paste it in there
and then we need to create it first
remember so new horizontal arrangement
right like that and we want it to be on
the screen so let's type in this now we
just have to have it be fill parent so
we're gonna go horizontal arrangement
dot whit right like this and we're gonna
go and get the fill parent thing but I'm
just gonna leave it like that for a
second and we're also going to define
the height this is pretty easy all right
so we want the length fill parent
remember this does that work for us
automatically fills it the right way
paste both those in there and then we'll
go back over and appinventor to find out
what we got to do next well we went and
created the horizontal range minh that
surrounds the button so I think it makes
sense to create the button so let's just
select this and look at what we got here
so of course we're gonna have to create
the button we're also going to need to
put the zombie paying image inside of
there if we come down you're going to
see that the width and the height is
down here but we change that before it
to zombie image height and then we are
going to want the text alignment to be
centered all right jump back over here
again type in zombie button is equal to
new and it's a button and this time we
want the button inside of the horizontal
arrangement though we don't want it
inside the screen we want it
specifically in the horizontal
arrangement so whenever we create the
button we're going to say we want it
inside there so there that goes and
there that goes so just like we did in
App Inventor we put stuff inside a
horizontal arrangement so we're doing it
again here we're going to create another
zombie button or I mean we're going to
put the image for the zombie inside of
here and that's just going to be zombie
dot Peng just like an app inventor then
we're going to want to
find the width for it and we already to
find that up here in these variables
where are they there we are
zombie image height right there let's
just copy that and be lazy paste that
inside of there
copy that as well paste this here we
have to also define its height just like
we did
zombie image well I actually copied that
there so let's change this the width
there you go and then the final thing
for our zombie button is we wanted to
define that we have the text alignment
set for center Colonna alignment center
exactly the same remember that takes
care of it for us and there we are
alright so what's the next thing we got
to do well we have the zombie moan sound
in the zombie attack sound let's go and
set both of those up and basically all
they're going to do is assign the value
for whatever the name of those is that's
it and that's going to be zombie attack
sound is equal to new sound and we're
going to put this in the screen so this
right there and then if we want to
define the source for the zombie attack
sound we just type in source right like
this and the source for it is aam be
attack dot wave and that's in our assets
folder just like before we're going to
do exactly the same thing for the bones
sound so I might as well just copy this
paste that right there and this is gonna
be moan and then this is going to be
zombie moan wave there we go pretty easy
it's actually pretty much easier than
App Inventor I think or it definitely
will be after you do this for a little
bit alright so the next thing we don't
want to do is if we're over inside of
App Inventor and we go into blocks we
have to look at some of the different
events like location changed and zombie
button click well we need to do certain
things when the zombie button is clicked
might seem like that would be very
complicated to set up in the code but
it's actually not we're going to use
event dispatcher if that sounds like you
heard it before well you did come up
here handles event dispatching right
there okay that's just like a little
tool that we went and plugged in there
and right in the beginning and basically
what this is going to do is it's going
to catch any button click events that
occur and then later on in the next
tutorial inside of a function
dispatch event we are going to check
which component triggered the event the
click event and then we are going to
handle the event just like we did an app
inventor so to do that you just go event
dispatcher dot register event and you
actually see it pops up right here so
let's just click on it there we go don't
have to type all that out see I was
hiding that from you there and then what
we need to do is say where did this
event occur we're going to say this in
our screen and then we need to give it a
component ID I'm just going to call this
button click this doesn't matter the
important part is this event right here
the event name and the event name is
click because somebody clicked on it and
there you go that's the important part
you need this anytime you want to catch
a click event click OK and of course
don't forget to put a semicolon down
there and there we go that's all we have
to do to catch that event other things
that we need to do is go and create the
location sensor and to do that you do it
exactly like you always do everything
else you just go location sensor and
where do you want the location sensor
you want on the screen so given this
just like before we are then for our
location sensor going to have to define
or get the best available provider
currently that's going to give us our
latitude longitude information and to do
that you just go location sensor dot
refresh or see automatically pops up
there there you go provider and you
don't have to put this or anything
inside of there just going to handle
that we're also going to want to create
the notifier so that we are able to pop
up a message if they have their GPS
turned off and tell them hey turn this
on so notifier and we want to notify ER
in this so there that goes again if they
need to go and turn the GPS on we're
going to need the activity starter just
like we used before in App Inventor so
we're going to have to create it is
equal to new activity starter and guess
what we're gonna put in here this
because it's on the screen also going on
need our accelerometer sensor which is
going to give us information on if this
thing is being shaken or whatever new
cellar ometer sensor and
at this then we want to also catch if
the device is shaken so let's just go
and copy this because you do it in
exactly the same way
there it is except in this situation I'm
going to come in here and just type in
shaking phone doesn't matter again the
shaking phone part this part does matter
and you're going to type in here shake
because that's the event you want to
catch or actually it's shaking sorry
about that and that is it guys that's
all I'm going to cover for this part of
the tutorial all of the code again is in
the description for the video and in the
next part it sounds like it's going to
be hard a lot of work it's going to be a
very short video what I'm basically
going to do is create the one function
that's going to handle all of the events
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
