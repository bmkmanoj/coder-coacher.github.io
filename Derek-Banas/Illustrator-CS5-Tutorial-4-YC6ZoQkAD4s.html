four of my illustrator cs5 tutorial this
has been a long time in the making the
reason I'm doing this is because Veera
asked me to review some of the wedding
invitations that she had had done for
her and showed her step by step how they
were created I'm going to start off
really really simple here with this
first one and do this one which is a
little bit more complicated and then
this one which is a lot more complicated
I'm going to show you how to find fonts
i'm going to show you how to draw things
i'm going to show you a bunch of
different shortcuts and a whole bunch
other thing okay well if I'm drawing
this this is a basic light bulb and it
has sort of like a brush edge to it so
I'm gonna use here i'm going to click on
the pen tool click here and then i could
either draw a circle or just use the pen
tool and then notice how this line is
straight up and down I want that sort of
look and then I come in here and sort of
Judge where it looks like the angle is
ending and click in here and then I'm
going to curve this and then this is all
the pen tool and I'm holding down the
shift key in some situations if I want
to make that line straight okay and I'm
gonna look for roughly the middle of
this guy alright so I got this guy right
here now what I'm going to do to make
sure everything symmetrical is to come
up here and go object transform reflect
you can see it's reflecting the opposite
of what i showed right there and i'm
gonna copy and i'm gonna drag this guy
over here just like that so that the top
edge is our meeting and it doesn't
really matter about the bottom edge i'm
just going to trim in your draw like
that and i'm going to select both of
them and then i'm going to come over to
my path finder tool which you can see
down here and i'm going to click on this
one it's going to unite them now this is
all 1 image okay now if i want to copy
the color just click like that if i want
to give it a brushed edge first I'm
gonna come over here select my stroke
and change it to the same color then I'm
gonna come to brushes which is right
over here and I'm gonna look for a brush
that sort of matches up nice if you
don't know how to get the brushes just
click on window and then look for
brushes it's check that means it's on
the screen right now well you can also
come in here and go brushes like this an
open brush library and I already did
that and I clicked on
artistic and chalk charcoal pencil and
I'm going to click on this one right
here and now you can see right here that
it has sort of a brushed edge to it
similar to the light bulb that you see
right here now to come in here and do
this bottom part of the light bulb I'm
going to come over here and click on
this rounded rectangle tool that's right
there and when roughly just come in here
in that area right there and already has
a stroke so i'm gonna copy this basic
color right here if i click on stroke
and then click here it's gonna give me
the same color for my stroke and then
i'm gonna come over and give it a rough
edge as well so there's that rough edge
all I did was apply that rough charcoal
brush to the stroke just like before so
now I can come over here drag this into
place just like that and I can copy this
if I hold down shift all I can drag and
make a copy of this guy right like that
and make another copy and make another
coffee and that is how quickly you can
draw roughly exactly what I was sent and
then of course if I wanted to come in
here and create the background for this
just come in here select this guy same
exact size come out of here come over to
the eyedropper tool copy that color then
come in here and go object arrange send
backward or you also have your shortcut
you can do this on a PC or whatever you
have so let's drag this into position
holding down the shift key so everything
is all aligned in there you are there's
your light bulb and the background now
i'm going to drag this out of place and
look at this one I'm going to show you
in a minute how to perfectly identify
any font but just from looking at this
I'm guessing this is kind of palutena
and I have palutena there so just to
make this part real short because I'm
gonna have to dwell on one of the other
one good idea okay so there I change the
font got this inside of here I can come
over to the character slide-out tool
here and increase the distance between
all of those letters and you can see
right here but let's do it a little bit
more dramatic so there is roughly and
also I could drag like this I want to
come in here and copy that part now for
this guy is a little bit more
complicated
and also a little blurry I don't like
but either way pen tool I'm going to
come in here again click I'm holding
down shift so everything aligns right
well this is not perfect see here I'm
just when I'm making this curve I'm just
clicking and holding and letting the
curve go into place like that and this
is all just a matter of estimating
exactly what you're doing so I'm
clicking and holding and if I want lines
to be straight up and down i hold down
shift you're going to notice this is
almost going to be identical and i
always cut off by clicking that so that
it doesn't overwhelm and decide what the
stroke is going to look like I prefer to
define what the stroke is going to look
like other people don't and again this
is art everything is all you know
whatever you like it's a good thing
about art and you can see there now I'm
gonna hold down shift to make sure that
these all align perfectly and I can go
along and redraw the whole entire thing
just like that with the stroke tool I
mean it's simple no big deal alright so
and then I would continue onwards to
this guy right here and I'm going to
click on selection tool /and that will
get rid of that color if I want to come
back in here with a pen tool just click
where I left off and just like that and
I also could have went and drawn half of
this I'm gonna hit ctrl Z get completely
out of this moment our guy again we have
the pen tool selected so I'm going to
come in here and click on it and it's
giving me a guide showing me where that
meets up committing object transform
reflect just like I did before and hit
copy and then I could just make a yellow
box after I join these guys so click on
that and I have the background locked so
now I got this chest piece right here if
I come in here and draw this yellow box
right like that eyedropper tool I'm in
here yeah it's just basically wine this
up all right look at that selected
object and range bring the front ok and
now select them both and say- front and
you can see it cut out the chest piece
for me and it's perfectly symmetrical on
the left and on the right and then this
font right here just from basically
looking at it I don't think I'm right
but it is extremely similar to future if
you increase the size on it and then you
could obviously stretch the font like
this and it is probably not futura but
it's
shuffling if you want to do this
extremely fast it would be a knockoff
now i'm going to show you exactly how to
find out what fun is with this more
complicated guy got right here okay so i
got this basic jpg i'm gonna jump over
into Photoshop and do the same thing
with GIMP though and first let's say we
want to figure out what the phone is so
what I did was I went in here and I
copied this line of text and saved it as
a JPEG and for the tool on the web that
I'm going to use you're going to have to
go into image size and increase the
height to 100 pixels ok so I did that
for both of the fonts that exists both
this the script as well as the non
script well then I'm going to jump over
onto the web and if you just type what
the font com or if you go to new fonts
com click on browse and locate the image
that you just made inside a Photoshop
and this is an awesome website so let's
say I want to find this font right here
I click on continue and then you come in
here and you define exactly what the
different letters are because sometimes
it doesn't quite get it and if it's
picking on something that isn't a letter
just ignore it here we have J and that's
just a dot to ignore it joyful and it is
getting everything else so let's click
on continue and you can see here if we
look at it that Minya new val is the
font and you can do this for the other
ones that i didn't go over and if you
click on that you can click on Add to
Cart continue to my cart and you'll have
to provide a user ID and password but a
lot of these phones are free click on
proceed to checkout place my order and
click on zip file and download it in
univ oh okay great now I got that font
and it's free for Mac if I open up my
font book got this guy right here give
al drop it in there boom close that and
now you can see font minion eval regular
is available right here so if I want to
make this whole entire thing minion a
bell font you can see there's also
examples of what the font will look like
again devel regular and you can see it
is identical and I could also do the
same thing with the script in that I
want to upload that but that is actually
a font you have to pay for so you can
choose to either pay for it or not for
$35 okay so if you don't want to do that
you can go to a website such as 101 free
fonts comb and pick a script out there
maybe that you'd like instead or you can
go to dafont.com right here and look at
calligraphy fonts for example there's
thousands of free fonts I don't really
see any reason to buy them one of
there's so many free ones but there you
go so that is how you get all of your
different fonts now if you want to
actually take this image right here and
break this down into individual pieces
that's easy as well so i have this saves
as jpeg and jump over to photoshop again
jump into this guy right here and i'm
going to select with my magic wand tool
the tree part because i've decided
that's the main thing that i want to be
able to get at right here and I'm gonna
make sure I get it home and come in to
select and select similar ok so now I
know I got every part of the tree but
I'm also getting this text here and I do
not want to get that so i'm going to
hold down my option alt key I'm in here
and deselect a text that I definitely do
not want to grab then I want to come in
here as they select inverse so now I got
everything but the tree and I know I
also cut out the birds so I'm going to
select again in verse and I'm gonna come
image adjustments brightness contrast
I'm going to take my brightness way way
down take my contrast way up look okay
and I'm gonna go copy I'm jump back over
and a illustrator and paste got this guy
right here this graphic and it's a
little bit rough but we can clean that
up and then we're going to go into
object live trace and we come down to
tracing options i love to use this tool
i don't know i'm a lot of people ignore
it and I'm gonna leave this black and
white I'm gonna come in here and click
on ignore white like you can see right
here and i'm gonna click choice what's
gonna do is it's gonna get rid of
everything except for the part that I'm
looking for here specifically and I'm
gonna go object live paint make and
there you go no everything you got here
is all broken down into individual
shapes come over here and you can see
that it copied all of the different
colors you probably can't see because
it's the light but if I draw a square
inside of here just like that get the
brown file range send it back you can
see that it copied every
thing right there and it's a little bit
rough but by tweaking these different
things and also not having a very low
resolution jpeg that will help you out
then you basically the only thing left
is the birds so let's zoom in here go
object selection lock then you would
come in here and redraw your birds just
like this and again remember if you want
to be able to see just backslash that
and as long as you have phil selected
it'll get rid of all the color you're
drawn in there and this is all I hand
coordination tall it is the more you
draw with illustrator the faster you get
so and then of course you can come in
here and draw the heart which I trust
you know how to do just draw it with a
pen tool or you could live trace it out
but draw it with pen tools easier and
then you drag the little birdie over
here into place and then you could also
come in here with the text tool I'm just
gonna make it same color as that just
like this joyful hearts da da da da so
here I hope that helps you understand
how to better use illustrator if there's
anything I did hear that was not a
hundred understandable please leave a
question and obviously anybody else
watching this video I want to help you
as well you have any questions or
comments leave them below if there's any
other things you want to see me do with
illustrator been using it for about 15
years so I can do just about anything
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
