introduce you to my recipe for spicy
bean curd it has a delicate nutty flavor
and yet it holds its flavor whether you
prefer it to be mild or very spicy
approximately one hour before I start
making this recipe I want to take 14
ounces of firm bean curd and I want to
place it between two paper towels on a
plate and then put my heaviest pan on
top of it while I'm preparing my bean
curd I want to take approximately two
and a half cups of rice mix it together
with five cups of water bring that to a
boil stir then put a lid on top of the
pot turn it down to 20% and boil for
approximately 10 minutes then in a
separate Bowl I want to take three
tablespoons of water and then add to it
five tablespoons of either soy sauce
liquid aminos or tamari sauce depending
upon which you prefer then your gonna
have to decide how hot you want this to
be if you want to keep it quite mild I'd
recommend you use about one and a half
teaspoons of chili paste with garlic and
of course if you want to spice it up add
more chili paste with garlic and then
I'm gonna add one teaspoon of sugar then
we'll be adding one teaspoon of sesame
oil to this mix and there's the brand
that I use if you'd prefer to use what I
use but any sesame oils fine and then we
are going to mix mix mix mix mix then
I'm gonna get myself one big scallion
like you can see right here and they
normally split in two and this is what a
scallion looks like with its skin on if
you want to recognize it in a grocery
store and then I'm going to very thinly
chop up this scallion now a lot of the
nuttiness is gonna come from these
scallions and I prefer to actually take
the time to break them into little
circles like you can see right there I
think they really really add to the
overall complexity of the dish then I'm
gonna take a one-inch knob of ginger
that has been peeled and I am going to
dice it up a really really small and of
course you want to make this dish a
little bit more spicier this will be a
good time to add a little bit more
ginger I'm then going to take the
scallions and the ginger that I chopped
up and put them in a separate Bowl just
to keep everything nice and neat and now
it's time for this star of the show
which is going to be the 14 ounces of
firm being curd and I'm just going to
chop them into four even pieces and then
I'm gonna go one two three and then
1 &amp;amp; 2 and that's gonna give me perfect
little cubes as I was putting this meal
together I forgot to add my 2 cloves of
garlic here I'm using minced garlic but
fresh garlic works just as well now I
have my wok on high of course you don't
need a wok just a big pan would work and
I'm going to add 2 tablespoons of just
regular old canola oil to that wok now
to help me judge exactly when the wok is
going to be ready for me to put all the
other vegetables inside here I'm just
gonna throw a scallion in and when it
starts to bubble I'm going to add all
the other vegetables now I'm going to
stir all of the scallions and the ginger
and the garlic of course in the pan
until I think it's about ready normally
takes about 3 minutes and then I'm going
to add in all my tofu I try to be a
little bit more delicate whenever the
tofu is in the pan of course this is
sped up here and then I'm going to add
in all of my sauces now I'm just going
to stir all this together until all of
the tofu is lightly coated I'm then
going to turn my stove top down to
approximately 20% and put a lid on top
of the wok after about 5 minutes I'm
going to remove the lid and maybe give
it another stir I'm gonna throw some
rice in a bowl and then I'm gonna take
out this wonderful nutty tofu and pile
it on top of the rice I hope you enjoyed
this recipe it really is wonderful and
of course you want to make a little bit
spicier just add a little bit more chili
paste and ginger please leave your
questions comments below otherwise so
