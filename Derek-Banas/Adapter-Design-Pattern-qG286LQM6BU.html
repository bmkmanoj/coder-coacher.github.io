my design patterns video tutorial today
we're going to talk about an easy design
pattern to understand it is called the
adapter design pattern now what the
adapter design pattern allows you to do
is use two completely incompatible
interfaces and get them to work together
just like any other adapter so let's say
you only have two plugs in a wall outlet
however you want to connect something
that has three plugs what are you going
to use an adapter which is exactly what
this guy is and you're going to use the
adapter pattern whenever the client
expects to use a target interface which
means the target interface in this
situation would be a two pronged plug
however you have a three prong plug and
that's what the adapter is going to do
it's going to convert the three prong
into the two prong and just like our
adapter here the adapter class is going
to allow you to use any available
interface that makes sense of course
with the target interface and to look at
it in a completely different way any
class can work together as long as the
adapter solves the issue that all
classes must implement every method
defined by a shared interface so let's
look at that as a UML diagram okay so
you have the client and he wants to use
in this situation an enemy attacker
again I'm looking at this like a video
game
alright so every enemy attacker so far
can fire a weapon drive forward and
assign a driver however you want to
create an artificially intelligent enemy
robot now an enemy robot has no need for
a driver also it is not going to drive
forward it's going to walk forward and
in this situation let's say our enemy
robot also has no weapons it just
smashes things with its feets and its
hands so what are we going to do we're
going to implement an adapter here and
this is what everything is called the
enemy attacker in this situations called
the target the enemy robot adapter of
course is going to be called the adapter
and the enemy robot is the adaptee so
you want to look at the enemy robot like
it is just any other enemy attacker are
you going to do that well you take the
adapter and you're going to store inside
of it an enemy robot and then what
you're going to do is each time one of
these methods is called whether it's
fire weapon Drive
4-door assigned driver you're going to
point to the correct version for the
enemy robot which is stored inside the
adapter using composition this is just
an object we're going to be working with
so there's a basic overview of the
adapter pattern so let's get into the
code and explain it further okay so the
very first thing we're going to do is
we're going to create the target
interface and this is going to be enemy
attacker so we're just going to come in
here and go public interface enemy
attacker pretty simple and then we're
going to define all the different
methods it's going to need now this is
what the client expects to be working
with and it is also the adapters job to
make new classes compatible with this
interface we are creating here so as we
said before we're going to need to fire
a weapon or cause damage in one way or
another we're also going to have to come
in here and drive forward with our
attacker and then finally we're going to
have to assign a driver and there you go
there is your interface and it's all
ready to use and that is inside of enemy
attack or Java now let's go over and
actually implement it inside of enemy
tank Java no enemy tank is going to
implement the enemy attacker perfectly
and our job is just to make sure that we
implement all of the methods inside of
here that enemy attacker defines now I'm
going to import a little library in here
just to add some randomness to this
thing and then I'm just going to jump
into it and we're going to go public
class now if we're going to be creating
a tank that is going to implement enemy
attacker that is how we're going to do
it and then of course it's going to say
you need to add some unimplemented
methods inside of this guy and there we
are so we're going to add those in there
so pretty easy then we just need to
define exactly what we're going to have
here and I'm also going to generate some
random values here this has nothing to
do with a pattern I'm just doing this to
make this a little bit more interesting
and then we need to have this do certain
things so what are we going to have it -
I'm going to say attack damage is going
to be equal to and I'm going to go
generator next int and what this is
going to do is give me a value between 1
and 10 to be able to use as a random
attack value and then I'm just going to
go system outline and we'll say enemy
tank and all the code is available
underneath the video so you should
we check it out to help you better
understand this but it's pretty simple
this is one of the easier patterns to
understand
alright so whenever it attacks it's
going to do a certain amount of damage
here so pretty easy to understand and
also again I'm sort of looking at this
like it's a video game let's say we want
to also have a random movement and let's
say that the random movement is going to
be between 1 and 5 that's how we're
going to calculate that again this
random stuff has nothing to do with the
pattern just throwing it in there to
make it interesting so now what are we
going to do we're going to go enemy tank
moves and then we'll say it moves a
certain random distance in there we are
then finally we need to assign a driver
to this guy one thing I didn't do is
with the enemy attacker over here with
assigned driver I'm going to need to go
string driver and dam so once again
that's in the enemy attacker interface
save that jump back over into enemy tank
and implement this and it's going to get
a string driver name and then here we're
just going to go driver name is driving
the tank and there you go and that's all
we need to do for this guy so now we
need to go in here and create our enemy
robot which is not going to have these
methods and then we'll figure out how to
fix that just go into enemy robot Java
and this is what is called the AB depth
e and the adapter is just going to send
method calls to objects that use the
enemy attacker interface to the right
methods that are going to be defined
inside of this enemy robot class we have
here so let's say I want to also come in
here and do some random stuff with it
and then we'll go public glass enemy
robot and then I'm just going to go
random generator again just to make it
interesting ok so now our robot doesn't
have any weapons however it scans
smashed things with its hands now of
course for the most part you're gonna
use the adapter whenever it makes sense
so in this situation at not having
weapons normal weapons like shooting
weapons but it has hands so it sort of
makes sense for me to use the adapter
pattern in this situation that's very
important you never want to try to cram
the usage of the adapter and pattern in
there whenever it wouldn't make sense
there we go just doing a random 1
through 10 and then we're gonna in this
situation enemy robot causes attack
damage
with its hands there you go so you can
see the difference between this enemy
robot and what it is doing versus our
normal attackers which are like tanks
and things like that so then what are we
going to do
well it doesn't move forward in the
normal way it walks forward so we're
just going to make it do what it does is
equal to generator nextint
and then this is going to give me a
value of 1 through 5 9 system out enemy
robot walks forward and then movement
and I'd say it also goes a certain
number of spaces so there you go all
right so we implemented 2 methods here
inside of enemy robot and then let's
implement the final one so what are we
going to do whenever our enemy robot is
approached by a human since this is
artificially intelligent it does not
need a human to drive it so driver name
is still going to be passed here however
we're going to say enemy robot tramps on
let's say he doesn't like the whole
concept of being driven and he's just
going to Tramp on our driver who tries
to drive him so there you go all three
of these methods do not work currently
based off of the enemy attacker
interface so now it's our job to go
inside of enemy robot adapter and make
them work we just need to have the
adapter provide an alternative action
for all the methods that need to be used
because as you're going to see here in a
second enemy robot adapter is going to
implement enemy attacker so we just need
to go public class enemy robot adapter
implements enemy attacker there you are
now since it's going to implement that
same interface as everything else we're
of course going to have to implement all
the methods that are going to be needed
so let's do that and then using
composition of course like I mentioned
previously you're going to have to
create an enemy robot object inside here
and I'm going to call it the robot and
then whenever fire weapon is called
we're going to use the robot and then of
course we're going to have to create a
constructor for this guy so public enemy
robot adapter and it's going to get past
an enemy robot for it to work and I'm
going to call it new robot and then just
go the robot is equal to new robot and
there you go ok so now it's our job to
implement these methods down here and
come work with our enemy robot methods
very simple just go the robot whenever
this is called smash with hands instead
will be called so just going to work
just quite simply just by throwing in
our specific enemy robot Matt fits
inside of there it's a pretty simple
stuff so walk-forward is what it's going
to implement and then of course for
assigned driver what are we going to do
go the robot react to human and drivers
name is going to be inside of there and
you can see it just pops right inside of
there all done
there we are enemy robot adapter is
fixed so now our only job is to go into
test enemy attackers and see if it works
so we're going to create ourselves an
enemy tank and call it our x7 tank you
know whatever and this is going to be a
regular type of enemy tank that we're
going to be creating here like that and
then we're going to create also an enemy
robot and I'm just going to call him
Fred the robot is equal to new enemy
robot and then I'm going to create an
enemy attacker and I'm going to type in
in this situation I'm going to use the
enemy robot adapter to make this guy
work so I'm going to go robot adapter
new enemy robot adapter and I'm going to
pass it Fred the robot because remember
that's going to need to be passed over
and be robot it adapter there it is see
this is what we're calling this
constructor right here and enemy robot
is going to be passed so that's what I'm
doing with that and then just to make
this nice and clean I'm just gonna say
all robot which is going to look at this
just like it's a regular old robot not
using my adapter and then what do we
need to do here we're going to go Fred
the robot react to human and let's say
it's Paul is the unlucky human that's
going to be interacting with that red
the robot and I'm just gonna go down
here
go walk forward Fred the robot and in
the finally thing he's going to do is
smash with hands so there you are I
created an actual Fred the robot this is
an enemy robot and then what we're going
to do is actually use the adapter to see
how they both work together so in this
situation I'm going to go the enemy tank
and then call everything inside of that
so we're going to go rx-7 tank dot and
we're going to go assigned driver and
we're going to pass it the value of
Frank there's going to be
using my tank rx-7 tank we're also going
to drive forward with Frank here rx-7
tank then we're going to fire our weapon
and there you are
so we're going to see what an enemy
robot acts like on its own then we're
going to see what an enemy tank does and
then finally we're going to see what the
robot with adapter does to show how to
use the robots and adapters so we're
going to go robot adapter and then we're
you know assigned driver and what is the
name of this unlucky guy his name's
going to be mark and then we're going to
go robot adapter again and then what are
we going to do we're going to call drive
forward and then just let it figure
itself out
robot adapter again and then we're going
to go fire weapon even though we know
doesn't have that capability alright so
we have it all set up now let's test it
to see if our adapter works execute and
you can see right here here is the robot
part and you can see of course it tramps
on Paul it walks instead of just simply
moving and it causes for damage with its
hands and you have the enemy tank it
acts just like a tank drives the tank
moves three spaces causes for damage and
here is our robot with our adapter see
it tramps on mark even though we're
using the enemy attacker interface here
it's going to walk forward one space and
cause nine damage with its hands so
there is the adapter design pattern
pretty easy to figure out if you play
with it you'll definitely get it leave
any questions or comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
