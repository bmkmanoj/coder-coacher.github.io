3 of my flash tutorial where I'll teach
you everything you need to know about
flash to be able to do cartoon animation
but in this presentation I'm going to
cover layer symbols using library and
how to convert image files into vector
art this is art work that actually drew
inside of illustrator and I'm going to
take it copy it and paste it over into
flash going to create an actionscript 3
file could see that the size of its 550
x 400 which was a little bit smaller
than the image that you just saw i'm
going to paste this on screen i'm going
to paste using AI file importer so that
i can keep everything as vector or
rather than Kevin come out as a bitmap
then I want to align it to stage and
before I do that I have to group
everything here come over to alignment
I'm going to align to the left edge make
sure you have a line to stage set up and
I'm going online to the bottom edge then
I come in here modify and ungroup
everything click here just to make sure
that that worked ok super so we got that
done now I'm going to show you how to
actually import a graphic i'm going to
do that inside here by going into the
library and then going file creating a
new symbol and this is going to be a
graphic symbol not a button not a movie
clip we'll get into those at a later
date and i'm going to call this is woman
and then i'm going to come up here in a
file and import import to library and
I'm going to find my gif image that i
have here and that gif image is going to
show up here in my library i want to
drag it over try to put it in the center
of the screen just like this and now i'm
going to actually convert it say i'm
going to this is the symbol that i have
here and i drugged the gif image over
into that and you can actually see that
I'm working with that and not to give
image itself now I'm going to convert
this by tracing it and turning it into
vector art it's real simple to do just
click on modify bitmap trace bitmap now
you can sit here there's a whole bunch
of different options you can play with
I'm going to keep everything I mean it's
pretty much this is a tool that you have
to play with until you get your vector
or as nice as possible and of course
your minimum area the smaller and
smaller you make this the more exact
it's going to be but also the more
complicated the vector art is going to
be so you want to try and keep this as
large as
possible while retaining that the view
that you want then you just click on
preview to me that looks pretty good so
I'm going to say okay all right great
now I'm going to come in here and I'm
going to get rid of this excess white
space that surrounds the vector artwork
switch here come in here and magnify
switch back over and get rid of any
residual garbage that I don't want to
show up in this vector artwork so got
rid of that is oom back out everything
looks pretty nice in general going to
jump back over the scene that's what the
where I'm going to actually be working
with these images and now I can take
this vector artwork I know this is
vector artwork but I can take this
vector artwork but first I'm going to do
is I'm going to zoom in to show frame
and I could take this Specter woman
right here drag her on the stage and I
can transform her increase the size and
you can do this with any of your symbols
the way symbols work inside of flashes
if you change anything in the symbol
library that's going to affect every
single item but if you have change
symbols that are on your stage those are
called instances of the main symbol you
can change those in multiple different
ways and it will not change the main
symbol if you work with symbols inside a
flash is going to save you an immense
amount of space so you better get used
to working with symbols inside of flash
so let's take this lady will put her up
here say I double clicked on that that
would allow me to change the entire
symbol but I do not want to do that so
I'm going to go back to see and you can
resize you can change the color a lot of
people don't realize you can change the
color of symbols inside a flash and i'm
going to show you exactly how to do that
without affecting the main symbol so
let's come over here and draw bring in
another for instance of the
businesswoman shrink this down because
she doesn't have a shadow I'm gonna go
modify and I'm gonna flip this
horizontally so that the shadow makes
sense and i'm going to come in here and
i'm going to rotate this lady so that
her shadow works now the thing that a
lot of people don't realize and this is
a little bit off-kilter but this is more
to show you how this works what a lot of
people don't realize is you can change
this color without affecting the other
symbol and how you do that as you select
it and go into properties and then you
can go to coloring effect right here and
if I want to make this lighter like her
shadow would be
that's exactly what I would do I would
come in here and manipulate this and
this is going to affect the instance but
not the original artwork itself or the
original symbol itself and if you want
to create new symbols of course you just
go into library and you can either go
new symbol just like that and remember
what we did previously or you could say
insert new symbol that way or like we
did before file import to stage i'm
going to import this again i'm going to
say don't replace i'm going to get this
image right here and if i want to
convert it into a symbol i can just hit
f8 or convert to symbol just like this
and those are the different ways that
you bring symbols into flash cs5 and all
versions of flash for the most part now
I'm going to come in here and I'm
actually going to delete this this isn't
a very nice and neat file because
absolutely everything is on the screen
all at the same time and in flash you're
going to work with layers you're going
to definitely want to work with layers
see all of these different items that
are on your screen are all on the same
layer it's very easy to put them all on
separate layers by just selecting them
and right-clicking on the screen and hit
distribute two layers and you can see
we'll take a second and there you are
now everything is being distributed to a
different layer and you can see if I
select the different artwork this layer
only contains that man and woman this
contains their shadow this contains that
one well let's go in here you should
also named your layers and you do that
real easy just double-click man and
woman and if I wanted to actually come
in here and take this shadow because it
would make sense that the shadow is
actually there with these two people
what i would do is just copy this some
over here where the shadow is i'm going
to copy it then i'm going to jump back
into here and i'm going to hit edit
paste in place now they're both on the
same layer and i can come in here and
actually right click on this and delete
that layer so now the shadow and the
woman or and the man and woman are all
tied to gather and that makes a lot of
sense you can also say that if you
scroll down there's that shadow and of
course you'd want to have all those
things separated on to different parts
of the screen
and you may also find that you would
like that this is a background and this
is another background and well that's
actually the arrow you might actually
want these two backgrounds three
backgrounds actually to be associated
with each other and held in the same
position so again it's going to be 11 13
and 14 well one thing you can do is
create a folder and you can name this
background and then remember that's
background you can drag that in you see
it indented down there that is not a
background this is a background so drag
that down in there and 14 is another
background so we can drag that up and
you can place it also in the folder so
there's another different way that you
can create and manipulate and keep
everything organized inside of flash and
if you actually select that folder it's
going to select every item that is
inside of the folder and now another
thing you want to do is you probably
can't tell this but this is actually
where what what i'm gonna do i'm going
to show you something i didn't show you
before i'm gonna come up here to view
and click on rulers you see right here
and actually you can drag and drop a
ruler down but if you look here this is
actually where the top of your stage is
now i'm just going to make a statement
you do not want to change that fact so
that would mean that in the movie
there's a possibility that this top part
would show through if you want to make
sure that does not occur what you need
to do is create what is called a mask
and we're going to need to create a new
layer up here and we're going to need
the in flash it's kind of weird whatever
I'm asked is over is what will be shown
in the final movie it's kind of the
opposite of what you would think we're
going to need to create a rectangle I'm
going to draw a rectangle here on screen
and I'm going to want to give it a color
that is very uncommon and it's very
unlikely that i'm going to actually use
it so i'm going to use a green which is
common well then i'm going to want to
align it again i want to make sure a
line to stage is selected I want to make
it the same width as the stage and I
want to make it the same height I know I
could have hit this and then I went to a
line vertical center and distribute
horizontal center now that mask is
completely covering the
stage all the other artwork once I
change this into a mask is going to
disappear I just go down here click on
right where i created this rectangle on
its own layer and I'm going to click
mask and now that I've created this mask
it's only going to mask this first layer
so what I need to do is come down here
and select all of the other layers and
folders and what have you and drag them
up and put them right there now
everything is going to be masked off and
any area that lies outside of the stage
I can guarantee will not show up in the
final movie so they're real quickly is a
full explanation of later symbols how to
use the library and how to convert image
files into vector or in flash so we
covered a ton of things and for the most
part and risk this tutor almond aren't
really heavily focused on animation so
if you have any questions or comments
leave them in the comment section below
