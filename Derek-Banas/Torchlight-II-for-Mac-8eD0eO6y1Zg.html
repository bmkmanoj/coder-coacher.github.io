received the question over and over
again how do I play PC games on a
Macintosh and I reached out though
there's people that asked me that
question and I asked them what game
specifically they wanted to play and
resoundingly torchlight 2 1 so today I'm
going to show you how to use play on Mac
which is free to play torchlight 2 on a
Mac using the PC version so the first
thing you got to do is go to play on Mac
comm and then click on download and
download play on Mac and we're gonna
keep it and it's going to download for
us ok after about 3 minutes it downloads
yes it takes forever and I have a pretty
high speed connection here and you just
want to open that file up and then after
it installs just click on play on Mac
and this guy will actually run a ton of
PC games I'm not gonna say anything more
than torchlight 2 at this point in time
but it runs a ton of them and eventually
I'm gonna do a proper wine tutorial so
that you'll be able to run even more PC
games without Windows on a Mac but for
now we're just gonna focus in on this
because torchlight 2 zooms to be the
game everybody wants to use and then
you're gonna get this little pop-up
whenever it's done installing and you
want to click here please download X
courts for me and then hit next and it's
going to download and then it's going to
install X courts and here is that
installer and we're just going to click
on continue and continue and continue
Dada Dada da agree and then install and
the great thing about this is you don't
really have to think about anything it's
gonna install most so everything you
need right for you so you can just let
it do its job bad thing about it is it
takes forever to do its job but just sit
here and wait everything's going fine
even though it's taking minutes whenever
you're used to things taking just
seconds and then the installation was
successful and you wanna hit close
Cleo Maddux gonna finish installing X
quarts and I would download the newest
release install update install and
relaunch continue continue continue
agree install and then you get a message
installation was successful hit close
and you get a message that you're going
to need to reboot your computer click I
agree click Next
and then grab Leon Mac
droplet in the Applications folder okay
so now that you have everything
installed we're just going to click on
play on Mac but you're still not totally
installed and play on Maki is gonna open
and it's going to say that you need to
click Next a whole bunch of times again
so just hit next and it's gonna install
some fonts please read all this yes okay
hit next and then after the fonts have
been installed hit next again and then
hit next then what you need to do and
here's the whole interface just click on
install a program and then you're gonna
search for steam and double click on
that and then you just click on OK and
then there's another wizard that pops up
to help you install everything it's
gonna install wine for you which allows
you to run your PC programs on your Mac
without windows and then it's gonna say
that it can't find a dotnet blah blah
blah just click on install then steam is
gonna be installed for you and then
you're gonna get a message it says how
much memory does your graphics board
have well you're gonna come over to this
guy and you're gonna click on that and
go about this Mac and then this is gonna
pop up and then you're gonna click on
more info and then you're gonna look
right here you can see I have a whopping
256 megabytes of RAM on my graphics card
so I'm just gonna remember that and then
go 256 click on that and then hit next
and then hit next again and then just
select steam and hit run and then let
steam update so process is basically
letting everything update and then steam
is gonna open on your screen and you're
gonna click on login now of course
you're gonna need to have an account on
steam to do all this and log in and then
you're gonna get a mail message sent to
you from steam to activate this and I
entered my little 5 digit little code
they sent me and now I hit finished and
then you hit agree and then you hit
agree for all that stuff and there's all
the games I have pay for the next part
the easiest thing to do is just to go on
steam powered dot-com which is steams
website and by torchlight 2 so just come
up here and go torchlight 2 if you try
to buy it through the PC fake version
just doesn't quite work and then you
just click on this it looks nasty and
it's a mess so just buy it directly
through steam like this and then just
click to buy torchlight 2 and I'm sure
you can figure all that out ok and after
you do that whenever you go into steam
you'll open the version of steam that we
just created on your Mac and you click
on library you're gonna see torchlight 2
is here and you just click on install
and it's gonna ask you where you want to
install it and then in this situation I
leave both of these on checks and some
on a Mac and it's installing everything
and then you click on finish and then
you have to wait for torchlight 2 to
download over here on the left side of
your screen and now it's installed so
let's click on play and check it out and
you can see it's downloading Microsoft
DirectX for Windows and here it is and
if you want to get rid of the dock down
here in the bottom of your screen you
just click on settings and go into dock
and then click on automatically hide and
show dock and then close that in there
see now it goes away unless you get on
here then you click on new game we're in
and there you go there's all the
different characters mail and I'm just
gonna click on the engineer get my
Bulldog I'm just gonna let him named
Winston and I'm gonna click on normal
and single-player and you could say
there it is its plan just like plays on
a PC looks pretty nice so that is how
you play torchlight 2 on a Mac if
there's any questions or problems you'd
like me to try to solve for you leave
them in the questions and comments
