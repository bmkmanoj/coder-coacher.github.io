my beginner Android development tutorial
today instead of making one app I
thought it would be fun to make two
really fun apps that are going to allow
us to explore a whole bunch of different
things we can do with App Inventor so
let's go over and take a look at the two
apps we're going to make okay so let's
take a look at the apps we're going to
make a weather application which is
going to pull all of this information
off of a website including a webcam and
just play it there real simple but as
long as it takes me to do this and
actually I made an app like this while
sitting in the lobby waiting for
somebody and whenever I showed it to
them they were absolutely amazed and
will show you exactly how easy that is
to make and then after we're done with
that we're going to make a camera
application which is going to display
the location for the image and it's
going to display an image it's going to
allow me to take a picture just by
clicking on that it's black because it's
on my desk
and we're also going to click on image
gallery and go to the image gallery and
pick an image and do all of that very
very quickly so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so those are the
two applications we're going to make and
it is going to be so easy and it's going
to be fun and we're going to start
really exploring how to make utility
apps so for example let's say you want
your device to do something well why not
just make it yourself and make it quick
and make it easy so what we're going to
do here is we're going to build the
weather app first very very simple I'm
just going to change the name of the
application here to weather instead of
screen one and of course we can expand
on this and I mentioned that I made an
app and somebody's Lobby I actually did
do a couple other things like for
example I put a little icon that
represented the weather and the
temperature we'll get into that later
but I just want to keep these as simple
as possible okay so basically what we
need here is 1 2 3 4 5 6 labels so let's
get ourselves a label and let's drop it
in there and then we're going to need
images there we're going to put the
little maps inside up so I'm going to
split label there's a second one I'm
going to put another image say you can
see here I'll zoom in soon maybe you can
see a little bit better there's another
label there's another
edge there's another label there's
another image ok so there's six of them
now I want to go and give them good
names so I'm going to select this first
come over here and text forward label
I'm going to call this first one
Pittsburgh math because that's where I
live at so there's that we're gonna be
able to no matter where you live in the
world we're gonna be able to get maps
I'm going to show you here in a minute
where we're gonna get all those images
from and then let's say I want to rename
this guy give it something like it's
Berg map label and remember it has to or
it can't have any spaces in it and then
we'll grab this image right here and
let's rename that as well I'm just gonna
call it Pittsburgh map image and hit OK
don't need to do anything else with that
select this one right there I'm over
here I'm going to call this US
temperature that is and let's give it a
new name
and let's call it US temp label and then
select this and come over and rename the
image for it and let's just call it US
temp image select the label again let's
call this US wind chill and then let's
rename it u.s. windchill label and we're
just gonna do that for all these
different guys there's the image US
windchill image do it for this label US
radar US radar label image rename US
radar image u.s. precipitation u.s.
participation label just make sure that
you get rid of that space and then for
the image US precipitation image and
then the label okay it takes me longer
to do this than it's actually going to
take to do the really complicated cool
stuff and then this is going to be
webcam rename the label paste that in
there select the image and rename that
to webcam image there we're done with
all that now we're going to go into the
whoops first before we go we're gonna
select these labels one by one and I'm
just going to show you doing this one
time I'm gonna click on none and I'm
going to go to grey change the
background to grey text colors going to
be changed to white there that is and
then width is going to be filled parent
and you can see right there exactly how
that changed so now what I'm going to do
is do that for all the other bars and
let's do it one more time background
gray come down here to text color white
there that is and then width is going to
be fill parent and there that is and
after you do it with all of them this is
exactly what it's going to look like so
now that's set up we can go over into
blocks and there we go and then to set
everything up is going to be really easy
basically all we need to do is go to
screen one click on that and we need to
say when it is initializing the
application which is right here whoops
which is right here just drag that right
there then what we want to do is change
all of our pictures and all our pictures
are right here so we can just click on
this and we can say set the picture to
grab this drop it right there and then
we're going to be able to use either
images from off of our device or get
images off of the Internet so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use Wonder
ground which provides a ton of images
that we can get directly off the web and
it is so easy look at all these
different maps we have right here so if
I want to copy one of them real easy I
just right click on it copy image URL
and then I can go in a text editor paste
that in there and you're going to see
that this is a gift well you can grab
these gifts directly off the internet
that easily so I went ahead and I got a
couple for Pittsburgh which is where I
live now I'm going to go into App
Inventor again and just put my little
quotes in there paste that in there hit
enter
grab this drag it up there and drop it
in and that is all you got to do and you
can just do it for all these images so
click on this sorry that it's too easy
but it's just too easy I mean that's
it's just the way it is and that's one
of the reasons why I chose to cover App
Inventor so we're gonna grab all these
different things and it would be easy to
grab temperatures and grab just about
anything but like I said I want to hold
off on that for now cuz I have a big
tutorial plan for that we're just gonna
drag and drop those in there and of
course you could go here and you could
look at all the other different things
that are available storm the ports there
you go a whole bunch of them and like I
said this isn't just for the United
States you go to Canada
Australia Europe Asia here Asia take a
look at what comes up look that's the
wonder map that thing's not going to
work for you quite as well because it's
not a gift but another thing it's really
cool is we can also get webcams there's
webcams all over the world so if I want
to get a webcam from Asia for example
click on by country there you go
and let's say that I wanted to get
something from all no I guess there's
not a whole lot of options but here is a
head image right here and we could just
click on latest image right there it's
going to automatically update of course
because whenever this updates everything
on your app is going to update and again
we can just right click on it and we can
just say copy image URL and if we want
to see exactly what that one looks like
paste it in there and there you go so
that's how easy it is to go and create
that map app very very simple and very
very cool and all I'm going to do is
just copy and paste these over here so
we can just do quote anywhere
da-da-da-dah enter there's that grab
another URL if you can't see there's
double quotes again paste that in there
da-da-da-dah and there you go
those are all of the URLs I just copied
and pasted them directly inside of there
piece of cake of course I'm gonna have
this block and links to all this stuff
in regards to where I got the images
from under the video in the description
so that was a real easy way to create
that application so now let's go and
create the camera app okay so now what
I'm going to do is I am going to create
our camera application it's going to be
a lot more complicated than before but
not really that complicated
basically it's going to allow me to take
pictures it's going to allow me to get
pictures out of our photo gallery and
display them it is also going to store
all the pictures in a tiny database and
it's also going to resize all the
components to fit any scrips size of
screen or device that we're using so
basically I know that I need from the
little demonstration I gave you earlier
I'm going to need two labels so I'm just
going to grab these labels and drag them
and drop them over here I'm also going
to need a horizontal arrangement so I'm
going to drag that drop it right there
I'm also going to need to get myself an
image that's going to be displayed there
that is and I'm also going to need two
buttons so just
I can drop those guys in there and then
I'm going to need the camera tool so
let's click that camera there it is drag
and drop that right there actually the
second button I'm gonna get rid of it
because I want a button that's going to
open up my media library so that's gone
and that is the image picker sorry for
that little slip-up so I'm going to grab
that and drop that right there and then
the final thing I'm going to need is my
little storage which is going to be my
tiny database drag and drop that right
there okay so I got everything that I
need here now this is basically just
going to say location so I'm going to
come over here and I'm going to rename
this click on rename call this location
title label that's perfectly fine and
I'm going to come over here and it is
just going to display location and
nothing else there that is so that's all
set up then I'm going to get this one
this is actually going to display the
location for whatever image is showing
so I'm going to rename this guy come in
here and we're going to call this one
image location label click OK I don't
want anything to be displayed so I'm
going to get rid of that and you can see
right there whenever you don't have any
text just has that little green box then
going to make a couple little changes to
my horizontal arrangement so I'm going
to click on that I'm going to have it
fill parent ok and then I'm going to
have its alignment be Center there that
is that's all I'm going to change then
for my image I'm going to have its width
be fill parent as well and that's fine
that's all I'm going to do there and I'm
not going to bother changing those names
then I come to my button right here this
button is going to say take a picture
scroll down here and type in take a
picture it's going to open up my little
camera app click on rename and I'm going
to give this guy take picture button
there that is OK and then I have my
image picker which is going to open up
my image gallery so double click on this
and I'm going to say image gallery ok
and rename this guy I'm just going to
let it be image picker 1 no problem ok
so I have everything set up the way that
I want it to be set up now what I want
to do is go in and have all of the
different
opponents fill the screen irregardless
to the type of device being used and to
do that I'm going to go into the blocks
okay here I am in the block section and
like I said I want to have every
component automatically resize so
anytime you're thinking about component
or the device itself you're probably
going to be wanting to go into the
screen and you're going to also want to
go in to initialize that's where we're
going to be making all of our changes
now basically what do I want to do here
well I want to have all the components
automatically resize depending upon in
this situation the height and one thing
that I did forget is I'm going to go
into the designer and I'm going to set
my screen and my orientation to be
portrait that way it's going to be
locked no matter what they do with the
phone and go back into blocks and Here I
am again all right so what do I want to
do I want to change location title label
first and I wanted to find what the
height of the component will be so I'm
going to use a set so just drag that out
of there drop that inside of there and
then I have to think about how big I
want it to be and also I want it to be
the size or the height of it to be in
comparison to the total height of
whatever device it's currently on now
previously in the math part here
whenever we clicked on that we went and
we talked about floor which is right
here basically the way for works is if
you give it a number say it's 2.5 it is
going to round down to 2 well if we're
using ceiling it's going to round up if
for example we give it to point 3 it's
going to round up to 3 so I'm going to
get the ceiling and drag that over here
and drop it inside then what I want to
do is get a percentage of whatever the
screen height is and then say this
component needs to fit in that area
again going to be doing some math so
click on the math component come down
here going to be doing a multiplication
to get a percentage if I want to get the
screen size I go into screen click on
that and then look inside of here for
the total height form a screen and
scroll Scroll scroll and you can see
their screen one height is available
drag that over drop it in and then let's
say that we want our
being that top label it just says
location to take up a small fraction of
the total space click on math get
ourselves a little number block drag
that over here and drop it in there and
of course I want this to roughly come
close to a hundred for all of the
components I don't actually want it to
be a hundred I want it to be a little
bit less than 100 so for this first
component since it's going to be taken
up almost no space I'm going to say that
it is going to get 0.05 it's going to
get 5% of the total height for our
screen then basically what I'm going to
do is the same sort of thing for every
other component so you just do a
duplicate here drag and drop that right
there
well then let's say we want to come in
and get our image location label now the
length of the the name for the location
of the image on our device as a tendency
to be a little bit big so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to come over here and
I'm going to double the size of this so
I'm going to change it to 0.1 or 10% of
the total screen size then I'm going to
have to come over here here and I'm
gonna have to get my image itself and of
course I want the image to take up the
majority of the screen size so we're
going to come in here and specifically
look for image height set image height
go get that I'm going to click on this
and duplicate it drag and drop that over
here and I'm going to change the total
height for our image to be around point
six two all right of course I've thought
about this before I jump dator and did
this and then we have our two buttons
the take picture button I'm going to
change its height again anytime I want
to change something you want to get the
set there that is and then since both
these are buttons I can click on this
where actually I don't know if it's
going to show up let's look no it
doesn't okay so let's throw that away
just because it looks like a button
doesn't mean the image picker is a
button so we're gonna get this and set
the height for the image picker drag and
drop that there go duplicate this there
it is drop it right there
go duplicate this and drop it right
there and I'm going to say that both of
the buttons are going to be equal to ten
percent of the total screen size so I
think that's going to be enough space
for everything and we're going to find
out aren't we okay so the next thing I
want to do is I'm going to be
boring and looking for and using the
location for our image over and over and
over again so that means that I should
probably create a variable for it and so
I'm going to so initialize global name
too and the name that I'm going to give
this guy is going to be a default image
so default image there that is and this
is just going to store the location for
the images that I'm playing with inside
the camera app then what I want to do
and I'm going to do this still inside of
the initialized part whenever the app
first starts up I'm going to go and find
out if an image has been stored in the
tiny database to do that I'm going to go
over to variables again and I'm going to
go specifically to set to and this is
where default image is going to come in
so I'm going to go set to global name
well of course this is going to be
default image there we go sorry about
that little slip-up and this actually
should be nothing so delete that okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
hey I want to get certain information
from the tiny database if it exists and
I want to store it in the variable name
default image so to do that I need to go
into the tiny database and see if I can
get a value so right here get value and
all I have to do is give it a tag now
the name that sort of sounds like would
be a good name to me would be last image
used that's what I'm going to be using
inside of here so I'm actually going to
type in last image right like that and
then if it doesn't have a value or if
this isn't stored in the database it's
going to get a default value of nothing
now what I want to do let's just get
this out of here and drag it up there
because it keeps getting in a way now
what I want to do is I want to make sure
that a value or an image location was
previously stored inside of this before
I go and try to gather it that means I
need to do and if then so I'm going to
go into ctrl and click on if then drag
that right there and then I'm going to
go and see what the value of last image
inside of our little database is or if
it even exists at all so to do that
to click on logic and then I'm going to
get this little guy here that's going to
allow me to see if things are equal or
not equal so drag that right there
change this to not equal and then what I
want to do is I want to find out if the
value for default image which is this
guy right here so go into variables
again and this time I'm going to be
getting the value of that see if it
called the database and there was
something in there then it would have
sent back a path for an image if however
there was nothing in there it's going to
do what return blank space so I want to
then check to see if this is not equal
to a blank space so in this situation
that means it has a path for our
location for our image stored in the
database that means I'm going to be able
to use it one of the things that would
be useful to be able to do is to take
that image and store it inside of the
image in our application and so to do so
I'm going to say set image picture to
drag drop that right there and I'm also
going to change the location because
remember at the top of the screen we
also show our location so I'm going to
go to image location label and set the
text for the image location label and as
you know I stored the value inside of
default image so I'm going to be able to
click on this and duplicate it paste
that right there and it's going to
automatically work in this situation
where at once text or the actual
location for the image or the image
itself just to be clear here here I'm
changing the picture for our application
here I am changing the location at the
top of the app so this is text and this
is an image all right so everything is
set up and initialized now I'm going to
show you exactly how we would set the
image inside of the database whenever
they use the image gallery part of our
app now the image gallery part of our
app is called the image picker so click
on that and we're going to come up here
and say after an image has been picked
come down here drop that right there
well I want to do a couple different
things and I should probably put this
stuff in a procedure but just keep it
simple I'm not going to do that right
now but I am
click on this and go duplicate drop that
right there I however do not want to use
this part right here so I'm going to
drag and drop that out of there and I'm
also going to duplicate this one drop
that right there and there we go now
it's very important whenever we are
working with the image picker that we
get the right image and that right image
is going to be available from image
picker and then we're specifically going
to look for what image did they select
and you can see right there there it is
so grab that guy drag it drop it right
there and then make a duplicate of that
and drag and drop that right there so
that is going to set the image after
they go to the gallery on our screen and
also change the location of that image
however we did not solve the problem of
putting the value in our database so
come over here click on tiny DB and
we're going to come up here and we are
going to say store value say there we go
just drag it drop it right there then we
have to give it a name well guess what
the name is going to be it is going to
be last image that's what we have up
here that's what we're going to be
looking for grab this drag it drop it
right there there's last image and then
what we want to put inside of here is
whatever the location was for our image
from our image gallery and there we go
what this is going to allow us to do is
click on the image gallery it's going to
update the image on the screen it is
going to put the location for set image
on the screen and then using the keyword
last image it's going to store the
location for the image that we
previously used or the last image we
used in our database so there we go
got that done now all we need to do is
make our camera go and open up and
that's easy enough all we're going to do
is whenever they click on take picture
button this guy right here
come up here grab this drag it out here
whenever they click on the take picture
button we're going to call for the
camera to open and click on camera come
up here and go to take picture call take
picture method there that is and that's
all we need to do with that and then
after the image has been taken we're
going to go into the camera again and
we're going to look for after picture
taken grab that raw
right there and we're going to be doing
similar things to what we did right here
which is mainly we're going to store our
new image so duplicate that and drag and
drop that right there that's going to be
the picture and duplicate this drag this
over drop it right there however
remember the selection here is for the
image picker for both of these can't use
that what we want is the picture that
was used from the camera or the picture
that was taken whenever the camera was
used drag and drop both of those out of
there and with we want to use the image
that was taken by the camera
well it's provided right here all we
have to do is put our mouse over that
and get image and get image and there we
go and the only other thing we need to
do is store that image in our database
since we have a new one and basically
we're just using the database here so
that if we open the app or close the app
that the image is going to remain that
is the only reason why we're using it
but remember can't use the image picker
selection that's bad drag and drop it
over there and then we go and grab this
one duplicate that tada boom boom boom
and there we go there is the whole
entire application actually two
applications of course I'm going to have
a link to all of these blocks here
underneath the video hope you enjoyed it
it was a lot of fun please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
