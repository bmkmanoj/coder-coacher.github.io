disembodied voice that you're all used
to I thought it would be interesting to
answer some of the questions you've been
sending me that don't fit into a ten
minute presentation so what I'm gonna do
now is the answer is 13 in the questions
that you sent out to me right here on
one video Chris b56
asked me what should I name my baby well
I won't tell you what to name your baby
I'll tell you what not to name your baby
definitely you should not name your baby
dick in my opinion there's no worse name
than the name dick on the other hand I
have found everyone who is named dick to
actually be nice so I'd say I'm a fan of
people named dick but not the dick name
in what was probably my favorite
question Rob nut said you said you had a
baby everybody who has a baby puts
videos of their baby on YouTube what is
it is your baby ugly or something well
Rob just for you I'm going to put a
video of my baby in this presentation
the most common question is what do you
look like Here I am
second most popular question is did you
really lose the weight Here I am right
here this is my waist no I am NOT taking
my top off it's quite obvious that yes
indeed I did lose the weight there is
your proof does ombak wrote in and asked
what is the best food you can eat well
does on back in my opinion there's
nothing better than bran buds they make
you pool Treadway wrote in and asked
what brokerage company did you work for
I worked for the wonderful company named
Morgan Stanley no that's not right much
better
dairy for 205 asked are you a
psychologist no and kardi wrote in and
asked me a question to try and get me
sued she asked what is your favorite
neutral fund well this is not advice but
you might want to go to one of your
professionals and ask about these two
funds take a look at the TCW Total
Return bond fund and also the Dodge and
Cox income if you want to know what I
think about mutual funds check out the
link right here headless wrote in and
asked are you married
well headless I'm lucky to say that yes
indeed I truly am
numerous people wrote in and asked how
many people work for you somebody named
ku klux can wrote in and asked where do
you get your news from
Oh ku klux ken I'm going to put as much
effort in to answer your question as you
put into him picking your screening I
get all my news from the Scottish son
this woman was stunned to find that she
merely choked on her favorite chocolates
because one was in the shape of a Willie
you can also find other insightful
articles on the Scottish son such as
this one on the brother and sister who
are living together numerous other
people wrote in and asked who was your
favorite blogger my favorite vlogger
without a doubt is a Frank he's the one
over here not this weird guy lady rants
a lot asked if you've lost all this
weight
what can you normally this is roughly
the amount of food that I eat in a day
and finally undriven wrote in and asked
who is your favorite stock guru well on
shriven from what I found a quarter
makes for a very good stock guru mainly
because after careful analysis most
stock gurus cannot outperform the
performance of a quarter hope you guys
