6 of my wordpress theme tutorial where
i'm going to show you exactly how to
make custom wordpress themes from
scratch
actually in this part that is exactly
what I'm gonna do however if you did not
watch the previous tutorials you
definitely should at the very least
watch part 4 &amp;amp; 5 which I provide links
to on the screen and here is the final
WordPress theme that I created here and
you're gonna learn to do just about
anything with WordPress based off of a
request from dougie I changed my menu
system so that now it's going to work
and allow people to edit their menus
using the WordPress menu tol inside of
here it's gonna have dropdowns and all
the other fancy things all of this
information is gonna come directly from
what we built and the HTML version of a
website you can see here everything's
working all peachy-keen and on the right
side of your screen you can also see I
have links to the RSS feeds Twitter
Facebook did all that I'm gonna show you
how to print out abbreviated version of
recent posts and also I'm going to show
you how to grab articles from RSS feeds
from anywhere and post that information
here on your website and a whole bunch
more but the first thing you're gonna
have to do in essence this theme is
honor % from scratch but I did use this
theme right here to start out everything
it's called the blank theme by Chris
coiour and it really is a blank theme if
we actually click on preview here you'll
say this is what the website would look
like it was if it was built totally
inside of this theme there's literally
no styling going on it's a completely
stripped theme that only has all the
essentials so what you're gonna want to
do is go inside of here to appearance
themes and download the blank theme then
once you do that you want to go over
into your WordPress folders and you want
to click on WP content and then you want
to click on themes and this is what the
blank theme looks like and you're gonna
want to click on that and make a copy of
it then paste it in here and then give
it a new name which is very important
and I'm gonna call this and for new
think tank theme Rea like that so it'll
be nice and simple and then you're
pretty much all set there then what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to use text
Wrangler this is all the code here on
the left side of the screen this is from
what we created previously in the HTML
version of this website and I'm gonna
come in here and go file new text window
and then I'm
go and I'm gonna open up all the
different things that I'm gonna need
from the new blank theme so I'm gonna go
open and I'm gonna locate my murder
trust folder wp-content themes and here
is n TT TT open that guy up and then I'm
gonna open up some of these files and
then we're gonna walk step by step
through this and make everything so I'm
gonna need the functions the header
index sidebar style obviously and footer
so I'm gonna open all those up and put
them over here then on the left side of
the screen we have this town dot CSS
file which we created previously and on
the right side of the screen is the new
blank theme style sheet and if you can't
see this you can definitely watch this
an HD full screen and I was also told by
dougie that a tutorial like this has
never been done where somebody builds a
wordpress theme from scratch a video
tutorial that is so I'm gonna copy the
style sheet right here this is from
again from the HTML website I'm gonna
copy all this and paste in my stylesheet
so I just deleted his stylesheet and I'm
gonna call this theme too alright so I
copied the style sheet over to this guy
now what I'm gonna also want to do is go
in and make a couple quick changes so
I'm gonna go functions and this is in
the blank theme and I can leave
everything in here untouched and the
same as it is except if I want to be
able to use that custom WordPress nice
menu system I have to come in here and
add in one function and what I'm gonna
have to do is go if and I have to call
function exists so I'm checking if the
register nav menus function exists and
we do this just in case somebody's using
an older version of WordPress and
doesn't have this and if it does I'm
gonna go now and use alright and then we
just type in main - menu and then go
main navigation ok so now I have that
all set up and I could actually come in
here if I'll save this I don't need to
edit anything else here on the screen so
since I saved it I could actually come
in here and delete that so I don't need
it I didn't delete it actually but I
actually moved it away from my text
editing tool now what am I gonna have to
change well I'm gonna jump over this guy
and I'm gonna jump into my index folder
because we're gonna be doing a lot of
copying and pasting from the left side
of the screen over to the right side of
the screen first thing I'm going to
change is the header file and we can
come in here and I can look again this
is HTML and I can
over here on the right and see what I
need to change well pretty much all this
information is pretty good as we scroll
down through here so I would not change
any of this and this is always gonna for
the most part be exactly the same no
matter what theme you're using however
whenever I get to this point right here
I want a link to my home CSS file that I
created and in this tutorial I'm gonna
go through and change a couple things
with it but it's really gonna be amazing
how little needs to be changed each
reference is equal to then I'm gonna
make a special call amount to or address
using PHP and this is very important if
you want to access the folder that has
your CSS code in it you're gonna have to
type in blog info and then say template
directory and all this code is available
in a link in the underbar in a
compressed zip format if you want it and
close that off and then you're gonna
want to go forward slash CSS cuz that's
the folder you want to go after and home
dot CSS and very soon here you're gonna
see exactly what's contained in that all
right so that's one change that we need
to make another change we're gonna have
to make and this comes from right here
by the way what I just typed in another
thing is I have a page wrapper here and
over here I have page wrap well that's
not gonna work I'm gonna have to call it
page wrapper since that's what I called
it over on the other side so we got to
change that I can leave header the same
because headers over here so that's fine
but I want to put my logo inside of the
header section so I'm gonna have to make
space for that so I'm just gonna go I'll
jump over here I'll grab this copy this
paste that code in right there and
there's a couple little changes I need
to make mainly I got a call log info
template down copy that I'm down here it
goes image source inside of here I
actually want to put that code I'm gonna
grab this whole thing so right where
that dot is I'm gonna paste in that so
now it's gonna be able to find my images
folder and then nothing else is going to
change all the rest of this is perfectly
fine then you can see here I have blog
title key care well to make this work
and have my blog title show up I just
gotta give it a new ID so it's gonna be
ID is equal to blog title right like
that and nothing else needs to change
with this guy and then I'm gonna come
down to this part which is actually
gonna be me my slogan I'm gonna get
myself some room here so you can see
this better and here I'm going to change
this to appiy paragraph because that's
what I have it over here and come and
grab this right here copy it so what
this is allowing me to do is while this
is gonna be static by going in here and
actually grabbing the description which
I have saved inside of WordPress this
can be dynamic which is a lot nicer but
I'm gonna leave everything else exactly
the same there however I want to put a
search form inside of this guy if you
don't remember I want to put this little
search feature over here which is a nice
little feature to have and makes you
stand apart from all the other blogs so
I just type in span and I'm gonna type
in ID is equal to and I called this
search box just so I can position it
properly and if you want to insert a
search form somewhere like that
PHP kit search form goes out off closed
off the PHP code close off the span then
on top of that I want to put my featured
banner in so that's gonna be the little
nurse thing right here and of course you
can change this to any image that you
want it to be doesn't have to be a nurse
to use this theme so I'm just gonna come
in here and I'm gonna grab this over
there paste it in tap that in so I'm
stickler and then we just have to make a
couple little tiny changes with this
being that I'm gonna have to go in here
and point to the template directory just
like I did before so copy and paste
cover up that little dot put that in
there everything else there can be the
same so I'm done with that part then
what I want to do because I want to use
the new menu system you're always gonna
do this in pretty much exactly the same
way I'm gonna go WP underscore now menu
remember we created this in the
functions part just previously in
functions dot PHP and then I'm gonna say
theme underscore location a little equal
sign little arrow I'm gonna say main
menu and that's the name that I gave it
previously
Calma menu underscore class and I'm
gonna call this drop-down it doesn't
really matter what it is but you just
have to remember that you called it
drop-down because in the CSS code you're
going to pay reference to this class in
the container ID this is just gonna be a
div that contains your menu it's going
to have an ID or a name of navigation
this really would be easier to learn
this stuff if you had this code in front
of you by the way and it's free so why
not and then fall back this is going to
be what is called if some problem occurs
like for example if they didn't have a
fairly recent
version of WordPress installed it's just
gonna pop up a list of the menus which
is gonna be real basic and work on
pretty much any version of WordPress so
that's what all that code there means
and there you go your header section is
done now what I should do is jump over
here real quick and I have some images I
want a coffee so I have my nurse banner
and Facebook and all these logos and all
this stuff so I want to copy that
that we created previously copy images
and then jump over into our new theme
and then just I'm gonna delete it now
I'm gonna go paste item so now I got all
my images that I need for my whole
entire theme I can close that and we
have the header done so let's file save
it jump over here and then we can get
rid of it we don't need that anymore and
then next I'm gonna open up my index dot
PHP file continue with all this and I
have this menu system over here which
remember we completely scrapped this and
threw it away so I don't even need all
of this so I'm just gonna come in here
and delete it I'm gonna delete the whole
menu system if you wanted to see the way
this previously was gonna be done you
can blame dougie because he's the one
that said he wanted it to be based off
the new featured menu that WordPress
offers which I agreed with him and
that's the reason why I did it and I
didn't really do it just for dougie okay
so now we're over here inside of
index.php what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna make two sidebars for
this guy and I wanted to make this as
different as possible so if I want to
make two sidebars I'm going to say get
underscore sidebar and I'm gonna call
this first this I'm gonna have another
sidebar called second actually why don't
I just go make those sidebars first I
scroll down here real quick and delete
this get sidebar down here at the bottom
of the screen because I don't need that
and then I'm gonna jump over into
sidebar itself and let's fix the
sidebars before we even do that what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna copy all this
code copy and then I'm gonna go file new
text document and whenever you want to
create a sidebar what you have to do I'm
gonna paste that in there and I'm gonna
jump over here and paste this inside of
there okay so I have the same thing that
I had a sidebar dot PHP and I'm gonna
delete it because I'm not gonna use it
and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
have renamed these guys so I'm gonna say
save as and I'm gonna jump over here
into ntt put sidebar in here and I'm
gonna call this sidebar dash
first it's safe and I'm gonna call this
one file save as sidebar - second and
hit save if we jump back to index here
real quick that's what we're doing here
see after the - that is what you would
call if you're creating multiple
different sidebars
so that's what's going on with that guy
but either way let's jump into sidebar
first and let's fix all the code that's
inside of here based off of what we have
over here as somewhat of a God what this
guy does here is if you're used to using
WordPress you understand the concept of
the dynamic sidebar where you can drag
different widgets and place them
wherever you want them in the sidebar
well this is basically saying if the
dynamic widget capability is available
then you want people to have the
capability to put in whatever widgets
that they want that's what this line of
code up here does then you have this
gets the search form this code here gets
the page as this case archives
categories and all this different stuff
what I'm gonna do with sidebar first is
actually delete everything so I'm gonna
come up here and I'm gonna grab this guy
right here and I'm gonna scroll down to
the bottom of the page and somebody said
to me what would you do if you don't
want the metadata to be showing up in
your sideboard well you do exactly what
I'm gonna do right here I'm gonna come
down here and I'm gonna delete it it's
all going see everything's going now so
now I'm gonna show you how to pull
recent posts from on your blog and post
that information so I'm gonna do is
leave subscribe here because people
always like it whenever there's multiple
different ways to subscribe so what are
we gonna do we're gonna create ourselves
an h2 tag I decide to use h2 instead of
age 4 for these titles and I'm gonna
call this recent posts and I'm gonna
close off my h2 tag and then I'm gonna
go in here and go div and then I'm gonna
say I want three posts so I'm gonna call
query posts and then oh I gotta do is
say posts per page is equal to three
easy enough so that will get me three of
my posts returned to me so I'm going to
close off the PHP section and then what
I'm gonna do is jump in there and
individually grab all of this
information so I'm going to go wow I
have posts to display meaning I haven't
gone over my three posts that I
requested I want to call the posts
function and have it get me all the
information that I need and then if it
gives it to me I gotta go echo and I'm
gonna create links right here so I'm
gonna go a H reference is equal to like
that
and I'm gonna say from a link which is
the link to the actual post then I'm
gonna close off that guy right there and
then I'm gonna call for the title of the
post and it's gonna automatically be
turned into a link but the person could
click on and then be able to actually
see the post I'm gonna go I'm doing this
purely so that the codes neat in the
HTML otherwise I could have definitely
put this right up there next to the link
you can do whatever you want they don't
want to go call for the excerpt which is
the abbreviated version of the post and
print that to screen yeah I want to go
echo and close that off and then I want
to call and while - and that while loop
forgot a quote there and then whenever
you do a query like this you always want
to call a function called WP reset query
and that way if you run multiple queries
on your page it's gonna work and not get
messed up so this will allow you to run
multiple different queries all on the
same WordPress page and really impress
people because that's what it's all
about ultimately alright so that's how
to pull posts off of your own site or
post three of them now what I'm gonna do
is show you how to actually pull posts
from another website so I'm gonna just
say great articles and I'm gonna go PHP
if and again we're gonna check function
exists it's called fetch feed again it's
a more recent function so we're checking
to make sure it works so that it will
elegantly not crash if it doesn't exist
close off that code and if it does exist
moved once this will allow us to search
for the feeds and you can put anybody's
feed on here that you want on your
website as long as they have a feed
obviously and then we're gonna say okay
well what feed do I want to pull it from
well only the greatest website on the
Internet will do so I'm gonna call the
fetch feed function HTTP colon
www.engvid.com you have to define the
quantity of the feeds that you want to
bring over to your site the more -
better if you're using this feed
obviously and then you go and get the
items and just put zero in there
and limit let you define previously this
is good long scroll this up and then if
there are no items well you know that
something went wrong so you want to echo
out the screen feed not available or
whatever you want to put there so that's
if there's nothing came back whenever
you requested articles from that feed
maybe it's been crashed because it's
received so much recent traffic and then
we'll get a run a for each loop on this
guy to get everything that we want
there's just gonna be a whole bunch of
echo statements what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create a div that's gonna surround
all this stuff and again I'm doing this
the way that I'm doing it so that the
HTML code looks neat you know I'm doing
some things a little bit longer than I
need to and I'm gonna do pretty much
exactly what I did previously except
with different functions so I'm gonna
get the link to the actual article
that's what I got right there and I'm
gonna go echo I'm making a link right
here using HTML it's all I'm doing not
rocket science so what do I have to do
now well in sided these a tags item -
get title I like that go and close off
the link and then close off the PHP code
and then I'm gonna come in here and
create a paragraph PHP I'm gonna say
echo I eat them
- get content so that'll be the content
that I want to grab from the feed which
is gonna be the actual words and stuff
or I guess I should be more restrictive
than that it's the abbreviated version
in the post then close off the div PHP
jump up here put in that single quote
and put parent and close off pretty much
everything else close off that PHP code
so there you are now you got your
sidebar all fixed all nice and neat
that's your first sidebar so you're
actually gonna want to come in here for
the ID and go first sidebar right like
that and then you want to file save it
and then you got to create your second
sidebar so come over here and get it and
this one's gonna be a lot easier because
it's not as fancy I'm gonna come in here
right after this commented area and I'm
gonna put in the links to my RSS feed my
Twitter account and my Facebook page so
go H to subscribe and then I'm gonna go
unordered list and I'm gonna create a
list item
I'm gonna go a H reference is equal to
and I'm gonna go log info because what
I'm gonna do here is I'm going to grab
of an image remember I copied and pasted
images into this well then I'm gonna
grab my link to my RSS feed dynamically
so if something changes it'll
automatically still work
right like that clink and then I'm gonna
connect this URL to an image source
equal to this make it call to PHP so
that I can actually find my image
directory
log info and call template directory and
this will allow me to point directly at
my images folder and the image called
RSS logo pane and I'm giving it a height
equal to 50 pixels and width equal to 50
pixels and then close off that link and
then actually what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to grab all of this code here cuz
this isn't gonna change too dramatically
and I didn't create a new list item
actually I'm gonna copy and paste this
in here and create the closing list item
since I just thought of that and closed
you know an ordered list also okay so
then I'm gonna come in here and the H
reference part I'm gonna delete that and
then I'm gonna type in twitter.com
forward slash you think I'm right like
that and then I called the image here
Twitter logo and I'm leaving the
dimensions the same then I jump up here
paste and then I'm also gonna link to
Facebook even though I hate it and then
this is gonna be Facebook logo and
everything else is the same there and
then I already have a search tool so I
don't need that so I'm just gonna delete
that out of there however I'm gonna
leave everything else exactly the same
so I can file save this now sidebar two
is done so let's jump over into index
I'm gonna show you how index works and
then we're gonna end this tutorial for
today there's not gonna be that many
changes in this guy right here all that
I really have to do is to put this main
content information inside of here and
so forth and so on so what we're gonna
do is we're just gonna copy this right
like that so copy it jump over here
right after we create our new sidewards
we're just gonna paste that in there
okay so that's done and what we're gonna
do is we'll go here where it says if
have posts right after that this is what
we call the loop inside of WordPress if
you've forgotten and I'm gonna create a
div and it's gonna have an ID of post
lists this is
coming from right here so we put that
inside of there this right here could
stay exactly the way that it is on the
screen this right here is gonna have to
completely change okay so we're gonna go
class is equal to this is called post
title and that's coming from this guy
right here that's where this is going
right there and we can leave this all
exactly the same yes perfect okay then
we're gonna jump down here and change
div class entry to post excerpt and then
we can leave and the reason that's that
way is because of this guy right here
see just change that a little bit leave
content exactly the way that it is don't
need to change anything well actually we
do we need to change this from a div
into a a paragraph sorry about that
now it's perfect and then all we need to
do at this point is close off post lists
and close off main content and we got
this guy all done so just come down here
to where it says end while and let's
since we got space
I'm gonna go /div it's always nice to
put a little comment in here I'm gonna
say and post lists and then right after
and while I do the same thing
I'll close off the divs and put in a
comment and main content actually I
should do this main content so now I
know which div lines up with which div
and then nothing else changes here
inside of the index file so we'll file
save that so we got a lot of stuff done
in this part of the tutorial we've got
the header section done we got both the
sidebars done and we got index dot PHP
done Oh what the heck I'm gonna also do
the footer just to get that out of the
way then in the next part of the
tutorial all we're gonna be doing is
style sheets so that'll be cool all
right so we'll go after footer and what
I want to be able to do here if we look
it's just show automatically dynamically
a listing of every page that is on my
website I want all those to show up here
at the bottom of the screen so I'm gonna
show you exactly how to be able to do
that so we're gonna come up here into
the footer section I'm gonna go
PHP obviously something I'll need to
brackets I give myself some space jump
down here and I'm gonna say if pages is
equal to get pages call that function
and guess what that's gonna do it's
gonna get me some pages then I'm gonna
go for each
I'm gonna say for each pages comes back
I want to create another one called
page object that I can work with here
grab some information from it and I'm
doing the same sort of thing again
create a link so eh reference is equal
to going close that off and then echo
I'm gonna say get page link then you go
page ID that's gonna give me the link
this guy right here it's gonna get me
the link that's actually gonna link to
the page they don't echo blink blink
like that echo I want to actually get a
title for the page so all that stuff's
gonna automatically update every single
time I make a new page close off the
link and then I'm gonna throw in here
some spaces and I'm gonna close this off
and put in some spaces with break
statements so that my copyright
information is separated from my other
information which is gonna be this
what's gonna be the copyright symbol on
the year and that's all that I need to
do with that so we got pretty much
everything done except I need to style
all this stuff a little bit more to
shape it up and then after that I need
to style the menu and then the whole
doggone thing is done and you know how
to make WordPress themes and if I jump
over here into WordPress now this is
gonna be ugly and activate this new
theme because there remember there is
limited styling on this guy you're gonna
see exactly what it looks like right now
but I promise after the next tutorial
it's gonna look exactly like this it's
gonna look beautiful and nice and
wonderful and everybody's gonna love me
have any questions or comments leaving
in the comment section below otherwise
