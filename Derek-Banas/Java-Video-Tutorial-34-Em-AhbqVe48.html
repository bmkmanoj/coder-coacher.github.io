34 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to show you how to set
up a database system so you'll be able
to access a database using Java the
first thing you're going to need to do
because you have to get the java
database connectivity driver you're
gonna have to go to mysql comm for it
slash products for a slash connector and
you're going to scroll down here and
look for JDBC driver for MySQL when I'm
using MySQL more specifically known as
connector J and then click on download
then you're going to see this screen
right here and then more than likely
you're going to want to get this zip
archive and you want to click download
on that as well whenever you download
that you're going to get this folder
right here and this is the part that's
important I'm going to show you how to
set up everything using eclipse and
actually in a couple different ways and
then I'm actually going to show you
another way to set this up using PC I'm
gonna show you three different ways to
set this up basically what you need to
do is you need to copy this right here
is my school connector Java and it's a
jar file and then on a Macintosh what
you need to do is go into system library
and then look for Java and then go for
extensions and then you need to paste
that inside of there see here it is
that's it you're done eclipse will
automatically update and allow you to
access the database so that's how you do
it with a Mac like I said there's 50
million different ways of doing this you
could also inside of Eclipse just come
over here where you have your files that
you have saved in Eclipse your Java
files and you want to go to build path
configure build path then Java build
path is highlighted you want to click on
libraries and then you can go add
external jars and if you can't see this
you can view a full screen and see
everything then you just point at this
guy right here which is MySQL -
connector - Java blah blah blah blah
blah jar and all of this code is
available underneath the video and you
hit open and that's it now everything is
going to be available to you and you
could actually scroll down here and if
you went to JRE system library one of
these your files is going to be mysql
connector - java now I'm going to
provide a link to an SQL tutorial that I
did in the past now in the next part of
this tutorial I am going to cover some
SQL of course I'll show you how to work
with statements and so forth by this
other tutorial is a lot more verbose I'm
gonna type in my SQL 5 - user MySQL
admin and this is probably going to be
dead
for you and there you are I'm logged
into MySQL now if I wanted to use a
specific database inside of here well I
could go show databases there you are
there's a whole bunch of databases and
let's say I want to use customer that's
right here I just say use customer ok I
got all that I could go show the tables
Marriott and there's customer and
actually one of the queries that I'm
going to run is going to be select first
name from customer that and there's this
first names it's a very very simple
query and like I said we're going to get
more complicated in the future but at
this point I'm just going to pretty much
stay right there so there I showed you
multiple different ways to load that
like I said you can also add this Java
database connectivity driver to your
path if you're on a PC or if you're on a
back or whatever now let's just get it
here and actually start using it so if
you want to access the API this could
provide the ability to process data
stored in the database you're going to
need to import a library and that
library is going to be Java dot SQL dot
star there you are got that library
inside of there and then inside of main
I'm going to go connection Co n N equals
null and a connection object is just
used to provide access to the database
real simple then I'm going to come in
here and create a try block because we
want to catch any potential exceptions
I'm going to go class dot for name and
for name dynamically loads a class for
you and in this situation the class
we're going to use is call my SQL JDBC
driver there you go and then I'm going
to take this connection that I have and
I'm going to go driver manager and
driver manager is used to handle a set
of different JDBC drivers for you and
I'm going to go get connection don't
worry about memorizing all this stuff
like I said just copy and paste the code
and play with it eventually you'll get
it get connections going to establish a
connection to a very specific database
in order situation we're going to type
in JDBC : MySQL : two forward slashes
local host forward slash customer
because I'm going to use that customer
database and then I need to provide my
user ID and there it is and then I also
have to provide a password which there
you go
it's provided that password and what we
have to do we have to start preparing to
send our statement which is going to be
our query so as ql state is what i'm
going
name this and a statement objects just
execute SQL queries and queries are just
questions jazz the database and then we
need to go : dot create statement like
that and create statement returns a
statement object for you to be able to
start coordinating the database then we
have to actually create our query I'm
going to call this select stuff it's
just going to be a string I'm going to
go select first name from customer
remember that and I actually queried the
MySQL database earlier so you already
know what the results are going to be
for that and then I need to create a
results set which is going to contain a
table of data that's going to represent
the results of our query and we just go
SQL state dot execute query select stuff
is the query we're going to be
performing it's very important to
understand that whenever you get the
results from this query those results
cannot be changed and you can only read
those results a one direction which
means from the beginning to the end
that's it and you're going to use a
while loop to iterate through those
results so we're going to go rows and
you use a method called next to iterate
through all the different results and
then in this situation I'm just going to
go system.out.print line
rows dot get strings and return the
value for whatever the columns name and
in this situation it's going to be first
name then what do I need to do I need to
catch any of the different exceptions
that might be fired so let's just give
yourself a little space here I'm going
to go catch SQL exception call this ax
then we can actually get a whole lot of
information in regards to this exception
but I'm just going to show you - I'm
going to do SQL exception of course make
sure this is in quotes
I'm going to go e^x get message and get
message is going to return a string
that's just going to describe whatever
the error was and to save myself some
time I'm also going to go vendor air and
get error code and this is going to kick
out a vendor specific error like I said
you don't need to worry about all these
different things you'll learn them as
this tutorial progresses and then I also
want to catch a class not found
exception e and in this situation I'm
just going to go
a stack trace and if we wanted to know
why that exception is in there it
actually catches this if they cannot
find that class and if we execute this
you're going to say that I've connected
to the database and there you are
there's your results like I said
underneath the video there's all the
code is heavily heavily commented and
also provide some information on setting
up class paths on side of pcs leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
