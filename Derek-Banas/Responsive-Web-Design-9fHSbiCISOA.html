responsive web design tutorial we use
responsive web design to make sure that
our site is going to be optimized
regardless of what device we are using
and we're going to use media queries
specifically to allow us to create
separate CSS files in this tutorial so
that we'll be able to optimize our site
for any type of device that might load
our site and in this tutorial I decided
to create the entire thing all in one
video and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it okay so you can see here the
final site that I created at the end of
this tutorial and you can see also as I
go and lower the resolution that it is
automatically going to adjust and like I
said I'm going to show you exactly how
to do this in this video so on the right
side of the screen I went and marked up
everything and basically I'm going to
use this as a guide this isn't going to
be a guaranteed way that everything's
going to line up but I always find that
it's very useful to use like a grid type
of system here on my screen and figure
out roughly where everything is going to
go
I then went and got all of the images
ahead of time and these are all just
paying files transparent things for the
most part and I have those stored in the
images directory inside of where I want
to have my website and now basically all
I need to do is come in here and start
creating everything so what I did ahead
of time was I went and created a well I
just put this line of text in here and
this is going to point at the default
style sheet that we're going to be using
and I'm going to need a bunch of these
depending upon whatever other screen
sizes I'm going to use and for my next
one I'm just going to have to come in
here and I'm going to type in media is
equal to and I'm going to say only
screen and and then here I'm going to
define my minimum width for which I'm
going to use this specific stylesheet
I'm going to define that as 768 pixels
because that seems to work well here and
max width of 980 pixels put a quote
inside here and then let's move H
reference down here and then inside of
this I'm going to type in style and I'm
going to type in 768 because that works
out well I'm going to copy this and
create two more of these style sheets
the next one we're going to create is
going to have a minimum width of 600
pixels and a maximum
and here I'm just going to take from
this guy up here and type in 767 pixels
so you see all those line up 768 767
down here for my minimum width I'm going
to put 300 pixels and then down here I'm
going to put 599 since this is 600 and
that's 599 then I just need to change
these so I'm going to change this from
768 to 600 and then this guy down here
is going to be 300 and that is going to
point at all the different style sheets
that we're going to need to use now what
I need to do is come in here and
actually build on inside of the HTML
what I have here on the right side of my
screen I like to always use a wrapper
around everything so that I have a
background for my body and then I have a
background for whatever the wrapper is
going to be around everything else I'm
gonna go div class and then define my
wrapper close that out and then I'm
going to close off the wrapper part and
then I like to come in here and say end
of wrapper just so I know where that is
because I can sometimes get lost now
that I have that I'm going to go and
markup this guy right here and I'm going
to make this an aside and then what am I
going to put inside of this guy
well first I'm going to have to
accommodate for my image and that's
going to be located in my images folder
of course that I showed you earlier and
all of these files are going to be
available in a link underneath the video
in the description I'm then going to
give this an ID because there's only
going to be one of them on the screen so
there that is I'm gonna call that logo
and let's give this alt text of new
think tank logo well then we have our
navigation part of our screen and I'm
going to make this an unordered list and
I'm going to make this a class and I'm
going to give it just one name because I
have no reason to give it to different
classes and I'm gonna call this SP icon
list and now inside of here I'm gonna
have to create all the list items for
all these guys right here and I'm going
to use a background to be able to put
this inside of here and then I'll have
all these other different things so
let's go and put in a list item and I'm
going to want to target these list items
both individually as well as as a group
or at least I might want to do that so
I'm going to have a group class name of
SB item and then I'm going to have
another one for first SB so that's
going to be the first thing in the
sidebar then inside of here I'm going to
create a span and let's give this a
class name I can't think of any reason
why I'd want to target these
individually so I'm just going to give
them individual this band name and then
I'm going to type in a bout now what I
need to do is create five of these guys
one two three four five and then I'm
just going to come in and change these
to second and then I'll change this to
contact us change this the third and
that is blog fourth videos and fifth and
this will be podcast then underneath of
it before the sidebar ends I'm going to
throw in a div and this is going to be
for the social part right here whoops
this guy right there flat then drive you
crazy div there's only going to be one
of these on the screen and then I'm
going to call this social and I'm going
to make a span here and give this an ID
equal to social title and let's just
make that let's talk just like it says
close that span off then I'm going to
need to put in some images and so I'm
going to go and put in regular image tag
here let's give it a class name even
though I don't expect to be able to use
it or need to use it but I think that
I'll probably edit these in exactly the
same way so I'm going to call these
social icons and then this is located
again in my images folder so we have
Facebook I see four icon paying and
that's all I need to do there and then
let's go and copy this because we're
going to need three of these paste that
in there paste that in there and then
for this guy we're going to call this
Twitter and then for this one we'll call
this RSS okay so we got that all in
there let's call it social icons not
social cons div and aside so there's
everything that's everything that I'm
going to use in my sidebar based off of
the design that I have here on the right
side of the screen now I come into my
main content area which is going to have
that big giant image inside of it it's
main and I need to put an image inside
of here and that's also going to be Luke
in the images folder and this is called
eyes Fang and let's give this an ID
because it's only going to be one of
those on there and we'll just call this
big image for now and then underneath of
it I'm going to have to put in the
snooze letter area where it's going to
allow them to sign up for a newsletter
so I'm going to put a div inside of here
and let's give this the ID of newsletter
going to put a span inside of that
definitely going to need to change this
let's give it an ID of signup text and
then let's put our text inside of there
so sign up for our free newsletter to
stay up to date dah dah dah dah dah dah
dah let's put the span closing span down
here so it looks a little bit better all
right so let's enlarge this a little bit
because I can see what I want to work
with here then after my span I'm gonna
need to put an input box there so
they'll be able to enter in their input
or their email so they'll be able to get
this guy but I also think that I'm
probably going to want to put a span
around this because I'm going to want to
move this guy right here down here
underneath this text whenever we get
small enough so at some point in time
I'm going to need that so let's say spam
that's what you have to constantly do is
think about the future and very often
what you're going to want to do is
actually create the smallest layout
before you create the larger layouts but
I'm doing it in the opposite direction
just to be crazy all right and let's
close off that span and let's come in
here we need an input box and that's
text and let's give it the name of email
and then let's give it a class name of
email input and basically what I'm doing
here i'm doing this layout out of my
head because i think there's some value
in doing things this way hopefully it
translates what's going on in my head if
that's worth something then I'm going to
put subscribe inside of here and the
reason why is I have a special button
design that I want to use inside of here
that I'm going to mark up in CSS and
then that is the end of the subscription
box all right so now what I need to do
is I need to create all these article
boxes right here and they're pretty
simple but I also know how I'm going to
want to move them around and things on
the screen so I'm going to want to put
them inside of a div and I'm going to
of them a class name of article block
goes that off and then I'm going to
create a specific div for everything
that's going to go inside of here
so let's give that a class name of
article and then let's also give it its
own name just in case I want to design
them differently I don't think I will
but it's in there just in case I do want
to do it there it is I'm going to put an
image inside of here and that's going to
be in the images first T n that is the
name of that picture that I have here
starting with this turtle not going to
need to do anything else there and then
we're going to create another div that's
going to have my title inside of it and
well I think I'm going to want to style
the article title who I absolutely
positive I know I want to do that I
don't know that I would want to style
them differently I can't think of any
reason I want to style them differently
so I'm just gonna give them one class
name the race is what that says and then
close that off and then we have a final
day of which is going to be like an
excerpt so let's just call this article
excerpt and I'll just throw some junk
text and say here's a random picture or
something isn't wonderful blah blah blah
blah blah then I'm gonna need to
basically copy let's just select a lot
get that all organized again I'm going
to want to come in here and create three
more of these guys might want to come in
here and say something like where this
is closing off at and of I know exactly
what I'm copying one two three there's
three more of those so here's the first
one and I call this second art this is
going to be second thumbnail change the
title on that leave that the same make
this third art change this the third
thumbnail change the title for that
leave all this the same this is going to
be fourth art and this is going to be
fourth thumbnail and then the final
title is the benefits of being cute okay
so there you go just some random things
I threw inside of there and that is all
the HTML we're going to need so we got
every single thing here lay it out right
there on our screen now we need to jump
into the CSS and actually move
everything into position so here is the
large CSS file this is going to be the
default
what I'm going to do here first is
define a couple things that are going to
be document wide for every single
article or every single element going to
define my padding is zero for everything
and that's what you do there with a star
targets every element and then I'm going
to define box boiler border box sizing
and what this is going to do is whenever
you define an elements height and weight
it's automatically going to fit whatever
you have the border and padding inside
of it so the border and padding aren't
going to bounce out and hit other
elements and I like to use that a lot
because it makes things neater and
causes or eliminates a lot of conflicts
now I need to define what I want with my
body and I'm going to define my font
size as sixty 2.5% and what that's going
to allow me to do is do a MS like if I
go 1.4 e/m that's going to be equivalent
to fourteen points okay it's just a
little trick I talked about it in my CSS
tutorial or one of these other tutorials
then I'm going to find the font family I
want to use and I'm just going to use
Arial I know it's boring
spell Arial correctly and then I'll say
sans-serif and then I'm going to let's
say I want to define a color this is
just taken from the logo that I'm going
to use so I'm going to just put this in
here so there and 51 and these colors
all come from the wiki colors website
that's where I find all these guys so I
just type in wiki colors in Google and
you will find it all right so then I
need to define my wrapper and I'm just
going to work my way up and let's say
that I want my default font size to be
116 points remember it's 1 point 6 cm
and I'm just accusing that so it scales
nicely and padding I'm going to say 2
e/m for my padding and margin I want the
wrapper is going to be inside of the
body section so what I want to do here
is make sure that it is always centered
and how we Center everything is goes ero
and
for the sides and that's going to
automatically keep the margins equal on
these sides let's say I want to have the
width be 990 pixels remember we're
targeting 980 so I'm just putting that
in there might go back and change it
background color and the background
color is just going to be white and so
for I think that's all I need to do and
I'm just looking at this as a guide so
now what I need to do is put my logo
inside of here now what do I need for my
logo well I don't know let's switch over
and start looking at the website there
you can see it's kind of a mess all
right so first thing I'm going to do
let's just come in here to the logo and
like I said I have all this say in the
description definitely going to want a
margin on the bottom of this so we can
separate the navigation from everything
else so let's just put this at 15 pixels
and let's just leave it at that because
I need to do some things with the asides
and the navigation or a bunch of other
different things here first so now let's
say what we want to do so we've got
wrapper there is our logo and then we
have our items well let's open up our
image again there is our little layout
see this is 34 pixels I'm going to want
to put some space in here so that I have
room for the background for that guy
this is a list which means it's going to
put little bullets everywhere I don't
want those bullets there so I want to
get rid of that and then I see here I
have 21 pixels between each of my list
items so it's bounced back over here
again target SB - item like that and
let's define its height as 34 pixels
just as my little diagram that I have
here showed and list-style-type and
we'll put none inside of there so we get
rid of the bullets and margin-bottom
remember we had 21 pixels between each
of those guys we might come back and
change some things but those are the
things that are obvious right now
looking at this again I can see here the
next big thing is there are 60 pixels
between the navigation section and the
little social thing we have down here so
I'm going to target SB icon list which
is the name of this SB icon list guy
right there so I'm going to target the
entire navigation thing and I'm going to
give it a more
Virgen bottom and this is how I work
everybody's different nobody's wrong I
mean if it works it works so I'm gonna
just put that in there and I like to
just as I'm looking at the diagram the
numbers that pop up that's what I deal
with immediately and as things change I
go and change things so now I'd like to
focus in on individual items here in my
navigation so I want to make sure that I
had get my little images to show up
inside of here well each of these guys
has its own name so theirs is first
actually this is in here twice let's
roll with that let's get rid of that
let's make sure that's over here as well
and yes it is so I put a bout in here
twice that's bad so let's get rid of
that first about now this is first SB
second third fourth and fifth so I want
to target each of those individually
which I have to do because each of them
have a different background so I'm gonna
first say first SB like that and I'm
going to change the background image for
each of these so I'm going to go
background let me go URL and you can see
these guys out here so where is about
this is first SB dot paying that's what
I called it I want to bring to bring
that inside here and here's the images
folder and if we jump outside of that
you can see there is index.html I need
to jump into the images directory right
there
so if I want to jump back one directory
I just go dot dot forward slash and I go
images and its first SB dot thing there
it is and I want it to be positioned at
the bottom and the left side of the
background and also of course no-repeat
because if it would repeat it it would
get in the way of the text and that is
basically all I'm going to need to do
for those so I'm going to go and copy
that and I'm going to need four of these
and then I'm going to go second SB third
fourth and fifth and then change this so
this is going to be second third and I
like to keep see this is the same name I
like doing that because it just works
well in my head just a little tips that
work for me they might won't work for
you just like to bring them up there we
go boom and now we can see there is our
background images and now we need to
move these guys into position so how we
going to do that well let's just move
over here
and you can see this is called list span
right there and they all have the same
name so I can move them all at the same
time so this fan I'm going to say
display I want to be able to style the
margins and padding on these guys but I
do not want them to act like block
elements so I'm just going to call them
in line block I'm going to put some
padding on them on the left side to
accommodate for our image we have here
let's just put it in 45 pixels and see
if that works I'm also going to put in a
little bit of padding on the top and
let's just say 8 pixels for that and
font size is way too small so let's go
and play around with one size as well so
1.4 am and see how that works and let's
reload it and there we go now you can
see everything's lining up looks about
right I think yeah good enough okay so
we got our little navigation set up now
now we want to go in and fix our social
title this guy we want the let's talk to
be above that and we want a line inside
of there which we're going to use a
border for that so if we jump over here
and look at that here is social and
there specifically is social title which
is the first thing I'm gonna target here
so that was an ID so I'm going to put a
hash symbol inside of there this I'm
going to display as block because I want
to have a new line remember I wanted a
border on the bottom of this that was a
dashed border and that's one pixel
dashed and let's give it the same colors
before there it is let's just copy this
and just use that because it's there
paste that in there and let's define the
width for this guy and if we open this
up let's see what do we have here is for
a width well we have 143 by 124 okay
good so let's go in there since I took
the time to draw out all that stuff it's
going to save me a lot of time thinking
and it I think it's a lot easier than
trying to do this live on the screen
let's say padding bottom of 5 pixels and
margin bottom of 10 pixels okay reload
let's talk is in there choose that looks
pretty good
hmm I don't know if I want to change
that at all let's say that I want to put
a little bit of padding on the right
side of them just to separate them a
little bit so social icons like that and
padding on the right side of each of
those of seven pixels because it doesn't
look like it needs much and there it is
just moved it a little bit so that looks
pretty good now I need to get my aside
to flow to the left side of the screen
so that I can have the main section flow
to the right side of screen so this is
going to be on the left and then this is
going to be margin right and let's go 35
pixels to separate those just a little
bit just to see if that works then the
main section is this guy over here so we
want to target in main and for now like
I said don't know I'm just working here
so not thinking too much I'm saying well
I don't think I need to do anything with
main at least not right now I want to
slowly work everything in here so that
everything fits and looks good and I
don't know something going on let's just
keep on working so I want to get this
image right here my big image and
remember that's an ID so big image and
I'm going to put a margin on the bottom
of that like that and let's just say 50
pixels because that sounds about right
then I want to target the newsletter
section this guy right here this is
probably causing the problem so let's
come in here newsletter again it's an ID
and I want to use background again let's
go look at this say this is what I'm
going to be marking up I want this to be
a background image again so let's go and
make that a background image background
URL and I'm going to need to go outside
of the or go to the route it's so that I
can go into the images folder and
newsletter - I see and that's a ping
file and again I'm going to put that in
the bottom left side of the screen and
no-repeat again just like before ah my
height keep half and openness up let's
just leave it open for now 35 let's say
35 34 or something like that
I think it's the 34 inside of there
because I think that's actually marked
up wrong well
change it if we have to and then we'll
go padding-left
and let's say 54 for this change it if
we have to and then we're going to want
to position this subscribe span remember
I put a span around this part right here
because I want to sometimes move it down
underneath it here so I'm going to
position this relative so that I will be
able to position absolute with that span
later on so that I can move it around
and then margin bottom let's just leave
it the same as before which is 50 pixels
that's what I had at the top and that's
what I decided to to there and 80 pixels
on that and reload it and there you go
starting to fit in there a little bit
nicer now I got to get this part fixed
up that little guy and then I'm also
going to have to put the button inside
of there
so let's target the signup text sign-up
tucks and that has a width of 317 pixels
I know that because of how I did my
markup when I was looking at that I want
to be able to add margins and such to
this but I want it to act like an inline
element let's go and use a font size and
let's just say 1 a.m. see how that works
out and margin right of 60 pixels and
padding top of 5 pixels yeah see that
went to three lines I want to only be
one line so let's see if changing this
to just 0.9 works and it does so now
that is on two lines come back here do I
need to do anything also signup text
nothing that I know of the email input
I'm going to shrink that down let's say
that I want my height which I had
defined before as let's say 30 pixels
and the width is the big one that's a
170 pixels margin right let's say 30
pixels
don't know and reload and there it is
it's a little bit bigger I'm going to
want to move this guy up here so that
lines up a little bit nicer and now I
get to get the button I already had a
button CSS or I had the CSS for the
button that I wanted to use so I'm just
going to paste that inside of there and
I cover this in my CSS tutorial I add a
radius to it and a whole bunch of other
different styling and then down here you
can see I have a top gradient and that
is what I use so if you want to learn
more about how border radiuses work and
gradients and all that you can look at
the CSS tutorial there we go reload and
there you can see it looks pretty nice
little gradient okay so now I want to
come in here to this subscribe span part
start styling this guy so that we are
and we're going to be positioning this
absolutely and that is so that we can
line it up or absolute sorry about that
said absolutely and it came out on the
screen and I'm going to have the bottom
of it be 10 and I want the margin top
let's try eight pixels reload and that
looks close enough okay so all I did was
move that up remember this whole entire
thing is relative and I move that inside
of there so now what well the article
themselves so the article and I know
that I want to again be able to work
with margins of padding but I want it to
act like I'm in an inline item so inline
block there this guy is I can see that I
have 164 for the width of this guy and
let's see so let's play around there's
different margins and all those
different things so I just have to pop
those in so I go whip and let's say 160
for our pixels
see if that works up the way I hope it
did and margin on the right sift 16
pixels works like that said it would
reload it ooh not bad okay there's a
little bit of a gap over here let's say
that I take this up to 166 and see if
that completely fouls up everything a
little bit doesn't it let's
down to 165 reload it yeah it's gonna
want to be hmm
164 okay it likes 164 so I'm leaving at
164 all right so now what well the
article title article title we're
basically just going to put some margins
inside of there so that it lines up
better and so we'll go margin top and
let's just go 10 pixels because that's a
nice default and then we'll go margin
bottom and we'll do the same thing there
10 pixels see if that works and then
finally I know what I want to do I want
that to be 166 margin but no data I know
why it was throwing that off this has a
margin on it remember I put margin right
on all those different guys this right
here 16 pixels so what I want to do I
want to go fourth art like that and I'm
going to go Marge and right just on that
one thing it's a good thing I went and
put that in there and change that to
zero pixels that see and now what we'll
be able to do is come in here to the
article part change this to like 166 and
see if that lines up a little bit better
reload bingo now it lines up almost
perfectly with that that's perfect so
this is perfect and that's perfect and I
did that by getting rid of the margin
right on the last article there you go
guys
there I marked up one page now you need
to go in and mark up the other different
resolutions were aiming at okay so now
what we need to do is take what we had
originally in our layout and transfer
there that over into our style 768 CSS
file so what do we need to change here
basically I just copied everything from
the style large and put it inside a
style six or seven sixty eight dot CSS
I'm not going to need to change any of
this stuff I'm going to not need to
change the font size at all the wrapper
doesn't need to change except for this
guy right here I'm going to change this
to 768 768 the logo is definitely going
to need to change because the logo went
from being on the left side of the
screen to be in the top and what I'm
going to do with this is I'm just going
to get rid of that so I'm going to just
comment that out front right now and I'm
going to want to display that inline
block so display:inline-block and that's
all I'm going to do for that right now
the sidebar items are definitely going
to change quite a bit
so let's come in here and look at
and we can see the height is going to be
somewhere in the 66 pixel range width is
going to be somewhere inside of the 48
pixels range I don't have that written
here but I know because I know well how
big these images are with style type is
going to be none margin bottom is going
to change so let's just go in and start
changing those things so we'll say the
height what did we say over here 60s on
that 66 between that okay so let's just
say 62 pixels for the height of this guy
let's say a width of 48 pixels with
style type none that's perfectly fine
I'm not going to want a margin on this
anymore so let's make margin bottom
equal to zero I am however going to want
a padding on my top which is going to
accommodate the icon that is now at the
top instead of being to the left side of
the screen and let's say 50 pixels for
that guy since I don't want it to go up
and down vertically but instead I want
it to go side-to-side horizontally I'm
going to change the display on this to
be display inline and I'm going to want
everything to be adjusted to the right
side of the screen so I'm going to put a
margin on that so say a margin left and
we'll say 35 pixels because that sounds
about right
okay so bounce over here say all this
changes reload now remember nothing's
going to change it's only going to chain
up see there we go
so now we got that we can actually
shrink that down a little bit more fit
that a little bit better on our screen
there we go so now we just need to move
all this stuff into place I'm going to
get the entire list and change the
margin bottom on this to say let's try
that 50 pixels I'm also going to want to
change the width to what I figured out
it would be in the markup to 540 pixels
and then this is going to
display:inline-block your load there we
go
now I need to make the icons go above
instead of to the left side of the
screen so find these guys and here I'm
going to say pop and center there it
went up our we're just I need to play
around with that a little bit
positioning once the top paste that in
there paste that in there so you can see
I'm doing
a lot of changes here and it's not
really forcing me to change that many
different things now we come down here
to the list span area which are all of
the individual words for all the
navigations so let's come in here we're
going to need to change those good bit
they can still remain inline-block
that's good padding left I don't want
anything there now so I want that to be
zero pixels because remember the icon
used to be on the left padding top eight
pixels let's see how that works I don't
know let's reload it and see what it
looks like there we go snapped right
into place and it looks pretty good I'm
not going to fiddle with it I think it
looks good enough this guy right here
I'm just going to get rid of it all
together because I don't think that I
need it so I'm just going to go into the
social area let's just change this to
social and then for display I'm going to
change it to none which is going to make
it not show up at all on the screen so
we can get rid of social icons as well
the aside I don't need to float that
left anymore because it doesn't float
left the main section well that doesn't
float right anymore because remember we
have that taking up all the screen space
available big image 50 pixels that looks
fine I don't know let's just go and see
what happens so reload could see that
one away and you can see that everything
lines up perfectly so didn't have
changed that many different things and
as far as I'm concerned that is a
success looks exactly like the other one
so now we'll come in here and let's look
at the last design that we need to work
with and that is this guy right here and
what we need to do is get rid of those
icons altogether and we'll move that
inside of there so let's go and we're
going to copy everything that's here and
then go into style 600 and paste that in
there alright
once again padding doesn't need to
change none of these need to change the
body doesn't need to change the font the
color
none of those need to change wrapper
section this is going to need to change
let's change this to 600 pixels might
need to come in here and change the
padding on this wrapper eventually but
I'm not going to worry about that now
until I am 100% positive about what I
want to do with it my logo I'm
definitely going to have to shrink that
down because it's getting to the point
where it's just too big so what are we
going to need to do display:inline-block
that's perfectly fine let's go and
change my height percentage lower so say
76 pixels
and the width of 84 pixels just to see
if that works
and margin-left and will just reload
that and there you can see now we're
getting smaller so I'm going to need to
move that over and move this over here
and then get rid of those icons all
together so let's go and move our logo
over just a little bit let's change the
margin left on that to negative 15
pixels and see how that works out SB
items which are each of the individual
items we have there I'm going to get rid
of the height on that guy get rid of the
width as well we don't have to worry
about the icon showing up anymore so I'm
going to get rid of all those guys and
let's get rid of this padding as well
because once again that just
accommodates the icons there's no other
reason for it margin bottom zero pixels
that seems to be fine display inline
that seems to be fine
list-style-type:none that seems to be
fine let's also come in and change the
background as a remember we don't have
background image anymore let's just
change the background on that to none
that also means we'll be able to come
down here and get rid of all these
background images where we set those in
so let's get rid of those there you can
see that lines up okay this of course is
terrible we'll fix that later though
margin left let's change that to like 14
pixels and then this is going to shrink
down and so forth and so on to fit
everything I'll still accommodate
everything else so we'll just leave that
the way it is right now the icon list
itself margin bottom 50 pixels that
seems to be fine at this point we're
going to have to change the width again
on this because remember we're working
with 600 pixels so let's change that to
430 display:inline-block that's
perfectly fine however I think I might
want to take the size down on this text
so I'm going to say something like font
size and last time point 90 I'm worked
well so let's try 0.9 again reload and
it's starting to look a little bit
better once again this is going to
change let's pan inline-block zero
pixels 8 pixels 1.4 let's see if that
works fine socials still not going to be
displayed of course we could have moved
that around or done something else we'd
like to do with that the background
image now this is going to have to
change it's 50 pixels margin bottom
let's just say that that's okay
and let's take this size down a
percentage so
change it to 570 pixels so most of the
screen remember this is 600 and that and
reload and there you go it's fitting in
a little bit better newsletter section
don't need to change the bottom left
no-repeat that's all fine the height 34
pixels that doesn't need to change the
height there's nothing all that adding
left 54 relative and 50 pixels that
looks like that's fine
so for sign up text this is going to
need to change let's take that down the
same percentage that we took everything
else down which comes out to 246
inline-block seems fun let's change the
font size to 0.7 e/m to accommodate that
margin right we don't need as much of a
margin here because we're viewing this
on a smaller screen so let's take this
down a lot let's take down to 15 pixels
padding top that doesn't need to change
we're worried about right and left we're
not worried about anything else
so let's reload that and there you can
see I'm starting to get more room here
to be able to change and fit everything
else email input let's change this to 25
pixels and we'll change the width a good
bit change that to 150 pixels margin
right hmm and then let's change that to
15 pixels see how that works out and
reload say I want that subscribe button
to come up here and button that looks
about right maybe we would want to
commit here for the padding section just
to give us a little bit more room let's
change this to 10 instead of 15 see how
that works
ah there it goes okay so everything's on
one line so everything's awesome
subscribe span absolute 10 8 pixels that
nothing else looks wrong there so why
fiddle with that inline-block 166 16
pixels what I think I'm going to do
since this drop down here I'm just going
to eliminate it altogether that seems to
be the easiest way to handle all that so
I'm going to come in here to 4th art and
I'm going to say display:none there that
is and reload and now it went away I'm
back up here's figure out what else
we're looking at subscribe to an article
that all looks fine 166 we're going to
change the margin right on this a little
bit
the fact we don't have that other little
guy there so that works article title 10
pixels 10 pixels it seems to fit so why
fiddle with it and third art let's do
the same thing we did previously with
4th art third art right like this and
eliminate the margin right margin right
zero pixels and let's see how that works
and there you can see it's almost
perfect pretty much almost lines up with
air on the outside of the screen there
you go guys that is my responsive web
design tutorial I leave it to you to go
in here and create style - 300 for
homework I know you can do it because I
taught you everything else you need to
know basically what I would do is I
would just have each of these articles
take up one line so you either move the
title and the text over here and have
all those on individual lines you could
then do something like move the
navigation into the bottom of the screen
or the crop of the screen or whatever
and Center the icon and do whatever you
would like to do with that I could
fiddle with this a little bit more but I
think you guys get the gist and if you
guys have any interest maybe in the next
tutorial responsive web design with a
fluid layout so please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
