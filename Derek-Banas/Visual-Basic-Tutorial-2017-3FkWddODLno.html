visual basic tutorial you guys have
asked me to cover visual basic and since
it's one of the only languages I haven't
covered I thought it would be fun to
jump in and cover it over the next
couple videos in this tutorial we're
going to be covering GUI design event
handling data types some math exception
handling input and output casting
message box and a whole bunch of other
different things on top of that I will
be also working with the newest version
of Visual Studio which is version 2017
which is free to download there's a link
in the description to all the code that
I use in this video as well as a
transcript and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it all right so what
you're going to want to do first is get
Visual Studio 2017 now this says release
candidate that will change to just
regular Visual Studio 2017 and where you
get it for free is at Visual Studio comm
/v s /video - 2017 - RC and this is
extremely easy to download it's not it
doesn't have any of the problems a 2015
had and all you're going to do is just
click on free download click on next a
whole bunch of times and you will be
ready to go then after you have that all
installed you're just going to come in
I'm using Windows 10 here and you're
going to find Visual Studio 2015 and
there it is right there
Visual Studio 2017 and the RC might not
be there for you or it might be there
and if you're doing this right now
obviously it is so what we're going to
do here is we are going to create a new
project so we're just going to come up
here and go file and new project and I
am going to use Windows forms app so
you're just going to select that guy
right there and you're going to come
down here and you're going to give it a
name I'm going to call this VB cut one
and click on OK and it is going to open
up a little form here for you over here
you're going to find all of the
different values you're going to be able
to change for all of your different
components the currently selected one is
the form and you'll be able to change
all kinds of things there and I'm going
to be creating obviously some forms and
then down here you're going to see all
of the different
things you're going to be able to drag
and drop into your form so what we're
going to do first off is I'm going to
get a label so I'm going to grab this
label right here did I grab it let's see
I'm going to track it up here and drop
it inside of there and you can see yes
indeed it is called label one you might
want to view this full screen now as
that is selected I'm then going to come
over here and I'm going to give it a
name that's going to make sense so I'm
going to call this label name LBL name
it is very common to use the LBL
for labels inside a visual basic
whenever you are laying out these
different components and I am going to
come down here and also I'm going to
pick a size for this so 39 by 13 let's
change that now let's just leave it that
way that's perfectly fine also you're
going to have the text here I'm going to
change this to something that makes a
little bit more sense I'm going to type
in name and hit enter and that's all I'm
going to do and now you can see up here
inside of our form that we have a label
and name is inside of it now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get a little
text box so let's just scroll through
here there is a text box right there
I am going to grab it look did I grab
the right guy yes I did alright so I'm
going to grab the text box and I'm going
to throw it next to the label that I
have here and let's go and give it a
name so we're going to come over here
once again to the properties for our
component and I'm going to come in and
very often when you're using text box it
is common to start the name off for that
with txt and I'm just going to call it
text name and I'm not going to put
anything in the text area so just leave
that blank over here for size let's
change that to say something like 208
and the height let's just leave that at
20 so just hit enter and now you can see
there is our label and there is our text
box and we'll be able to grab it and
drag it and move it around if we'd like
to as well I'm going to add a couple
more a little bit more functionality
here I'd say I'd like to get a button so
I'm going to grab a button and I'm going
to drag it and
robbed that button right there what are
we gonna do we're gonna come over and we
are going to give it a name again so
come over here and it's common start
the button components off with BTN I'm
going to call this BTN okay come down
inside of here and for the text for my
button I'm going to change that to okay
and let's say that I would want to have
a shortcut for this button that would
allow me to just click on the oh and my
keyboard and that would automatically be
the same as if I would clicked on it I
can do that by just typing in an and and
then okay like that and let's change the
size on this guy little bit let's have
75 23 let's just leave it that way all
right so we can just click on enter and
you can see now that it says okay there
now you're going to also be able to go
and get these components and copy and
paste them so you got another component
here let's say that I want to create
three of them just paste this again come
in here and then let's go and click on
this one and we'll have it do something
a little bit different let's change its
name to txt and message this is going to
open up a message box on our screen here
very very soon come down inside of this
guy and what we're going to do for this
is say that we want them to be able to
type in an M on the keyboard so go and M
and just type in message keep the size
exactly the same don't need to change
anything else there come over here to
the third button and zoom in on this and
I guess I don't really say basically hi
jet d'eau excited whenever I was making
this basically Visual Basic is really
cool because it provides an easy way to
make pretty complicated GUI applications
and it's also very often used to
interface with databases and by
understanding the basics of Visual Basic
you'll also be able to use something
else called Visual Basic for
applications which is a scripting
language you can use with a whole bunch
of different applications in the
Microsoft Office suite and the major
attraction of Visual Basic is it allows
you to create applications by just what
you see here just by dragging dropping
components and it requires very little
code as you'll see also here in
so I got all excited and started just
playing with and I didn't talk about why
visual basic school alright so we're
going to call this guy button exit
come down inside of here and the text
that we want to put inside of here let's
say that this time we want to them to be
able to click on X on the keyboard just
go and and exit like that and there we
go so there is our basic form that we
have here and now we're going to make it
do some stuff now basically what we want
to do is we want whenever they click on
the ok button for some stuff to happen
and basically what we're going to do is
they're going to come in here they're
going to type in their name they're
going to click on the ok button and then
the information inside this text box is
going to change from just their name to
say hello whatever their name is alright
so if you want to add what's called an
event handler which just means when an
event occurs like this button being
clicked on that event is going to be
handled and something is going to be
done it's very easy in Visual Basic you
just double click on this and look at
that now you're able to come in here and
automatically have it do some stuff now
all of the code that you see here inside
of this class for your form they have
here is going to define what happens
with your form and what we're
specifically going to do here is define
how to handle different events like
mouse clicks and things like that now
this guy right here is known as a
subroutine and it is not going to return
any values it is just a regular old guy
that's going to do things whenever that
button is clicked on and the code that
is inside of this subroutine is going to
run every single time that button is
clicked on so we're going to do here is
we want to refer to this text box over
here and remember that it's name is
whoops let's click on the text box here
is the text box and its name is text
name so we want to do is go and get the
value that is inside of there and which
is going to be the you know the person's
name and we want to change it whenever
the button is clicked on so to do that
we just type in text name and dot text
and if we want to change the text that's
inside of there we can say that it will
be equal to now hello put a space and
then if you want to concatenate
eight or join strings you just put an
end and side here like this
and we can get the name that is already
in there and replace it with a new hello
name and to do so you just go and use
text once again
so it's pretty simple stuff and we save
that and we can jump over here it
doesn't really matter if we do and if
you want to run your application just
click on start right up here and here is
our application pretty simple and I can
just type in Derek like that and click
on OK and you can see that it now prints
out hello Derek okay so let's go and add
some more function out of here that was
pretty simple
let's do something else let's say down
here whenever they click on message or
they click on the M remember that's
going to be allowed for us let's say we
want to open up a message box and once
again say hello so just double click on
that you can see it automatically went
and created that for us here and to open
up a message box all you do is type in
message box dot show and let's say they
just keep this simple we'll say that we
want to have it say hello and then go
and text name and get the text that is
in the text box inside of there and then
if we also want to put a message at the
top of our message box we could do so
here with the after that comma
so we'll say hello and we'll just be
boring and do the same thing again
so we'll say text name and text and we
can save that you can see then take much
code click on start and now we have new
functionality once again so now we'll
come in here and we'll type in dark did
to Derek and click on message and there
is our message box alright so there's
something else we can do and let's keep
on going now let's go and say we want to
make the exit functionality work and all
this is going to do is close our
application when it's clicked on and to
close it all you have to do is say me
dot close like this and you can see
that's going to work and we can run it
and there it is and if we just click on
exit you're going to see that it closed
that's it alright so that's how we open
applications and that's how we close
applications now let's come in here and
do some things that are a little bit
more complex again we'll open up our
little form that we have here and we're
going to throw some new little things
inside here I'm going to come down
inside of my tool box and grab a text
box and I'm going to throw this here
this is going to do some adding and
subtracting of different values we'll
come over here scroll up here and we're
going to call this text box
txt add value one and let's change a
couple things it's not going to have any
text inside of it we are definitely
going to change the size of it though
let's go and change our width to 55 and
just leave that be 20 like that and
there you can see it's a little bit
smaller now we can also come in and add
a button inside of here so let's go and
get button drag that up there drop it
inside of there and the button we are
going to call BTN add values and what
this is going to do is it's going to
take two different values it's going to
add them and put a result on our screen
so we'll go and scroll down here and the
text inside of here is going to be a
plus and the width definitely doesn't
need to be that big let's change it to
23 just like the height is currently and
there you can see is a little addition
button there once again we can grab this
all we can also click on it and go and
click with our arrow buttons so up to
move that into a position that makes a
little bit more sense hey let's grab
another little text box inside of here
drag it drop it up inside of there and
it doesn't really matter where it goes
because like I said you can go and click
around move it around with your little
keys and let's go and give this a
different name so we're going to call
this text add value - pretty simple it's
not going to have any different not
going to have any text inside of here
let's go scroll down a little bit more
and the width on this guy let's also
have that be 55 and right there would be
where you will put two texts or so many
different things you do here and that
looks pretty good so now what are we
going to do well I think I'm going to
oh and get myself a label it's just
going to be an equal sign so come down
here in our tool box and there's a label
and we'll drag it up here oops what I do
there we go
drop that there move it down into
position let's go and change the name on
this to LBL add equal and it's not going
to do anything that's why it's a label
and scroll down to the bottom let's
change the text on this to just be an
equal sign and let's change the size on
this guy to 13
and let's just leave it be 13 all right
so there's our label all right so now
what we need to do is have another text
box here that is going to allow us to
display the answer so we'll come down
again text box drag it drop it right
there come over here and scroll inside
of here and we're going to call this
text some answer and scroll down the
size for this obviously needs to be
smaller so change this to a width of 55
and the text inside of there let's just
leave that have nothing inside of it
once again okay so there you go not the
prettiest looking thing ever but I just
want to demonstrate a whole bunch of
different things here so now what's
going to happen is users going to be
able to type in a number type in another
number hit a plus sign and the answer is
going to show up right there so to add
that event handling functionality to the
little button we have here just double
click it and you can see it's right
there now very often whenever we are
working with events there is the
potential vet and error could occur so
let's say for example somebody goes and
hits that plus sign but they didn't put
a number inside of the two text boxes we
have or they did put or they put a
letter inside of there we obviously
can't add letters so what we want to do
is potentially stop any error that could
occur how you do that is with exception
handling so what we're going to do is go
try to do something that could
potentially cause an error and then
inside of here
going to go and create some different
data types and since I'm here I might as
well just talk about some data types
alright so there are a whole bunch of
different data types inside of Visual
Basic I just want to talk about some of
them there are interred all by the way
if you want to make a comment which is
just going to be a line of text that's
going to be completely ignored by our
interpreter here inside of Visual Basic
you just put a single quote and then
type stuff out and it will be ignored
now you have integers and they are going
to hold values of it's like two one four
seven four eight three six four eight so
that's going to be the smallest number
and then the largest number you're going
to be able to hold inside of an integer
datatype is going to be that guy right
there so there is no decimals and it's
just going to be their whole numbers
that's when an integer is it's the same
in every programming language then
another data type if you need to hold a
number that's even bigger than that is a
long and you can see how big a long can
be quite large another data type that
you're going to use a lot is a decimal
and they are quite large you can see
plus or minus this gigantic number is
going to be the types of numbers you're
going to work with in regards to
decimals and another thing that's great
about decimals is that they are precise
to 20 times 29 decimal places you're
also going to have doubles which are
going to be and this is integer not
integers whenever you define it I'm
going to create some variables here in a
second then you have doubles and they
are also going to be quite large
extremely large numbers the only problem
with a double is that it is not precise
that's why inside a Visual Basic you
should normally use decimals and not
doubles and by the way these decimals
are going to have the ability to have
decimal places inside of them they are
floating-point numbers instead of whole
numbers like you have with integers and
Long's and another datatype you're going
to have is going to be a boolean and it
boolean is either going to have a value
of true or false
should never try to save anything else
in a bullying except for the values of
true or false
and for now that is all I'm going to
cover in regards to the different data
types available we'll get more into them
here later on however all right so back
inside of here now basically what we
want to do is we want to create two
variables in a variable is just going to
be a place we can temporarily store data
value so to create a variable you type
in D I M which is short for dimension
which is like referring to the size of
the data that you want to be working
with I can get more into the specifics
of what the di M means but there's no
reason we get confusing so if you want
to create a variable just type in di m
then you're going to give it a name so
I'm going to say first number and then
I'm going to define what type of data
type it's going to be so this is going
to be as an integer because I don't need
it to be a huge number and whenever you
are pulling data from a form like we
have over here we're going to be pulling
this data first number from this guy
right here
whenever you're pulling that information
it's going to come in as a string we
want to convert it from regular old
characters to an actual integer and to
do that you need to cast it so it's
going to be changed from a string into
an integer to do that you type in C I
and T like this and then to get the
value that is currently stored inside of
there you're going to refer to it by the
name that I defined for it's over inside
of our form wizard and to get that you
then type in text and you have it but we
can't settle with that we also need to
get to the second number that they
entered in so we're going to come in
here and we'll call this second number
just keep that simple and we will change
this to value two now we want to come in
here because we want to output our
result so we're going to create another
variable and this is just going to be
called sum and we want to go and add the
first number plus the second number and
with ups let it
second number and there that is and now
we need to convert the integer into a
string so that we can save it back into
our result and the name for our result
let's just click on this again is going
to be this guy right here so that guy
right there and if we come over here and
look at the name it's name is txt some
answer so it's just back over here again
so text some answer and if we want to
change the value for it see if you can
remember what that's going to be going
to be text and then we want to convert
from a integer into a string so we're
going to type in C STR and some right
like that and if you're wondering how to
convert into the other different
datatypes you would use c beol that is
going to convert any value into a
boolean you're also going to be able to
convert into a double with c dbl you're
also going to be able to convert into a
decimal with C Dec and a long with LNG
like that so those are the different
ways to convert into the different types
that you would want to work with all
right so that is all that we need to do
with this inside of this try block
that's going to be all the potential
problems and remember like I said if
they didn't enter something or if they
entered a letter or something that
wasn't a number this is going to catch
that potential problem now the error
that I am going to probably have here is
what is called an invalid cast exception
which means it is going to be an
exception in which I'm trying to cast
something like a string that would be a
character for example into a number
can't be done that throws an exception
so I want to catch it now this one that
pops up down here is the default that is
going to be triggered if I don't catch
the specific exception that occurred or
the specific error that occurred so
inside of this I am going to have a
message box open up and I'm going to say
message box dot show and because I
didn't catch this error I'm going to say
and on
own error occurred and then remember I
can go and put a title inside of here
across the top and I'm just going to
type in error right there now it's not
good to not have any idea what your
exception is you want to use something
that is specific so I'm going to say
what I expect to occur which means they
typed in a letter or left nothing inside
of there and in that situation I would
get an exception that is referred to as
system and you're going to learn these
exceptions just by making errors then
the errors are going to show up down
here in this general area right there
that's how you're going to learn them so
don't worry about not knowing them and
the one of them I'm expecting to occur
is invalid cast exception and then for
this guy I'm just going to come down
here and I'm going to have a message box
open but this one is going to be more
specific and what it is going to be is
please enter numbers to sum and I can
just leave error be there inside of
there another thing it's kind of cool is
if you would like to print out
information in your console for
debugging purposes you could also come
down here and print to the console by
going console right line and you just do
something simple like an error occurred
just to throw something down there just
to show you how to write down here in
your console window as well and then
after this you're going to see n try
that ends our try block where we could
have potential problems and then we'll
have and the subroutine that's what this
subpart stands for so we can save that
and we can run it as long as we can do
anything wrong and there it is so let's
bring this guy right here and we're
going to type in a four and a five and
hit plus and you can see that it printed
out the answer there however let's say
that I typed in an A here and hit plus
it is going to open up a window it says
please enter
please enter numbers to some I can click
on OK you're also going to see right
here is the exception that was thrown
exception thrown system invalid cast
exception say told you that's where we
could get that information
and that is the gist of what we could do
with this guy so we're going to click on
exit and exit out of there
all right so pretty cool stuff now let's
go and create another one just so I can
show you an additional way to cast as
well as another example of a math
function we could use remember we can
just copy all of this I'm just holding
down the shift key to select multiple
components at once copy and paste saves
us a little bit of time come in here and
then we just need to give these
different names so come over here select
this guy and I'm going to call this text
divided value 1 leave everything else be
exactly the same come in click on this
guy this is going to be a button button
and let's just say button divided values
and we want to come down into the text
area inside of here and change that from
a plus to a Division and enter and
that's all set up select the next little
text box we have right there over here
and we will say text and divide value 2
and we don't need to do anything else
with that and the equals sign here which
is a label I select that and go label
divide equal and it's always good to
give every single component a good name
because you you know it's good idea all
right and because you know at some point
in the future if you just let random
things go in there you're going to get
random answers and not have any idea
what's going on and then I'm going to
select the last part here which is where
my answer is going to show up come over
here select this guy and we'll call this
text division answer
to put something inside of there and we
don't need do anything else with that
and hit enter and there we're ready to
go so now we want to add some event
handling functionality to this division
button here so double click on it you
can see it opened up for us and here
we're going to be working with decimals
instead so I'm going to go dim and let's
just call this a first num as decimal
and remember we like decimals because
they are precise numbers and what I want
to do here is I want to convert from a
string into a decimal and let's go text
divided value 1 and to get the text
that's in that text box you just type in
dot txt and we'll go copy this guy and
we'll paste that there we'll go and get
our second number and change this to
value two because that's what I call
that and there we are everything else is
perfectly fine and now just to do
something different what I want to do is
divide these decimals and then convert
the answer into an integer so how do we
do that well we can do it in a different
way what is referred to as the C type
function so I'm going to call this int
solution and remember I want it to be an
integer is going to be equal to and you
can type in C type and then convert into
multiple different values here I could
do this division outside of here and
then just put the variable name inside
of there or I can put it inside of here
just want to show you different ways to
do it so we're going to say first number
is equal to second number and division
and then what we want to do is get the
answer for that division and convert it
into an integer and that's what C type
is going to do for us it's going to
allow us to define that we want it
converted into an integer or some other
or data type and then finally to go and
put the answer back inside of our form
we can go text division answer dot text
is equal to we want to convert it back
into a string so go C string int
solution is the guy that we want to be
working with here and if we save it and
we run it let's go and see what happens
so
we'll come in here and we'll do a
division so remember this accepts
decimals so we'll say something like
five point five whatever and divided by
four and click on the division and you
can see one comes back there we could
also convert this and the reason why is
because I said I want the integer result
to show up here that's what this guy
does right there and you can revert that
into a two and hit that and you can see
that a three comes back and the reason
why a three comes back is because it
gets this value and it rounds it up
whenever it converts it into an integer
all right
so there you go guys that is a whole
heck of a lot of stuff about Visual
Studio as well as Visual Basic in
general and I'm going to be making a
whole bunch of other different videos
and getting into the meat of the
language as this tutorial continues it's
not going to be a huge tutorial just
diet plan on probably making about six
videos just enough to cover what you
would learn about Visual Basic in a
standard three hundred page book so like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
