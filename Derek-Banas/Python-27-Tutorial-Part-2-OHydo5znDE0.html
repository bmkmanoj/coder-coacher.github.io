Python 2.7 tutorial today I'm going to
cover tuples lists and dictionaries
variable types a tuple list and a
dictionary are very similar to what are
called arrays in other programming
languages basically what an array is or
any of these guys is a bunch of boxes
that can hold any type of value so they
can hold strings they can hold numbers
floats individual characters boolean
values anything that you want to put
into them and each of these locations is
referenced by what's called an index you
can think of it as the address or the of
the location of the individual variable
value that is stored inside of one of
these guys so if you wanted to access
for example let's say you created a tube
or a list that was called customer and
you wanted to access the value that is
stored in the index of zero would be Bob
you could just simply put the 0 inside
of square brackets and if you had a
print in front of customers square
brackets with a 0 in the middle it would
print out the value of Bob to the screen
you can see that it would proceed
upwards in indexes but you could also
reference the last value inside of the
tube or list by using negative 1
negative 2 negative 3 and so forth so
you can see here examples of that so
what's really the difference between a
two point A List the difference is once
you define a tuple and give it values
you cannot go in and change these values
on an individual basis however with a
list you can and let's also have a whole
bunch of other powerful functions you
can mess around with and on top of that
a tuple is what is called immutable if
you ever hear that fancy word it just
means can't be changed now you can
completely change every value in here
all at one time and I'm going to show
you how to do that but you cannot change
these on an individual basis so what's
the difference between a to point a list
and dictionary dictionaries have keys
and values so instead of a index a
dictionary has an actual thing we call a
key which is just a string that
represents the value that is held inside
of the dictionary let's get into actual
coding Here I am back inside of Eclipse
I'm going to show you exactly how to
create a tuple this is just an arbitrary
variable name you don't have to begin it
with word tuple and
say I want to put my name in here and I
want to put an integer which is my age
and the city I live in and the state I
live in now if I print this the screen
you can see it prints out all this
information I put inside here but if I
wanted to instead pronounce just my name
using indexes you can see it does that
and I can also go in here and reference
all the other indexes individually one
thing that's kind of weird about tuples
is let's say you wanted to actually
create a tuple that has only one value
you would define it by like this you
have to put this extra comma in here so
that's how you would it put an
individual variable inside of a tuple
let's say also you wanted to change this
string into a tuple how would you do
that with a tuple function right like
that now if you print the screen you
could say that all those individual
values are broken apart so that's how
you would turn a string into a tuple and
of course you could put the variable
name of a string in here instead of the
string itself and you have things called
slices and pretty much what that is it
you can actually reference the beginning
and the ending index for anything you
would want to put the screen so let's
say I take tuple X 2 and I want to print
the screen all of the index is starting
with 0 and up to but not including the
values stored in the second index you
can see that's exactly what it did this
being the zero index and this being the
1 remember it prints up to but not
including the second index C being the
second index and that's pretty much all
you can do with tuples there are no
other methods there's really nothing
else to a tuple so let's get into this
how would you create a list you just
change the brackets so instead of that
round bracket use a square bracket just
like this and to prove that this is a
list I just put in the type function
which you saw in the previous tutorial
but I should probably call this list
example so this doesn't get confusing
for you now I'm going to show you all
the things you can do with these guys
and there are many let's say you can
also cut slices off just like we did
previously with the tuple course as you
can see I just did right there and all
this codes on my website new thing thank
talked on by the way if you want that
you
you can also print screen' you could
also do this with tuples the last value
by referencing the last index and there
it is so that's how you would access the
last value and let's say I go in here
and actually create number square
brackets one okay so I just created a
list that's numbers one through and and
let's say I want to print the last three
digits how would I do that this is
something you just really have to start
to memorize kinda and the best way to do
that is to code so if I want to print to
screen the last three values in here I
would start it off with negative three
what's doing is is actually going
opposite direction and it will print to
screen those last three digits see eight
nine ten and of course if you wanted to
print to screen the first three digits
you put the colon followed by the three
and it prints out the first three digits
that are available and let's say also
that you would like to start printing to
screen starting with the second index in
this list up to the very last index in
this list and skip every other number
how would you do that real simple one
start at index 1 through index 10 and
then put in how many indexes you want to
skip each and you can see it prints out
all of the even numbers for you if you
want to see how long a list is print le
n function list num see 10 indexes and
if you wanted to see the minimum value
stored use the min function one and if
you want to see the maximum value stored
use the max function these are just a
whole bunch of little random sort of
things you can do inside of Python with
lists I'm going to go in here and start
playing around with strings so so you
know here this is how you would turn a
string into a list use the list function
just like we did with the tuple function
and let's say I want to take Fred bring
him in here see it broke Fred's each
individual letter and put them on in
their own individual boxes now let's say
I want to go in here and actually add
the two characters to you wide at the
end of that how would I do that I would
define this name put a bracket and say
from the index 4 onwards I want
you add this string to that list and you
see it automatically put dy at the end
of that list if I then wanted to join
these guys and print it out Freddie
as a string what I would do is I'm just
going to put two blank quotes in here
and I'm going to use what's called the
join function a stick list name inside
of there you can see it prints it out as
a string instead of printing it out as a
list you just saw how I added two
additional indexes to the list there's
also other multiple different ways you
can play around with these guys here I'm
going to create another list one two
three four and let's say I wanted to
replace the value in index one with a
five index one is this too
how do I do that it's real simple and as
you proceed through this tutorial you're
going to start to really understand it
because I'm going to give you a ton and
tons and tons of examples see when I
never replace the two and you could also
just delete the whole entire thing so
let's say I wanted to delete the value
in index I'm just going to jump up here
type in de el and I want to lead to that
guy right to here if I print it out the
screen you can see that it went in there
and deleted the value that was in the
second index spot so there's just a
couple more things now I'm going to show
you a bunch of different methods or
functions you can use like let's say you
wanted to add the word joy or the name
joy to the end of this list how would
you do that well you would just type in
list example append and you can see that
it appended that on there and if you
wanted to remove that value you just put
inside of there use the remove function
and you can remove things by stating
exactly what you want to remove could
say I added it and then I took it out or
you could come in here and remove it
based off of the index position and you
can see that it knocked off PA also
remember index 0 1 2 3 so here it
knocked off the the value that was
stored in index 3 with this remove
command so those are two different ways
to remove things from lists and let's
say you wanted to jump in here
and add a value into the list in the
second index spot it will automatically
make room for you so let's say I want to
put PA in the second spot and remember 0
1 2 put it in there and automatically
move Pittsburgh over I didn't delete it
and let's create a new list and let's
just throw in a bunch of random letters
so it's just a bunch of letters in no
discernable order now I'm going to show
you how to sort these in alphabetical
order real easily
just like that if we print that to
screen you can see that it puts them all
in alphabetical order for you just by
tacking that on just by running that
function it automatically jumps in there
and fixes that up for you another neat
thing you can do with lists and this
will be the last example is let's say I
wanted to create a multi-dimensional
list meaning it's going to have multiple
different values stored it would be
probably easier to understand just by
looking at it here a B see I can place
values inside of a list just like you
have here so maybe it looks a little bit
complicated I could have like for
example my name my neighbor's name
wife's name ages and all these other
different things and of course don't
forget to put the commas here
and as you can see what I did was I said
I want to remove the letter or print the
letter to the screen that lies in the
second index so this would be 0 1 2 and
inside of that area I want the first
index inside of this index little box
and that's the reason why it printed up
H so that's my explanation and a ton of
examples on how to use tuples and lists
inside of Python if you have any
questions or comments leave them below
in the next tutorial which will be
coming out today I will go over strings
and dictionaries till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
