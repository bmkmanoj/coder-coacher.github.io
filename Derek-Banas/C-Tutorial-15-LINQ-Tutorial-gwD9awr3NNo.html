of my c-sharp video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial we're going to
focus in completely on Linc
now I have covered Linc methods in the
past but this time I'm going to cover
Linc quarries and more specifically I'm
going to cover from where order by
select enumerables inner joins as well
as group joins now those are pretty vast
topics and I'm going to just provide a
whole bunch of examples of how to use
them and like always all the code as
well as a transcript of this video is
available in the description underneath
this video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so I went in did
a little bit ahead of time I created an
animal class there's your beloved animal
class everybody likes and it just has a
name weight height and animal ID
property inside of it and you could
pause the screen or like I said get the
code below and then just copy and paste
it and here is a constructor for it and
here is the to string method and all it
is going to do is take the different
properties available in this animal
class and allow me to print them out
like a string okay so pretty simple
stuff didn't want to waste time on that
so I could focus on wink also I created
an owner class and it just has a string
name property and an owner ID property
so that is all that I created ahead of
time and now I'm going to jump over into
program and just start writing the lock
code okay so here I am there's the top
of the code right there and here is the
main function now what I am going to do
is I am going to create a function I
mess around with arrays I'm going to
query arrays collections a whole bunch
of different things so I'm going to
create a string array or I'm going to
query a string array here and then I'm
going to have the main function up here
call it to execute it so we'll go query
string all right right like that alright
so now we're down inside here so we're
going to need some data that we're going
to be messing around with and there it
is it's a string array that contains a
whole bunch of different dog names and
we're going to perform some queries on
it to manipulate to this information
once again I make videos that are meant
for pausing so pause your screen typing
in or
the code copy and paste it alright so
what I want to do here with this query
is I want to get strings with spaces
inside of them and then put them in
alphabetical order so a pretty simple
way of messing around with this array so
we're going to create this a little
query and I'm just going to call this
dog spaces and from is a link command
and it is just designating where this
information is going to be coming from
so it's going to be coming from the dogs
array and the it's going to be stored
temporarily in a dog variable and then
where it's going to define conditions
that must be met to succeed to be able
to be put into my new collection that I
create here so what I'm going to say is
where a dog is going to contain a space
because I said that I wanted to only get
dog names that contain a space and get
rid of that dot right there all right
then we're going to use order by to
define what data is used and for in in
regards to how we're going to order the
data so I'm going to call this order by
I'm using dog of course and you can
either put ascending inside of here
right there so just to do something
different I'm going to say descending
and then finally select is going to
define the variable that is checked
against this condition and is going to
be dog of course all right and there is
a query we're going to do more and more
of these and you will completely
understand them basically link which
stands for language integrated query is
going to provide many tools for working
with data now link is similar to SQL but
it can work with data asides from
databases and just like SQL you're going
to manipulate this data using what are
called curry expressions ok so I got my
information here so what I want to do is
just cycle through it so I'm going to
say for each bar I in dog spaces I know
that the horrible name but it's just
what's coming into my head as I'm typing
this and then I'm going to use the CW a
little trick to print that out there
real quick and I'm going to print out
that information and
after this I'm just going to do a new
line alright so now we can run this and
see how that query works and you can see
right there it went in and only grabbed
dog names that have spaces inside of
them and then it put them in reverse
alphabetical order so let's go in here
and do another one so I'm going to
create a what I'm going to cycle through
this time is an integer array so I'm
going to create another method inside of
here I'm going to call this static it's
going to return an integer array and I'm
going to call it query int array it's a
pretty simple stuff just want to show
you how to perform queries on different
types of data and I'm going to come up
here and I'm going to call the or I'm
going to call for it to execute query
integer array right like that okay so
let's come back down inside of here and
let's play around with this guy so I
have to create an integer array and I'm
just going to call this num and I'm
going to throw some data inside of it so
I'll say some point 5 10 15 20 25 30 35
just with a coven alright so there's an
integer array that I'm going to be
pouring so let's say I want to get
numbers that are bigger than 20 so I'm
going to say let's call this GT 20 is
equal to and again I'm going to go from
where I'm getting the information from
like that and then with where I'm going
to define my conditions so where num is
greater than 20 and then I'm going to
say order by num and then I am going to
say that I want to select num that's
what's going to be stored okay that's
pretty simple and then we can just come
in here and we can cycle through all
this information just to show that it
indeed worked so in GT 20 and then let's
come in here and let's just print that
information out so pretty simple and
let's throw another break here at the
end of it alright and let's run it
whoops I have an error what's my error
oh it doesn't return a value I forgot to
do that nuts
I've also wanted to demonstrate how to
return a value so you know what I'm
going to do I'm going to come in here
and do a couple more different things so
let's say that I so let's say I also
want to come in here and find out what
the data type is
this guy I can do that let's come in
here and let's say get pipe and go Gigi
20 and of course we would go get type
all right so some additional information
and don't forget to put those little
parentheses inside of there let's get
rid of this extra thing right there all
right so that will get me the datatype
for this and why don't I also show you
how to convert it into a list we can go
VAR and list greater than 20 is equal to
GT 20 to list and this guy is going to
be an integer list and that's how we can
do that
and also let's come in and GT 20 and
convert this into an array so we can go
GT 20 and to array and that's probably
important to cover because you very
often we're going to want to do things
like convert them into lists and convert
them into arrays one thing is kind of
interesting is if you would see up here
we called for this to print out what I'm
going to do up here is come in here and
change the data so we issued the query
above that the neat thing is after you
change the data the query is going to
update and you're going to see what that
looks like so even though the
information you don't have to issue the
query over and over again it's going to
be something that automatically updates
so let's come in here and let's do
another for each for I in GT 20 just
little crazy things come into my head
hey why don't I cover this also all
right so we got that and we can output
this and then let's go and do another
break and then finally let's return the
the integer array that we promised we
would return so I'm going to go array TT
20 and return it all right so no errors
and let's run it see how that works out
you can see right here that this comes
back as an ordered enumerable see there
we print the dog names here we got 25 30
35 and you can see here also that we
went and updated one of the values
inside of our array and we didn't have
to issue the query again to have
information updated so pretty cool stuff
so what I want to do now is work with
array lists so I want to create an array
list so I'm going to call this guy
static void once again query array list
seems to be a logical name forming here
throw that in there and we're going to
have to create our array list again just
to save a little bit of time I'm going
to create an array list I'm going to
call it famous animals ArrayList and I'm
going to throw in some animals and then
I have the height and the weight of
course and I'm not going to mess around
with ID right now you see Heidi and
Shrek and how big Shrek is and the
weight and then Congo and once again 3.8
and the weight is 90 all right so got
all that information in there so now
we're going to mess around with it and
query it now one thing that's important
is you're going to have to convert the
ArrayList
into an enumerable and to do so I'm
going to come in and I'm going to go
famous animal enumerable and to do that
we go animals famous animals and I'm
going to say of type and state that they
are the animal type and then I'm going
to issue my query on them so I'm going
to go I'm just going to SM animals is
meaning small animals as what I'm doing
here and what I want to do is I want to
look for animals that have a weight that
is less than or equal to 90 so once
again animal what I'm going to be
pulling this information from the famous
animal innumerable and once again I'm
going to say where animal weights is
less than or equal to nine and you could
put additional conditions inside of here
with ands or or whatever you want but
I'm just going to keep it simple die
right now once again I'm going to say
order by here I'll say animal name and
then finally select animal now that I
have all that set up we can cycle
through here I'll go animal in small
animals and then I can well let's go and
print this out go like that and then we
can go get the animals name out of there
and we could say ways
and get the wait for our animal and that
will be pounds just to keep that a
little bit simple and then to get the
specific information I'll just go animal
name and then animal and wait alright
and did I call for this to execute
inside of my main function don't know if
I did or not
let's like go up here and doesn't look
like it alright so I got that in there
don't see any error so let's run it and
see how it works and there you can see
we only got animals that are 90 pounds
or equal to 90 pounds or less I guess
it's a say and it went and printed out
the name as well as the animals weight
it's a pretty useful stuff here and now
what I want to do is show you how to
work with a collection so let's come in
here get rid of that and for this guy
let's throw another break inside of
there and let's create a brand new
method inside your static function all
right so we'll go static void and this
time a moment to be pouring a collection
just to show you another thing that you
can query and I went and throw a
collection inside of there just to save
some time you can pause your screen type
that out if you'd like to and then I'm
going to move on okay so now what I'm
going to do is look for big dogs that
have a weight that is greater than 70
and have a height that is greater than
25 all right so we're going to go big
dogs is equal to once again just going
to define where the information is
coming from it is coming from my animal
list that I just imported there and I'm
going to then define my conditions so
I'm going to say that I want dog that's
weight is greater than 70 and like I
said you can put and inside of there
whatever you want and I'm going to say
dogs height is greater than 25 all right
so now what I'm going to do is go order
by and I'm gonna order by the dog's name
and then once again we can just go in
here and go select dog you're going to
see other ways of using select here in a
little bit so pretty cool stuff and we
can output all that of course so we can
go dog
the big dogs and then let's output that
information so we can say a and throw
that there this is going to be a dog
breed ways and put that there pounds and
let's just keep it at that and then
we're going to output you know get the
actual information so we'll go dog name
whoops dog name like that and dog and
weight and let's throw a new line in
there after that just to keep everybody
happy and let's go and run it and now
you're going to say it went in there
whoops did something wrong oh I know it
it did I'd forgot to call this function
from up side main all right so let's
just grab this guy right here
zoom right up to the top and let's go
and call that function to execute now
let's run it and you could say that the
st. Bernard is the only one that comes
back as qualifying for our conditions
and it prints out a st. Bernard weighs
200 pounds okay so pretty cool stuff
okay so now what I want to do is I want
to show you how you can come in here and
do some more things with select like I
promised you could do as well as how to
do an inner join and a group join which
is very very useful so we'll go like
this and we'll say query animal data is
the name of this and let's just go and
call laughs don't worry about it all
right so I'm going to throw in some
information here okay so I went and
created an animal array called animals
equals new and I went and created
individual animals inside of it so I've
German Shepherd height weights and
animal ID animal ID is going to be used
to perform my different joins so that I
can join this information that I have
right here on the screen with the
information that I have down here which
is going to be owners so you can see
there's the matching IDs and how they
are going to match up with the different
animals that we have up here all right
so let's go and another thing that be
kind of cool is you can actually go and
remove just let's say we want to just
remove the name
the height and how you can do that is
with select so we can come in here and
do something like name height is equal
to and we can go from a in animals and
then after that just go select new and
we're going to create a brand new guy
inside of here and it's going to be made
up with the name as well as the height
so there we are we just created that
guys and that's just something kind of
interesting you can do is select all
right so you're just pulling those two
things out and making a brand new
collection
you could then come in here and convert
this to an animal rack and how you would
do that is go array name and height is
equal to and go name height like that
and then go to array so that's going to
convert it into an object array like I
said before and we can also then come in
here and output this information so
we'll go for each or I in and this is
going to be array name height and then
we can call for this information to
print out on the screen so we could just
go I and let's just keep it simple and
just go eye to string so there that is
and let's throw in a break there as well
and if we run that you're going to see
whoops did I do something wrong oh I
know what I did I forgot to call this
function again all right so let's come
up here and let's get Cory animal data
zoom way up to here to this guy and
right there throw that inside of there
and that like that and let's run it and
now you can see that it returns only the
name as well as only light all right
so neat stuff let's do some more now
what I want to do is create what is
called and inner join and what this is
going to do is join info and the owners
and animals using equal values that
exist in the IDS and what I want to do
specifically is store values for the
animal and the owner specifically so I'm
just going to call this inner join
and then we'll issue our core
a so I'm going to say from animal in and
um moles and then I'm going to join and
I'm going to join owner in owners that
is this guy up here this is what I'm
going to be messing with these owners
array up here and of course this animals
array right there so those are the two
guys I'm going to be playing with so I'm
going to say joint owner in owners on
animal and then specifically animal ID
jump down to the next line that's
perfectly fine equals owner owner ID so
these are going to be joined based off
of equality between the IDS of the
animals as well as the owners and then
do something fancy with select I'm going
to go select anew and I'm going to say
owner name is equal to owner name
obviously and let's jump down to the
next line and then say animal name is
equal to animal name alright so there we
got a fancier type of query that we just
issued now what we're going to be able
to do is cycle through this information
so I'm going to say var I and n inner
join and then let's output the
information so we will say go like this
and owns and then the animals name after
it like that and then to output that
information we'll just go
i dot owner name and i dot animal name
and those come from these guys see these
were variables that were created inside
of here that with we are then going to
be able to access all right
and we're going to be able to access
them by referencing the inner join that
is where that information is going to be
created and then throw in a break and
then let's run that again
and here you can see comes back doug
parks owns german shepherd Sally Smith
owns to Iowa da-da-da-da-da-da I guess I
should say owns a but whatever you get
the point of it so now let's do
something even cooler we're going to do
a group joint and what a group join is
going to do in this situation is get all
the animals and put them
in a newly created owner group if their
IDs match the owners and what we're
going to do is print out the owner's
name followed by the specific animals
that that owner owns so I'm going to go
VAR group join is what I'm going to call
this is equal to and I have to define
where the information is coming from so
I'm going to say owner in owners which
is the owners array and then I'm going
to say I want to order by owner thought
owner ID so these are going to be
ordered by the owners ID then we're
going to do a join or define how this
information will be joined so I'm going
to say join animal in animals which is
the animals array and we can down in the
next one on owner dot owner ID and then
go down to the next slide the situation
in which they are equal to the animal
the animal ID and then I'm going to say
that I want them to go into a new one
that is going to be called owner group
after that I'm going to go select new
and then inside of here I'm going to
define what I want to deal with so I'm
going to go owner is going to have get
the value for owner name and then
animals and you can throw another query
inside of here we can go from owner to
this is just at the owner to is just a
temporary holding cell
just like animal is an owner is up there
okay so that's going to hold the value
in we can get out of next one in owner
group this brand new group that we just
created right here that's what I'm
referencing order by owner to name the
bounced way over there
whatever that's what happens whenever
you're messing around I have my font
size extremely big so that's the reason
why that happened and then I'm going to
say select owner to at the end of that
come down here and throw a semicolon in
there all right so that's probably about
one of the more complicated queries
you're ever going to see all right but
what it does is going to be really
really cool so what I want to do
is I'm going to go total animals and
then I'm going to quarry through all
this information so I'm going to say for
each bar owner group this brand new
group is what I'm going to be working
with group going is where I'm getting
this information from and then I can
output this information so I'm going to
say owner group owner and that's going
to give me the owner's name and then I'm
going to cycle through the owner group
animal list and print out each animal
underneath of each owners names so megha
animal in owner group animals let's go
do another one inside of here and I can
cycle or I can increment the values for
total animals if I'd like and then I'm
going to come in here and output some
information so let's say I want to do
like a bullet point and do a bullet
point like that like this and close that
off and then underneath of it go animal
and get the animal name all right use of
unsigned local variable total animals
what I do you know what I don't even
think I need this I was trying to do
something fancy but I don't even need it
so let's just get rid of it all right so
let's save that and let's run it and
there you can see it went and printed
the owner's name and followed by the
specific animals that that owner owns
alright so there's some pretty cool
stuff you can do with a link like I say
always go in there experiment play
around with your own data and just try
things out break things learn things do
things that's how you learn so like
always please leave your questions and
comments below the last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
