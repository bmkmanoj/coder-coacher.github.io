2 of my tutorial on how to make video
games in this part of the tutorial I'm
going to continue making pong and we're
going to learn about sound managers and
how to make our balls bounce and how to
create an AI paddle and a whole bunch of
other different things and just to make
this very clear this whole entire
tutorial isn't just going to be about
pong up next amount going to probably
make space invaders and I'm going to
pac-man Tetris whole bunch of 2d games
and then after I do the 2d games then
I'm gonna start making 3d games so this
tutorial series is going to be about a
whole bunch of different games and in
the comments you can leave your a
request for games that you'd like me to
make that would be really awesome
and after the last tutorial I know that
I said that the Mac OS version is nearly
the same as the Windows version and you
guys said well prove it so in this
tutorial I'm actually learning to
continue it using the using Windows
version of unity and also I got some
questions about GIMP
so I'm going to go and talk about that
also so this tutorial is going to cover
a whole bunch of different things and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so the very first thing is GIMP you
guys want to know how to create stuff in
GIMP so I will show you and from now on
instead of Photoshop I'm gonna use gift
so if you want to create let's just say
we want to create our ball we're going
to go file new and I'm going to change
this into one pixel by one pixel that's
what our ball is I'm going to click on
OK and then I'm going to zoom out of
this and I can click on the little
magnifying glass up here and you're
going to be like what is that one pixel
it's impossible to say well it's going
to be right here in the middle of your
screen so there you go and you can do
other things here to make it working
with pixels and pixel art a little bit
easier but there you can see there's
your one gigantic pixel and because
we're using white here what I want to do
is come over here and just click on this
little guy just to verify that the
foreground color is going to be black
and the background color is going to be
white and I can do a select all on this
guy
whoops hit the wrong button I can do
select all on this guy
everything's selected and then I can go
in here and go edit and oops and I'm
going to use background color which is
white ok so that is now a one pixel of
white one pixel alright so if I want to
then save it I go file export as and
then I'm going to go select file type by
extension click on that
I'm using pinging files here I'm going
to go ping image like that and this is
going to be a ball it's going to be
called ball so I'm going to come up here
and go ball like that and export and
it's going to love love the blob replace
it and this is going to pop up and I'm
just going to go export alright so there
you go that is how we are going to be
able to create our images using GIMP
instead of Photoshop and now I'm going
to jump over into unity and keep writing
our code alright so here we are using
the windows version of unity it looks
exactly the same and if you want the
layout that I'm using come over here
click on a layout and it's 2x3 alright
like that I'm not going to click
anything because it's going to mess up
everything on this screen but it's going
to give you the exact same layout that I
have I had some questions about that so
the very first thing I want to do here
is I actually want to well I want to go
and get my paddle my right paddle so I'm
going to select right paddle and I want
to set it up properly using a rigidbody
so I'm going to go add components that's
going to allow me to move it so I'm
going to go rigidbody like that
and I want the gravity on this guy to be
zero so I'm going to set that to zero of
course I want to freeze the rotation I
don't want it to rotate in any way and
so I'm going to check that I'm going to
set my collision detection to continuous
and because this is going to actually be
an AI controlled paddle I am going going
to definitely want this to be smoothed
out so I'm going to have that set to
interpolate all right so I have that all
set up that paddle is working and now I
want to set up my sound manager now my
sound managers are going to contain all
of my special effects so it's going to
play a different sound whenever a ball
hits a wall or a goal or another paddle
or what have you and to set this up I'm
going to in my hierarchy I'm going to go
create and create empty and I'm going to
name it sound manager so just select
game object and call it sound manager
good enough then I can select that guy
and then come over here and click on add
component and audio and audio source
then I want to come down here and go add
and then scroll way down to the very
bottom to where it says new script and
then I'm going to call this Sound
Manager and that's going to be set for
c-sharp of course and go create an ad
all right so that's all set up now the
only difference really between unity on
Windows and on Mac OS is going to be
that on Windows we're going to use
Visual Studio while on Mac OS we're
going to use mono development alright so
we have that setup and I can come in
here and click on this little gear over
here and go edit script and that's going
to open up visual studio and you're
going to need Visual Studio community
I'm sure you can go download that it is
free so just go on Google or whatever
and type in Visual Studio community 2017
that's what I'm using and install it so
I'm just going to say yeah reload
whatever and then I'm going to set over
everything in my Sound Manager so what
do I need to do here well I'm going to
need to store all of my different sound
effects in here and also I'm only going
to ever have one sound manager so one or
I we want to protect myself so that I
only have one sound manager and don't
accidentally create another one so I'm
going to go public static and sound
manager yes the class name is the same
as what we have here and this is called
a singleton and I'm going to call this
instance and I'm going to give it a
value of null and I'm going to create my
sound managers and I'm also going to set
up names for all of my sound effects so
that I can drag the sounds over directly
in the inspector so that they work so
I'm going to go public audio clip and go
bloop
that's what I called the file so I'm
just going to keep that exactly the same
as what I use before a little bit weird
but what have you and then I'm going to
have lost buzz which I don't even know
if I'm going to use but have it in there
anyway I want to have hits paddle bloop
and this is where I'm getting these
names from by the way sounds and there's
all the different noises we have wind
sounds and then our final one is going
to be wall bloop and we'll set up our
background music later on then I want to
be a
refer to the audio source that I added
to the sound manager so that I will be
able to place out these different
effects so I'm going to audio source and
I'm just going to call this sound
effects audio and then in start this is
going to be where I initialize this guy
and I want to set it up so that I can
only ever have one of these so I'm going
to go instance which is a reference to
this guy right here somebody go instance
if it's equal to null then I'm going to
say that instance is equal to this guy
all right
else if instance is not equal to this
specific sound manager then I want to
destroy if they figured out some way to
create another sound manager I want to
destroy it so to do that I go destroy
gain object and there we go
so now what I need to do is I need to
get all of these sound effects that they
have a sound assigned to the sound sound
manager and store them so that I will be
able to reference them so I'm going to
go audio source and this isn't a rat
just a box it's going to hold about a
whole bunch of different sound effects
and I need to go and get my audio source
so that I'll be able to get all these
guys so I go get component audio source
and if you wondering what I'm talking
about it's this guy right here
so if I go sound manager audio source so
that's what I just got a reference to
and this is get components not get
component sorry about that
and then I just need to cycle through
all of the different special effects
sources that I have or sounds and set
those all up inside of this new array
that I just created here so I'm going to
go for each audio source you're going to
see here in a second where I set up all
the audio sources and I'm going to call
each one source in sources and I'm going
to go if source clip is equal to null
well then I want to go sound effect
audio and assign the source to it and
then I want to add a function that I
don't need update at all so let's just
get rid of it
I want to add a function to my sound
manager that's going to allow any other
game object to call the sound manager
and play a specific sound so to do that
let me go public make it public
obviously so that anybody can access it
void it's not going to return anything
and play one shot and it's going to
receive an audio clip to play and it's
going to play it for me
so I'm going to go to cliff and then I
can go sound effects audio play one shot
and whatever the name of the clip is
you're going to see how this all works
as the tutorial continues okay so we
have all that set up and of course all
this code is available in the
description ok so we want to save our
Sound Manager and then jump back over
into unity and whenever we jump back
over into unity you can see that there's
little boxes here for us to drag all of
our sounds into so we are going to do
that here are our sounds and we're just
going to drag them in there so we got my
gold bloop
I'm gonna grab that drag it in there
lost buzz drag it down inside of there
hit paddle bloop whereas that out there
it is hit paddle bloop wind sounds and
wall bloop ok so there we go we have all
our sounds all set up inside of there
and now that have all that setup I'm
going to go and create my ball and write
all of the code needed to make the ball
work properly so once again open up the
sprites and I'm going to grab a ball and
I'm going to throw it right here in the
middle of the screen I'm going to add a
box Collider to it because I'm going to
let some of the collisions be handled by
just our box Collider here and other
collisions I'm actually going to handle
in the code so just box Collider and
that's going to do a lot of work for us
which is going to be great now to make
our ball actually bounce like a ball and
interact like a ball unity actually has
something that's called a physic
material physics of materials that is
built into it and we'll be able to
assign that to the ball and then it will
handle a lot of the bouncing for us and
to use it we're going to go into our
project I'm going to go create and
physics material 2d and I'm going to
call this ball material and then I'm
going to select my ball and then get
ball material and drag it
right here in the collider section so
that will all be set up then I could
select my ball material I do not want
friction to affect the movements in my
ball minutes so I'm going to set that to
zero and then I'm going to set
bounciness to one and then we're going
to play around with bounciness and see
if one works out I think that it will
now of course if we want our ball to be
able to move we are going to have to
have a rigidbody a sign for the physics
so I'm going to go physics 2d and
rigidbody that's set up I do not want my
ball to in any way affect my paddles so
I'm going to set the mass to that to be
very very small I do not want gravity to
affect my ball in any way so I'm going
to change that to zero I do not want the
ball to rotate so I'm going to set to
that guy I'm going to constantly check
for collisions and I also want the
movement to be smoothed out now that
have all that set up what I need to do
is create a script that's going to
handle what happens whenever my ball
bounces off of different things and
another thing I want to do is I want to
click on assets and grab my Sound
Manager and grab that and move that into
my scripts folder so that I have
everything nicely organized don't want
things all over the place so let's go
into scripts once again I'm going to
click on this I'm going to go create
c-sharp script and this one's going to
be called ball after I have that set up
double click on it and edit it in visual
studio and it's going to say do I want
to reload and I say yes reload and there
is ball dot CS so what am I going to
need for my ball to properly work well
I'm going to have to monitor the speed
and I'm probably going to have to mess
around with the speed so that I get
everything working well so I'm going to
have that be equal to 30 just start off
and I'm gonna make it public of course
I'm going to need to reference the
rigidbody so that I will be able to mess
around with that and call this rigid
body I'm going to need access to the
audio source so I can play different
sound effects depending upon what the
ball is going to be bouncing off of so
I'm going to go audio source and just
call it audio source that works fine and
that's basically it
so then I'm going to go into the start
function and to initialize my ball I
want to get a reference to my rigidbody
and
to get any component you always use
getcomponent like that and then you give
whatever the name of the component is
and then I want to have my ball as soon
as it comes on to the screen I want to
have it start moving and I want it to
start moving towards the ai-controlled
ball
so our ai-controlled paddle so I'm going
to come in and go rigidbody velocity
oops make sure that this is uppercase
rigid body and rigid body that's this
guy's what I'm referencing so I'm going
to go velocity and whenever we want to
move things inside of unity we're going
to use vectors which is an XY position
you want to move towards and one of the
things that's built-in is if you want to
move directly to the right with no
nothing in regards to the y axis you can
just go vector two and right and we're
going to multiply that time speed that's
going to define the direction as well as
the speed that we're going to be moving
all right so then we have update well
update with in reference to the ball
actually doesn't make any sense because
we want our balls to actually be
controlled based off of what they
collide off of so if we want to
automatically call a function any time
our ball is colliding with anything
we're going to call on or we're going to
create a function called on collision
and this is going to be called
automatically every time the ball
collides with anything and it's going to
be passed a reference to whatever was
collided with so I'm going to go
collision to D so that's what we
collided with and then we need to think
about okay so what are we going to do
well what we need to do is we need to
check what we collided with with our
ball so I'm going to first check if we
collided with left paddle or right
paddle and do certain things depending
upon that and then I'm going to check if
maybe we collided with wall bottom or
wall top and if you're wondering what
those are that's these guys right here
and you're going to be referencing them
or asking about them based off of using
these names right here that are inside
of the hierarchy and for the most part
we're just going to let our our Collider
component that's attached to the ball
just do all the
stuff but whatever and actually I forgot
in bouncing around here what is is
called left going right goal
and then we're going to check if left
goal or right goal if our ball hit a
left goal or the right goal okay so we
have that all set up so let's go in here
and do some stuff so I want to check if
it collided with either of those and to
do so I can just come in and so let's
move this up why that ball is me okay
so let's check if we collided with left
paddle or the right paddle so I to do
that I need to say hey thing I collided
with what is your name and to get that I
guess go whatever that is that whatever
that object is game object followed by
name and I'm going to check if it's
equal to left paddle or not or in a
situation that's what did you do you
silly thing
that or if the name of the game object
was right paddle just throw that in
there and then change this to right I'm
going to do pretty much the same thing
if it clicked on either of those or if
the ball hit either one it is I'm also
going to do basically I'm going to check
if we hit wall Baltimore wall top in the
same way all I need to do is go wall
bottom and wall talk and I'm going to do
the same thing for left alright goal so
just change this to lift goal and then
change this to write goal all right so
we have all this set up so now we need
to come in here and do some calculations
if we hit the left powder or the right
paddle
now I don't want my paddle and my ball
to always go directly to the right or
directly to the left whenever the ball
hits either to those paddles because
that is boring so what I want to do
instead is I want to set it up so that
if it hits near the top of the paddle
above the center line of our paddle I
want my ball to go upwards in the
y-direction in an angle and it's going
to become a more severe angle depending
upon how high on the paddle it hit if
it's below the midpoint of the paddle
meaning the ball is going to go
downwards so I'm going to do some
different calculations here just to
figure out how to do that and that's a
little bit complicated so I'm going to
create and now
our functions going to handle this so
I'm going to go handle paddle hits I'm
going to pass whatever the ball collided
with to that function and I need to
create that function of course so I'm
going to go handle paddle hits and come
down here outside of that function and
create another one so this isn't going
to return anything so this is going to
be void and then the name of it and it's
of course going to be getting the thing
that it collided with so collision to D
give it same name doesn't matter and
then like I said I want to verify if it
hits the top of the paddle the middle of
the paddle or the bottom of the paddle
and that's going to determine my Y in my
vector for where I'm going to be moving
so I'm going to create another function
and this one's going to be called whoops
that this one is going to be called ball
hits paddle where and to this we are
going to pass anytime you say transform
and position the this is assuming that
you're using whatever the name of your
class is so it's it's what this is
assuming is you want the balls position
to be passed over and that's what we do
want and then if you want something else
you need to reference that object so if
I want to find out what the the position
on the screen or in the scene for
whatever the ball collided with I have
to go and reference that objects name
which is the thing that I collided with
transform and then position once again
after you do this a bunch of times this
stuff will start to stick in your head
and I also want to get the paddle
because the only thing in this situation
that our ball is in a head is the paddle
so I want to get the height for my
paddle so I know if I hit the top of the
paddle the bottom of the paddle and all
that other stuff and to do that you go
sighs why and if you wanted the width to
the paddle you use size X okay just for
future information so there we are we
have all that set up so now we got to
create ball hit paddle where and of
course that's going to return a float so
come down
here and go float like this and this is
going to receive vector position on the
screen for our ball and it's also going
to receive vector position for our
paddle and it's also going to receive a
float which is going to represent our
paddle heights and that is all we're
going to need to return where the ball
hit the paddle so I'm just going to come
in here and just go return and where you
go and get the balls Y position and
subtract the paddles Y position and then
divide by our paddle height and there it
is and that is going to give us our
exactly what we need which is going to
be our Y direction all right so we have
that all set up you next up we need to
figure out or calculate the direction of
our ball and that's going to require a
vector once again so I'm going to call
this direction is equal to and this is
new vector2 like that and one thing that
is important to understand about vectors
is straight up is going to be 0 1 Wow
straight down is going to be 0 negative
1 all right so what we're going to want
to do is work within a higher a high
value of 1 and a lowest value of
negative 1 and everything in between
there so what we're going to come in
here and check for is the thing that we
collided with was it equal to the left
paddle and if it is then we're going to
change the X direction of for our ball
so we're going to go direction is going
to be equal to new vector2
and that's going to be the X Direction
is going to be 1 because it hits the
left paddle we're going to move to the
right and to the right is 1 and then
we're going to pass in the y-direction
otherwise we're going if it's hit the
right paddle we're going to do the exact
opposite so we're just going to change
this to right paddle and this is going
to be negative 1 so the X Direction
change the Y Direction stays exactly the
same and the last thing we're going to
do here
as we are going to call our sound
manager and we are going to play a sound
effect so sound manager instance play
one shot and go sound into reference a
sound effect that is assigned to the
sound manager your sound manager
instance and here I want to play the
sound effect called hit paddle bloop and
there that is and that's how easy it is
to play sound effects that are assigned
to the sound manager and I'm actually
going to copy this because I'm going to
use this for bouncing off the other
stuff okay so if it hits the bottom or
the top wall what I want it to do is
just play a sound effect that's it I'm
going to let the collision components
and all that handle everything else but
the sound effect that I want to play for
this is going to be wall bloop so let's
just go in there and change that the
wall bloop
alright that's all we need to do for
that guy that's all setup and if it hits
a goal I am going to also play a
different sound effect which is going to
be gold bloop so let's just change this
the gold bloop there that is and then
later on I am going to also let's just
put a note here to do in the next part
of the tutorial I am going to come in
here and updates'
score UI so we'll just have that set and
then after it does all of that I am also
going to meaning it hits one of the
goals I'm going to transform or move the
position for the ball and I'm going to
go new and vector two and I'm just going
to make the ball show up in the middle
of the screen so I'm just going to put 0
and 0 inside of there like that and
that's all that I need to do for now for
our ball made a little bit error here I
have to also come in and calculate my
velocity now that I have everything set
up so I'm going to go rigidbody
on velocity is going to be equal to my
direction multiplied times my speed and
this is going to change the velocity
direction of the ball and of course
you're going to be assigning a vector to
velocity here and then the final thing
is I have like two little warnings down
I want to have both of these methods be
uppercase so I'm just going to come in
here and change this to ball hit tattle
where and then of course I'm going to
have to change this guy right here
because that changed and then I'm going
to change this guy right here and then I
am going to come up inside here and
change this one all right so there we go
now we have all those set up and you can
see that I don't have any errors down
here and now we can go test it out so
I'm going to go file and save all that's
all going to update and then jump back
over into unity and then select our ball
and then go and get our ball script and
drag it and drop it right inside of
there and that's automatically going to
work you can see speed here which you're
going to be able to play around with and
I can go in and test everything that I
have setup you can hear the sound
effects and you can see how everything
is bouncing around and the ball is
resetting in the middle of the screen
and a whole bunch of other different
things alright so there you go guys that
is how to setup the ball and in the next
part of the - and also to set up the
sound effects and so forth and so on and
then the next part of the tutorial I
hope to finish absolutely everything and
add in the AI components for the other
paddle as well as the user interface so
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
