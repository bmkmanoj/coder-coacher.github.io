presentation on income distribution in
America in this presentation you're
gonna find answers for almost any
question you could ever have in regards
to how much people make how they make
that money how their tax on that money
and how they spend that money all of the
information comes from one source the
IRS for individual corporate taxes and
income I use IRS gov forged slash tax
stats and for all the information I
provide on the top four hundred and
three billionaires used to conceal a
link here on the screen if you want to
look into that here's the income changes
in the United States from 1947 to 2007
could see here is a top 5% down here is
the bottom 25 the next 25 to 50 the next
50 to 75 and then the top 25 percent you
can see here in 1947 the average person
in the top 5 percent made right around
$60,000 and today the people in the top
5 percent made close to $200,000 or in
2007 I used 2007 2008 data because of
the accuracy it provides you can see
here further how income was distributed
from 1947 to 2007 this big number here
being the top 5 percent and then this
number right here being that same top 5
percent in 2007 and you can see how
income has been taken from the other
different brackets to make this number
increase basically the top 25 percent
have not changed so all of that
additional income has come from these
three sources you can see here further
how I broke all this information down
being the average income for the bottom
20% average income for the next 20 to
40% there's a link in the bottom of the
underbar if you want to take a look at
this presentation or of course you can
hit pause the next 40 to 60 percent from
1989 to 2007 and then again average
income for the next 60 to 80 percent the
top 10% changes and then that next 80 to
90% and you can see here the average
income of the top 1% from 89 to 2007 and
the changes from 1989 in 2007 for the
top 400 here I also provide all the
changes in regards to total combined net
income of all US corporations in 1992
you can see that they had a total income
of around 371 billion well in 2007 that
number was approaching 1.3 trillion
dollars so in this short period of time
you can see a dramatic increase in the
total income for US corporations I'm
gonna look at this much more deeply
later
further break all this down into real
numbers kid so you can see everything
here on the screen the bottom 20% had an
average income in 89 of 9600 and today
that numbers at 12,000 300 and then you
can see all the other different brackets
as I break them out here on the screen
and how they have changed quite
dramatically then here I provide more
accurate information regards to income
for corporations in 1992 versus 2007
further break this down from 1989 to
2007 these bars representing total
income and how that is lauded this pink
bar representing the top 10% and then
this little tiny insignificant bar down
here representing the bottom 20 you
could see how this compares by just
adding this up so this would be the
bottom 20 this would be the bottom 40 60
80 and so forth and so on and then this
is a as a combined group and this number
over here represents billions of dollars
you can see how that money has been
allocated to all the other different
groups here now looking at the top 5%
and then the 10 to 25% and you can see
just how dramatically by looking at this
information from multiple different
angles how these numbers have increased
dramatically then again we can look at
income distribution in 1980 versus 2008
using that same data as you can see the
top 5% of incomes have ballooned from 21
percent to 35 percent over this period
of time and you could see where loss in
income from these other brackets has
allowed this number to balloon so what
percentage of the top 5 percent of
income actually goes to the top 1%
that number has also gone up
dramatically you see here that in 1989
the percentage of the total income of
the top 1% in relation to the top 5
percent went from representing about 50
percent to representing about 61 percent
over here in 2007 and this is really
important because a lot of people don't
really ever focus on this this is the
total corporate income before deductions
in the United States and I'm gonna focus
really here on 2005 because this really
stands out in 2005 the combined total
income of all corporations in the United
States came very close to two trillion
dollars if you look in the next slide
watch this number drop remember two
trillion in here in 2005 you can see
that that number dropped to right around
310 billion dollars so it went from two
trillion before deductions to right
around 310 billion dollars after
deductions what a lot of people don't
know is that corporations only pay
income tax on a very small percentage
right around 25% of their total income
and you can see that demonstrated here
corporate income before compared to
corporate income after deductions in
1980 that number was right around 25%
that means they were only paying income
taxes on a right around 25 percent of
their total income and if we come over
here to 2005 you can see they were
playing very very close to 15% in their
most profitable of years and what a lot
of people don't know is corporations
spend their income and then they have to
pay taxes on what is left there after in
comparison to the total polar-opposite
for regular people
they first pay their taxes and then they
try to live off of what is left there
after that so that is the major
difference between corporate taxes
versus individual taxes in the United
States and here you can see exactly what
people spend money on this is the
average u.s. citizen and exactly what
they're spending their money on on a
percentage basis I find this could be
quite interesting what is really
interesting though is how these numbers
don't dramatically change as we look at
different income levels you can see here
for the bottom 20% what they spend money
on really you want to focus here on
insurance and pensions and investments
that's 2% for the bottom 20% that's why
they don't have any money to save and
then also look at the changes in housing
being this is 39% and how all these
other numbers change as we move forward
so this is the middle 20% can see they
spend 33 percent on average on housing
you can see their investments into
insurance as well as retirement accounts
has jumped up to 9% I find it quite
amusing that the food hasn't changed
that much so you went from 17 to 15% you
can just of course see a dramatic
drop-off and utilities this little
orange bar down here if we look at the
next one especially if you jump up to
the top 20% you can still see that
housing is still quite big but major
major difference is the total amount
that's set aside in retirement accounts
and insurance that is what is growing
and then of course things like utilities
and so forth are falling so what exactly
are the tax rates in the United States
well this is what everyone is supposed
to pay I could go through all this and
it would really bore you to tears so I'm
not going to again if you want to look
at this closely pause the movie but you
can see here this is what you would
really want to focus on people earning
over three hundred seventy three
thousand dollars per year we're supposed
to pay 35 percent that is very very
important as you're gonna see here in a
second now if we look at what people
actually
from 2001 to 2008 the top point one
percent who are all supposed to be
paying 35% instead in 2008 numbers are
paying right around 11% so they're
supposed to be paying 35 they're paying
11 and that number is dropped off
dramatically from 2001 whenever it was
13% you can see over this period of time
nobody's paying what they should be
paying we then look at the top 1% from
1980 to 2008 again everyone's supposed
to be paying 35 in federal taxes and
they were paying 35 in 1980 but you can
see that numbers dropped dramatically
down here to paying right around 22% we
then move on to the top 5% who all
should be paying 35 again 1980 they were
paying 27 and today they're paying were
around 20 then we look at the 5 to 10
percent that are supposed to be paying
on average around 30 they're paying
right around 12 the top 10 to 25 who
should be paying 30 are paying right
around 9 the top 25 to 50 percent are
paying right around 6 and a half then
you have the bottom 50% who are paying
right around 6 in 1980 and are now
paying right around 2 then you have
federal taxation on corporations well
remember they're only paying taxes on 25
percent of their total income even that
being you can see here there's the
magical 2005 they paid almost 15 and in
2008 they paid right over 22 percent on
25 percent of their income that's very
very important and then you see the tax
rate for the top billionaires in the
United States you in 1992 they were
paying right around 20 percent and now
they're paying right around 18 to 19
percent so let's look at tax revenue
that has been lost in just one year 2008
it was just picked because it was the
most recent and best information I had
available to me the amount not paid by
the top 50 percent was one point two
trillion remember this is the difference
between the tax rate that they pay that
and what they should have been paying
and we look at the total amount lost by
the bottom 50% you can see this number
is dramatically smaller and then we look
closer and corporate taxable income they
had a total income of 978 billion or
almost a trillion dollars if they were
taxed at 35 percent they should have
paid three hundred forty two billion
dollars but instead they paid two
hundred twenty eight billion dollars so
that comes out to a total loss for
corporations of 113 billion dollars so
you can see these numbers balloon this
is just in one year then what I'm going
to take a quick look here at state
taxes this is the average amount that
each individual in the state pays for
state taxes so in Hawaii they have the
highest state taxes per capita of
eighteen hundred thirty two dollars
remember these are all averages you can
see all the other numbers here and if
you live in Alaska Delaware Montana New
Hampshire Oregon you are paying nothing
and you can see who has the highest tax
rates in California Indiana Mississippi
New Jersey Rhode Island and the lowest
again Alaska Delaware Montana New
Hampshire and Oregon where you pay
nothing then we look at state local
taxes X school tax if I would have tried
to figure out school tax my head would
have exploded so I'm just providing you
with just your average local taxes in
these states you see who pays the
highest local taxes on the left side and
over here there are zero taxes again X
school taxes who has the highest amount
in gas taxes remember this is the amount
of tax that's tacked on per gallon see
California New York wine Connecticut
Illinois's have the highest rate and
then the lowest amount of taxes on
gasoline is listed on the right side
your screen then we look at corporate
state taxes Iowa has the highest in
Pennsylvania Minnesota Alaska and New
Jersey these are corporate taxes and
then if you moved in Nevada and North
Dakota Texas Washington or Wyoming you
pay nothing and these are also the
states that are setting up what are
called dynasty trusts that are used by
very wealthy people to try and escape
estate taxes altogether the reason why
state taxes were created was to help
eliminate the creation of elite groups
of very very wealthy people who held on
to large sums of money I have another
presentation on net worth if you want to
check that out I provide a link on the
screen what a lot of people don't
realize is ninety-nine point seven
percent of total estates are not subject
to estate taxes at all and this is based
off of research provided by the
Brookings Tax Policy Center and many of
the people that are against a state
taxes say that the reason they are
against estate taxes is that they do not
want to hurt small businesses and farms
what you can see here is a less than 1.3
percent of this number right here so 0.3
percent of Americans ever pay estate
taxes of this only 1.3 percent of that
tiny fraction is made up of small
businesses and farms very very very tiny
percentage of the total population the
United States and a lot of other people
that are against the state taxes say
that the reason
against them is because of double
taxation meaning that they believe that
individuals earn income and they are
taxed on that income throughout their
life and then they're again forced to
pay income on that income whenever they
die for the most part the reason why
capital gains are considered good is
that they are largely payments on
unrealized capital gains an increase in
the value of an asset is almost never
subject to income tax if the asset is
held until a person dies what they mean
by that is if somebody goes and buys a
stock say 40 years ago and that stock
continues to grow and overall worth
quadrupling in value as long as that
asset is not sold nobody is ever gonna
pay a tax on it and that is the reason
why the IRS says that we need estate
taxes is to have taxes paid on that
stock for example whenever this person
passes on in 2001 anyone who had a total
estate - all deductions and so forth Oh
less than six hundred seventy five
thousand dollars was exempt from estate
taxes altogether if you were over this
number you paid fifty five percent on
that total estate to the federal
government however from 2002 to 2010 the
estate tax fell from 55 percent in
regards to tax rate to forty five
percent and then to zero percent in 2010
the IRS is estimated through this
decrease in overall estate taxing they
have lost over seven hundred billion
dollars to over a trillion dollars just
over this 2002 to 2010 period and
currently we are set up so that anyone
who has estate less than five million
dollars is exempt and if you fall over
that number you're going to pay just
thirty five percent this is 2011 where
we are right now as I do this
presentation so if they lost 700 billion
to a trillion over eight years with
people paying fifty five to forty five
percent you can only imagine how much
money is gonna be lost based off of this
current estate tax system that we have
today now I get to the elite four
hundred and three billionaires in the
United States this is the acclaimed
Forbes 400 they have an total estimated
net worth of 1.7 trillion this number is
dramatically below what it actually is
because it does not count trusts or any
money that has been provided to
nonprofit corporations and and numerous
other different ways of moving networks
around these four hundred or four
hundred three actually have
total income in 2008 of 109 billion
dollars just 400 people this equates to
an average income for this top 400 of
274 million dollars just in one year 400
people earned 274 million dollars on
average and as you can see here these
billionaires are also very good in
regards to using tax deductions to
escape paying taxes on their income
right here you can see in 1992 they paid
taxes on only 66% of their total income
that number shot up to right around a
little over 71% that means they're if
they get a hundred percent of their
income in they're only paying taxes on
72% of it and as you can see here that
number has continued to fall in 2003
being right around 68% and then it has
risen slightly to 2008 where they're
paying just slightly over 68% so that is
the percentage of income that they
actually pay taxes on for the top four
hundred three billionaires then we can
look closely here at exactly where their
income comes from here this big giant
pie slice right here represents capital
gains capital gains are taxed at 15% and
historically they have been taxed near
their being in 1942 where they were
taxed to 25 percent 78 28% 80 120 and in
today where we are which is 15 a lot of
people think that this used to be taxed
as ordinary income though that is not
true then you could see wages
represented 36 percent in 1992 that has
dropped the whole way down to 13 percent
because the wealthiest have decided to
escape paying taxes they would rather
this money be paid to them through
capital gains and dividends which allows
them to escape paying taxes as you can
see here in 2003 the dividend rate which
used to be counted as ordinary income
dropped down to 15% so that means the
wealthiest people in the nation are able
to pay only 15% even though he should
pay 35% they're only paying 15% on 79%
of their total income that's the reason
why the total tax rate that they are
paying is as low as it is and I provide
here a chart that represents the total
taxes lost whenever they lower the tax
rate on dividends from ordinary income
which would have been 35% but the whole
way down to 15% you can see that this
total number and
revenue lost because of that tax changed
that one little change from 2003 to 2008
has equaled out to a total loss in tax
revenue for the federal government of 65
billion dollars and then I broke
everything down here further in 1992 the
average income of households for the
bottom 80% of United States citizens is
thirty three thousand six hundred and
then that number jumped up in 2008 to
forty one thousand one hundred
twenty-five dollars if you compare that
to the average income of the top four
hundred and three billionaires in United
States they earned on average 1817 times
as much in 1992 as the average bottom
eighty percent of the United States
households that number has jumped in
2008 to represent six thousand six
hundred and seventy times the average
income for the bottom eighty percent of
households in the United States and I
have a whole entire presentation on
Social Security and Medicare but I keep
getting asked this question so I thought
I'd cover it one more time this is the
amount that the average United States
citizen receives on Social Security
whenever they retire one thousand
seventy seven dollars and 20 cents per
month or six dollars and 73 cents per
hour and then on how that money is spent
by those senior citizens on a monthly
basis good any other questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
