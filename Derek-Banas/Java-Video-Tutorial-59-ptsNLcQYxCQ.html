59 of my java video tutorial series
today we're going to continue making our
videogame here while explaining
object-oriented programming design
principles and just to get something out
of the way yes I am going to cover Java
design patterns I kind of am doing it
right now in describing opie design
principles and yes I'm covering MVC and
yes I'm going to do Java networking I'm
going to show you how to draw images
instead of just polygons I will cover
sound and yes indeed I will get into C
and C++ because if you want to do
anything heavily graphic oriented you
have to use C and C++ okay now onto the
tutorial in the last part of the
tutorial which if you haven't seen I
provide a link to it above as well as a
link to the beginning of this whole
video game design series as it is in
last part we created the photon torpedo
which you see right here photon torpedo
Java and all this codes available in the
link underneath the video and it's
heavily commented as you can see well
now what I need to do is implement the
whole entire thing so that I can shoot
torpedos in my game board and in the
program itself now if I use good
techniques like I have here instead of
what I did with the rock sea on purpose
I made Rock wrong just so I could show
how to make spaceship and photon torpedo
and eventually we'll fix rock so that
it's not so heavy ok so we created the
photon torpedo now if we use the correct
design principles that means that all
the other classes should have a minimal
effect to them well let's just get into
the spaceship well we know that we need
to shoot the photon torpedo from the
nose of the spaceship well we need to
find out what the exact vector is for
the nose of the spaceship and it totally
makes sense that we should create some
methods inside of the spaceship to be
able to get those coordinates so let's
just scroll on down through here and
look for a place that makes sense and I
think here makes just as much sense as
any get spaceship nose vector so let's
just go in here and figure out what
those vector points are for the nose so
I'm going to call this public double
because it's going to return a double
get ship nose X sounds like a good
enough name for me and then how exactly
are we going to do that
we're just going to use a little bit of
trigonometry and go this get X Center
this is going to be the center vector
point for our spaceship and if we want
to figure out what the new vector point
is for the nose we just go cosine and
the rotation angle for our spaceship and
then we multiply that times the length
from the center point of our spaceship
to the nose which is 14 pixels so I'm
just going to let it like that and there
you go you just got it just some basic
trigonometry once again you're going to
take whatever your first vector is which
is going to be the center of the
spaceship and you're going to add to
that the cosine of whatever the rotation
angle is for the line that would go from
the center of the spaceship to the new
vector and then multiply that times 14
or the length of the line so once again
trigonometry is coming in here and
saving us now if we want to figure out
what the Y point is no problem piece K
come in here again and then we're going
to come down here just change this to Y
and then we want to get the Y vector for
the center of our spaceship and if you
want to find the new Y vector for the
nose you're just going to come in here
and type in sine and then of course
you're also going to have to put in math
dot and math dot and aside from those
few little changes that's it that's what
you need to do if you want to be able to
get the x and y values for that and we
can save spaceship and guess what that
is all we need to do with spaceship so
let's go into the game board now it
makes perfect sense that we would be
able to store an ArrayList inside of the
game board that's going to contain all
of our torpedoes that we're going to be
shooting so right here ray list holds
torpedoes okay so we're going to create
this ArrayList I'm going to go public
and I'm going to make this static array
list and it's going to be a bunch of
photon torpedoes or photon torpedo which
is the name of the class and I'm going
to call it torpedoes is equal to new
array list and once again
photon torpedo the name the class close
that off and there we go
and inside of this guy we're going to
have all our photons what
Peto so we'll be able to play around
with us so now where are we going to go
scroll down here again and we're going
to check if the enter key has been
pressed where it would be a good place
how about here
checked for Enter key press to fire
torpedo if I want to be really explicit
about what's going on here and then it's
just simply I'm going to go else if this
is going to be a continuation of all
these other checks that we have here for
this key listener we're going to go II
dot get key code and then if we want to
check to see if the enter key was
pressed we can go key event dot V K
underscore enter and there we are
now if the enter key is pressed we're
going to perform certain actions one of
those actions is to create a new torpedo
and if we look over here with the photon
torpedo and scroll to the constructor
you can see right here here is our
constructor at what is being passed is
the ship's X vector that is this guy
right here for the nose and then this is
the Y vector for the nose and then this
is going to be the moving angle for the
spaceship well since I already have a
spaceship in here on the game board I
can use that guy so I'm just going to go
torpedos and add a new torpedo object to
my ArrayList I'm going to go new photon
torpedo and way down inside of the class
called game drawing panel - I have a
ship that I created something goes am
drawing panel two and I'm going to say
the all ship which is the name of the
ship and I'm going to say that I want to
get ship knows X which is the method
that we just created this guy right here
get ship knows X right there and that's
going to give me all that then I'm just
going to copy this don't have to type
all that out again because I need to get
the Y vector as well paste that in there
and then this situation I'm just going
to say that I want the Y vector and then
on top of that I'm going to paste this
in there again and I'm going to get to
get to the rotation angle for our
spaceship and there's that and then we
are we just created a new torpedo and
it's going to start out on the game
board whenever the Enter key is pressed
wherever the knows the X&amp;amp;Y knows value
area
for our spaceship is and then it's going
to shoot based off of the rotation angle
of the spaceship so it goes in the right
direction and then we need to draw our
torpedoes let's scroll way to the bottom
of the screen and here we are we're
going to draw our torpedoes right here
how we going to do we're going to use an
enhanced for-loop of course and the
temporary value is going to be torpedo
and we're going to go game forward
because remember we have the torpedoes
stored in the class called game board
and there that is and then we're just
going to move our torpedo polygon and
how do we do that we just say call the
move method simple enough and then we
want to make sure that the torpedo is on
the screen before we go through any
sorts of calculations that wouldn't make
sense we're just going to go if on
screen we created all these things in
the last part of the tutorial so if it's
not on the screen we're not going to do
any of this stuff and then we're going
to go graphic settings set transform and
then this is going to be identity and
this is just going to allow us to draw
anywhere in any direction rotate in any
way just like we talked about in
previous parts of the tutorial and then
if I want to move my torpedo I just call
translate and it handles all the messed
up math for me and I just go torpedo get
X Center whatever this Center elmontour
pedo is and I'm just going to copy that
paste that in there
and then I need to get the Y Center for
it that's going to move my torpedo for
me and then I just need to draw the
torpedo on the screen just that simple
and that's it that's all the changes we
need so let's file save this and see if
I did it right and here is our spaceship
just flying around just like before so
we didn't break anything and you can
also say that I'm able to shoot my laser
beam so pretty cool stuff in the next
part of the tutorial I'm going to handle
all the collision detection so that our
spaceship breaks and our asteroid breaks
any time that a laser beam hits them or
one of these rocks hits them leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
