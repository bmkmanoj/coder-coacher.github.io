6 of my android development tutorial in
this part of the tutorial we're going to
create an XML parsing multiple activity
stock quote picker now for this tutorial
I wanted to cover a ton of different
things so last night I sat down created
this whole program what you're gonna see
here in a second and my main goal here
was to teach you how to do countless
numbers of things all in one little tiny
app that does some really cool things so
some of the things I'm going to cover
include how to use the table layout how
to dynamically fill scroll views which
are really cool how to save key value
pairs so if your app closes and then
reopens they'll still be there I'm gonna
review click listeners again I'm going
to show you how to use intents to open
up other applications I'm going to show
you how to force close the keyboard I'm
going to show you how to use alert
dialog boxes I'm going to show you how
to start other activities and pass
information into those activities we're
gonna review the Yahoo web service and
I'm going to show you how to grab XML
data and parse it using YQL I'm going to
review the async task class and show you
how to use threads whenever you want to
do any type of processing and background
like parsing XML and of course I'm going
to show you how to parse XML data using
the DOM and eventually I'm probably
going to show you how to parse XML data
in the other different ways of doing it
and a whole bunch more so let's get into
it so here is basically our little
application I already created it here so
I could show it to you right from the
very beginning what it's going to allow
you to do is enter a stock symbol and
it's going to get you a quote and it's
also going to provide you with the
opportunity to click a button and jump
out and get news about the stock so what
we're gonna do I'm just going to zoom
out here if you can't see this it's
recorded in 1080p so you can do whatever
you want alright so let's say I wanted
to get some information on Apple so I'm
just going to click on that I'm going to
type in the symbol for Apple hit done
and then hit enter and it's gonna pop up
this little window with the little
symbol that I put inside of there this
tutorial is all about showing you how to
do things it's not about making
everything beautiful then what you're
going to be able to do is hit quote and
a whole bunch of information is going to
get pulled from the internet and
displayed on your screen in regards to
the Apple stock and of course you're
going to be able to come back
here hit the back button and another
little thing I built into it is how to
create a new activity with an outside
application so if you click on web what
that's going to do is it's going to show
you all sorts of information regards to
apples stock on Yahoo's financial page
sorry if that's a little bit blurry and
there you go there's the whole entire
thing and it does a whole bunch of other
things in the background now we're I'm
gonna be pulling all this information
from is from developer yahoo.com /y ql4
it slash console whether this is going
to be the tool anyway that I'm going to
use to look up all the different web
services that are available and there
are a ton of them so if you come over
here inside of this website what I'm
going to do is I'm going to click on
show community tables click on that guy
and then it is going to show me a whole
ton of different things that I'm going
to be able to search through so I got
this all blown up here so it's a little
bit wacky but you can pull information
using this tool from Amazon and
answers.com and Netflix and BBC and
bizrate and blah blah blah blah blah
this thing is huge Craigslist Foursquare
there is just a never-ending supply of
information you can pull from but what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna focus in on
Yahoo went over Yahoo
there's Yahoo and I'm gonna click on
that guy and then inside of this I'm
going to specifically look for Finance
quote and click on that and as you can
see it popped up this nice little YQL
query for me and if I just want specific
information on Microsoft like it has
here I can just hit test and I'm going
to be using XML as you see but you could
be able to use JSON if that would be
preferable to you and I'm also going to
show off Diagnostics and if I do all
that you're going to see here if I
scroll down it's going to pop up this
nice little XML file that I'm going to
be able to parse information out of so
let's say I want to get the change so
far for the day and the price and the
day's low the day's high the yearly low
the yearly high what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take all that information
and I am going to save it inside a text
file so these are going to be all the
different things that I'm going to want
to create inside of my interface so just
remember these guys you might actually
want to take some time here and write
them down
because I have them in front of me on a
piece of paper and it might really help
you if you wrote them down yourself okay
so that's what I'm going to be working
with so let's start writing out code
okay so inside of Eclipse here what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to call
this stock quote and I'm just going to
click on new and then go Android
application project an inside of
application name I'm going to go stock
quote and if you want all the finished
code I'm not going to cover it all of
course in this tutorial but if you want
it alright now I have a link in the
description and you can go get it
alright now if you don't want to wait
and of course it's all free so I'm going
to type in new think-tank I'm gonna let
everything else here be exactly the same
as it was before hit next let everything
on this screen also be the same and hit
next
let the icon it picks be okay there I'm
gonna let everything be blank activity
create activity just like that and then
finally I'm just going to let this be
called main activity I don't need to
change anything for any reason there and
then hit finish and that's going to
create our project for us and there it
is you've seen this before so now I'm
going to use the table layout and if I
want to change this from relative layout
which it is right now I'm just going to
right click on this and I'm going to
scroll down here to change layout and
that's going to pop up a little window
and I'm gonna come down here and go
table layout and then hit OK alright now
I'm using the table layout in this
situation because the table layout is
awesome in regards to having everything
automatically scale for you directly
depending upon the size of device you're
using whether it's a tablet phone
whatever it automatically scales really
nice now before I actually go in here
and start messing with this thing what
I'm going to need to do is I'm going to
need to take these guys that I told you
about previously and I'm actually going
to save a whole bunch of information in
regards to my interface inside of values
click over here come over to strings.xml
and open that guy up and there you can
see and then I'm going to go down to
strings.xml and click on that tab and
start messing with the actual code
inside of here first thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of a little world because I
don't need that and then I'm gonna china
cheat here a little bit normally have a
little pen drawing that's going to show
exactly what I want each activity screen
to look like but since I already created
them I might as well just open them up
directly inside of here so here's
activity main and this is basically what
we're going to be designing which is
this guy so I'm going to need enter
symbol I'm gonna need enter there I'm
going to need a editable text area I'm
gonna have this little box be up here
then I'm gonna have a scroll view and
then delete all symbols so you can
either draw that out there or of course
it pause in the screen or you can just
watch me do it I'll do my best to
explain what's going on so here is my
layout and I'm just gonna come in here
and click on that I'm just gonna get rid
of this all together so just delete
there it is it's gone then what I'm
gonna do is jump over into strings dot
XML and I'm gonna start adding some
different things inside here so what do
we need we need to have a line of text
that says enter symbol and we're doing
this so that our app will work with any
different type of language you can
imagine and yes I'm going to get into
how to translate later on and it's just
this tutorial so pack for the
information I decided not to cover that
alright so I want to have enter symbol
be printed out on a screen and I'm going
to do this for all of the different
pieces of text that I'm going to have in
all my activities so then I'm also going
to want them to enter their stock symbol
and that's actually going to be the
enter button so I'm just going to click
on that the line of text that's going to
represent to the scroll view which we're
going to make it a little bit I'm going
to put stock symbols and quotes print it
just like you saw on the previous screen
whenever I showed you what it finished
product looks like and then we're going
to have change stock symbol then we'll
have okay and that's going to be used
for our dialog boxes whenever we get
into those and then we'll have cancel of
course anytime you have a dialog box
you're going to use these two things and
then let's have our little message from
our dialog box so it's going to be
missing stock symbol and I don't know
let's just say enter a stock symbol so
I'm doing here is just putting in all
the text that's going to be you did for
my applications or my activities and so
that I don't waste your time there are
all of the different strings that I
saved inside of string XML and all they
are like I said again is just all the
strings I'm going to need for my
application so now that I got all those
defined I can close strings.xml and in
case you forgot strings that XML is in
the values folder and the values folder
is inside of the layout folder inside of
Eclipse and then the layout folders
inside of our es so there it is that's
everything so now that I have that
defined what I'm going to do is I'm
going to get rid of this text view
and right now I'm inside of activity
Maine this is going to be the thing that
pops up on the screen whenever they
start your application and because this
is a table layout what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a bunch of table
rows and how you do that is you go
layouts and you come to table row and to
use the table row I'm just going to drag
it out here and I'm just going to drop
it inside of there
now that I have that set up what I'm
going to need to do is actually put a
text field inside there or a text of you
so I'm just going to grab that guy drag
them over here drop them inside of there
and another thing I'm going to do here
quickly before I get into that is I'm
going to actually create a colors dot
XML file inside of values so I'm just
going to right click on that and I'm
going to go new and I'm just gonna
scroll it down here until I get to
Android XML file click on that and then
this book guy pops up but I'm going to
go colors dot XML and this is where I'm
going to save all my colors and I'm just
gonna hit finish
and there it opens up now if you want to
define colors well this is where I do it
on the web I just go to Wikipedia if you
just type in wiki colors this thing will
pop up and then I come through here and
I think about colors that I might want
to use so let's say I want to use Aero
blue well there it is
and there is the hex code for it so
let's just create that right now so I'm
just going to copy that pop over here
and if you wanted to find a color you're
just going to go color name is equal to
and I'm going to call this arrow blue
right like that close that and then come
in here and paste in the hex code and
there it is you just defined a color and
let's say that I want to define a couple
more of these colors come over here
let's say that I want to try like an egg
color
there's eggshell that works I'm just
gonna copy this hex code right there
paste it in there and there's eggshell
it makes it real easy to go and change
colors across your whole entire
interface and of course you can come in
here and do something simple like black
which is just a whole bunch of zeros
there you go there's all my colors
defined in colors XML and I'll be able
to pull those out and I'll show you how
I pull them out here in a second that
brings us back into activity main now
that I have this guy selected text view
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come over here and I'm just going to get
rid of this one there and change this to
an uppercase T and I normally give these
very verbose names I'm going to call
this and
a symbol textview and if you click out
of there and I'm not going to waste your
time going through and showing you how
to make all these because it's just a
repetitive task and then I can come over
here into the text area click on this
guy and stock symbol is the name and
there you can see now it says enter
symbol and for now that's all I'm going
to do with that now I'm also going to
want them to be able to come in here and
actually enter a stock symbol so I'm
going to go into text fields and I'm
going to grab one of these guys just a
plain editable text area and I'm going
to drop it in there inside of my table
row come over here again
it's selected editable text area and
this guy is going to be called stock
symbol edit text hit OK again it's going
to update everything then come back over
into the text area and leave it blank I
don't want it to do anything right now
but I'm hating the way that this is all
laid out here because the edible text
area is completely filling this in well
in that situation I like to actually go
into the code so I'm just going to click
on this tab open this guy up and I'm
going to go through and explain
everything now the table row if you
wanted to automatically sized to the
full width of your device what's real
simple you just go in where it says wrap
content and change that to match parent
that's one trick for the most part
that's going to be the only trick you're
going to need for table rows all this
other stuff up here is all perfectly fun
the textview I don't need to have match
parent because I don't want to fill out
the whole entire screen so I'm going to
leave that completely alone and then
down here with edit text this guy right
here
Android EMS what that means is it's
defining that the text size of the text
that goes into this editable text area
is going to be based off of the
specified point size for your device so
it's going to automatically scale for
you so that's why you want to use that
and then request focus whenever you put
that inside of one of these edit text
areas that means when the application
starts it's going to get the focus
automatically and any time an editable
text area gets focused that also means
that the keyboard is going to pop up and
also here with the editable text area
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
droid : and go lay out weight is equal
to one and basically if you don't have
any other components inside of your
table row that means the editable text
area is going to fill all the space
that's available however in the
situation like let's say we had to just
like we do here when we have textview
and we also have edit text well if you
would want the text of you to say only
get a third of the available area inside
of the table row well you would give it
Android layout weight of one so it would
get one third and then the editable text
area you would give two and by doing
that what's going to happen is textview
would get one third because there's only
three available numbers and the editable
text area would get the two thirds that
remained but in this situation we're
just going to let that exactly the way
it is if it didn't make any sense please
leave a question in the comment section
below and I'll be happy to elaborate on
that another thing I'm going to do here
is I'm going to go Android input type is
equal to text there we go
don't know why they didn't go in there I
probably pulled over the wrong editable
text area but no problem it's solved now
and then the other thing that I want to
be able to put inside of here is a
button so I'm gonna bounce back over
here and you can see that it's taken up
all the space in the world and I'm gonna
go into form widgets again and I'm gonna
grab my self up button drag it over here
let's see if it goes in nope didn't go
inside of there no problem just go back
into activity underscore main bounced on
here and there is my button where is my
button there it is okay so let's just
grab the button and put it in the right
place all on our own
do that I'm just gonna balance inside
the table row throw the button inside of
there and I'm gonna come in here and
actually give this a name that actually
makes sense so I'm gonna go enter stock
symbol button right there let everything
else be exactly the same and don't add a
layout wait what that's going to do is
it's going to give the button its
available space and it's going to give
the textview its available space and
then edit text is going to take up all
the remaining space so that's what's
going on with that and then for the text
area gonna come in here and if you ever
want to get a string out of your
strings.xml file just add string and
then this is going to be enter stock
symbol right
that jump back over and graphical layout
and you can see that there it is that's
exactly what I want so now what I need
to do is go in here and actually define
the little text block it's going to pop
up and then underneath that's going to
be the scroll view that we're going to
create a second well for this I'm going
to pretty much do the same thing I'm
just going to go into well it's wrong
button I need to click on layouts there
it is and just go table row and drag it
over here and drop it in and there it is
bounced back down into activity main and
just verify that everything's the same
so match parent want that make sure yep
say yes see here you want to make sure
that these table rows are always matched
parent so that's good then let's say
that I want to actually have a different
color in my background for my table row
pretty easy to do so I have table row
two selected over here if I want to
change the color for it I'm just gonna
have to search for background and click
on that that's in view and then we can
come in here to color and you can see
eggshell is available that guy that I
created earlier so now the table row has
that guy now if I wanted to actually put
another text view inside of that table
row what I'm going to do is come in here
and go form widgets grab text view drag
it down drop it in and you can see that
the eggshell pops up inside of there now
with that selected come in here text
view and this is going to be stock
symbol text view that's fine
hit OK I'm going to skip this part from
now on so don't waste your time and then
inside of text view where it has the
text that's going to show up click on
that and I'm going to search for stock
symbol list click on that and there you
say there is stock symbols and quotes
pops up inside of there now I don't
really like the way this is left
justified and I also don't really like
the fact that the text is so small so if
I want to change the text on this what
I'm going to do is come over here again
to values and click on dimensions XML I
can change the text size in there click
on dimensions on XML at the bottom and
if I want to define a custom size here
no problem paste that in there and let's
give this a name so I'm going to call
this I'm going to give it a name very
similar to what I just typed in so stock
list text size and then I'm just going
to change this to 16 SP
and if I'll save that and also I think
I'm going to change my margins a little
bit I'm going to change this to 5 DP and
change this to 5 DP also that's just
going to be the margins around all the
different things components in my
activity so I got that safe that's
dimensions that XML close that so there
we go and I still don't like the way
that this is set up so I'm going to go
back down into activity main.xml and I
can do it over on the right side of
screen some reason I just prefer doing
it inside of here
and also for this guy I'm a coffee match
parent and I'm going to copy that down
inside of here because I'm going to want
to Center it and I want to fill up the
whole entire space so that's fine the
thing I'd like to define is how many
columns this component is going to take
up in my table row and if you want to do
that you can just go Android and it's
going to be span and it just does
exactly remember this is a table so
we're going to define how many different
it's actually not spinning its layout
span I'm just defining how many columns
it's going to take up and mark this is
two if I want this to be centered
actually let's do this elsewhere so you
can see all the options let's bounce
over in the graphical layout again if I
want this to be centered I just have to
select it of course and then over here
I'm going to look for gravity and what
this is going to do is define if a
components going to be centered right
justified or left justified and actually
there's a whole bunch of different
options so ir's gravity right there and
it's inside the textview little drop
down there so come over here click on
this and you can see there are all the
different options that are available to
you I'm gonna have it be Center
horizontal just because that works for
me I'm gonna hit OK you can see look at
it centered okay so that's how you would
do that I'll save it and anything else
that I would want to do let's say I
already have my padding defined as 5dp
wouldn't hurt to actually come in here
and do this let's just this is how you
would define padding just go Android
padding is equal to and I'm just going
to put five DP if I want to make sure
that the color is black for this guy I
could also just go Android text color is
equal to and then you're going to go at
color /black there that is defined and
then if I want to come in
you're in to find the dimensions from my
text because remember I wanted to change
that I can go in here and go Android
text size is equal to and to get things
out of the dimension XML file you go at
domen forward slash and this is going to
be stock list text size which is what I
called it now if I click on graphical
layout you can see there it is it is now
centered and it's also black all good
things
now if I want to put a scroll view
inside of this guy what I'm gonna have
to do and what a scroll view is it's
going to allow me to dynamically add
symbol stock symbols and those buttons
and all those different things what I
need to do when that situation is put in
another click on layouts throw in
another table row just throw it in there
right like that and now that I have it
selected and let's make sure that the
background stays the same squares
background up there's background
background color cut now come into color
eggshell there we are
click on that again and in this
situation I want a scroll view to show
up inside of here and to get that you're
going to want to click on composite
there's composite and here is scroll
view and you want to drag that over and
drop it down inside of there so there's
your scroll view now that I have that
selected gonna come over here give it a
name that makes sense
I don't worry about the table rows
because I don't really have anything to
do with them I'm not messing with them
so I just get let them have generic
names I'm going to call this stock
scroll view and whenever you create a
scroll view as you're gonna see you're
actually going to have to put a table
layout inside of it and a whole bunch of
components later on so to do that I'm
just gonna click on OK scroll down here
inside this and let's drive this match
parent like that I'm also gonna put the
layout wait there just to make sure that
it fills up the whole entire thing this
guy right here
copy paste that in there there that is
and then inside of the scroll view I'm
also going to do a couple other things
well I'm going to do match parent again
cuz it's basically just going to scroll
it's going to do and it's going to hold
a whole bunch of components inside of it
and then let's say I want to do Android
layout span is equal to two again number
of columns that we're going to be taken
up there's the only thing in there so
that worked and I'm going to put my
padding inside of here again of 5dp so
make sure that the padding works then
inside of that this is set up as linear
layout
I want it to be a table layout that just
goes in there automatically I didn't put
that in there so now it's a table layout
and let's just make sure that it has a
name that makes sense match parent is
fine height I'm actually going to change
this back to wrap content so it doesn't
take up too much space orientation
doesn't matter because it's a table
layout so we can get rid of that all
together and let's go and throw our
padding of five DP into this again and
then another thing I want to do is I
want to make the column stretch and what
that means is by going in here and going
Android stretch columns equal to yes
what that's going to do for me is to
define that I want my components to
expand in width to fit any extra space
that is available and that's what
stretch columns means which basically it
kind of makes sense and then now what I
have left here so you fills the whole
entire screen basically I'm going to put
one more table row in here and it's just
going to have a delete button on it so
I'm actually enough to scroll out here
to do that click on layouts and table
row and just put it down here who cares
if it doesn't even work I see it went
the wrong place I don't care I'm gonna
go back into activity main actually
that's kind of a nightmare if I think
about it I might as well just go in here
and actually write that thing inside
there so I'm just gonna copy this table
row like that I'm all the way down here
after this paste that then I'm gonna get
a table row again copy here we are match
parent wrap content all good now I want
to put a big giant button inside of
there now it should be down inside of
there so form widgets and I'm gonna go
and get myself a button there it is it's
in the right place if I went this button
to fill the whole entire table row first
thing I'm going to do is come over here
to ID delete that button delete stalks
button inside of text click on that
delete all symbols just double click on
it and now it says delete all symbols
however if I want this to actually come
in here and fill the whole entire area
to do that I'm gonna come all the way
down here where the button is and just
let wrap content and all these other
things stay exactly the same I'm just
gonna come up here
grab a Android layout span copy that
paste that in there with the button and
I'm gonna do the same exact thing with
layout wait and they'll make sure it
fills the whole entire screen or the
whole entire row anyway if we bounced
out here you can see there it is there's
our whole entire layout went a little
bit crazy
there we are that is the layout that we
define before now the final thing I'm
going to do here is I'm going to show
you how to actually create the rows that
are going to go into our scroll views
remember that's going to happen
dynamically well to have that
information go inside of there
what you're going to need to do is come
over here where it says layout and
you're going to want to create yourself
another layout inside of there so come
up here go new XML file where is it
there it is
and there it opened up and then inside
of this guy I'm going to call this stock
quote row and I'm actually going to
define this as a table row so it's just
fine table row here double click on that
and then hit next and I don't care and
hit finish okay so now this guy is
actually going to be the rows that are
going to be dynamically added to our
scroll view so if I want to create these
guys down here in this tab area there
you can see it's defined as a table row
match parent that's going to be
perfectly fine I'm going to change the
height to wrap content though there we
are and then since these table rows are
going to be on top of that egg shell
sort of scroll view if you want to
actually have them be set up as
transparent so that the color of
whatever it's sitting on top of shows up
just go equals at Android colon color
transparent and it will make a
transparent and then the other thing
let's say that I want to add padding to
it as well now I'm just going to show
you what padding looks like elsewhere
graphical layout table row in here
whereas padding there's padding right
there click on that and in this
situation I'm just going to let it be
5dp like it is there and hit OK and then
I'll give me padding then inside of this
what I'm going to do is populate a
textview and two buttons dynamically so
I'm going to grab a textview from the
forum widgets over here and there is my
table row come over here
stock symbol textview and then I'm
automatically come in here and throw two
buttons and also there's
and there's another button and I'm gonna
go in here and actually edit them and
here I'm gonna let these be wrap content
wrap content the textview I want to
completely fill the whole entire area
not taken up by buttons so I'm going to
go Android layout span is equal to two
Android layout weight is equal to one
and I'm not going to final wait for the
other one such is going to do exactly
what I just said it's going to take up
all available space if I want to also
come in here just to review and change
the text color and I'll just go text
color at color black which is something
that I defined before and then if I want
to make the text selectable and go
Android because I hate it whenever I
want to select text and is not available
text is selectable and set that the trip
and this guy right here I don't need it
all I'll save and then down here for our
buttons I'm just going to call this guy
I'm a stock quote button which whenever
it's clicked it's going to go and get me
a quote I'm gonna let that wrap content
and let's say that I actually want this
to use a smaller size for my button how
you would do that is to go style is
equal to at symbol Android or you could
just pick the small style attribute
forward slash button style small and we
get more into these styling tools later
on in the tutorial and the text for this
guy I'm gonna define here in a second
because I kind of forgot it and then for
this one I'm also going to define this
for style small this is going to be the
button that's gonna grab the website
quote from web button now I'm going to
bounce out of this click on the button
stock load button under text click on
that and it is get stock quote says
quote and then for this guy click on
that go to website and there it is so
that's all I'm going to cover in this
first part of this guy setting up the
application the next part and stuff all
the event listeners and a whole bunch of
other things pretty much everything
except parsing XML which is going to be
in a separate tutorial all on its own
but like I said if you want all the code
and everything everything is available
in a description underneath the video
and of course always feel free to ask
any questions till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
