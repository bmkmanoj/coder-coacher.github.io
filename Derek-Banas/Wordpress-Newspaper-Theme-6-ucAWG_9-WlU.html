6 of my wordpress newspaper theme
tutorial in which we will take this
plain Jane HTML / CSS site that you have
here that we made earlier and turn it
into a wordpress theme like you see here
on the screen and now i'm going to show
you what it looks like currently ah it's
terrible but in this tutorial what we're
going to do is really go in there and
fix the sidebar and start styling this
guy up the important thing to understand
here this is in index.php right here
we're defining the side where we want to
use and we are calling it first so why
that is important is whenever we open up
to start creating our customized sidebar
we need to change the name of it it
cannot be called sidebar dot PHP we are
going to instead save it as sidebar dash
first just like we labeled in the index
dot PHP file so now let's start going in
here and messing this guy up first we're
going to come into this div area i'm
going to call this first side lower it's
all we need to do there what this is
going to do up here this line of code we
have here on the screen is it's going to
allow you to throw widgets in there and
edit the setai bored with your theme so
we're actually going to leave this
exactly the same as it shows right here
we don't need a search form and actually
we don't need anything else that's on
this screen so we're going to come the
whole way down here to the div and
delete at all it's what i mean by
creating these guys from scratch and
what we're going to do start making an
additional divs so we're going to create
a div and let me open up the actual
thing so this is what we're creating
over here on the right side of the
screen if you can't see it you can watch
this in full screen and in HD because
it's an HD video so sorry bore widgets
okay so i'm going to create a div called
sidebar widgets obviously and then i'm
going to create another day of class is
equal to sidebar label and for now i'm
actually going to leave this empty i'm
gonna actually let it sit there but
there's not going to be anything inside
of it my commander and delete that
altogether but sometimes i leave things
in there just because i think it might
use them in the future and as i
mentioned previously i am going to turn
this guy into a plug-in or in fact I
already did create it or create it as a
widget and I'm going to get into that
later on
just like I did before I'm just going to
link out to the location for my RSS feed
and how you do that is with blog info
and then you type in our SS to
underscore URL and then that is
automatically going to pull in the URL
for your RSS feed and then I have to
link out to the image equal to PHP and I
have to go blog info and plate directory
which is just my theme directory and
whenever I type that in there it's going
to output to the URL for my theme
directory onto the screen close PHP then
I can go images RSS logo and it's going
to grab that logo from inside of there
and I'm going to tell it I want a height
of 50 pixels and a width equal to 50
pixels and then I'm going to close that
off but that a tag inside of there and
then just like I did previously i'm
going to make four copies of this so
let's just put that there i'm going to
link out to my twitter address and this
is these are going to be the defaults
except i'm not going to have to call PHP
for that I go HTTP beow twitter com do
think time so that will just be the
default and then pretty much everything
else is going to be here the same here
except this is going to be turned into
twitter logo and then this is going to
have to be a pain file let me correct
that right now probably thinking what is
file type logo and everything else
there's going to be exactly the same and
I copy that paste that in there save us
all some time and then I'm going to link
to Facebook and that could stay the same
change this from Twitter to Facebook
that could be the same even though I
never use it linkedin in LinkedIn okay
so that's going to bring in all that
information for the social networks then
I'm going to give myself some room so we
can look at everything else here on the
screen a little bit better I have to
close off that paragraph tag that we
created that surrounds that and then I'm
going to create another div class type
is equal to sidebar title and I'm also
going to leave that they're just as a
placeholder create another pair glad
class is equal to sidebar excerpt and
then inside of this like I did
previously I'm going to have it generate
all my pages dynamically for me by
calling WP list pages depth I'm not
going to show the children so depth is
going to be equal to 1 and title under
school
li is equal to then I'm going to
surround or define what I want to
surround the title that pops up there
see pages pops up there so we want to
tell it exactly what to do with this so
I'm going to say div class give it
sidebar I'll you don't know put it
inside of an h4 tag and I say pages h4
and then close the diff and you close
off that function and you close off the
PHP and then you close off the paragraph
tag and that little bit of code right
there is going to generate all of my
pages on there and then I'm going to go
div class is equal to sidebar title and
this time once again I'm just going to
leave that empty for now and then close
that deal let's say you wanted to put
like an advertisement inside of here p
class is equal to sidebar mixer don't
forget the quotes and then its image
source and this again it's just going to
be placeholder PHP log info call the
template directory my theme directory
also going to do is put the URL for that
there then I'm going to say images add
sample that's what my logo thing is over
there on the right side of the screen
and I give it all advertised and give it
a title equal to advertising width equal
to 250 pixels which is kind of standard
height is equal to 250 pixels and then
close that off and then close off the
paragraph tag for sidebar excerpt and
then just like I did before I'm going to
print out my categories side far and
this time I'm going to leave an actual
title inside of there I call it
categories I could have done the same
thing as I did here for pages but I
decided to do it this way just to show
you a couple different ways and i know
i'm repeating a little bit from last
time but that's really the only way
you're going to learn sidebar excerpt
and then call PHP to execute or to show
those categories on the screen so you do
that with WP list categories and i'm
gonna say i don't want children
categories to show up just like i did
before with death and then because i
already have a title here l is equal to
and i'm just going to close that off and
put nothing inside of it and then i'm
going to close off PHP and the paragraph
tag and i'm going to close off the do
for sidebar widgets and then way up here
you saw this if statement up here well i
got to close that off
as well I'm going to get rid of this
white space there's no reason to have it
there don't need it and right after this
div I'm going to go PHP and if and leave
that div in there and there you go with
your sidebar course first sidebar in our
fist sidebar and if you file save that
nothing really is going to change
dramatically over here there you go at a
couple things kind of change but
whenever we get into styling now things
are going to change dramatically so this
is the blank theme style and to show you
how important this is I'm just going to
select it all and delete it there it's
all going now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to grab the styling that we
created it's like golf coffee whenever
we created this straight CSS HTML guy
right here and inside a style dot CSS
i'm going to paste that in what we
created already delete this file save it
then things going to start changing a
little bit more dramatically there you
go now stuff start actually line up on
the screen it's starting to look kind of
nice but it's still kind of messed up so
we have to come into this styling and
make some changes it's actually not
going to be that many different changes
one of the first things here as you can
see random site is a link and I'm not
referring to it as a link right here
with blog title so I'm going to come in
here I'm gonna change this to a so now
it is going to start styling that link
and then I'm going to have to go text
decoration none what this does is it
gets rid of the underline that's put on
all length so if i'll save that reload
it and there you can see starting to
look a little bit nice but it's off
center I can fix that quite easily
though just have to come in here on the
top where it says negative 15 I'm gonna
get rid of that all together file save
it reload it and there it is now it's in
the right place on top of that I want to
make a couple other additional changes
let's guys so that I can change its look
whenever someone hovers over it well how
you do that scroll up here is after the
a tag i'm going to type in hover its
basic CSS styling here now whenever a
mouse hovers over top of it we're going
to do a couple of different things we're
going to change the color of it so say e
6 e 8f a and also we're going to put a
text shadow on it that just puts a
little thing in the background make it
look kind of neat to pixels to pixels
and then for pixel blur file save it
reload it if you put your mouse over top
of it you can see that it's
colors and it's changing a little shadow
in the background so that's kind of neat
then for blogs slogan I'm going to play
around of this guy a little bit also I'm
going to have it go 50 from the top just
like i like it looking that way and then
I decided I wanted this font to be bold
and 15 pixels instead of 20 line height
change that and i decided i want to get
rid of the seraphs all together here so
i'm going to type in arial sans-serif if
i'll say reload it and i personally
think that looks a little bit nicer
we're gonna have to do some additional
stylings with the sidebar because the
sidebar is now inside of an h4 tag and
that's all I need to change there and I
need to make a couple other additional
things here because I have something
called sidebar excerpt sidebar excerpt I
want to target li UL li a make a couple
additional changes here being list style
type and I put none that's going to get
rid of the bullets and text decoration
none that's going to get rid of
underlines for the links whenever we
have these pages get automatically
generated by wordpress they are put
inside of a div called page nav so i'm
also going to do the same thing for page
now let's get rid of all these things so
it's going to get rid of all those
problems as well and then also going to
target age now remember it's a directory
that goes around any time you create a
page or you have WordPress automatically
generate all of your pages in the list
i'm also going to target page and a few
l li a text decoration still going to be
none not going to need list style type
get rid of that but i want to change the
font to a bold 14 pixels 17 pixels
helvetica sans-serif and i'm going to
automatically make all of the text
uppercase you do that with text
transform uppercase and then i'm going
to change the color of the text will get
scared 666 it's just a grey and then the
first sidebar i don't have the unordered
list part in here i'm just going to
target list items in this situation and
margin left i'm going to set this to 0
pixels and then i have to change text
decoration which again is underlined to
not let's save that see how it's shaping
up here starting to come together a
little bit nicer you can stay that all
that information street
they're on the screen and if I go into
my wp-content folder and inside of
themes news themes and images and copy
all these guys which I had from before
and jump into images and paste in all of
those different images inside of there
and then reload this now you're starting
to see a pretty dramatic change with
this i'm going to copy this guy and
we're going to come in here and
specifically start targeting the links
that follow the list items and just
going to grab this font paste it inside
of there text decoration also want to
get rid of that on all the links text
transform also get that and then color
make sure we get that to be gray and
then i need to target sidebar excerpt
because again that's something that has
changed so we'll go in here text
decoration none page now sidebar title
h4 if they're going to be using that h4
tag I want to be prepared for it now fix
that as well also want to do some
styling changes in a category section
it's a target sidebar excerpt called
categories and then I want to target the
list items make sure i get rid of all
the dots and everything there then i
want to target come in here and reload
this see how it's shaping up and you're
not going to notice much difference here
what I'm working on is the right side
not this part that's going to be in the
next part of the tutorial so this is
where you're seeing changes at as well
as changes in the bottom of the screen
I'm basically just correcting all the
different parts of the sidebar right now
you will Li tags I can save the font yes
I did so that's good and then if I want
to put a border on the bottom will dash
border which look nice before coming
here to do that dashed at semi DC DC DC
like a grayish thing and then patting
put a little bit of padding between
these guys so it looks nice as well as
padding on the top of the same amount
margin left because these are list items
are going to be indented so I want to
get rid of that just did text decoration
and I got rid of that as well the footer
here can stay exactly the same way that
it has been except i decided to increase
the size on the footer to 320 pixels
that's going to be the width of these
three boxes you see here on the screen
and this guy here isn't even going
Steny more I'm going to put some space
in here i'm going to create the last
part so footer content page now what am
I going after here I'm going after the
div that is surrounding the automatic
list of the pages this guy down here
where it's listing all the pages that I
have that's what I'm shooting for and
going after the a tank or the links
whatever you want to call them and I'm
going to color that in there with white
and I can copy this and then I want to
target sidebar title target the h4 tags
make them white as well when it target
any list items inside of here which is
basically going to be anything that
comes after the title it's inside of the
day of called footer content and on set
the font to the same as above list item
I want to get rid of those bullets so
I'm going to say none margin left why am
I making this negative cause the list
item I want to move it over to the left
and I'm gonna make it white that's the
text by the way that I'm making way and
then footer content li a basically going
to do the same exact thing with this
text decoration is going to be set to
none text transform it's going to be set
to uppercase so that all the letters are
forced to be upper case which is just a
styling choice i chose definitely not
something that's needed that looks nice
and then footer in this situation we go
after title and target h4 tags and i'm
just going to copy this whole entire
thing paste that in there it's gonna be
exactly the same except this is gonna be
negative 30 going to be negative 40 that
is a vast majority of the style sheets
and that is the sidebar totally done and
now you can see everything starting to
look sidebar is all real nice looking
down there and the sidebar I mean the
footer looks nice down here and the
sidebar looks nice and this looks nice
so in the next part of the tutorial I'm
going to finish styling all of this mess
inside of here so it looks nice as well
as dialing the menu even e questions or
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
