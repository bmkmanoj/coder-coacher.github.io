online video tutorial and this one
tutorial I'm going to cover the core
syntax of the Erlang language through a
ton of example code now this is the
number one most requested next
all-in-one video you guys asked for and
so here it is like always all of the
code as well as a cheat sheet for this
entire video and also timestamps to all
the different parts of the video are
available in the description and this
video is basically for somebody that
already knows another programming
language and wants to learn how to do in
Erlang what they do in other languages
like Python or Java or C sharp or
whatever they're used to so going to be
doing a lot of unconventional things but
I think you'll learn a lot about Erlang
in this video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it
okay so I made a previous video which is
also in the description that shows you
how to set up Erlang install everything
and get it to work with eclipse as well
on a Macintosh and on a Windows computer
so this is what we're going to start off
we're going to come over here to source
and we're going to go new module and
we're going to open this guy up and I'm
going to call this talk dot ERL that is
the extension for an inner line file
then I'm going to click on finish and
it's going to spit all kinds of crazy
stuff all over the screen now basically
modules are going to contain many
different functions and this guy right
here is always going to be the first
statement in any of your Erlang files we
are probably going to also want to
import a whole bunch of different things
here so the next thing I'm going to put
inside of here is import and I'm going
to import a whole bunch of string
functions that I'm going to cover later
on so we'll have length and the way you
set this up is you are going to define
the functions name so this is length it
gives you the length of the string and
then you're going to follow that up with
the number of attributes that that
function is going to be receiving concat
likewise is going to go allow you to
join two strings and it's going to
receive both of those strings as
attributes and there you can see a whole
bunch of other different functions which
as the tutorial continues I will cover
then you're also going to
have to then put export' inside here and
this is going to be where you're going
to find what functions can be called
from this module your personal module
and to start off I'm just going to put
in hello world I'm going to keep this a
very simple and don't worry I'm going to
get into all kind of complicated stuff
so this is not going to receive any
attribute and that is going to be the
end of that file also remember to always
end these statements with a period like
that and likewise like that now what
we're going to do is actually go and
create a function inside here and this
is the hello world function that I just
previously mentioned put the parentheses
at the end and then you're going to put
this little arrow inside of here you're
going to then tab in and here all this
guy is going to do is go and print some
information out on our screen and you
may have guessed it but it's going to
print out the hello world on the screen
all right and this is a newline which
just means it's going to put a new line
after it prints hello hello world on the
screen for us then we come in and we can
save that then we're going to come up
here this is a clips I'm using and we're
going to run this guy and you're going
to see the console changed a little bit
over inside here I'm then going to
change to the directory where I have all
of my files you can see that right here
our Lang cut and source it's going to be
different for you unless you have a
derrick being a stricter E if you do
you're very awesome and we're going to
hit enter inside of there and then to
execute this guy we're going to come
over here and we're going to go well
first off we have to compile it so we're
going to go see put Tut inside of there
which is the name of our file right like
this and then we can come in here and go
tot like that and main and then and
hello world with our parentheses and
then period and we run that and you can
see hello world comes up there all right
so pretty simple stuff don't worry we're
going to get much more complicated than
that
let's come in here and also defined we
want to export another function and you
may have noticed all your functions are
going to be lowercase letters and this
guy is going to add two values so I'm
going to put add inside of there and
then obviously it's going to add two of
them so I'm going to put that inside of
there now what I can do is come in here
and define my function and it's also
interesting to know that you're going to
be able to call other
functions from inside of your functions
so when you go hello world like this and
then we're going to put a comma at the
end of that and that's going to allow us
to call the hello world function and
then we're also going to be able to come
in here and add these two values that
are passed inside air so we're going to
save that we're going to go touch we are
going to go add and then inside of here
we can go five and four whatever we want
to do hit enter you can see that it
printed out the hello world because it
called that function and it also went
and got our result and printed that out
on the screen so you can use F right or
a whole bunch of other different ways of
outputting to the screen or you can just
come in here and just have whatever you
want to show up on the screen just put
that right in there and it just works
it's also interesting to know that we
are going to be able to come in and to
find functions with the same name that
are just going to have a different
number of attributes so let's say we
also want to be able to add multiple
numbers of three numbers for example we
could do so so let's just copy this
paste that inside of there and we'll go
see like this and then we will go a plus
B plus C and we save that and took an
ADD and then we can say something like
three four and five and close that off
and you're going to see it did the hello
world but it also now allowed us to add
in three numbers instead of just two
another things kind of interesting is
you can get some information about your
module just by going cut like that and
touch the name of my file here and just
go module info and dot and it's going to
provide you all kinds of information in
regards to the different modules that
you have inside there are different
functions you have and a whole bunch
other different things which I'm not
going to get into here right now and now
only to save time and keep things a
little bit constrained here I'm only
going to export one function and it's
going to be main and the main function
isn't going to receive any attributes so
I'm going to put a zero inside of there
now where Lang normally isn't work
doesn't work this way in regards to
using a main function or whatever I'm
just doing this to try to keep
everything well organized so I can cover
it so I'm going to do inside of my main
function just go main and then this and
I'm going to call a function that's
going to be called variable stuff make
sure this is indented
variable stuff and put a dot at the end
of that now variable names are going to
start with an uppercase letter or an
underscore and then they can contain
either letters both uppercase and
lowercase numbers underscores or at
symbols it is very important to
understand with our language variable
values cannot change however variable
types are going to be defined
dynamically so the type is going to be
defined and based off of the type of
data that you try to store inside of it
and another thing interesting point out
here is that you are going to be able to
call a function inside of here before
it's actually then the font and that
just means that I can come down here and
put variable stuff up here or down here
below where it was actually defined and
all this guys going to it's just going
to be a function that is going to define
a variable remember uppercase letters
and commas if you want to have multiple
different lines inside of here and then
this is just going to return the value
of num right like that and when you come
over here cut oops make sure I save this
first save it now because we changed the
function we're going to export we're
going to have to come over here and
compile this so C cut like that and now
what we're going to be able to do is
just go touch and main and run it and
you're going to see that the one comes
out right there now when Adam is another
variable that's name is actually going
to be equal to its value and you're
either they're all going to start with
lowercase letters and they can either
just be a simple word sort of the
lowercase letter obviously or they're
going to be surrounded with single
quotes so I'm going to change this to
Adams stuff and I'm going to change this
to Adams stuff like this and then I
could just simply come in here and do
something like and add them like that
and run that over there and you can see
an atom comes up inside of there or I
can come in here and just put a single
quote and go an atom if there's spaces
inside of there obviously you're going
to have to use quotes and there you can
see an atom popped up and if you're
missing it you have to go in here and
type cut main like that and followed by
a period and that is going to execute
your code over here on the right side of
the screen now I want to do some
math things here just to cover a couple
other different things so let's go call
this do math and let's have this
function come in here and pass five and
four inside of there I'm going to call
this do math and it's going to receive
two attributes obviously then it's have
it come in here and just add these
values so go a plus B like that and you
can see that nine comes back so that
works great we can just throw a comb
inside here we could also go in and go a
minus B put that period inside of there
and run that to get an answer of one we
could also do multiplication of course
and division and you can see there that
that is floating point division they're
also going to be have an option to do
just integer division in that situation
you put a div inside of there like that
and then we come over here and run it
and you can see that only one comes back
and we're also going to be able to do
modulus which is going to return the
remainder of a division and we can run
that as well
and you can see one comes back from that
there's a whole bunch of other different
specific math libraries involved in here
also are available also so let's say we
wanted to go and get a raise to the X
power we could do so let's go put exp
inside of here and let's just do one
like that and there you can see as a
value of e we're also going to be able
to come in and do the natural logarithm
so we can come in when we just copy e
here copy that and change this to log
and paste be inside of there andronica
we're also going to have the common log
let's throw 1000 inside of there execute
that for three we're going to be able to
take let's say 10 to the second power by
just putting POW inside of there like
that and then 10 to the second power and
there's 100 we also have square roots so
square root and let's just change this
to 100 and there's 10 and you're also
going to have all of these other
different functions you have right here
of course you're going to put math in
front of them like we did here to be
able to use them and if I didn't mention
it before if you want to put a comment
you just put a
% inside of there and everything after
that is going to be completely ignored
if you'd also like to know how to
generate a random value you can just
come in and go random uniform and let's
say that we want to generate a random
value between 1 and 10 that's how that's
done and there it is you can see we got
5 like that and then each time we call
it we're going to get different values
there's 8 and there's 10 and now I want
to talk a little bit about how we can
compare values so I'm going to come up
inside of here in this main area and I'm
going to say compare and I'm going to
put a 4 inside of here and a 4.0 change
this to compare leave a and B in there
now you can check for equality of both a
value and type by just going a and an
equal sign with a colon inside of there
and B you can see that false comes back
from that you're going to be able to
check for inequality between them both
in value and type that's what I'm
checking here right now and you see that
comes back is true you can also check
for equality and disregard type C this
is a floating point and this is an
integer here we're not going to pay any
attention to type and you can see that
comes back is true and you can also
disregard type for not equal to by
putting that guy inside of there another
thing that we'll be able to do is
there's you're also going to be able to
go greater than or less than greater
than or equal to this guy's a little bit
weird this is going to be less than or
equal to and you're also going to have
the logical operators which are going to
be + or not and exclusive or and I'll
come in here and do a quick example here
to show you how what's up with this so
let's say you have age is equal to 18
put a column inside of there and then we
can do some comparisons we can say if
age is greater than or equal to 5 or age
is less than or equal to equal to or
less then maybe we should say 18 then
we're going to come back here and get a
result and put that inside of there and
you can see the true comes back alright
so there is a rundown you can test you
know
the other different logical operators
but I think you get a good idea of how
comparisons work so now I'd like to talk
about
if conditionals okay so in the main
section I'm going to create a function
called what grade and I'm going to throw
10 inside of here
now down inside of here I will basically
I'm going to create two functions and
one of them is going to be called
preschool and it's not going to receive
anything but whenever it's called it is
going to return go to preschool and then
we're going to create another one and
it's going to be called kindergarten and
whenever it is going to be called
instead is going to say go to
kindergarten okay two very simple
functions going to create another
function and it's going to be called
grade school and this one's going to be
go to grade school all right so we've
got all of those different functions set
up now we're going to actually come in
and create what grade so I'm going to go
what grade and I'm going to receive a
value passed inside of here as you can
see I'm not defining data types or
anything and then here is an if
statement so I'm going to say if X is
less than 5
in that situation I want to call the
preschool function down to the next line
then I'm going to put a semicolon then
I'm going to go X equal to 5 in that
situation I want to call kindergarten
and down to the next line put another
semicolon and I'm going to say if X is
greater than 5 in that situation
I'm going to say grade school ok and
then to end off this if statement we're
going to put end and then a period you
come over here
execute this guy and there you can see
that go to grade school pops back
exactly like we would have guessed so
there's a rough overview of how we can
work with if and I know else's and
inside of there but you can see the
basic structure of how we can do all of
those different things using Erlang
I would like to come in here and now
talk about case conditionals so I'm
going to come in and change this to say
hello is it's going to be the name of
the function so say hello and inside of
it I'm going to
pass an atom that is going to be German
and then define the function so say
hello and then based off of what they
pass in they're going to get different
results so I'm going to say case X of
and if it has the value of French in
that situation I'm going to return
Bonjour throw in some Accola otherwise
if they go and put German inside of
there I'm going to Kabul gutentag close
that off with another semicolon and if
they say English in this situation I'll
go hello okay so depending upon what is
passed inside of it that is going to
change the results and then we're going
to end that case and we are going to run
this guy and there you can see gutentag
pops back just like you would have
thought all right so just a real quick
explanation of how case works go in
there and experiment more with it to
figure out some other neat things and
now I'm going to talk about strings and
pretty much a little bit more depth so
the function I'm going to use this time
is going to be called string stuff and
it is not going to be passed anything
and I'm going to come in here and create
string stuff so string stuff and
basically strings are going to be
surrounded by double quotes and you're
of course going to use an uppercase
letter to start this off and we'll go
random string and throw a comma at the
end of this we'll go and create another
one we'll call this string 2 and this is
going to have the name of another string
throw another column in there and you
can put spaces and things wherever you'd
like to do and now you're going to be
able to place these strings or any data
inside of your output using a tilde and
I use P this up to you whatever you want
to use so we go up right and let's say I
want to do something like string and
then go tilde P and tilde P and throw in
a newline inside of there and then to
transpose those in there you're inside
of brackets you're going to go string 1
and string 2 and they're going to show
up in the output based off of the order
so this is going to go to the first one
and this is going to go to the second
one and you see if I ran it it's going
to
random string and then it's going to
show another string okay let's continue
doing some more you're also going to be
able to use a format for similar results
so let's create another string here and
so we'll go I owe lib and formats and
here I'm going to say it's a SAM I'm
just going to go till to s and till to s
throw in a new line inside of there and
then go string one and string to close
that off and now I'm going to output it
on the screen by going IO and F writes
string three and then close that off and
then you can see it says it's a random
string end of the string and you can
also see in this situation we don't have
the quotes around the strings that we
were importing which might look a little
bit better let's go and do some more if
we want it to output on the screen the
string length we could do so let's go
string length like that and you can see
15 pops back right there do some more
whole bunch of these guys I told you
before you can concatenate strings or
join strings together we go string four
is equal to and we'll go contacts and
string 1 and string two and then I'll go
string four like that main you can see
random string and another string comes
back they're together of course there's
no space continue add some more things
you can also get the index for a
character you're searching for so I'll
call this character index and to do so
use the function CHR and if you're not
remembering this is where all these
functions were defined up here okay so
I'm going to go string four and then
you're going to put a dollar sign and
then the string that you are
specifically looking for inside of there
and I can go character index and execute
that you can see it shows up in the
third spot which is this okay likewise
you're going to be going to be able to
get a substring of a string by defining
the starting index where you want to
start and then the number of characters
there after you'd like to receive so
let's go and call this string five and
this is substring and you can go string
four and let's say I want to start at
the eight index and I want to get six
letters to there after
works or six whatever characters and
then lets out put that on the screen in
there we oh and there you can see string
pops back you're also going to be able
to get the index of a string so let's
call this string index like that and we
go to string and what we're going to be
searching for is string for and what
we're specifically looking for is string
two and get our string index and now
that is shows up at 14 and for the final
two examples of things you can do with
strings let's say we also wanted to do
upper case we went upper case every
single one of those characters we can do
that and random string pops up and then
we're also going to be able to likewise
go to lower and there you can save in
things lower case alright so there's a
rundown of a lot of things you can do
with strings inside of our Lang and now
I'm going to talk about tuples now a
tuple is going to be able to hold
multiple values so what we're going to
do here is define another function I'm
gonna call this tuple stuff and I'm
gonna define a tuple so let's just call
this my data and you're going to put
this between curly brackets so I'm going
to put 40 to 175 and 6.25 you can use
different types of data as well and then
we can come in here and get the data
just by going my data and you can see it
output there on the screen you're also
going to be able to store values inside
of another tuple so we can come in here
and go something like a B and C and then
reference our tuple here and then output
the value of C in this situation you can
see 6.25 shoots back there you're also
going to be able to use what are called
anonymous variables to match a pattern
so let's just come in here and do
another one of these an anonymous
variable basically is an underscore so
you're going to put if you don't care
about something you don't want the data
back just put these underscores inside
of there and there's my data and then
here we can output the value of D and
you can see 42 popped back you're also
going to be able to use an atom as the
key for a value and this is what we call
a tagged tuple so let's go my data
- equal to and we can put Heights inside
of here which is the atom and then 6.25
and then after that we could go height
and let's just call this HT is equal to
and my data - and then I'll put the
height on the screen and there you go
alright so there's some things we can do
with two bowls so now I'm going to look
at lists so I put list stuff inside of
there and there's list stuff and
basically lists are going to contain
multiple values from any data type so
let's go into final lists list 1 is
equal to 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
and let's define another one list 2 is
equal to 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 now you're going to be
able to join lists so let's go and
create another list list 3 and you can
do that just by using the plus + sign
and there's list 2 and let's go an
output list 3 here on the screen
and there you can see join those
together you're also going to be able to
subtract a list from a list so we can go
list 3 with just putting - - and
subtract everything that was in list 1
out of that guy and then we can output
list for here on the screen it's done so
there that is look there we go
you're also going to be able to retrieve
elements and in this situation what I
want to receive is the head or the first
element inside of our list so we'll go
list for likewise you'll be able to
receive the tail by going TL and we'll
do that for list for as well here we can
just execute that guy now you can see
grabbed the for would have come back to
the head and the 5 and 6 come back to
the tail and you're going to be doing a
lot of things like that
using Erlang you're also going to be
able to add a value to a list using
something called the cons operator so
I'm going to go list 5 is equal to and
I'm going to go 3 and then list for like
that and then if we output list 5 on the
screen
you can see that 3 is now in there in
the top position
side of the list and then finally you're
going to be able to get to the head and
the tail from list and like I said
you'll be doing a lot of this lately or
later on so go ahead and entail is equal
to list five and in this situation I'll
just get the head and not put that and
there you can see three pops back okay
so a bunch of things we can do in less
now let's go and take a look at
something more interesting which is list
comprehensions so I'm calling this guy
LC stuff for list comprehensions now
list comprehensions are going to make it
very easy for us to manipulate lists so
let's go and create a list to go and
show you an example of that so let's
just have one two and three inside of
this guy let's say we want to multiply
every list item by two it's pretty easy
to do we can just go list two is equal
to and then we are going to define what
operation we want to perform put two of
those pipes inside of there and then
we're going to define the temporary name
for each list item that's going to be
pulled out of the list one by one grab
that like that and then we can output
the new results that we have here and
there you can see it when multiplied all
those by two okay so we do even cooler
things let's say that we would like to
come in here and add conditions like for
example we want to get a list and we
only want the even values from it let's
go and create list three and just one
two three and four and then we'll go and
create list four which is going to be
nothing but my events plan go and put
those two pipes in there and then N and
then we're going to be pulling this out
of list three and then we can define our
conditions so we'll say n remainder of
the division using two if that comes
back out as equal to zero
well then we know it's an even value and
then we can bin here and output the list
itself and there you can see it grabbed
only the even values okay we're also
going to be able to do things like
search through a list of tuples so let's
say we want to do something like city
weather and this is going to be a
list of tuples so we'll put Pittsburgh
inside of here that's going to be an
atom and then we'll put New York inside
it it's going to be an atom also but I'm
going to put a space inside of it so I'm
going to go and surround that with
quotes and we're just going to throw
different temperatures inside of here
let's go and put Charlotte's say it's 68
and we'll throw Miami and we'll say that
that is 78 okay so then close that off
and then let's say that we want to go in
here and we want to find every place
that has a temperature over I don't know
65 so we can say great temp is equal to
and what we need to do is define city
and temperature which is what we're
going to be putting the information into
so there's the pipe and city and temp
and reference the different things that
we'd like to work with and what we're
going to do here is we're going to go
City weather reference that list of two
bulls and then we're going to define our
condition we are looking for temperature
greater than or equal to 65 put that
inside of there close that off and then
let's go and see what our results are so
in just go a little grate temp and it's
going to give us everything that matches
up with that condition you can see back
Charlotte and Miami pop back okay so
there's a whole bunch of different ways
or things you can do with list
comprehensions of course there's many
more and as this tutorial continues I'm
going to touch on a couple more but now
I want to talk about pipe conversions
very briefly okay so I change this to
type stuff and basically you're going to
be able to use is followed by all of
these different data types to see if
what is contained inside the parentheses
is actually going to match up with that
or not so we can go like this we execute
this to see how this works out so we'll
go
Tutt and you can see that that comes
back is true and if you did this with
all the other individual pieces you'd
see that this is an easy way to figure
out what
Atta type any of these different
variables would be you're also going to
have a whole bunch more of these guys
you're going to be able to convert
basically from one to the other just by
using whatever you want to convert from
to what you want to convert to so atom
to binary atom to list and
da-da-da-da-da and you can see right
here is a complete list of all of the
different things you will be able to
convert to as well as back away from
okay and just to show you an example of
how we can do this let's come in here
and create list 1 and go integer to list
and then let's throw 21 inside of there
and here we can just go list 1 and if we
execute that you can see the 21 pops
back alright so I just wanted to show
those off here real quick without
getting into a bunch of detail and now I
want to talk about something extremely
important in our line which is recursion
now recursion is the act of a function
calling itself and basically those
things you normally accomplish with
looping in other languages as you're
going to see here in a moment are going
to be solved using recursion with Erlang
so let me come in here and just do a
simple type of idea here that we
normally use whenever we're basically
going over recursion and how recursion
works so I'm going to do I'm going to
find a factorial so I'm going to call
this fine factorial and what I'm going
to pass inside of here is going to be 3
and then let's just go and copy this guy
right here and let's work this out using
recursion so fine factorial down inside
of here then what I'm going to do let's
go and do it before the fine factorial
I'm going to go factorial we're going to
receive a value and then what we're
going to do is we're going to define a
condition here so I'm going to say when
n is a value of 0 what we were going to
return in that situation is a 1 whenever
you're dealing with recursion there
always has to be an exit spot and this
is going to handle that situation then
what we're going to do is actually
define the recursive act here so we're
going to say when and
is greater than zero what we're going to
do in that situation is we're going to
take n and multiply it times and we're
going to call factorial once again and n
minus 1 and if you've never seen this
before
I will explain it here and in just a
second so now what we're going to do is
we're going to go find factorial and
we're going to say let's go through a
little X inside of here and we're going
to say Y is equal to factorial and X and
then I'm going to output this on the
screen so I'm going to f rights like
this and factorial throw a new line
inside of there and output the value of
y all righty
now let's tab this in again let's run it
and then I'll explain exactly what's
going on there you can see the factorial
comes back as 6 basically what happened
here is our first run-through as you can
see right here we're getting a value of
3 it's going to say when N is equal to a
which would be 3 in this situation is
equal to 0 well that doesn't work so
let's just ignore that then we come down
in this situation when n is greater than
0 which it is it's 3 when it's getting
passed in in that situation we're going
to multiply 3 times factorial and then
we're going to call factorial again and
we're going to pass a 2 inside here so
you can see right here when we pass the
3 and it goes 3 and this goes up - well
guess what that F 2 is then down here so
what's going to happen the twos coming
in so we're going to go two times
function of f 1 again we're going to
take F 1 which is down here 1 comes in
we're going to go 1 times F 0 what's
this going to return it's going to
return a 1 why because of this guy right
here which gives us a value of 1 that's
going to be sent up here place right
there we're going to multiply 2 times 1
get a value of 2 that's going to go up
there multiply 3 times 2 is equal to 6
and that gives you your final result ok
so a simple example of recursion as I'm
guessing you probably I've already seen
let's go in here and do a whole bunch
more let's go and create another
function this guy's just simply going to
be called sum and it's going to receive
a list and it's going to sum all the
values inside of it so the list as this
guy's going to receive it's just going
to be 1 2 and 3 and then I'm going to go
sum and define our conditions
go say if the array is emptier if the
list is empty I should say well then
we're going to return a value of zero
and then we will define our recursive
act here we're going to grab the head
and the tail and then as we cycle
through the list that's passed inside
here I'm going to take the head and then
add it to whatever sum plus the tail is
and as you can see it's going to pull
the head off of there then pass the tail
what you're going to do pull the head
off past the tail and it's going to
continue doing that over and over again
until there is nothing left in the tail
and then everything will exit and then
we will have the sum of our list values
if we come in here and we are on it and
I'll show you an example if this doesn't
quite make sense and you can see a value
of six comes back why is that
once again we're calling some we're
passing in the complete list which is
going to contain one two and three it's
going to grab the head in this situation
which is going to be one right like that
and then pass two and three into the sum
which is then going to drop off the two
which is then going to pass the three
which is then going to give us one plus
two plus three plus sum of nothing which
is going to give us a value of zero we
could just put zero inside of there if
we would be so inclined and that is how
we come back with a final answer of six
okay so another situation which we're
using recursion and to a certain extent
list comprehensions let's go and take
another look at this because we can do
something that's called tail recursive
and in this situation what we're going
to do is instead of holding up the
additions like we're doing here what
we're going to do is keep a running
count as we run through this guy so we
just have to make a couple little
changes here up here which has changed
this too now it's just leave it Google -
name of sum here what we're going to do
though is instead of just the list we're
also going to have our running tally
which is going to be that guy right
there and what this is going to return
when it's all done is the final value of
sum once again we're going to do the
same thing down here let's go and have
this be a multi-line function though
instead and then let's go and output
some information inside here so let's go
iÃ¶ so we can see the value change as
it's being run
Saltillo says some you'll see the
changing value of some as more and more
of these guys come through there let's
go some once again close that off and
then we're going to be calling some
again and in this situation we'll get
the tail and head Plus and we'll add
that to our sum once again we come down
here and we can run this guy and there
you can see we got the same answer of
six just like we did before
now Erlang doesn't contain four loops
but you could actually create one I'll
show you how to do it using these same
recursive tricks so in this situation
when I have a function it's going to be
called for and it's going to receive the
maximum value we want to count up to and
where we're going to start from now
we'll come in here and define that so
I'm going to go for and we go zero and
then I don't care about the next thing
that gets passed inside of there so just
put that inside of there and in this
situation this is just going to return
okay now it comes time for our for loop
so I'm going to say Max and min values
we're going to be working with and then
I'm going to say when Max is greater
than zero so as long as that condition
is true I'm going to continue doing what
I'm doing here in the for loop so in
this situation I'll go F right and I'm
going to just type out these values as
they decrement so thoughts and let's put
them on separate lines and then I can
come in and go max once again and then
we couldn't call for once again and you
can see how we're using recursion to
basically do what we would normally do
in other languages so max one and then
the data and we can run that guy and
there you can see it decremented those
values from 3 to 2 to 1 and then it
print it out ok all right
so this time we can do a little bunch of
different things with occurs and we're
going to do some more with recursion as
the tutorial continues but now I want to
take a look at maps now a map is a
grouping of key value pairs and so it's
going to find one who's going to say
let's say Bob is the name of this they
start off with a hash symbol and let's
say we want to have the key be first
name
going to put a little arrow inside of
there and we're going to define that
this is bulb then we come in and go
ellipse go last name and put the arrow
inside of there again and have this be
Smith now we're going to be able to all
kinds of things with it so we can get
the the value that is assigned to a key
for example so we'll just put first name
inside of here
and throw in a newline and how we're
going to be able to get that is call
maps and get and what we're looking for
which is the F name first name for ball
that's the key for that and run it and
you can see first name ball comes back
there like we would have guessed let's
go get a copy of this because we're
going to do a whole bunch of these guys
we could get all the keys so let's just
get rid of this here all together and to
do that we'll just come in and once
again we're going to have maps except in
this situation we'll go to change that
to keys and then we'll just have this be
ball and you can see right there we got
all of the keys we're also going to be
able to get all of the values just by
changing this from keys into values we
can execute that again and there you see
we've got our values we're also going to
be able to return everything except the
key that we designate that we do not
want and to do that we can say remove
and we'll put L name inside of here and
Bob's where we're going to be getting
the information from again you can see
we got the first name but not the last
name that we designated we're also going
to be able to come in here and check if
a key exists by going maps and find and
first name and Bob and you can see it
comes back yes indeed Bob is in there
and we could also come in and put a key
value into the map and to do that we
could just go maps and put and we'll put
address inside of here and one two three
main and where we want to put it which
is inside a Bob and we can execute that
and you will see that the address is in
there along with the first name and the
last name okay so run down to things
we can do with maps now let's take a
look at records so I'm going to change
this a record stuff and change this to
record stuff now basically with a record
you're going to be able to define a
custom type that's going to contain
multiple different fields and to do this
let's come in here and define a record
I'm going to go
record and customer and then what I want
to have inside of here is the field for
name which is going to have a default
nothing it's going to be empty and then
let's say that they have some sort of
balance with our store okay and it's
going to be 0 by default ok so there you
go you just defined a record now inside
of record stuff let's do stuff with it
so it's going to find a customer so
we'll go Sally is equal to and we can
reference our customer record and then
follow that up by giving or passing in
the name so it's going to be Sally Smith
and then we can define her balance as
being equal to 1 let's say she owes us
$100 we're also going to be able to come
in and change the data so we could say
Sally 2 is equal to Sally and reference
the customer again and change our
balance to 50 and then of course we can
come and output this information and we
do this just by going P owes which is
going to be her name and how much money
she owes us P and then we'll put a new
line inside of there and then to pull
information out from there we just go
Sally - and customer and name and then
to get the additional information we can
say Sally - and once again customer and
balance and we can double check that the
balance changed which we know it did and
we run it and it says Sally Smith o is
those $50 ok so a real brief example of
Records of course the whole idea this
tutorial is just to get you accustomed
to seeing working examples of how to
work with this stuff and now I want to
talk about another important concept
which are higher order
functions okay so functions that can
receive other functions as a parameter
are known as higher-order functions and
what we're going to do here is to define
couple so let's go and to find a
function that multiplies every item by
two so we'll say we'll call this double
and it receives an X and we'll just x
times two all right oops
there we are x times two now let's go
and create another one and this is going
to multiply times three so let's call
this triple triple and then we'll change
that to three now what we want to do is
we want to be able to receive a list of
numbers and both multiply all of them by
two and also multiply them times three
so we're going to call this do math - so
do math - and then we'll come in here
and define how it's going to work so go
to math - and then I'm going to go list
and map now map is going to take a
function and then apply that function to
every item inside of a list and to do so
we're going to use something called fun
which is going to be used to assign a
function to a variable so we'll go list
and map and fun and double which is the
guy we define right here and how many
attributes does it get it's one so we're
going to put that inside of there and
then we're going to find our list right
like that now what we can do is come in
and also call the triple function so
come in paste that inside of there and
this is triple instead and we'll just
have the same exact list passed inside
of there and we're going to store that
up and we can come in and we can run it
and you can see that it gave us three
six nine and of course if we got rid of
this guy and save that like that we
could then command and run that guy and
just double those values okay so that's
an example of a higher-order function
but we're going to do some more stuff
here it's also come in and I'm going to
create another function inside of here
and this is going to be called fun stuff
just so you can see more examples of the
how we're going to use this and what
this is going to do
pass my name inside of there and you're
actually going to be able to use fun to
define anonymous functions so we're
going to go and define fun stuff it's
going to receive something and then I'm
going to go fun stuff equal to fun and
I'm going to put some information on the
screen so f right and what this is going
to do is just go hello and whatever the
name is it's going to pass that out on
the screen so you have like this like
that and then at the end of it we'll
just put end and a comma and then after
that we can say fun stuff okay so save
that up and run it and you can see hello
Derrick pops back alright something else
that's interesting let's go and do fun
stuff too and let's just have it do
nothing you're also going to be able to
access values that are outside of your
function so let's go let's just change
this the fun stuff to like that get rid
of this guy right there get rid of all
this stuff right there and then we're
going to go X is equal to 3 and then Y
is equal to 4 and then Z is going to be
equal to and here is a function and it's
going to be able to access all of those
values outside of the function we're
going to do is go f rights and we'll go
some tilt P new line and we'll be able
to go X plus y call end on that and then
bounce down here and call the Z function
and if we run it you can see that's the
sum comes back at seven okay so a couple
neat little examples there now I want to
take a look at file i/o now I'm going to
create a function that is going to be
called write text and it's going to pass
in a string called rights to the file
and then let's come down here and define
this function so we'll go write text
it's going to receive a string that's
going to write to a file what we want to
do here is get a file handler that we're
going to use to write to our file how
you do that is you go OK and file
handler and we're going to say file what
we want to do here before we want to
write to it well we want to open it
so open or created if it doesn't exist
already so there is our text file and
then we need to define what we're doing
well we're writing or overriding what
might already be there then what we need
to do is write this text to our file
that we have open so there that is file
handler and new and then we're going to
close off that function well we'd also
like to probably be able to come in here
and append data to it so let's go and
create another one of these throw that
inside of there we'll call this write
text too and that just means it's not
going to overwrite and to not overwrite
but instead to append data to us we're
going to type append in there and we're
going to leave right be exactly the same
and let's go and call write text to once
again so we'll copy that out of there
paste that in there write text to and
then we'll just do something like more
text to the file and what's the point of
writing all this information if we can't
read it so we're going to create another
function that's going to be called read
text and first thing we have to do is
get read permission on this so we go
okay and the file that we're working
with and go file open and what are we
going to do well we're going to go and
get my file out of this guy so let's
just get this paste that there what are
we doing this time we're reading so to
put read inside of there and then we
just need to read the texts and store it
inside of a string so there's words and
to get the text out of the file we just
go read and you're going to put file
inside of there and 124 times 124 to
find sizes at that information and we're
going to go F right and let's output the
information that we want to or that we
have stored in the file do that's that's
just like we always have been doing and
then we'll just reference words and of
course we need to call the read text up
here so they'll read text and we'll see
all this stuff work so oops main whoops
and I add a little air and there I get
to get rid of that period put a colon
inside of there instead and likewise
change that period right there to a
colon as well and don't forget to put
your little column up here say little
things like that was totally slippy up
and run man and there you can see right
to the file more text to a file
okay so we wrote to the file and we went
and read from the file so that's how we
do file i/o now let's take a look at
exception handling
now basically exception handling like
I'm sure you know it's just going to
allow our program to handle errors
rather than just crashing and I'm just
going to provide a very simple example
you'll be able to expound upon from this
point I'll go and do two examples
actually I'm going to call function
that's going to be called error stuff
and it's going to pass in a value of
zero we're going to try to do a division
by zero all right so what we're going to
do here inside of arrows stuff or error
stuff anyway
is we're of course going to receive
parameter or an attribute inside of here
now where you think an error may occur
you're going to put a try and you're
going to put the code that could cause
an error inside of there so we're going
to do is going to take two and divide it
by whatever they passed inside of here
and they passed in something good we
will then provide the answer otherwise
we're going to then come down here and
find catch and we're going to list the
error that we are looking to catch so
that is going to be a bad arithmetic
error and then after here we can list
what the error is can't divide by zero
and then after we're done we can go end
okay if we run it you're going to see
what does can't divide by zero comes
back and it would pass something inside
of here that actually does make sense
we'll say the throw a for inside of
there in that situation it will just do
it and not throw the error of course
let's do another one let's say you
wanted to do a catch all with these guys
let's go and say we wanted to do
let's do file i/o because we just did
that we'll go read text too and then
we're going to go and define that here
so we'll go read text to throw it inside
of a try block and then inside of here
we're going to try to read a file just
like we did previously in this situation
though instead of my file I'm going to
call for mile five my
file1 which doesn't exist and what I
want to do is I want to catch any error
that could potentially occur with trying
to read the file and in this situation
trying to read a file that doesn't exist
so to catch everything that could
potentially go wrong put an underscore
colon and an underscore that's going to
catch all errors and we know that more
than likely if we're trying to open a
file for reading and we get an error
that means file doesn't exist so in that
situation we'll distance a file doesn't
exist if indeed the file doesn't exist
and then we'll come out of here and type
in end and we'll run it again and there
you can see file doesn't exist pops in
all right so cool stuff or you know of
course you can change that to my file
like we did before but and main and data
and you can see that it comes and writes
or reads it okay so cool stuff now I'd
like to talk about macros now macros
provide for inline code replacement and
it's probably better just to see an
example here to see exactly how that
works so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to define the macro which is going
to be XR ad and then it's going to get
two parameters passed inside of it x and
y and then afterwards I'm going to
define exactly what's going to happen
with x and y inside of this okay so now
what we're going to be able to do let's
go up here and let's define macros stuff
macros stuff like that and then let's go
and create macro stuff so macro stuff
and this is going to receive X&amp;amp;Y and
then what we need to do here is to use
our macro so we're going to go out right
okay till the P and a new line inside of
here and then to call for our macro
we're going to put a question mark
inside of there and then add and x and y
now you normally want to do something
that's simple with a macro but you know
I'm just using this as an example you
have this would be much more complicated
okay now for macro stuff come up here
and do five and six in there and then
we'll come down here and run this guy
and you can see that 11 comes back
alright so real brief example macros
just wanted to definitely cover that and
now I'm going to provide you with some
simple examples on
concurrency okay so concurrency is when
several processes are going to execute
at the same time and potentially
interact and as long as the processes
aren't dependent on each other they can
run at the same time so for example if
you had one process that its only
purpose was to count to one million and
another word that purpose was to
calculate pi these are going to be
things or processes that are not
dependent if on the other hand you had
one processes that job was to sort an
engine and another process that was had
a a job of driving a car well obviously
they're independent you have to start
the engine before you can drive the car
so what I'm going to do here is just
give you a very very simple example here
and this should get you going to
learning more about concurrency so I'm
going to have a git ID and stuff right
and let's see what I'm going to do with
this maybe this will work maybe the
whole time am I going to yeah yeah I'll
call it alright so each process is going
to have an ID and let's go and pull this
out of here and let's be M so this whole
point of this is just to get the ID of
the process and output it so I'm going
to create a function called spawner and
what this guy is going to do is spawn a
process and the process in this
situation is going to call for get ID to
run so we're going to define that so it
gets ID and then self is going to give
us our ID if I spell it properly so so
and then you're going to put ends at the
end of that and then up inside of here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
call spawner a couple times so you get a
spawner and spawner why don't I go call
it three times just so you can see it
all right and spawner you're going to
see that there is going to be three
processes running and there you can see
are those three processes okay so really
really simple let's go and do something
a little bit more complicated might
remember this guy from before this is
our for loop and what I want to do is I
want to take this code
I want to start two different processes
and have them count in different
directions okay so we got that guy and
we're going to call this spawn or two
just to change the name of this and get
that like that and you'll be able to see
now how these processes take turns and
execute code so when you go spawn or two
and we're going to have a max value and
a minimum value passed inside of it and
then it sort of just going to execute so
we're just like before we're going to
spawn and we're going to define what we
want to happen here so we're going to go
for two and it's going to get a max and
a min value and end and how these are
going to differ is going to be based off
of the information that's passed inside
so this guy right here is going to be
counting down from 50 to one while this
guy right here is going to be counting
down well from 100 to 51 okay so a
little bit different and when I run it
you'll be able to see how they trade
places back and forth and uh Oh change
this before to got a little bit of an
error there not a big deal save that all
right and come over here and run it and
dented up the dot and there you can see
they're counting their way through and
after they are all finished trading
places and counting and counting countin
we can cycle up through here and see
exactly what was going on so here we are
back at the very very beginning that the
there we are and you can see fifty one
hundred forty nine ninety nine forty
eight ninety eight forty seven ninety
seven and so forth and so on
so they execute those two processes and
they basically take turns spitting out
the results or performing the actions
that I told them I wanted them alrighty
so there you go guys that is a run down
a lot of things you can do with Erlang
and hopefully it's sort of cleared up
how to accomplish things using Erlang
that you can already do in other
