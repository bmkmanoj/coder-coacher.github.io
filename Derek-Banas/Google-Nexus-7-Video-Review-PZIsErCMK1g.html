7 I thought it would be fun to go
through here because I normally don't
review anything but I felt compelled
because I'm so happy with this purchase
I had the original iPad but I never
upgraded and over excessive use my
battery is basically pretty much dead on
my iPad so I just came to the conclusion
whether i should go and fork out four
hundred to five hundred dollars for a
new iPad or whether I should spend 200
dollars for the Nexus 7 and I'm very
happy that I went with the nexus 7 not
only do they save money but it is just a
speed name it's just beautiful thing so
since you're on YouTube one of the
things that's vastly improved over the
ipad is the YouTube application you can
see I can just very very quickly zoom
through anything that I'm following in
regards to channels there's all the
other different channels that I'm
following and pretty much the only thing
that's flawed about this is it is
impossible to return comments that
people post on your own videos but in
regards to actually surfing through
content far superior to the ipad so
that's the first thing it's awesome
every news aggregator that you could
ever want for the most part is available
on Android definitely all the big ones
they are available here and they look
just as nice as they do on the iPad you
have all your different social network
applications and some of the ones you
might not be familiar with you have
chrome of course just like you have on
the iPad and it works pretty much
exactly the same the email is extremely
snappy and because of the size of this
guy it is extremely easy to come in here
and actually start replying to email so
this
one and iPad I never could type that
fast it's I can just reach everything's
right here that's what's so awesome
about the size of this guy and let's
just kill that see it's really easy to
come in here if I want to just select
multiple different messages and click on
the trash can and delete them everything
is very very easy to use want to jump
back to the home screen just hit this
center button right here one thing
that's kind of weird is yes it doesn't
rotate and on top of that yes this
camera up here is pretty much worthless
and just to reinforce that there's a
whole bunch of apps that are out there
being the camera app which is free you
know you might as well get it actually
the pictures are not bad if you take
them outside but if you take them
anywhere except in bright sunlight
they're going to be very very bad and
they're low resolution so you won't be
able to print them out pro capture in my
opinion is a complete waste as is
perfectly clear these are supposedly
applications gonna allow this guy to
take good pictures guess what they don't
work after focus and also pick shop
light it also tools that are supposed to
fix these nasty images they just don't
work I mean if you're looking for taking
pictures yes isn't the way to go but for
the most part a tablets not meant for
that anyway also you have currents which
is a google specific android specific
news aggregator and it works pretty good
in general and you can put a bunch of
different things inside of here i prefer
the other aggregators that i normally
would use but if you know you're into
this type of thing it's definitely
something that's usable if you want to
close applications just click down here
on on this little guy right here and
just rule simply there they are they're
all getting closed quickly if you want
to see games this guy is awesome if you
want a tablet just four games this is
the way to go in my opinion this is dead
trigger which is a pretty intensive game
and you can see this guy can handle it
on its highest settings with no problems
at all you saw how easily I load it into
this guy bounced around I'm sort of
doing us looking through my camera
that's why I might be doing some silly
stuff but you could say even when it's
high settings and got loads extremely
fast the turning is extremely fast and
because you're not holding this gigantic
thing in your hand like you do with the
ipad i found first-person shooters just
about impossible on an ipad on this guy
there and freeze I mean it's just like
the perfect size for playing around with
this type of stuff so that was dead
trigger really cool game and then you
have if you want to get into other
intensive things you could drive Riptide
I actually haven't really played this
but either way you can just come in here
is another intensive games pretty cool
yeah click ok whatever and there I go
you can see the water effects and
there's absolutely zero zero zero lag I
mean it's just this is the perfect
gaming device I mean it's just that
simple just really really cool ok so
let's pause that get out of it you can
see just how snappy it is boom boom boom
I'm off doing something else you have
the Notification Center which you just
do this it's awesome it shows you all
the different things that are going on
Twitter interactions that it uh you can
want to know what the weather is just
click on it no problem of course the
voice assistant is absolutely awesome
far superior to Siri and I just said far
superior to Syria and you could say it
just gave me superior groceries didn't
mean to do that but for example let's
say I want to see something about a
sports team pittsburgh pirates and is it
going to rain tomorrow and the really
cool thing you can do this is awesome it
just works and it's just google now all
you do is click down here and go up like
that and it automatically opens up for
its beautiful so that's really cool so
let's get rid of that it's awesome it's
like one of the best features I mean
there's a lot of features that are
pretty cool that's why i'm doing this
video because i just really really love
this guy if you want to see all your
apps you just click down here and
there's every single app on the whole
entire device it's available and if you
would want to get a app just to show you
here or the type of apps are available
pretty much anything on the ipad that
you would want to get for the most part
is available on this guy so you can come
in here and talk page there's an of
course there's a lot of different things
in here you don't normally see on the
iPad because there's a lot of live
wallpaper type things but you can see
Angry Birds where we go to cut the rope
dadadada da pretty much anything that
you would ever want to buy on the ipad
is surprisingly enough available on an
android device which is really cool
there's calendar you can use google
translate which i actually use a lot
because I talked to people a lot of
times out of languages I only speak one
so let's say that I want to
from English to Spanish where is the
restaurant see if I turn the volume up
and there you go it speaks in other
different languages which is really cool
instagram of course is on here which is
really cool because i never had
instagram in the past and all this is
really neat you want to bounce back and
forth there's my different pictures that
i have all weird sort of strange things
but either way so that's also pretty
cool another thing is I hear air video
server is not available on Android and
they are right it isn't but it is
available on something called omit this
allows you to stream content from any of
your computers you just come in here
easily enough video click on this click
on that and you have to pay three
dollars to get the streaming but you
know it's worth it and you can see
there's breaking bad that's just stream
directly from my computer so there's
another thing that's really cool about
it there's a whole bunch of really cool
things and just give you a real brief
run-through say one of the only weird
things about it is because this guy is
so potent in regards to how much powers
involved in it if you do use a pretty
strong application that's intensive this
will get a little bit warm but like burn
yourself warm but you can feel it I mean
if you really want to go out there so
basically Google Nexus 7 the camera
sucks the processor is beautiful it is a
perfect gaming tablet I mean it's as
good as anything I've ever tried feel
free to leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
