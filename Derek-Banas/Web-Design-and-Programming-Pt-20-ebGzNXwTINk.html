20 of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm going to step back
into the web design and programming
tutorial obviously which is an overview
of all the languages needed to design
robust web applications and you can see
a link to the previous video to this one
on the left side of your screen and on
the right side of your screen you can
see the link to the PHP security
tutorial which I was working on prior to
this which I will most definitely be
getting back to very soon but today
we're going to talk about how to create
cookies and sessions and I'm also
briefly going to talk about the server
global variable because it's kind of
important in regards to security but
first onto cookies on the left side you
see I just have some junk HTML well if
you want to set a cookie which is just a
variable that you want to store on the
computer of the client that visits your
website what you do you have to always
do this ahead of all of your HTML code
unless output buffering is on but I'm
not going to get into output buffering
today that's for a later tutorial
so just think this always has to be done
first so we're going to define ourself a
cookie and how we do it is call the
setcookie function and then we're going
to pass the name that we want to assign
to our cookie and then we want to pass a
value that we want to store in the
cooking you store any value that you
want and then you have to define exactly
how long this cookie is going to survive
and you can do that with the time
function this is a definition of the
life of the cookie based off of seconds
well time is going to get you your
current time and then what you have to
do is just come in here and calculate
how long we want this to survive so
let's say that we want this to survive
for exactly one week well what we would
do is put a 60 in here because there's
60 seconds in a minute and then we put
another 60 in here because there are 60
minutes in an hour and then we would put
a 24 in there because there's 24 hours
in a day and then we will put a 7
because there's seven days in a week
so that would make this survive for
exactly one week and yes this is a very
common way to define how long it should
exist and there are a bunch of other
things that we can also define inside of
here inside of this cookie for example
we could also define a path on the
server
that would allow us to access this
cookie so let's say we want to restrict
access to the value of this cookie to
only scripts on our server well what we
would do is put exactly what I have here
on the screen forward slash surrounded
by quotes but then if we want this to
actually make any sense we have to
define the domain that we want to be
able to access the values of these
cookies and this also has to be in
quotes and let's say that I just want
this data to be available to my website
that's exactly what I would do of course
he was all be separated with commas and
if I would want this to be available to
any subdomains of my website I would put
a period before that and of course if I
don't want any restrictions then I would
not put anything there another thing is
you can define that you only want this
value to be transmitted on secure HTTP
connection so I'm going to get more into
that later if that's true you want to
put true inside of here and also if you
want to restrict access to this
information so that javascript files or
any scripting languages won't be able to
get ahold of this you would come in here
and type HCV only followed by the value
of true so those are all the different
values that you can set inside of this
guy but we're just going to simply put
in what we got here and of course all
those values can be set by a hacker so
none of that secure and then no way are
you really securing yourself by doing
any of that stuff so what we did was we
created a cookie called cookie var gave
it a value of 100 and said that we want
it to exist for a week now we're going
to come in here save as and I'm going to
jump into my web server and I'm going to
give this a name of create cookie dot
PHP and save and if I come over here and
run it you can see that there's nothing
displayed on a screen that's because I
didn't tell it to display anything on
the screen to display anything on a
screen I actually have to call for the
value of that cookie I'm going to show
you how to do that here now I'm going to
create a file that is going to go in
here and access the value of this cookie
so I'm going to call this get the cookie
all right
cookie monster would love this all right
so how you get the value that you stored
previously in a cookie is of course find
your PHP area and of course for security
reasons you would want to check that the
he actually exists and this by the way
is a global way to access values that
are stored in cookies and then you just
put in here cookie var because that's
the name that we told it we wanted our
cookie to be represented with and then
we're going to come in here and if that
value is set we're going to store the
value in a variable and I'm really doing
this to show you exactly how to store
the cookie and a variable no other real
reason and then I'm going to echo out
the screen catenate this onto the end
cookie and then I'll put an else
statement in here right like that and
then close off my PHP scripting area now
if I we file save this and I'm going to
call it get cookies PHP and click Save
and if I call that script you can see
that it shoots out the value the cookie
value is 100 and that's what I set it to
before and that's pretty much all there
is to know about cookies except for how
to delete them well what I'm going to do
is I'm going to come in here and create
another PHP scripting area remember if
I'm changing the cook you have to call
that before I do anything else and one
way to delete the value is to just come
in and give it a value of 0 and another
way to do it is let's say I want to put
in the absolute opposite expiration date
that I put in before I'm just going to
put time and so on here followed by 60
times 60 times 24 times 7 close that off
followed by a semicolon and then let's
close off our PHP scripting area and if
we file save that jump over here we're
actually gonna have to reload this twice
and you can see no value found and the
reason that popped up there is because
what I have right here and that's pretty
much what you need to know about cookies
except for sessions and a session is a
file that's stored on the web server and
we figure out which session belongs to
which user by setting a cookie and of
course we want that ID stored in the
cookie to be as complicated as possible
and not easily guessed
and there's actually a function called
session start that does that for you and
I'm going to get more into how to hack
sessions in a later tutorial here I'm
just simply going to show you how to
create a session so I'm going to come in
here and go file new this is just a
basic text editing tool there's nothing
fancy at all about this
called TextWrangler you can use any
other tool you want and I'm gonna give
this the title create a session and then
again just like with cookies if you want
to create a session you have to do it
before any other HTML code so I'm going
to come in here open this guy up and
what session start does is it will
either go in and look for an appropriate
session ID and if one does not exist it
will create one and there you go so all
you need to do to create that now I'm
going to jump down into the body section
and if I want to set a value for this
session you can create as many as you
want unlike with cookies where you have
a twenty maximum cookie limit with
sessions you can create as many as you
want because why they're stored on the
server so let's say I wanted to store my
first name right like that that's
exactly how I would do it close off that
PHP and then we're going to open up
another one echo hello session right
like that jump over here and then let's
save this as great session dot PHP right
like that now let's jump over here and
you can see it pulled that value out and
that is the simplicity that is sessions
and I'm going to get into a lot of the
more complicated things whenever we
start talking about how to hack sessions
in my upcoming PHP security tutorial but
there are a bunch of other things other
global variables and the last one I talk
about is the server global variable and
some of the tricky little bits of
information that you'd be able to get
from it and we're just going to come in
here and click echo and I'll show you
how to get the server address since I'm
on localhost this isn't going to be all
that exciting all this information is
stored for the most part any time
information is passed then I'm going to
actually copy this guy and I'm going to
show you kind of six little neat things
say I want the server name all of the
server software which would be very
helpful to a computer hacker to know
what he was working with in regards to
the web server being used in any modules
attached to that guy HTTP host which
often contains a lot of interesting
header content sometimes you can find
out which website the person was on
prior to coming to you
or web address and also you can get the
client IP address which is also kind of
interesting if you want to fight against
hackers so here we're going to get the
server address once a server name let me
just come in here and type name in
instead want to find out what software
is being used meaning the web server and
any modules attached to it HTTP
underscore host might get me some header
information might tell me what website
they came from before they came to see
me and is going to show me the IP
address for the location of the person
is currently looking at my web site and
if I save that jump over here you can
see all the information we are able to
get this is localhost that's why server
address is shown as one here otherwise
it would show the server address for the
site that I'm currently on again server
name localhost you can see all the
interesting information it was able to
gather in regards to the web server as
well as the modules attached to it so if
they wanted to attack in different
languages this pretty much tells them
exactly how to do it and some security
information again localhost here there
is nothing defined and the reason why is
the web website that I came from to come
to this one did not pass this
information along that is something the
only way you're going to get it is if
they pass that information along and for
the most part most websites don't do it
but it's still neat information that's
why I put it on there and then you can
see here the client IP address which is
also one which is the same as this and
remember this would be the client IP
address for the person who's visiting
your website so hope that is helpful to
you if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
