49 of my java video tutorial series
today we're going to have another fun
tutorial today I'm going to show you how
to implement a little brush set here as
well as setup the lines like we talked
about before draw ellipses draw squares
and also as an added little feature here
or of course going to still have the
color changing there we're also going to
be able to set transparencies and do a
ton of other different things and on top
of that based off of everything I cover
in this tutorial you're pretty much
gonna be able to implement anything you
could possibly ever imagine in a paint
application so let's get into the code
now this is all the code from the
previous tutorial and if you didn't
watch it you absolutely should watch it
because I explain all of this stuff in
that tutorial so that's part 48 and
there's a link above so let's just jump
right in here I'm going to be doing a
whole bunch of things just so you will
be able to extend this and all the code
and this tutorial is available in a link
underneath of the video you can do
whatever you want with it and if you can
get somebody to spy it off you I don't
care just do whatever you want okay so
I'm going to be throwing my own events
this time just to show you a neat way to
do that
so I'm gonna have to bring in a couple
other different libraries here and there
you go another thing I'm going to be
doing here is I'm going to be
implementing that little transparency
little slider that you saw there
previously if you can't see this
beautiful screen to make sure that the
float that I use to define the
transparency is always two decimals I'm
going to use the decimal format library
as well and to get rid of this little
error message that I have here I'm going
to suppress warnings for serial because
that's kind of aggravating and like I
said in the past serials just used so
that you could have backwards
compatibility whenever you are creating
other different classes so we saw a
slider there so we're going to create a
transparent slider it's going to allow
the person on the fly to change the
transparency and I'm also going to need
a jlabel for that that's going to
automatically dynamically update so
there's that and I might as well just
come in here and also define my decimal
formatting and that is like I said
before just to make sure that the
transparency has two digits so I'm just
going to go new and decimal format
I'm going to be covering a ton of things
here basically reviewing if you want to
make sure that it only has one digit and
two decimal places that's exactly how
you do that we're going to be using that
a little bit later so when we're
formatting everything to come out on the
screen and another thing is I don't need
to do this but I'm doing this because
you guys always ask me for homework so
I'm going to give you some homework I'm
going to take the graphics settings that
I have here that I created previously
and put them outside of this class just
to show you how to do that and one thing
I didn't implement on purpose was a
stroke tool so that you could change the
stroke basically all you need to know
this is the magic method based and then
using all the other techniques I showed
below you should be able to use this
method here to dynamically change your
stroke right like that so if you wanted
to dynamically change your stroke to
five pixels wide this is the guy that
you would use but I don't need that in
this tutorial just remember there's
homework if you want it and I'm also
going to come down here and go float and
create my transparent value holder and
it's going to be a float so that means
you have to end it with an F those all
work with floats and we can scroll down
through here let's say I want to make
this window a little bit wider I'm going
to change it to 800 by 600 there you go
of course you know how to do that and
then we need to actually add our
transparent little tools that we had so
I'm just going to keep scrolling down
until I get to this part right here and
I'm going to start adding some things
here so if I want to put in a
transparent label now I'm just gonna go
translate elizy quitin ooh jlabel like
that then I just need to define exactly
what I want it to say inside of there
and you can have it say whatever you
want like I said I'm going to
dynamically change that later on and I'm
going to set it at negative or no
transparency just to start off with so
I'm going to leave that as one then I'm
gonna go transparent I got to create my
slider and if I want to do that I just
go j slider see I said I'd be reviewing
a whole bunch of things if I want the
minimum value to be one maximum 100 you
just put 99 inside of there and then 99
is going to be my maximum actually 100
or a 1 transparency or no transparency
is going to be the default and then I
need to create a listener so that
whenever this slider is touched it's
going to automatically go in there and
make change
is listener for slider I'm going to go L
for slider I'm defining my own class
here that's going to handle all this and
go new listen for slider I like that and
of course I'm going to need to go create
that class which I'm going to do here in
one second then I'm going to go trans
slider and go add change listener and
then l4 slider like I've covered in
previous tutorials that is going to
allow me to do dynamic things with this
slider and then before I leave to go
create that class I'm going to come in
here and add these two new guys to my
box for my layout so let's file say that
then I'm going to scroll down to the
bottom of the screen and add in this
class listen for slider here I am at the
very very bottom of this guy and I'm
going to create private class listen for
slider and then you need to call
implements change listener this is just
going to implement the action listener
so that it can react to events on that
slider component that's all this is
going to do which is a lot of guests
kind of cool let's see what happens then
I'm going to go public
Lloyd state changed so that means every
single time the slider is changed go
change event e so every time the slider
is touched or changed in any way this
method right here is going to be called
so that's what's going on with that and
then I'm just going to double check that
the source that call this actually came
from trans slider my slider because I
don't want to react to any other events
and if it did I want to go translate to
change the text for the label and I just
do that with set text and I'm going to
change it to trans parent right like
this and then go plus and then I'm going
to use my decimal format that I talked
about before let's scroll up here to see
you know this guy right here decimal
format remember Dec I'm going to be
using this guy okay so let's get in
there jump down to the next line so it's
a little bit easier to see I'm going to
go Dec and format and trans slider and
then I'm going to say I want to get the
value for translate or whatever it is
whatever they set it to and then since I
want it to show off as either one or
less being a percentage of transparency
I'm going to multiply that
point o1 right like that that's just
going to move the decimal place over to
and then what I need to do is set the
value for transparency for every shape
that's drawn there after so I'll just go
trans parent value and I'm going to need
to change this into a float because
that's what the transparency function
uses and then I'm going to go trans
slider get value like this and then
we're going to multiply this times 0.01
again because we want to move the
decimal place over and there you go you
just implemented a custom class that's
going to catch any events triggered on
your slider pretty cool and before I
leave make sure you put two equal signs
in there now we're going to jump up and
create our new ArrayList that's going to
hold my transparency values jump way up
to this ArrayList we're gonna create a
new ArrayList array list and this guy is
going to hold a float but you're not
allowed to use primitives inside of here
so you have to go fellow 80 like that
primitive would be lower case float and
I'm going to call this trance or sense
and then just go equal to new ArrayList
and float again and there you go so
that's going to allow me to store all
the changing transparency values for
each shape that's drawn on the screen
well then what I need to do because I'm
going to be doing some funky stuff with
the brush is I need to come down inside
of drawing board and we're going to be
doing different things based off of if
I'm trying to draw the brush shape or
I'm trying to draw a regular shape shape
so right before this guy right here
I'm going to go if current action if
you're having a harder time
understanding exactly what's going on
it's probably because the last tutorial
isn't fresh in your mind so feel free to
watch it again so what I'm going to do
is say if I don't have the brush
currently selected which is this guy
right here this is the brush see how I
draw what I'm actually doing here is
drawing individual ellipses to create
this brush effect so if this is not
selected but all these other things are
I want to do the same thing as I done in
the past and then right after this
repaint I'm just going to close off this
if statement just like that no problem
and then I'm going to copy this because
I'm basically going to do this again
roll down into Mouse released right
inside here and paste this guy here and
then I'm going to do a couple different
things
because remember I'm going to be drawing
more than just rectangles this time so
I'm going to go to shape a shape is
equal to null can nullify the shapes and
then what I'm going to do is react
differently based off of what the
current value of current action is so
I'm going to say if the current action
is equal to I'm going to change this to
two and then I'm going to perform a
couple different things here I'm going
to go a shape is equal to and I have a
special method for draw a line which
you're going to see here in a minute
I'm going to go and send it this
starting x-value draw start the starting
y-value whenever they first clicked and
then I'm also going to send over get the
very last value for X and get the last
value triggered for Y then I'm going to
go else I'm gonna go if actually paste
that in there equal to I'm going to
change this to 3 and we're basically
going to do exactly the same thing again
so I'm going to copy this save myself
some time paste that in there and this
is going to be also a shape but in this
situation I'm going to be drawing an
ellipse so I'm going to create the
ellipse method here however I'm going to
be passing it exactly the same values
and then I'm going to go else if current
action is equal to 4 and in this
situation I'm going to be using the draw
rectangle so I'm just going to cut that
out of there and paste that in there and
then this stuff is going to say pretty
much the same here exactly so here we're
going to be adding our new shape to our
shape ArrayList we're going to be adding
our new fill our new stroke however
there's one thing that is also new and
what is that it is the transparency
remember every shape now has a
transparent value so I'm going to change
this to trans percent which is the name
for the ArrayList that holds all the
transparent values and then I'm going to
actually give it that float which is
going to be saved inside of the array
list then this and all I'll stay exactly
the same way that it is and then down
here inside of this guy this is where
we're going to be creating our brush so
I'm just going to get rid of some of
this stuff actually let me get rid of
all this so I have a little bit of room
here to work and I'm going to say if
current action is equal to one so I'm
going to handle for my brush
go into value for X is equal to e dot
get the last value triggered for X as
the mouse was dragged as this method is
saying right here copy that out of there
paste that in there and I'm also going
to do exactly the same thing for Y and
then we got that and then I also don't
want to forget set my shape back equal
to null so get that out of the way and I
also want to make sure that my stroke
value and my fill color are the same
whenever I am drawing with the brush
otherwise if the stroke is different
than the fill because I'm going to be
drawing a bunch of ellipses to kind of
make it look like it's a brush if
there's a different stroke on the
outside it's going to look weird so I'm
going to get that in there and make that
look good
and then I'm going to go a shave create
a new shape here and call draw brush and
then pass over to it x and y and then
I'm just going to put in five inside of
here you could of course change that and
this is just going to be the height and
the width for each of the ellipses that
are going to be drawn as you're going to
see here below and then I'm going to
come in and go shape dot add a shape
what the heck scroll up here and grab
that stuff so I don't have to type it
out copy all that paste that in there
and everything else here can remain
exactly the same so let's keep scrolling
through here and you see this remember I
defined this already very early in the
tutorial so I can get rid of that and
I'm going to show you here in a second
all the methods involved in printing out
all the shapes and all that stuff out to
the screen and this guy's going to
actually have to change here but I'm
also now going to have to iterate not
only through stroke colors fill colors
and shapes but I'm also going to have to
iterate through my transparencies as is
real simple just changes the float and
then I'm going to call this trans
counter and then this is going to be
trans % because that's the name for my
ArrayList that holds all that
information and then this guy is
basically going to get moved from here
down inside of this this for block
that's going to set everything up for me
real nice so paste in the transparency
in this situation get rid of that
because it no longer applies and then
down here where I originally had the
float I'm going to change this to trans
counter dot next I'm going to grab the
transparency for the shape on the fly
most of these other things are not going
to change until
get right here because remember I'm not
just drawing rectangles I'm going to
change shape back into a null value
right like that
scroll this up so you can see it and
then I'm going to perform different
actions based off of what the current
value for current action is which means
what type of shape does the user want me
to shoot onto the screen then they go a
shape create my shape call draw line and
then this guy is going to be basically
the same as what we had up there above
just scroll up and grab it and bounce
down here and paste all that inside of
there come back up here make sure I got
this all set right and it looks right
okay so current value if it's 2 I want
to draw a line because that's the way I
had everything set up except in this
situation I'm going to be passing draw
end instead of these guys right here
which I had saved previously from last
tutorials so this is going to be draw
end and this is going to be draw end
because I have those saved
else and everything else is going to
also be that way so I'm going to copy
that and whenever I draw this ellipse
right here I'm also going to pass the
ending values and then for this guy when
I draw this rectangle I'm going to do
the same thing for that and then of
course I'm going to need to get rid of
this all together because I handle that
above and then that's all perfect and
then I created the draw rectangle last
time and it all works perfectly this
time and the ellipse which I also drew
in exactly the same way we drew the
rectangle except in passing backs and
ellipse instead of passing back a
rectangle that all looks really cool so
that means the only other thing I need
to do is handle drawing lines so I'm
going to go private line 2d don't float
because that's the value you pass
whenever you're drawing a line or at
least the line that I'm currently
drawing and then it's going to be using
the same thing we got here so just copy
that paste that side of there and then
in this situation whenever you want to
draw a line we're just going to go
return new and then we're going to be
passing back this value because of
course that's what it has there on that
side of there and then we're going to be
passing x1y1 x2y2 and then close that
off and then we're going to have to
handle drawing in our brushes and to add
a ton of flexibility for you to do all
kinds of things I'm going to have the
brush actually be drawn using a lips
whole bunch of ellipses
and the name of this guy is draw brush
it's going to get past an integer X 1
integer y 1 another integer that I'm
going to call brush stroke width
remember those were 5 as they were being
passed brush stroke height you could
easily go in there and change those and
then in this situation we're going to
return new ellipse to D float like that
and then it's just going to be X 1 Y 1
and then brush stroke width which we're
just going to copy here because it's too
much to type like that and then get rid
of this integer that's right there and
that's what we're going to be returning
right there and there you go there's a
whole program and there you go if we
file save it and run it hopefully it's
going to work here and there it does and
there's your paint application you can
see it sounds kind of complicated but
it's just a matter of putting all the
pieces together to get this guy to work
go download the code play with it do
whatever you want with it
leave any questions or comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
