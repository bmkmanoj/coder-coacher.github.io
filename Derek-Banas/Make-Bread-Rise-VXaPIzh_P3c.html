asked me to do a tutorial on how to make
bread that Rises guaranteed every single
times this time I'm going to show you
how to combine water yeast flour and
salt and do just that
now I'm going to start off by adding one
and a half cups of lukewarm water to a
bowl and I don't technically have to
proof the yeast but I'm always do it so
I'm going to do it this time then I'm
going to get myself one tablespoon of
instant yeast add that to the bowl as
well and then 1/2 teaspoon of regular
old sugar now I'm going to add what I
consider an insurance policy which is
vital wheat gluten I'm going to add one
teaspoon to two teaspoons of vital wheat
gluten and this is going to be used to
strengthen the gluten strands that may
be cut by the brand and the whole wheat
flour we're going to use and then I'm
going to whisk this all together and let
it sit for about ten minutes
and now everything should be bubbling
which is going to prove that the yeast
is still active now I'm going to add one
and a quarter cups of regular old
all-purpose white flour and then to that
I'm going to add two cups of whole wheat
flour for the most part this is a whole
wheat flour recipe now in essence what's
going on here is the yeast is going to
feed on both the sugar as well as the
starches and then it's going to release
co2 which is going to create the bubbles
in the air then I'm going to add 1/2 of
a teaspoon of salt make sure you add the
salt for flavor and then I'm going to
start mixing everything up now whenever
you mix the flour with the water a
protein called gluten is going to be
formed and whenever it's hydrated these
proteins are going to start to stick
together and create a web structure
around this time I'm going to add in an
additional 1/4 a cup of water and the
reason I'm doing that is because while
white flour is going to require about
60% of the flours weight and water whole
grain bread is going to require
somewhere between 90 to 120 percent but
don't worry about the percentages just
follow the instructions I have here in
this video so as you can see here we are
hydrating the flour which is going to
create proteins that are going to stick
together to create a web structure and
as more of these bonds are formed the
air is going to be introduced through
kneading as you can see right here and
then the dough is going to be filled
with pockets of air and then whenever
it's baked the gluten is going to harden
and you're going to get the holes in
your bread and there you go everything
is real nice and neat and yes the dough
should be sticky still and now we're
going to go and get ourselves a damp hot
cloth and we're going to place that over
top of this and what this is going to do
is keep the crust soft so that the gas
in the bread can continue to rise and
then after about an hour you're going to
have dough that looks like that and now
I'm going to sprinkle some whole wheat
flour down where I'm going to be
kneading everything going to flop that
out and this is the kneading process put
some flour on your hands to avoid
sticking because the dough is still
sticking and this is all you do you just
do this over and over again around this
time you can decide then if you want to
add something I decided to add 1/4 of a
cup of quick oats and I'm just gonna
spread a little bit on and then knead
the quick oats in you definitely don't
need the quick oats though so as you're
watching me knead this dough you may ask
yourself well why exactly does whole
wheat bread harder to make than regular
old white bread well basically wheat
germ and bran because their weight is
going to impede the breads ability to
rise which can make for a dense piece of
bread which is the problem most people
have also the brands going to cut into
the gluten strands which is going to
damage the structure and that's the
reason why we added in the vital wheat
gluten it's going to help strengthen the
structure but either way after about a
minute and a half of kneading that's how
long it took to knead this everything is
looking really nice and I'm gonna go and
spray a little bit of nonstick spray on
here and flop my dough in there and let
that rise for about an hour and you can
see everything's rising perfectly and I
have the oven set at 450 degrees I put a
cast-iron skillet in there during the
preheating process and then I'm going to
add in right around a cup of water to
the cast iron pan to keep everything
steamed and nice and soft please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
