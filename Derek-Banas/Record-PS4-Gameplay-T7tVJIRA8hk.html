this is a blast okay so what's going on
here is amusing all kinds of software
that is way more advanced I probably
should have spent you know a couple
hours trying to figure every single
thing out about it instead i figured out
i spent a about an hour figuring it all
out so sorry about that thank you for
bearing with me um but i think i figured
it out all right and you guys are saying
i'm back again so i guess i'm back again
alright so basically what happens is i
wanted to start doing live streams
because you guys say you'll like it when
I do live streams but i wanted to do
professional live streams and as you can
see i'm doing a fantastic job of that so
I wouldn't tested a ton of hardware a
ton of software and I came down to what
I think is the best in hardware and
software and so I am going to go through
it I tried out a bruh media's live
broadcaster pro two I believe that's
what it's called live gamer portable
whatever it's terrible it's constantly
the frame rates drop audio drops it's
terrible software and this is on a Mac
by the way and using Sierra the most
updated operating system and I tried the
el gato I tried the HD 60s which you can
see right here and i also tried to HD 60
they have audio problems with Sierra
they're denying it but I used it on
three different Macintoshes and it
doesn't work it constantly falls apart
so what I wanted to do here is what I
ultimately ended up using and I'm going
to switch over and show you it and it
works flawlessly and if i'm going to
switch this over and here it is this is
a mage well USB capture HDMI capture
card thing it works perfectly the things
that I was having problems with here
earlier in the stream or me not
understanding how my software works but
I think I have
all figured out that you can use this
with OBS but I used another piece of
software because I want to do really
ridiculously crazy live streams and OBS
wasn't allowing me to do all the
different things that I wanted to do so
I ended up using something called game
show and you can see basically this is
how easy it is to set up I know a lot of
times my how-to videos are ridiculously
complicated basically that mage well
thing that I showed you there i have to
like yank it and you know what it looks
like you plug your hdmi from your ps4
into the end of it that normally goes
into your television and then the USB
into your computer and that's it it
works the only negative tunas gets a
little bit hot but I've played with it
for long hours and nothing's ever broken
on it so i guess it's cool um the in
regards to setting up game show all you
do is you come in and you select like
let's say you wanted to go and get your
the game you want to broadcast as well
as your webcam you select that there
click on next you then go over to the
next frame you type in whatever your
screen name is for you to but also works
with switch and hitbox I tested it on
switch and it works as well I haven't
really done anything with switch you
know I'm a YouTube guy you type in your
screen name and you should probably pick
Apple h.264 if you're using a Mac sorry
pc people all this stuff works the
elgato works good on windows all this
other stuff works this is for poor
people and macintosh that are trying to
do things you're then going to select
whatever you want your resolution debate
and I normally pick 1080p60 that guy
right there which is going to be 9
megabits per second and then after that
you come in and you select the little
controller and then whatever your game
sources is your camera and whatever your
microphone is and then you authorize
YouTube to be able to go and so you can
do your streams and then after that you
click on allow and you click
next and boom everything just pops on
your screen everything works to do
recordings the you can see in the upper
left-hand corner there's like the little
circle within the dot inside of it
that's how you do recordings works
flawlessly all the tests I've done if
you want to do streams you click on this
little stream icon is directly right
next to it where it says 00000 you know
that and you can just add in all these
different things I can do a full
tutorial on how to use game show it's
just impossible to do a tutorial on game
show in slalom running game show so if
you guys want to see that you know just
tell me um I'm gonna open up my chat
here and see I'm that uh looking over
here now to see if you guys are asking
anything Ward for fun there I said your
name and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to test this for everything
because I from reading online I
basically because I was having all kinds
of problems I saw what everybody else
was having problems with and I saw that
people were having problems just doing
streams or doing recordings this this
setup right here does all that and I'm
not sponsored by any of these people if
I didn't say that just want to make sure
that everybody knows I'm not getting
paid to say this and so I saw that
people are having trouble with streaming
and recording regular old games so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just go
in and do that and just to verify you
know so you guys can actually see that
what I'm saying actually works and let's
go do this and there's that and you can
see I threw my webcam in Anor you're
able to crop your webcam image and do
all that which is really cool and here
are I don't haven't many games and most
of the ones i have or
for my kids and such but you know
there's overwatch so if you want to see
what overwatch looks like let's see here
and I'm also everybody says it's
impossible to record or stream with with
PlayStation VR i'm gonna show you how to
do that i'm gonna show you that it works
I just showed you how to do it simple oh
let's try this and flip that matter so
let's just do a very quick gaint our
play through with overwatch just so you
can see what that looks like so if I can
hear this can I hear it I doesn't do
anything silly anybody have any advice
in regards to headphones and such I'm
always open to hear that because my
plantronics headsets really stink I try
to need 50 and they they didn't sound
very good I had some problems with that
an astro a50 so let's go in here I'm
gonna prove that you can do streaming
directly over top of this so let's go
like this ah ok yeah whatever close that
down and it says everything's cool um
will I make programming streams I can do
anything I'm basically what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to have my regular Saturday
and Wednesday um programming tutorials
just like always out but on Monday and
Tuesday I'm gonna do live streams on one
or the other of those days and the live
streams are going to be whatever it's
gonna be all the stuff that I don't do
tutorials on all the time like playing
games and cooking I'd like to do a live
cooking stream I want to do a tunnel
live streams okay so I'm just here I'm
just verifying that overwatch is going
to work so you guys can see the quality
of it and what just will be one of those
times where I can't get on the server
and entering game I I'm really I really
stink it over watch but let's just come
in here and do it um practice for say I
just doing something so you guys can see
a sample of what this looks like all
right so I'm gonna come in here I'm
gonna pick one of these guys there we go
and I'm going to open up the chat system
and read it while I'm waiting for this
to do something
she sit ups you guys can ask me
questions there's no need to donate
money to me always feel free to ask me
questions I saw something about that
alright so let's see how this works out
you guys will see for yourself if it if
it looks good or if there's frame
breakdowns or anything from what
everything I've tested this is as good
as it gets you know I really stink at
this game I've all the chat shut down so
we don't have to listen to people
screaming and playing in the background
and they can't hear me and I'm talking
and I'm not paying attention to what I'm
doing all right oh so this people are
gonna come running out of there okay
good to go
alright so here they come let's see what
I can do and you're getting to give the
ample of what it looks like
fire
and the only reason I'm doing any good
is because I'm playing in the basic
thing right now just so you know so you
don't think I'm some wonderful player
there they are
alright so I don't know you guys can
tell me if it sounds good looks good
does whatever good and I'm just gonna
play here for a little bit longer let me
see check it open again and I can also
display chat and all that other cool
stuff so whenever we want to do that no
I'm not attention at all all
right good
I don't know how the sound sounds along
with my microphone you guys oh I'll
watch the video afterwards and I'll make
changes accordingly and I was thinking
about doing is one of the first live
streams is to do a resident evil vr
whoops ty just fall off a cliff yeah
this kind of sucks ok I was going to do
let's hit people viola shot be our live
stream because I thought that would be
really cool supposedly that's the game
that's making people sick and it's like
frightening to play and overwatch
so I'm not talking more i'm trying to
figure out where I'm supposed to go yeah
that didn't sound good
yeah anybody have any tips on good
headsets tell me because I have to get
rid of this plantronics headsets
terrible
fire I should have put you chat system
up here so I could see your messages
while I was playing this that's
something off direct later and then
after I do this I'm going to show you
that the PlayStation VR also works with
this exact set up so that you can see
exactly all that stuff works it's really
pretty awesome software and hardware all
along because the other stuffs really
stinks I mean especially al God is a
mess on Mac OS Sierra it's a terrible I
don't think I can tell me all they want
I I can give them credit though because
they did try to fix it but it just was
unfixable I don't know if anybody out
there has gotten it to work with el gato
but i know i did and their technical
support people couldn't get it to work
either so i guess i should use my super
powerful power up here and then as soon
as this is over I'm gonna go do a VR
thing because
all right so I think that's the end of
it come on guys just
see
like I said before I'm not very good at
this game the only reason it looks like
i might be doing okay so i think i'm
playing against a computer alright so
that's the end of it ok so it's quit
that leave game and then i will show you
that it also works with quicktime VR so
let's jump out of that and let's open up
quick time BR all right cool yes that's
cool alright so soap lit up yes I I
don't understand why most youtubers
don't reply to comment so I think it's
really cool I don't know I love talking
to you guys and I'm just reading your
comments now if you're wondering what
I'm doing and from what you from what
you guys are telling me it looks like
everything looks awesome I didn't see a
single comment here that says anything
is bad nope aren't cool so what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to jump
over into the thing put my goofy looking
headset on and then I'll show you what
PSP or looks like all right cool I love
doing live streams
you
you
all right back again let me check all
right so I have the goofy headset on and
this thing is ridiculously cold by the
way you guys haven't ever tried it Oh
appointment oh you should see the setup
i have in this room it's ridiculously
cramped okay so i'm going to plug in
this and then i have the demo disc and
i'll ask you guys what you want me to
play and i'll play it anything on the
demo disc so tell me in the chat box
because i have chat open right now and i
will play any of these different things
so let's see can I do see if I can get
them all to show up and I have played
some of these and some of these I have
not played so there's res infinite I've
tried thumper I've tried skywards I
don't think I've tried Russia blood
doesn't work because i don't have the
fancy hand things um driveclub tumble vr
I don't believe works job simulator
kitchen I think that's the VR thing all
right I can't play with you right now
ivy that's my daughter coming in staring
at me wondering why I'm sitting here
looking crazy I'll play kitchen and I'll
play Valkyrie I'll play anything any of
these different games battle zone is
really cool if you want to see any of
those things and I'll open up the chat
now and you guys tell me what the play
and I'll play it so let's come down here
job soon drive club okay I'm looking for
somebody to getting all different things
here job simulator i don't think i can
use because i think it requires me to
use the to hand things so that I can't
do job simulator you want to see battles
on
I saw a battle zone i will try battle
zone just so you can see what that looks
like whatever guys don't seem to care
you want to see battle zone i'll show
you battle zone alright so here's battle
zone alright cool beans some in battle
or its battles on at let me just verify
that all the other sound is working and
it is cool alright so here we are
battles on our toes and here it is and
then you can basically see what I see
whenever I'm playing the game yeah I can
look around and you can well not
whenever there's nothing honor of course
here we are this is battle zone looks
better than this as the game goes it's a
tank game i have played this one it's
pretty cool it's one of the games i've
considered buying because it's cool hold
options to Center view are we on X can
only select one tank this is really a
cool game I love this game you can see
if I look around I believe the screen is
changing to whatever you were looking
around at each hexagon represents it's a
pretty cool stuff your mission is to
reach confront and let's just do it
please confirm launch order I haven't
played these games that much just so you
know you can say
yes let's do this all right so cool you
could say as I look around you can see
whatever i'm looking at which is kind of
cool I've never tried the oculus and all
that other stuff so I don't know what
that's like the only experience I've had
with modern-day VR stuff is this which
is pretty neat can imagine what it's
going to look like with something like
where is in an evil that goes out of its
way to try to scare you and just seeing
I can't see your chat messages right now
I don't believe it yeah use the right
stick to aim fire okay
gonna shoot while I'm in here all right
cool
it's ridiculously cool all right let's
now move away from the hangar exit
and now I have to find somebody to shoot
enemy detected get ready
Oh
I'm sure this is really easy on just the
beginner demo disc and it's a lot I this
is a multi-player game love to try it
oops
oh I'm doing good particularly bad right
now because I haven't been playing any
games lately and when I got this at
Christmas time I was super awesome just
let me tell you this
ah
see if i can get my tank that this
parikh all together here i am really
particularly doing poorly right now
let's see
oh ok stay out of sight and shoot some
of your range none unless little power
so I'm doing terrible
anyway oh there's that I supposed to
shoot that sorry whenever I was talking
and not paying attention it's doing have
a tendency to defer poorly in Games
and then after i'm done with this or
whatever i can just stop it right now I
think you get the gist of it and I'll
answer any of your questions in your
chat and then we'll be done I think
everything worked pretty good though
uh-huh take all that off oh it's crazy
stuff so let's say here I'll go back
into your little chat thing here and
answer any questions you guys have so
let's see here well you got all right
battle zone yes do I know about the
third eye thing no I do not is this a
joke gameplay on a Mac I have an
Instagram account but I don't really
ever use it bring you guys a comments
here all right so you guys are asking me
all kinds of questions about vegetarian
cooking I don't know dodo I'm reading
your comments right now if you're
wondering what I'm what I'm doing is
there any anything you guys particularly
want to see in regards to live streams I
have a whole bunch ideas so what's my
favorite game um I really like overwatch
but my favorite game ever was resident
evil 5 i believe and that was on Game
tube I like old school games kind of
boring that way let me jump over and see
if there's anything else I i think the
VR headsets awesome there's really
awesome games for it right now I mean I
just have them bottom because I don't
really play games all that much I mean
it's it's if you were just watching me
play it that does not transfer into what
it's really like to wear the headset
it's it's really really really cool
and check it out I'm sure there'll be a
best buy or something where you guys can
check it out and see if it works for you
I mean I think it's ridiculously cool
though but i haven't had a game system
is since the the nintendo wii so you
know I'm not that's probably why I think
the PlayStation is really really awesome
war thunder I've never played yes I love
resident evil 5 i think it was like my
favorite game ever so it was really cool
game do I know any code for resident
evil 5 oh no I don't think I ever
cheated on resident evil 5 if there was
a way to cheat I beat that game to death
I mean I played that was like my game
for like a solid year and a half I
played it that was like the only game i
played so I'm real excited to see what
biohazard looks like because I heard
it's absolutely insane what else do I
got here I know any code for resident
evil 5 now yeah I'll do a setup tour
it's um it's a it's a mess right now
because like I said I've been playing
around a lot of different hardware and a
lot of different hardwood software and a
lot of different setups to try to get
everything to work as good as humanly
possible so this is whatever
all right so I guess you got what am i
working on now in regards to what I'm
gonna do on YouTube is mondays and
wednesdays it's going to be C sharp with
a focus on after I cover the basics of C
sharp I'm going to get into some
graphical user interface stuff and all
the other little nitty-gritty things
that everybody's asking me about for C
sharp then I'm going to go into zoom
Aaron and then after that I'm going to
go into game development and I'm gonna
do game development heavy for much of
the year that's like going to be my
major focus however i'm going to do a
bunch of learning ones and things like
that also and what I want to do is have
like live streams of numerous different
topics and things like that either on
monday or tuesday so i'm going to have
like a what a monday show or a a
saturday show a wednesday show and
either a monday or a Tuesday show and
the next time i'm going to do a live
stream jusino is going to be on tuesday
if you guys want to see it and what I'm
going to do is write as an evil
biohazard 7 with VR and see what that
comes out like I think I'd be kind of
cool game development is going to be
really geared towards c-sharp with unity
and all the different things you can do
with C sharp so Monica immunity a whole
bunch of different things and so here
bring your guys comments yeah I already
said what I was gonna do I'm gonna do a
whole bunch of different ways of making
games but mainly I'm gonna focus on C
sharp just because I already did a java
game de ville I've made a game with java
java is not really geared towards doing
professional gaming i mean yeah i know
minecraft was made with it but right now
I think C sharp is like if you want to
go if you want to do games that's my
opinion where is the best thing to use
the best programming language for
beginners is Python and I have a series
called learn to program which i think is
kind of geared towards beginners I you
guys just tell me what type of projects
you'd like me to do and I will do it
like i said i'm going to be doing
cross-platform mobile app development
using zamarian and game development
using multiple different frames works
and c-sharp so it's good this is going
to be a year of a lot of projects above
all else but I'm still going to do
learning ones and things like that it's
just going to be you know mix and match
it up
I'm not gonna talk about Donald Trump oh
I did I doing something really cool let
me show you my wife made this morning it
is I don't know if this is going to show
up on the screen or not it's a trumpet
chew they say here see it's you can't
see it it's a what it is is it's Donald
Trump Pikachu thing I'm gonna paint it
it doesn't come up very well but is
there any way for me to say there it is
my wife made me that it's a Donald Trump
Pikachu thought you guys might think
that was amusing I know I thought it was
amusing oh so that's my comment on
Donald Trump is there anything else you
guys are asking me questions about full
3d but I'll get into 3d development
after I cover to date yes it she has a
3d printer it's a I got this this 3d
printer for for Christmas that's like
ridiculously cheap for what it does and
it's really really cool what else you
guys asked in yeah I've always wanted to
do ionic I just never did it so yeah I
was going to cover the honor ionic
framework updated tutorial on pug which
is the rebranded Jade as far as i know
nothing's different about Jaden pug
maybe something changed since I last saw
it so although I'll take a look at that
now i'm not doing hacking tutorials i
don't i'm sorry i'm just not going to do
anything like that even you know
anything that could possibly be
construed by the federal government as
me teaching people how to do anything
illegal i'm not going to do I don't need
that type of trouble make a series on
web services so Brussels services i
already have it type in YouTube Web
Services tutorial and it will come up I
already covered all that stuff and I
made an application that did translation
into multiple languages poor translation
into multiple languages but it's used as
a web service and it's
functional so I did that wolfram alpha
has its own programming language and at
one point in time I was going to cover
it and I just never did so that doesn't
mean I never will um I i will do it
someday I'll get into c plus plus two
tutorials at some point don't know when
what else you got did Russia hack the
vote um yes I'm going to cover c-sharp
in unity that's definitely going to be
covered I want to do C sharp with mono
game first and then do C sharp with
unity yes I'm going to do in our
tutorial is there anything else do I
have a website yes it's a new think tank
com yes i'm going to do app development
with um i'm going to do app development
multi-platform app development using
samara and NC sharp so yes that's coming
it's very soon like within a month I
love don't starve shipwrecked don't know
I guess you saw my other video before
what's my favorite language I don't know
I don't really know that I have a
favorite language I do have GameMaker
studio I think I only have 1.5 so I have
it and I've played around with it a lot
I haven't made a tutorial on it but
that's definitely something that I can
do it's very easy to learn multiple
different programming languages if you
learn one object oriented one functional
language very very well then all the
rest are easy to learn no I'm a private
consultant
everything always turns into and ask me
anything which is kind of funny oh it
else I work with a lot of different
companies do you have a PI audio or PI Y
fi tutorials no I do not sorry about
that I was the ps4 was connected to my
Macintosh through using that mage well
USB HDMI capture card thing i'm going to
put links to what exactly what i used in
the description underneath the videos
you'll say yes i have a haskell tutorial
what new programming languages videos
will a release in the near future i will
do an hour tutorial um not sure I
haven't really made a decision I have a
long list but I don't have that list in
front of me right now so i'm sorry i
can't i can't tell you and yes i will do
2d platforming games before i do three
day because that kind of makes sense
already made a ruby tutorial as well as
a rails tutorial i'm planning on doing a
react to tutorial also i just haven't
gotten to it what languages do I use all
the time I use JavaScript I've use a lot
of C sharp for like the last year and a
half and PHP and those and I use these
job all the time but not so much anymore
I will probably do a C++ tutorial after
I finish up with C sharp so I can't say
that that's going to start anytime soon
but I don't know I want to cover
artificial intelligence and machine
learning and things like that but what
did you I've looked into it a lot I've
read multiple books on the topic the
problem I'm having with it is the
mathematics behind machine learning is
rather complex so I've been trying to
figure out if there's
any way that I can make it less complex
and so far I haven't figured that out so
you know I don't want to make a tutorial
series in which I you know basically you
have to be an expert in high level
mathematics to be able to understand any
of it so that's why I haven't covered it
yet I've spent a lot of time looking
into it and it just it's it's not out
there only because I don't want to put
out to tour Allah that just confuses
people so just so you know I think about
these videos a lot I mean I think about
stuff well before I make it yes i will
definitely cover pixel art and all that
stuff whenever I make games yes I do I I
used to do a ton of of illustration you
want to see some illustration I did here
I'll go grab one thing and show you some
this is just laying here so i'll just
show you this let me see if it actually
shows up this is something i did a long
time ago there you go that's an example
of something I did this is just a goofy
design thing I did that's Tim Burton by
the way it's like a Tim Burton tribute
thing so there's something that I did so
yes I can do the illustration part and i
think i can teach how to do pixel art
and things like that so that's
definitely something i want to cover and
is there anything else yes in angular 2
tutorials on the way i'm going to cover
cordova and phonegap at some point in
time the microphone i'm using is a rode
nt1-a and it's connected to a focusrite
scarlett 2i2 and that's that's what I
got first language ever learned was
basic people are obsessed with Donald
Trump no that wasn't Donald Trump that
was Tim Burton that was just a crazy
caricature that I did that my wife
always liked and she had it framed and I
guess that does it for a lot of the
comments so alright guys so that was a
fun tutorial to make and I'm gonna do a
lot more and I learned basic when I was
about ten years old and I just thought
it would be kind of cool and to do more
live streams and so this is sort of a
taste of that as well as an explanation
of how you guys can do live streams if
you're stuck on a Macintosh like I said
all this stuff works on Windows that I
showed you right here as well and I
tested that as well but there's other
options like el gato works perfectly
fine on windows it just doesn't work on
Macintosh on upgraded Mac sierras
faithfully so I just wanted to solve all
those problems and sort of answer any
other questions that you guys might have
f and I think that's about time for me
to sign off so thank you for coming and
watching what was a really eventful
stream and a whole bunch of craziness
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
