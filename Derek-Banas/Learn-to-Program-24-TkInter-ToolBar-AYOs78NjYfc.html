of my learn to program series in part 5
of my TK enter tutorial today we're
going to start wrapping up TK enter by
covering toolbars list boxes spin boxes
label frames and a whole bunch more and
in the next part of the tutorial maybe
I'll create a paint application or
something with canvas all of the code as
well as a transcript of this video is
available in the description underneath
the video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it alright so I need to
import some things of course just like
always
we'll import TK inter and then we're
gonna be working with images so that
means we'll need pill also so it's
import image as well as image TK and on
whenever I get to those parts I'll tell
you exactly what those two modules do
for us and let's go and create a class
here and like I said I'm gonna keep
everything as simple as possible here
and just cover these very specific
topics so we're going to create a static
method and it is going to allow us to
quit our application and we'll set event
for none of course in case nothing comes
over and of course to quit a TK enter
application we just call root quit
that's it next thing we want to do is to
initialize everything here for us and
this is going to be past route and we'll
go start creating some things here now
let's say that I want to give my
application a super wonderful title this
is how I do that and I'll just call this
toolbar example cuz that's gonna be the
big part of this tutorial and let's go
and create a menu bar once again so that
this will be completely ingrained in
your brain on how to create just a
simple menu bar across the top of the
screen and now what we're gonna do is
create our file drop down menu
and we'll just pass it route and then
set tear off equal to zero just like we
did previously then we're going to add
our menu drop-down options and we're
gonna add those to the file menu and you
do that by going add and command and
then we'll just simply give these a
label let's just say open isn't gonna do
anything obviously from previous parts
the tutorial you know how to use command
to make open do all kinds of different
things and we're gonna have another one
and we'll call this save and then the
final one we're gonna call quits or
exits and we will call command on this
and call our little function that we
made up here the quit applications and
to do that we're just going to come in
and go self and quit app alright so we
have those in the little drop-down that
comes down here now we just need to add
our drop-down options to file and to do
that we go menu bar and add cascade and
let's go and give this the label of file
and then we need to associate the menu
here with the file menu that we just
created and there we go
so we just created our little menu and
of course pause the screen if you want
to write all this stuff down it's also
in the description underneath the video
and now let's go and create our toolbar
and to do so it's not as hard as you may
think we are going to create a frame
here and I'm going to put BD inside of
here and that is just going to define
our border width then I'm just gonna let
that be one and then we'll also come in
and go relief and set that to raised and
that's just going to draw a line
underneath of our tool bar if you don't
want to line there and then don't put
the brazed inside of there now we need
to go and get our images for our toolbar
and these images are all going to be 24
by 24 pixels but of course you can make
them whatever you want and I'm going to
call this open image and this is where
we use that module from up above that I
talked about and we're gonna have to say
Oh
and paying is what I called that and I'm
gonna create three items inside of the
toolbar here there's open and we're also
going to have save and that one is
called disk pain and go and use whatever
24 by 24 characters you want to use or
whatever thing you want and you could
just look for three free icons or free
images or type of an open image or
something like that in Google you'll
find all kinds of different things you
can use and this one's called exit okay
so we got those now we need to create a
TK inter image to be used in our button
and I am going to call this open icon
and image TK and then we're going to go
photo image and then we are going to
pass in open image inside of that and
then we need to do that for all of our
other different images we're going to
have on our tool bar so this is gonna be
called Save icon and here we'll have
save image and then this one will be
called exit icon and exit image of
course alright so now we have those
already now what we need to do is create
the buttons for our toolbar and I'm
going to call this open button and that
is going to be a button of course and
we'll pass it toolbar and then the image
we want to use inside of it it is going
to be our open icon and then we got to
do that for all of the different options
we have available here so also have a
Save button and an exit button and then
here we just go and do the same thing
Save
and exit so pretty straightforward doing
the same exact thing over and over again
now we need to come in and set this up
far button and our image and this is
going to be make sure to spell
image correctly and this is gonna be
open icon and you're gonna do exactly
the same thing once again for the save
and the exit save and save and exit and
and exits and there we are
it's a pretty straightforward stuff
let's go scroll that up now what we need
to do is place the buttons in the
interface and to do so we go open and
button and we're gonna call pac---- on
this and I'm gonna have everything line
up starting on the left side of the
frame that we're gonna be working with
here and let's say that we also want to
come in and throw some padding let's
padding for x and y directions of two
I'm gonna do the same thing for the
other two buttons so you could say it's
very very straightforward and of course
save and don't need to do anything there
and exits and there we are now after we
have all of those set up we need to go
and call the tool bar and pack that and
I'm going to have the side for this beat
off and I want to completely fill in the
x-direction and make sure that's toolbar
and then after that we go roots and
config and menu is equal to menu bar
that to handle our menu bar which we
didn't do previously and then of course
outside of the class we need to create
everything so let's go and get whoops
can i spell root correctly there we go
and then we'll go and create our TK
object yawns let's go and define our
geometry for our window and let's make
it something like 600 by 550 and then of
course well we'll come in and just go
app is equal to T
a inter example that's what I called it
correct yes that's what I called it and
we need to pass it root of course and
then to make everything run until we say
for it to stop we call me loop and let's
run it and see if I did that right and
yes I did look at that guy's there it is
and if we click on this oh nothing
happened why didn't anything happen well
let's go look doctor that the duh there
is the exit well I know why didn't work
it's because we didn't set it up to work
so let's go in here where is our button
here we are there is the exit icon and
then we will come in and we'll go
command and we will go self and quit app
and of course get rid of these
parentheses and if we run it there it
pops up on the screen there is our nice
toolbar and click on that and it exits
ok so that's how you create a toolbar
now what I'm gonna do is jump in and
show you how to create a list box
alright so I want some events to be
triggered here whenever the user clicks
on items in our list box and we're gonna
have a function in call inside here
called on favorite food and select yeah
that's really long-winded and so we're
gonna come in and this guy is going to
have events equal to none by default and
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
go and get the widget that triggered
this event and to do so you just go
event and then widget and we're gonna
have everything set up with indexes so
what we're gonna do here is get the
index of our list box and to do that we
just refer to our widget and then we say
cursor selection parentheses and then 0
we then want to come in and get the
value associated with the index and to
do that we just refer once again to our
widgets and say get index then what
we're gonna do is we're going to refer
to a label which we're gonna create here
is suck
and what it is going to do is change the
label based off the selection for the
listbox and how you change a labels text
is right like that is equal to and then
I'm going to come in here and I'll say
something like I'll get you and they'll
be value okay so that what we're gonna
do is create a list box and we're going
to allow the user to go in and select
different food items and then it's going
to change the label based off that like
I said I'd want to keep this very very
simple so we'll go down inside of our
initialization function that's where
we're still at and create our list box
and a list box is just gonna display a
list of items that you're going to be
able to select from and why don't I
cover something else I was looking for a
place to talk about label frames let's
go and create one right now even though
it might be kind of ugly in this
situation so label frame is just the
frame with a label as you're gonna see
here in a moment and to create one
instead of a regular frame you create a
label frame and you pass it route just
like you would otherwise and then you
can put text inside of here some say
something like food options is gonna be
that and then if you want padding inside
between you know the outside of the
frame and the actual widgets that are
inside of there you just add padding to
it and there you go so there we are
that's how you use or create a label
frame and now what we're gonna do is
create the label that is going to be
changing let's just go and do this on
favorite food let's just call this
favorite food label that's what we
called it up here right let's go make
sure favorite food label yeah that's
what we're gonna be changing and of
course it's a label and we're gonna put
it inside of our frame here our label
frame and let's throw in some default
text for it and I'm gonna have something
like what is your favorite food
and so and we're gonna have this be
favorite food label and pack because we
don't need to do anything else with that
and now we will create our list box and
to do that we're just gonna call it list
box and you go list box like that and
you pass in the frame or whatever you
want it to be inside of and then if you
want to create different list box
options you just say list box and you
insert them so insert and we're gonna
give it an index as well as a value so
let's say spaghetti is one all the
options we have and what's going throw a
couple more inside of here so there you
go
spaghetti and I don't know let's throw
in four of them just to have something
different now we'll change all these
different indexes here so they are all
different and who doesn't like the pizza
and we'll throw burgers inside of here
and then we'll throw hot dogs inside
here cuz I can't think anything else all
right so there's hot dogs now what we
need to do is tie an event whenever the
list box items are clicked they are
going to come up here and run this
function so let's see if you remember
how to do that to do it we just go a
list box and then bind so find and then
we come in here and say what we want to
bind to and this is gonna be a list box
select is the name for clicking on a
list box item and if they click on one
this is the function that is going to be
triggered that guy right there of course
get rid of those parentheses then we're
gonna say list box and pack so that it
shows up in our interface and then
finally we need to go lb frame and have
it be packed also so it shows up and if
we run it see if it works and look at
that it worked all right so it says what
is your favorite food and if you click
on spaghetti
I'll get you spaghetti pizza I'll get
your pizza burgers hot dogs okay cool
beans everything works and now for the
final example I'm going to show you how
a spin box works so once again we're
just going to stay and the
initialization phase here or
initialization function and what a spin
box is going to do is provide a fixed
number of values as an option for the
user to select from so we are going to
create another frame and this is going
to basically ask how many of those
different items the user wants so let's
go it creates a just a regular old frame
instead of a label frame and I am going
to call where I'm going to create
another label inside of here just for
the heck of it and let's call it label
and we'll put it inside of SB frame of
course and the text for this is going to
be how many do you want
so ask them for their favorite food and
then we're gonna ask them how many of
those things they want and let's just go
and pack this away there that is so
that's all set up now what we need to do
is create our spin box and I'm just
gonna call this spin box I'm going to
create two spin boxes because there's a
couple different ways of using or
creating spin boxes a spin box and we
have to define where it's gonna go to
and if you want it to be within a set
number of values what you do is for
example if you'd like it to be from and
you have to put an underscore inside of
there from 1 to 5 that is exactly how
you do that so we're gonna limit them in
regards to how many they can get and a
little spin box and we won't pack it and
you're gonna see there's like little
arrows on the right side that you're
going to be able to select from but
you'll see that in a second and that's
if you want to use a range of values if
however you'd like to put some custom
things inside of there I'm gonna go and
create another label here to label and
throw SB frame inside of there and then
what we'll do is we'll say add on item
so something else that they might want
whoops and make sure you put text inside
of there of course add on item and there
is your label
as well come in and get the extras label
and pack it as well
into the interface and now it's time to
create our custom item spin box and I'm
gonna call this extras spin box and once
again same exact thing spin box just
like we did before and we're going to go
SB frame just like we did before and now
for your custom values you type in
values is equal to and let's say french
fries is gonna be an option and what
else can we put inside of here
onion rings and of course what there's a
soft quotes I've been severely lacking
in my quilting ability today and then
we'll put in tater tots hey got that
thing again tater tots and there we go
yeah and for some reason I don't like
tater tots very much and we will also
come in I don't know why I'm doggin so
silly today we will go in and pack in
our spin box and we'll run it to see if
we got it and we didn't what did we do
wrong let's go make sure here we got oh
I know why it didn't work
we got to throw in our frame so we'll go
sp a frame and pack that up as well and
run it and there you can see it did
indeed Orca wonderfully so we can go in
select spaghetti and say we want two
plates of spaghetti and we want onion
rings with those or we could go and get
burgers and you can see I'll get your
burgers and we want five of those they
won't let us get any more for health
reasons and then we can select tater
tots okay so there you go guys there is
a whole bunch of other different widgets
available for TK enter of course with
Python and then the next part of the
tutorial I'm gonna finish up TK enter by
covering canvas so like always please
leave your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
