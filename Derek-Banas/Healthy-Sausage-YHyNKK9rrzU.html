show you how to make something that many
people would think is impossible I'm
going to show you how to make healthy
sausage now buy sausage it's going to
taste exactly like sausage the only
difference is not going to have meat in
it instead it's going to have my secret
weapon for losing weight textured
vegetable protein and it's extremely
easy to make all you need to have are
all the ingredients so first off we're
going to put a half a cup of textured
vegetable protein inside of a pan and
into that you can add a half a cup of
your hottest tap water just to the point
where it's hard for you to put your
finger under it and you're going to mix
that together a little bit until all of
the texture proteins completely
submerged in the water and then you're
going to sit that aside for five minutes
that's it all right so while that is
sitting then what you're going to do
next is you're going to get yourself a
half cup of water and pour that into a
bowl and then to that you're going to
get yourself some liquid smoke that's
what liquid smoke looks like and that's
going to give you the smokiness for your
sausage and you're going to need a half
teaspoon of liquid smoke so just pour
that in there with the water and then to
that you're going to get yourself some
either Liquid aminos which I use because
I'm allergic to MSG or you use tamari or
you could use soy sauce you're going to
put three tablespoons of that there's
one two three and then to that just to
keep everything light I'm using Vermont
sugar free low-fat syrup again the only
reason I'm using this is it's 15
calories for 1/4 cup and I'm going to
put about a teaspoon of that inside of
there as well and then you're going to
get yourself a fourth of a teaspoon or
it's just an insignificant amount of
molasses and there you go that's at
least 1/4 teaspoon you don't have to be
perfectly exactly this I've made it
before many times and then you're just
going to stir that up inside your bowl
and then sit that aside then in a
separate Bowl so you don't have to wait
because remember our textured vegetable
protein sitting over on the side I'm
going to get myself 1/2 cup of whole
wheat flour 100% whole wheat flour and
all the fat that is actually in these
sausage patties comes from flax seed
which we're going to add here a minute
and then to that you're going to add 1/4
cup of wheat bran again I'm using just
like unprocessed it doesn't matter what
and though there's 1/4 cup of wheat bran
this is going to help with the texture
and flavor and also binding everything
together and then you're going to get
yourself a tablespoon of what is called
nutritional yeast you can get these to
the health food stores and things like
that like I said if you're willing to
put forth the effort you're going to be
able to eat really delicious things and
lose weight so there's a tablespoon of
nutritional yeast of course you can
order all this stuff off the internet
and then I'm going to get myself one
tablespoon of ground or milled flax seed
and that's one tablespoon again this is
going to help everything bind together
especially the flax seed there's all the
fat you're going to get out of this by
the way then I'm going to get myself
some garlic powder and there's going to
be a teaspoon of garlic powder in this
then I'm going to get myself a 1/2
teaspoon or if you want to spice
everything up this is fennel seed you
want to spice this up a little bit you
can put more than a 1/2 teaspoon
actually I'm going to put a whole
teaspoon of fennel seed then you give
yourself couple dashes of pepper you put
ground pepper in there if you want it's
up to you recipe actually says 1/2
teaspoon then you're going to get
yourself a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne again
cayenne pepper again you can put more in
if you wanted to spice it up even
further then you can just mix that
around
because right now my textured vegetable
protein is done so I'm going to take
everything that I just mixed there dump
that in there and then mix all of that
together and you can see that it's
starting to come together and actually
look kinda like meat gonna look a lot
more like meat here in a minute whenever
we put it in our other liquid mixture
that we made previously and all of your
ingredients have been added basically
all you have to do now is cook the stuff
up so that's stirred up blowing up and
take our little liquid that we took from
before put together before dump that in
there and stir that off even further
you're in the homestretch you're almost
done you're a couple minutes away from
having yourself some sausage patties and
just to compare this to Morningstar
these sausage patties going to be 3
times as large and be about less than
half of the calories of the morning
stores which is a good comparison except
I think he's tastes a little bit better
same amount of fat and more fiber pretty
good I have all the nutritional
information underneath the video as well
as a link to the actual recipe there you
are everything
setup now it's just a matter of frying
it okay now I have a pan cooking here I
have it on six out of a total of ten in
regards to heat wise everything's a
little bit different I'm just going to
take a little tiny piece of our sausage
mixture and throw it in there and wait
till it starts to bubble while that
happens I'm gonna go and heat my hands
under hot water so that the sausage
mixture doesn't stick to them I don't
know if you can see that or not but if
you zoom in on this guy might be able to
see there that the little piece of
sausage that I threw in there see there
it is it's starting to heat up and cook
that means it's time throw our sausage
patties in okay so what am I gonna do
here I know you've got about four
sausage patties here these are big ones
remember somebody gets something a
little bit bigger than a golf ball size
there they are you want to look at it
from different angles that's basically
as big and as wide as my little sausage
patties gonna be and I'm just gonna
throw them in there Thanks there's about
a tablespoon or a tablespoon and a half
of vegetable in there you can use olive
oil you can use whatever you want you
know make another sauce of fat throw it
in there you can see they're all holding
together beautifully and there's another
one and there's another one so we're
just gonna sit there and let these guys
cook in the pan press them down into
that oil a little bit if you get a
little impatient that's okay flip them
over see they're starting to get golden
brown now hold together wonderfully
and there you can see after cooking for
about two minutes per side you got
yourself some really nicely cooked and
really delicious healthy sausage patties
and of course you could cook them longer
if you preferred their you say in just a
couple of minutes you were able to do
the impossible make healthy sausage
patties leave any questions comments or
requests below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
