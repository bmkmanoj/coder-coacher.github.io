show you exactly how to make a wordpress
featured content plugin and the reason
I'm doing this is phil requested it and
this specifically is what Phil wanted me
to make this big giant guy right here
it's not too high nice and wide and it's
going to pretty much provide all the
different options that you would want in
a featured content plugin and since i'm
going to show you how it's made from the
ground up you're going to be able to do
anything here change colors change fonts
change anything you'd like and even make
totally different featured content
plugins based off of these principles if
you didn't see my wordpress theme
tutorial you'll probably should watch
that first and also if you didn't watch
my wordpress plugin tutorial you
probably should watch that first as well
that'll ease you into this process but
somebody who's well-versed in wordpress
and or programming in general should
probably grasp most of what i'm going to
do here today and we have right here
what i want to create and then down here
i'm going to build it step by step and
I'm going to start off I have something
called featured content PHP right here
and currently all that i have saved as
this image right here in this image
right here and then of course we're
going to populate this as time goes by
so i'm just going to jump right in here
and like I've said before everything is
a box and most of the time that box is
called a div so I'm going to do is I
know I need a surrounding div that's
going to surround everything so I'm
going to call that ntt featured content
and again if you want any of this code
it's available in a link in the underbar
and then to close this off to show you
some good code practices i'm actually
going to come in here and close this off
before it has even started and of blank
so that way you'll be able to keep track
all the dibs so this div right here all
it's going to do is surround everything
that is up here and technically I could
come in here and style this immediately
just so you know exactly what it's going
to look like so if I jump into this guy
remember it was called ntt right there
this is actually normally how I work I
do everything piece by piece and you're
going to want to position it relative to
everything else on the screen and you're
going to want to wit of 954 pixels based
off of the dimensions and I created this
image right here in Photoshop by the way
he just sent me a sketch there's the
height and it ends up being 326 and I'm
getting all these dimensions from
Photoshop that's where they're coming
from and then just so we know where it's
located i'm going to define
on a border that I'm then going to get
rid of it a little bit but start off I'm
going to actually have a border in here
and give it a border black so if I file
save that and jump over here if i'll
save this just to make sure and reload
it you can see that there it is there's
the box the border anyway that pops up
on a screen so we're going to continue
diving in here and making some more
additional things well I'm also going to
be needing a div that is going to fill
in for this text area over here so I got
to come in create another div what we're
doing it's just going to be a div it's
going to lie inside of that border and
TT text div close that off and then I'm
going to copy this and close that off
and of Mike and that's just there to
alert me to what's going on then inside
of the text box I need to define another
div one for sales techniques one for
this underline one for this text and
then went for this read more button it's
down here let me zoom in so I one for
this one for this one for this and one
for this so I got a defined for more
dips inside of this text box div and I'm
going to give my next div a class equal
to n TT article title and all of this
information is going to be propagated
inside of wordpress then i'm going to
say let's put sales techniques and then
we'll close that div off then we can
file save this and then i'm going to
jump over into my style dot CSS folder
and make some changes here so i'm going
to go ntt text div i'm going to position
it relative and that just means i want
to position it relative to this div that
contains it that's all that means just
go with the flow inside of the day of
you are in there and I want to say that
I want a width of 377 pixels again I
figured out these dimensions by just
looking at my photoshop file and I'd
show you that photoshop file I don't
have enough screen real estate to fit
all this stuff in and for now I'm going
to define a background image but later
on in this tutorial I'm actually going
to get rid of this and I'm going to put
in a gradient that is built based off of
CSS so that it'll be nice and easy for
me to change text or background colors
and all that stuff and this guy is
called FC text area made it ahead of
time and then I'm also going to grab
this guy and TT article title on that
since it's a class yet started off with
a dot if it was an ID we would start it
off with a hash and this time I'm going
to position it absolutely that
games i'm going to tell it exactly where
i want it to show up and I do that by
then referencing top being 40 pixels
from the top and then left 20 pixels and
then I'm going to find that I want the
font to be bold 24 pixels 38 side here
for line hi Georgia and I'm going to say
serif I'm going to give my text color a
color of six and eventually I'm going to
show you how to do this in GIMP which is
a free image editor instead of Photoshop
because I know a lot of you guys can't
afford Photoshop hell I can barely
afford for the job I'm just defining all
of the information that I got previously
then I want my text align to be centered
see I'm putting a box around this text
right here this is actually going to be
a box it's like this big and then i'm
going to say any words that are
contained inside of it are going to
center that means that and it doesn't
matter what this title is it can be real
longer it could be real short either way
the text is always going to be aligned
to the center of this whole entire
container that's why I'm doing it the
way that I'm doing it and then to be
fancy I'm going to throw a text shadow
which is just the background effect wait
1.5 pixels down 1.5 pixels to the right
one pixel so if we file save that and
reload you could see okay well sales
techniques just popped up as did the box
that we define so that's great so let's
jump back over into the actual place
we're going to have it no by the way
this stuff isn't going to exist here
whenever this is a plug-in actually body
won't none it as well but this is just
the way you have to start out building
these guys so the next thing I gotta
define is the text lies right inside of
here and you could do this full screen
by the way it is an HD video if you
can't see what I'm doing you're probably
left already if you haven't seen what I
was doing it before actually instead I'm
going to do the horizontal rule and I'm
going to use a fake horizontal roll
that's going to look like a horizontal
rule but because i define it as a div
it's going to actually show up better
forming and we'll give and what the heck
it's going to find that text that's
right here instead i'm going to call it
Dave I'm going to call give it class
equal to n TT article excerpt div copy
link and then show where these devs
clothes off and I grab some lipson text
and then I'm going to paste that lip
some text inside of here if i'll save it
and then open up the style area so then
i'm going to create the horizontal rule
and its class and i'm going to say i
want it position it also absolutely oops
absolute and i'm going to say from the
top will go down to 87 pixels 20 pixels
from the left side hg IG HT two pixels
and then it's going to have a width of
315 pixels and it's going to have a
background color ve again it's a grey
you're going to be able to of course
change the colors on these after i
change some things here and we have to
put in this stuff here because internet
explorer of course doesn't like whenever
you do anything that's at all creative
they have to try to figure out a way to
make mess that up ok so that's how you
create that horizontal rule that i have
there and then i'm going to define some
styling this is the name of the class
for that guy when akka musician this
also absolute from the top 15 pixels
left 20 pixels fonts 12 pixels 17 line
height or j Sarah color and I'm going to
give it a width remember this is what's
going to contain all of the text that
lip some text that we put in there and a
height of 120 pixels so that's the
excerpt eres will 5 save that jump over
here reload and now you can see that the
world's on roll showed up and there is
the text so now what do we got to do
well we got to put the read more little
guy in there which is Roy down here this
is all coming together real fast I mean
this is really awesome I mean once you
get good at HTML and CSS you can pretty
much do anything you want really really
really fast so I'm going to come in here
again put in another div equal to class
and this is ntt read more based in a
little bit of comment I also heavily
comment my code way more than I do in
these tutorials and read more I'm just
going to type in as read more even
though this right here is all upper case
letters I'm gonna do it this way and
then i'm going to use CSS styling to
actually come in and make it the way
that you want it to make it so i'll say
jump into stein ntt this is how I
normally do it I just jump back and
forth over and over and over again and
i'm not saying this is the best way it's
just the way i do it i'm not one of
those people that really believes in
telling people that there's an absolute
way to do anything because it just takes
the fun on everything that's the way you
want because in my opinion if it works
it
and that's all that matters and I'm
going to make this bold 14 pixels 17
pixels on I vithika Emeli sandÃ© sir
this is the text color FF text shadow
we're going to copy this I don't have to
type it out again one pixel one pixel
this just puts a little bit of a shadow
in the background and then that 0 means
that I don't want the text shadow to be
blurred and remember I said I don't want
to be able to type in and lowercase or
whatever and then automatically make it
uppercase well this is how you do that
in CSS code text transform uppercase
reload and there it is see it showed out
isn't it awesome okay so back into
featured content what we got to do we
got to put this image in here and again
later on this is going to be something
that's pulled dynamically from inside of
wordpress but for now it's just going to
be the way that it is everything's done
in baby steps well i'm done with the
text gives though i need a new div
that's outside of the text div and i'm
going to give it a class name equal to n
TT featured thick like that closing div
and then inside of this guy i'm going to
point at temporarily this featured image
but later on again this is going to be
all dynamic inside of wordpress but this
is just the way you have to do it
whenever you start out or it's at least
the way I do it I don't know anybody
that goes in and does all this stuff all
at one time everything's done in pieces
that way you don't get confused but if
you're real smart I guess you could do
it all at one time and I'm going to get
an alt of handshake for now but again
this is going to be dynamic awesome so
that's awesome jump over style dot in TT
featured pic and then do some CSS
styling position absolutely and I want
it to be across the top so I don't want
it to have any distance from the top and
then left I wanted to peer 378 pixels
from the left with a 576 pixels because
that's all bigoted hgih to 240 pixels
and that's all we had to do and we
reload it and there's our little picture
of the handshaking so that's awesome and
now I'm going to make a whole entire bar
here all in one little clip so this is a
new day variance so I have to surround
all of this with one box so we're going
to have to come in here so it'll be a
master box class is equal to n TT i'm
going to call it thumb bonk
and this is big guy so I'm actually
going to come in here and actually
define this first thing I got to do is
come in here and define the div that's
going to surround the left button which
is right here and I'm going to find all
these other little pieces class to class
is equal to and TT left button close
that on and then I'm going to find an
image that's going to always be there
which is going to be the button image
equal to it's going to be in my images
folder in the same folder here and it's
going to be cold FC left arrow all I'm
going to put back inside here close that
off I'll say cause lift button position
relative to the box that surrounds it
Tom give me thirty six pixels from that
yeah I and then left will be eight
pixels and then I'm also going to have
to define the box that's going to
surround all this stuff and that's ntt
thumb box and it's going to be
positioned absolutely 240 pixels from
the top left 378 pixels it's going to
have a width 576 pixels eight of 86
pixels and the background color 05 @ 5
out of 5 and do if i'll save it reload
you can see that there is the arrow and
there's the surrounding box it's great
that's awesome and then we're going to
come in here and we're going to find
everything else so right after again we
want this to stay inside of ntt thumb
box I'm going to create all those boxes
that show up up here and I'm going to do
that I need to think about this in a way
that is going to allow me to change the
number of those in the future them now
and this is frame so these are actually
going to be divs that are going to
surround the image that lays inside of
there so for now this is going to be
image source is equal to images from
hands is the name of that little image
class equal to now we need one of these
guys by the way and this is going to be
NTT featured thumb alt text is going to
be a featured page for now again this is
going to change pretty much everything
you're seeing here is not going to
change but these things will change and
what I'm going to do is I'm actually
going to copy this guy just for now just
so we can see and this will look better
and i pasted that in there five times
now in the stylesheet i'm actually going
to style each one of those thumbnails at
the same time because its class so
go n TT thumbnail frame so I'll five of
those are going to show up the same time
position is going to be relative and
then I want them to float to the right
so as each one of them is created they
slip into the right side of the screen
so you can have one or two or five of
them doesn't matter and then we'll put
our wit at 58 and then to make
everything line up nicely it's going to
have a margin of negative 12 pixels from
the top 47 pixels from the right 0
pixels from the bottom and then 0 pixels
and then it's going to have a background
image that is this guy to the images
folder and I'm going to have to go into
the featured thumb which is going to be
the image that lies inside of the frame
that we just created and we're going to
position it relative to that little tiny
box that contains it and we're getting
it for pixels left four pixels so this
is going to put it in seiner with this
is nunda if it has a height of 48 pixels
and width Oh 48 pixels I'll save that
jump over here reload and there they are
all those different images that are
inside of there and they're all broken
because I did not put a be inside of
your easily correct at the B pase and
there you go there's all those images
showing up inside of there just like we
want them and in now all that we need to
do is create the little right button I'm
gonna so still inside of the thumb box
we're going to create a new div and it's
going to have a class equal to n TT
right button and then we're gonna put an
image source ERA king and i'm going to
say alt next' and then jump into the
Style section after you save it position
it relative six pixels down from the top
and left 551 pixels and if you fine it
will save that for the grand finale I'll
make this real big and you can see right
here that there is the featured content
area that we created and most of the
HTML or all HTML and all the CSS needed
to create it in the next tutorial I'm
going to move you towards WordPress and
making this all more dynamic any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below weather wise till
