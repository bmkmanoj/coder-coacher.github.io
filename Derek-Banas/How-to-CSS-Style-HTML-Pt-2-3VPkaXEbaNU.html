the complete CSS tutorial where I go
through every single way of using CSS
cascading style sheets if you didn't
watch the first video which is available
right here first off I'm gonna go
through every way that in this
presentation that you can style text
with cascading style sheets let's start
off with the shorthand way to define a
font in just one line you would do that
with this font property followed by the
style of font font variant font weight
font size line height and font family
you can see here a very specific way
that I used this property the style of
my h4 header tags and here's an example
of what this change would do to an h4
header tag now fun family right here is
the basics of a fun family it's fun -
family : and then I would define
whatever fun family I wanted to use for
my text here I'm specifically am using
Times New Roman if that's not available
on the machine then it would use times
and if that was not available then it
would use finally the serif font which
is available on every single computer
here is by the way a list of all of the
different fonts that should be available
on every single computer now move on to
font size here just to simply type in
the property fine - sighs :
and then whatever size you want it to be
and cascading style sheet sieve there
allow you to increase or decrease the
size of the font using a percentage
which you would use right here or if
they allow you to use words such as
smaller extra small medium default extra
large and extra extra large
and that's font size now on the font
weight here basically we're defining
with font weight whether we win text to
be lighter or bolder and you do that by
typing it font - wait : and then one of
these values right here of course you
could hit pause and write this down if
you'd like or just simply go to new
think tank comm and print out all this
then we have font style font styles kind
of misleading but the only thing fonts
down
allows you to edit is whether you want
text to be italic or not so you would
never use it unless you wanted text to
be italic that's one style then you have
font variant now you know I'm covering
every single property that's available
at CSS when I'm using something I'd like
fun variant it provides you with the
ability to either have fun show up
normally or with small caps where all of
your large capitalized letters would be
the way they always are and all your
lowercase would show up as small
versions of uppercase versions of
themselves then you have line-height
here we are defining the distance
between each line of text and you do
that as percentages as we show you right
here there's 2050 the whole way up to
220 I'm talking about letter spacing
here we're defining exactly what it says
the distance between each letter and you
can see here you define that with an 1.5
am : I don't want this to be too Jordan
later you can see here examples if I
changed the data value in the distance
of the letters from each other and also
space for based off of word spacing here
you can see examples of how word -
spacing changing will affect state you
can tell there's no letter spacing being
affected here only the different words
you can obviously align text which I did
here with the word - spacing : in this
case Center option and you can see left
center right and justifying or all the
options that are available then we have
text decoration which is kind of neat
maybe you don't see used very often here
we have underlined choose chosen as an
option here we have over lined now this
is not oh no entice we have
strikethrough or line through as it is
defined with the text decoration tag and
we have blinked
now onto text-indent this is the proper
way to indent text with cascading style
sheets and you would use again the 1.5 e
m and just keep changing this value to
find the way of indenting that you
prefer and here are examples of an
indent of 1e m 1 point 2 a.m. and so
forth and so on then we come to tact
text transform here you can either
choose to all have your text capitalized
uppercase or lowercase T those are every
options available for text transform and
then we have vertical alignment here we
have examples again a vertical alignment
sub so forth and so on through super top
text top this is kind of hard to display
because by vertical I mean up and down
so this allows you to align your text
upwards and downwards within is chosen
Texas ways now let's move on to color
styling here if you wanted to change the
color of your text which is what the
color property changes is the text color
you could type in one of the default
colors that are found in every single
web page or web page browser or you
could type in what's called hex code and
if you want to see a mile-long list of
hex codes and their associated colors
just type in WI ki web color and hit
enter in Google and it'll take you to an
amazing page that's hosted through
Wikipedia which will show you how to
turn of colors if you want to change the
background color you would use the
background color principle and its
background - color and here again are
all the Devon colors found in all of the
browsers in the next presentation I'm
going to go through every single option
and feature that's available for styling
backgrounds see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
