do something a little bit crazy I'm
going to try to teach pretty much
everything there is to know about css3
in one video so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay
so in the description underneath the
video you're going to find links to all
of the different parts of this tutorial
as well as a link to all of the code or
HTML CSS that you will find here and on
the left side of screen I have sublime
text on the right side I have Google
Chrome I'm going to be referring to two
different websites throughout this
tutorial one is this Wikipedia page
right here which is going to provide us
with all the hexadecimal codes for a
whole ton of different colors so there
is that link and I'll put that in the
description as well and also you're
going to see here the easy way for us to
validate to make sure that our style
sheets are all compliant and there is
the link for that so what I did was I
went ahead and created all of the HTML
which you can see right here and then
I'm going to jump over and create all
the style sheets to edit it so that you
can see everything as it happens the
very first thing I'm going to do is open
up heading dot CSS and inside of this
heading I'm going to define an h1 tag
style as well as an h2 tags down and
that is how you can style two things at
one time and I'm just going to change
the text color here to white that's how
we change our text color and I'm going
to change the background color behind
all of this to black and then I'm going
to throw on some padding all the way
around this guy of 15 pixels and then
I'm going to open up paragraph dot CSS
and I'm just going to say that all of my
paragraphs are going to have the default
styling to have text color of blue now
what I'm going to be able to do is go
into my main style dot CSS and import
both of those styles that I created
right there now whenever you're dealing
with imports anytime you want to use
them they must be the very first thing
in your stylesheet and I'm just going to
come in here and go import and type in
the names for those style sheets that I
just created just a second ago and
import again and this is going to be
paragraph this time dot CSS and since I
have the main style sheet right here
defined as my default style sheet this
is how we would be able to link to
outside style sheets I'm not going to
get in get into in lining style sheets
because that should be avoided at all
cost I'm going to put in my semicolons
after my import statement save that and
reload and you're going to see that all
the different things have changed here
text change to white and here you're
going to see for this other heading tag
that has changed to white in the
background change to black also if we
come down here we can see that our
paragraphs all change the blue based off
of our defining that right there if you
want to focus in and change everything
across the entire document you're just
going to put in a star and let's say
that I want to define my font family
this is how you would define your font
and let's say I want my default font
across everything to be Arial black I
would put that inside of quotes anytime
we have spaces inside of font names
we're going to put them inside of quotes
and then we're going to define other
defaults for font wise that may exist if
the first font that we define does not
show up and we can save that reload and
you're going to see all the fonts change
right there everywhere that's what the
store does for us if I instead just
wanted to change everything that lies
inside of a div let's just copy calling
family I would just type this and then
font family and let's say anything
inside of a div I want to be Comic Sans
type in comic sans ms make sure you
close that off of that quote and then I
could do anything it doesn't have to
follow any real guidelines just whatever
I put inside of here and whenever you
only have one statement in here you can
either put the semicolon in or leave it
out I'm going to leave it in there and
reload and now you're going to see that
this right here lies inside of a div so
all of those links all of a sudden as
well as everything down here is all
going to be changed to Comic Sans if I
flip over to the HTML here for a second
and we come down here we can see here we
defined a class for this link right here
and if we want to focus in and change
styling just on classes we are going to
type in a period and then the name of
said class so that was site link and
let's just stick to the old font family
guy and let's say that we want the
default to be
giorgia or sarah that's how we can find
that and reload and you're going to see
that change right there and as we make
changes in the style sheet anything that
overrides what is up here is going to
overwrite it so it's going to continue
to cascade down and change as things go
on that's pretty much where the term
cascading comes from I wanted to come in
here and change the Tony quote in this
situation this does not have a class but
it has an ID as you can see right here
ID if I want to focus in and change
styling on an ID I put a hash symbol in
and then Tony quote right like this and
I could change the font family on this
let's say I wanted to licinia sans
unicode' Orla Cydia grand and then
sans-serif I can do that make sure we go
and put a semicolon here at the end
because we're going to make multiple
changes here and let's say that I want
the color of this guy to be black I can
do that and you can see it changed if I
wanted to go in and change site links or
classes name site links only inside of
paragraphs I would type in P for the
paragraphs and then site link and I
could come in and change my font family
again I'm on purpose making all these
font names different just so you can see
the most common types of fonts you're
going to be able to use right out of the
box on any browser and there's book
Antiqua Palatino or serif and then let's
say that I want to have my default color
be black reload and now you can see
right here this font right there change
to Palatino Linotype and if we flip over
here come down here you can see this has
a class name of site link and it's a
paragraph so that's the reason that that
changed and the other ones did not
likewise let's say that I wanted to come
in here and change Tony Robbins so let's
bounce over here and here we can see
Tony Robbins is right here and it is
inside of a span that has the ID of Tony
name well how are we going to target IDs
well we're going to use a hash symbol
and then if we want to specifically
target this span we're going to come
over here we're going to say span we
want to target any span on the screen
with the ID of Tony name and we'll be
able to go in there and change that and
let's change the font family again
Times New Roman
which I'm sure you've seen before and as
this continues we're going to get into
crazier things I just want to start off
with the simple things here first and
there's times and there's Sarah once
again and then just to make that stand
out a little bit better let's change
that to blue and now you can see Tony
Robins name change right there now let's
say we wanted to target an ID of
tutorials let's come over here and look
at this there's an ID for tutorials and
then we wanted to specifically target
ordered lists right there and items in
those ordered lists well we would go
tutorials because that is an ID and then
ordered lists and then list items now
we'll be able to come in there change
those to purple and you can see they're
purple now I could also go in and target
the unordered list these guys right here
by doing likewise tutorials unordered
lists list items and let's give those
the text color of green just to make
those stand out a little bit different
and now they're green now let's say I
want to do something a little bit
weirder like I want to target this
paragraph that's right here that follows
the favorite video games right here
that's inside of an h3 tag so it's
bounced over and look at that here's an
h3 tag and I want to target the
paragraph that comes immediately after
it what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go h3 + paragraph and let's change the
font style to this to italic and you can
see it's now italic maybe then let's say
that I want to come in here and
specifically target this link that
follows after the h3 tag and is inside
of a paragraph well I'm going to do
something quite simple Amanda go to h3
when a target the paragraph comes after
it and then I want to target the link
that is inside a said paragraph read and
now that's read just trying to show you
all the different ways of targeting
things let's say that I wanted to target
every single paragraph that has a class
there we go go like this
and let's say that I want to change the
background color for all those guys to
gray let's so many paragraphs I have
with a class well there's that one I
guess there's only one of them and then
we could also come in and target
specifically paragraphs I don't know
that have an ID now let's change the
background color for those into yellow
and you can see the Toni quote up here
turn yellow let's bounce over the HTML
again let's say that we want to target
anything with the alt of Nintendo say
anything
and then we'll say alt do this little
squiggly well make sure it says alt do
our little squiggly equal to and then
we'll say a Nintendo and we can come in
here change the background to orange and
you can see if I take that semicolon out
of there and reload it it's still going
to work and you can see here how
everything's highlighted in orange so
there's a quick rundown of how to target
all sorts of different things and we'll
get into more of them as the tutorial
continues now I'd like to talk about the
difference between borders margins and
padding's well the border is going to be
surrounding all of your content and it
is going to be the outside of whatever
padding you define so here is going to
be your content your text your images
your whatever then you're going to have
your padding then you're going to have
your border and then you're going to
have your margin now let's go in and
start playing with us as you can see it
went in here and created some lorem
ipsum text and I'm going to demonstrate
a whole bunch of different font
properties and a whole bunch of other
different things let's jump into the
style sheet what I'm going to really
focus in here first off is this
paragraph with the ID of lorem and we're
going to play around with margins and
padding's and all that different stuff
now it's an ID so of course I'm going to
type in a hash symbol like this now if I
wanted to find my padding I can do it in
numerous different ways as you can see
bottom right top and left all pop-up
right there if I wanted to change the
padding right on one line I could say 10
pixels and that would be at the top was
where I'm going to put my padding
another 10 pixels is going to be on the
right another 10 pixels is going to be
at the bottom another 10 pixels is going
to be on the left side of screen so it
goes in a circle sort of like a clock if
I however would get rid of these and
let's say that I change this to 25
pixels what that is saying is I want my
top to be 10 pixels
I want the right and left to be 25
pixels and I want the bottom to be 10
pixels if however I change this to just
two of these this is saying that I want
my top and bottom to have a padding of
10 pixels and my right and left have a
padding of 25 pixels not really
necessarily something you need to
memorize but something you can talk
about anyway so like I said we could
also come in here and do padding talk
and let's say I wanted to do
20 pixels for that I could then come in
and do padding bottom like this and
let's say that I also want that to be 25
or 20 pixels and there we go there is 20
pixels and if we reload it you can see
that the padding has indeed changed it's
going to show up a little bit better
though whenever we talk about borders so
we might as well just go in here and
talk about margins and then we'll talk
about borders we can define our margins
in much the same way as I talked about
before if we have four here the first
one's going to define the top the right
bottom and left in that specific order
if we have three it's going to target
the top right and left than bottom and
if I only have two it's going to be the
top bottom and then the left and the
right I'm just going to come in here and
define margin like this and say 10
pixels won't we come in and then mess
around with our borders and here I'm
going to do something a little bit
funkier let's say I want to come in and
define my border for the top and have it
be five pixels that's going to be the
border size for the line I can have it
be solid and then let's go and throw in
a hex code and I showed you where I get
all my hex codes there from the wiki
colors area and if I reload it you can
see it is a solid blue line I could then
come in and define my border bottom and
you can see you can also come in and
define the width of the lines and all
that stuff all in separate little tags
but I never do that and pretty much
nobody else ever does otherwise I could
also type in dotted instead of my common
solid define a left border and let's
make this dashed and then finally my
border right and have this be five
pixels and double it's going to be a
double line and close that off and there
you can see all the different borders
over here on the right side of the
screen the other different line types
are going to be able to use is none
dotted - solid double groove Ridge inset
and out set and I leave it to you to
play around with those and that leaves
us into the background remember we are
inside of this paragraph with the idea
of lorem if I'm going to change the
background color for that I can just
type in background and then throw in
some type of background right like that
to keep it very simple there went just
real subtle color I could also come in
to the background area and well you
could leave a color inside of there I
could also type in a URL to an image so
let's say repeat and then
to find repeat like this and reload it
you can see it has like a stone
background there and now the text is
completely illegible we could change the
color of the text of course to white to
see if that changes and makes that look
any better and it does a little bit but
not really just pull that image out
there randomly you could also define how
these images would be repeated so repeat
is just going to be repeated to the
horizontal level as well as the vertical
you could also type in repeat - X if you
just wanted the image to repeat to the
horizontal plane you could type - y if
you wanted it to just repeat up-and-down
or you could type in no-repeat just make
sure that you put the little dash inside
of there another thing we could do is we
could go into the background area and
define the position of whatever images
in the background to be either in the
left top bottom or right and this would
be in situations in which we are not
going to repeat and I'll get a little
bit more into the other different ways
we can mess around with the background
as the tutorial continues and I'm just
going to go in here and paste in a whole
bunch of different font property as you
can see here font style font variant
font weight font size and all the other
different options that are available
there's font height as well and if I
save that and bounce over here you can
see all of them defined and they all
have their own ID and if I reload it
you're going to see all the different
stylings that are available to us so
font-style:normal is just going to look
normal then you have italic then you
have oblique which looks almost
identical to italic font variant normal
variant small caps font-weight:normal
font and there's lighter and there's
medium there's extra extra small there's
also an extra small here small extra
extra large large and there is font size
set at 200% if you bounce over here and
look at the style sheet and come down
here you can see exactly how all of
those are defined 10 1 spend too much
time on them of course all of this is
available in the description now it's
bouncing here and take a look at some
different ways we can position things
once again I have all of the HTML here
we're going to focus in on it very first
thing I'm going to focus in on here is
this parent div once again an ID so
we're going to use a hash symbol and I'm
going to say a parent div in the
stylesheet and let's say that I want
the background color for that div speed
change to that color and then let's say
that I also want to come in and define a
border and let's go in and change this
border to zero points 1 a.m. and as well
even though I talked about it in my
html5 tutorial
why don't I talk about the different
unit types that are available to us in
CSS basically the different unit types
you're going to see all the time is
going to either be pixels points EMS or
% pixels are normally going to be used
whenever you want to represent pixels on
a device just like you would think
points are mainly going to be used in
print media in which 72 points is going
to be roughly equal to one inch you're
going to see points all the time with
fonts
eeehm is going to be equal to whatever
the current font size is for your
document and percent is going to be the
current font size equal to 100% so
whatever the current font size is the
percent is going to be at a hundred
percent is going to be equal to that
percentage and as we see these in
examples they're going to make a lot
more sense another thing that I should
cover is the difference between block
elements and inline elements to simplify
this greatly just think of block
elements as elements that have a break
statement after them so after they go on
your web page there's going to be a
break that's going to jump to the next
line and then inline elements are not
going to contain those breaks and as you
can see block quotes bodies breaks
statements of course divs footers h1
tags headers paragraphs bodies tables
things that are known for being quite
large are all going to be block elements
which once again just means there's
going to be a break
well inline elements like links
everybody knows there's links inline
inside of paragraphs of other different
data and so forth font tags which of
course would not cause a line break
images which also by default don't cause
line breaks and things that you would
expect to show up in the body of your
text without going and causing all sorts
of other problems like spans are all
going to be your inline element so your
block elements going to be like big
giant boxes while your inline elements
are going to think be things that just
flow with the rest of the data on your
screen sorry go covered most of the
basics now let's say we also want to
target the
default ID and go and give that a
background color as well like this and
then if we reload you're going to see
exactly how those are changed basically
just threw a border around them and if
we jump over here we can see here is the
div that I was focusing in on and I went
and gave it a color of gray right here
and then you can see for the default
part which is just this very first part
inside of this div I went and change the
background color to blue so yes it's
possible to go in and override just
parts of different elements inside of
other elements let's say I also want to
come in here and target this id centered
very simple just goes centered so I want
to change the background color to that
and let's say that I want to come in and
change the width on that and here we'll
use 50% and I also want to change the
margin to auto which means it's going to
have an equal amount of space on the
right and the left yes indeed I can do
that and you can see here is the width
that I defined which is going to be 50%
of the total area that's any enclosing
parent provides for this element and
then it's going to Center it thereafter
if I did text the line I could also have
centered show up inside of there and
while we just do that here I'm going to
target centered text like this and then
show the difference between text align
and center and reload it and now you're
going to see that that text went and
centered itself I'm going to come over
here and get rid of this and demonstrate
absolute positioning so let's get rid of
all this altogether basically absolute
positioning is just going to be
positioning based on the document itself
so I want to target a div with the name
top left position and let's say I want
the background I can use color as well
and change the background color on that
and we can come in and change the border
on this as well and here we're going to
position it absolutely so we have to say
that and then we're going to find our
width once again top left position come
in here and look at it this is this guy
right here and it is a div that we're
going to need to be positioning
absolutely we come in and define the
width of it as well as the height for it
and also we can find the z-index and the
element on your page that has the
highest number of set for the z-index is
going to be the element that shows up on
top so let's set this to 4
if we reload that you can see it shows
up right there now let's zoom in on the
bottom right parent part and reposition
that so that's this guy right here this
div right here that is inside of this
div that we just positioned so if I want
to change its positioning I just go
bottom right tl parent so I'm going to
move it to the top left of this parent
how do I do that let's change its
background color again make sure you set
the position to absolute again and then
let's say we want it to be in the bottom
right hand corner set this to zero
pixels and if we went in the bottom
right hand corner we set that to zero
pixels and reload it and boom you're
going to see that it popped down there
let's say that I then want to also get
this div right here top right position
div and put it in the top right corner
inside of my webpage again just target
it top right position and these names
mean nothing they're just names that I
pulled out of a hat and then if I want
it to be positioned in the upper right
hand corner I'm going to say top zero
pixels and then right
once again zero pixels reload you're
going to see that shows up there and the
z-index is the reason why this shows up
on top of this value item right here
then of course I could go and target
another div let's just copy this in this
situation it is bottom left TR for top
right parent and then if I want to show
up in the bottom left-hand corner of
that element I can just do that and
reload it there you can see it's parent
and you can also see how that flows so
it's a little bit messy but I just
wanted to cover that exactly how
absolute positioning works in a real
bizarro way let's get rid of these guys
and let's talk about fixed positioning
rid of all of it and fixed positioning
is going to be positioning that's going
to be based off of our browser so in
this situation I'm going to target this
paragraph right here which is fixed POS
and we can go fixed - POS and whether
the page Scrolls or not it is going to
stay exactly where it is so let's just
make the position fixed on that we want
it in the top part of the screen we're
going to have to set that to zero top
left again zero and then if we would go
down from there would move around on
screen we could set the width to fill up
the whole entire top of the screen by
making one hundred-percent define a
background color for that I also want to
come in
to find a border and then let's throw in
a margin of zero to make sure that it
also butts up against top the screen and
reload and you can see I'm staying right
here is right there and whether I scroll
it or not it is not going to move that's
an example of fixed positioning talk
about relative positioning which is just
going to be positioning an element
relative to where it originally was on
the screen and now we're just left with
relative one and relative to with some
lorem ipsum here it's go in and target
those guys so relative one and there you
go there's relative layout relative
layout two and all this other stuff
we're going to reposition all of it
change the background color on it let's
change the border on it make it black
and give it a height of 100 pixels let's
just go in here and do this same sort of
thing for a relative to in this
situation we're going to use a
positioning of relative if I want to
make it go to 20 pixels to the right of
where it originally was I just type in
left and 20 pixels and then if I want to
have it be 30 pixels up or down from its
original if I wanted it to be up from
the original I would say negative 30
pixels but let's just let that be 30 or
like that make it go down instead so it
would be 30 down from where it was go in
and give it a width of 300 pixels
background color let's change this to
yellow and get rid of the height and
then look up here to how this is going
to change and there you can see relative
to went and moved down here there's
relative layout right there so that is
how we're going to relatively move an
element based off of where it originally
was this element right here was
originally over here in this space right
there another thing we can do is we can
take this little brain image right here
and float it to either the left to the
right and let's go in here and look for
a little brain there's a little brain
right here it's embedded inside of this
paragraph tag so we're going to target
it by looking specifically for the
source that's right there and to do that
we can say image with a source equal to
little brain ping and say that we want
those to be floated to the left and then
we could also throw in some padding of
10 pixels so that looks a little bit
neat and reload and you can see it fit
in there real nice now let's take a look
at clipping and we're going to be
clipping these different brain images
over
on the left side or the right side of
your screen you can just see there they
are they're divs with little images
inside of them very simple so if we want
to come in here and specifically this
time we're going to be targeting classes
so you can see all these are classes
that we're going to be targeting so
we're going to go div dot little brain
clip this is going to be the very first
one and let's do some positioning
absolutely define a width on this of 100
pixels we're going to make the width be
a little bit short from what it is and
if we want to define exactly how we're
going to clip this we're going to draw a
rectangle and we're going to define the
top part of it so we'll say zero pixels
here so we start at the very top then
the right we're going to say we want to
clip 50 pixels over 50 pixels down again
it's going to go clockwise just like
always and then zero pixels for the left
then we'll go in and focus on another
one of these guys little brain small and
you're also going to see over here
didn't point this out we're going to be
able to define multiple different
classes inside of here just by just by
putting class and then inside of the
quotes multiple different class names we
want to be able to edit so this guy
we're going to shrink the size of the
divs so the image is going to be able to
fit so let's go in and define our height
of 50 pixels and you can see the brains
are slowly disappearing I'm going to
make them come back though here I'm
going to come in and focus in on
overflow:visible and whatever that's set
what this is basically saying is the
part of the image that doesn't fit in
the div it's going to show anyway so
let's go in and do that do
overflow:visible go to top 100 pixels
and then overflow:visible there you can
see another brain pop back in here we
can then define and overflow:hidden
which is basically going to say that the
hidden part isn't going to show and
define our top as 200 pixels
overflow:hidden like this and reload and
now you can see just part of it shows
and then for the final one I'm going to
show you how scroll works basically it's
going to hide everything but it's going
to allow you to scroll so let's say top
let's set this to 300 pixels and then
have overflow set for scroll like that
reload and now you can see you can
scroll through the image even though it
doesn't totally appear so something you
might not use all the time but wanted to
cover it just to be completionist now
let's cover some html5 things like using
header tags and navigation tags and main
and sections and all that and combine
that with some css3 I'm going to do
first here is to find some different
ways that I want my links to change
inside of my documents based off of the
fence so anytime a link is hovered over
for example we can say that I want to
change my color for that to blue I could
also come in and if it is the active
link on our screen could change the
color in that situation to red and then
finally if it has been visited we could
change the color on that this grayish
color another thing I didn't cover
before if you want to put comments
inside of CSS files just put a forward
slash in a star and whatever your
comment is and close it with a star and
a forward slash if we want to change our
body tag background color do it that
quickly and you're going to see all the
colors change there I do however have a
div with the name of rapper this guy
right here so if I want to focus in and
change that so that all the background
color behind everything inside of my
page is going to actually show up with a
value of white I can do so here let's
say that I also want this to be
automatically centered
I just put Auto inside of there for
margin for my wrapper remember I want to
change my background color to white so
we can read this a little bit better and
then I can also define my width for my
wrapper as well as the height for my
wrapper and now you can see that reloads
and you can also see the background
right there so let's make all this other
stuff a little bit neater here so
padding is used so things don't sort of
butt up against each other in the header
section which is where I have my little
icon let's say that I want this to
display as a block element instead of a
regular inline element like it is I just
type in display:block
and then I can come in and decide that I
want to put some padding inside of here
yeah let's just let everything be zero
and say that I want just the bottom
padding
to be 10 pixels now you can see that
move down I could then go in and target
the website logo that has that ID and go
padding once again five pixels remember
that's for the top zero pixels for the
right zero pixels for the bottom and
then five pixels for the left side of
the screen to make that pop off the edge
and there it did now let's focus in on
the navigation part which is these guys
right here these links they have the ID
of horizontal nav say I want them to be
displayed as block elements throw some
padding inside of these guys so they're
going to be basically padding between
the different links five pixels bottom
and zero pixels on the left side and
then I'll throw a background color as
well of black on those see how that
change now I want to get rid of those
underlines make this a little bit more
readable so if I want to focus in on the
underlines well the underlines are going
to the links not to horizontal nav so we
have to specifically target the links
inside a horizontal nav to get rid of
those underlines text-decoration change
that to none that's the underlined let's
go ahead and put a twenty pixels only on
the left side of each one of those links
so that they don't butt up against each
other there they are if I want to change
and add a hover to those links again
target the div that surrounds them and
then link hover and define a new text
color for those situations there you go
if I hover over them you can see that
they change a different color of blue
and it's change this text color right
here to white so they show up a little
bit better so it's not the prettiest
thing and worth but it's getting better
now let's focus in on the main content
of our page throw in some padding on
this guy let's float everything in main
to the left side of the screen like we
covered previously and then let's make
the width 600 pixels I could say things
are floating a little bit better if you
look over here on the right side of your
screen you're going to see sidebar items
let's say I want those to line up a
little bit better let's just keep those
on the screen like that I can target
sidebar throw in some padding let's
float that to the right side of the
screen since the main content area is
floated to the left define a width of
150 pixels to accommodate those size
let's just set our height to auto and
let's give it a
from background color to make it stand
out a little bit and if we bounce over
here you can see that sidebar item has
been added in let's bounce over here and
see what else we can play around with
there's an h2 tag let's say I want to
change the size of that of course I can
just type in h2 change font size to 1
a.m.
looks a little bit nicer focus in on
this first paragraph right here
play around with text align of word
spacing so that again is going to be a
ID so I just put a hash symbol in there
text a line and let's make that left and
this is either going to line the text to
the left center or the right and then
word spacing is going to define the size
of the space between our words so let's
say we change that to 0.5
eeehm and watch how that changes see how
the words are more spread out left one
is going to do anything because all rate
was a left-aligned by default we could
go and change this to target the second
paragraph and align it to the right get
rid of the word spacing so you can see
the difference say a little bit tighter
go in here to paragraph three text the
line to the center now that's to the
center this is to the right say we could
also indent so throw this in there for
the fourth paragraph and let's do a text
indent of two e/m what just got right
here see how it end ended we could also
change letter spacing which is going to
change the space between letters do this
paragraph five letter spacing change
that to 0.5 e/m and I can see how much
bigger that is here we have our footer
down here if we want to make sure that
nothing is going to show up next to our
footer let's go in here type in clear
that guarantees nothing is going to but
up next to our footer change background
black so it shows up a little bit better
text color change this to white change
the padding to 10 pixels all around
reload there it is now we play around
with these different guys over here
these different list items there are
numerous different list items you can
use you use circle disk lower Lattin
lower Greek upper Latin upper Greek
square or you could use a URL like this
and then whatever your picture name is
ping like that then put this inside of
quotes let's go in here and change this
let's target the sidebar which is a
named sidebar list change the list style
type change it to lower
and you can also define how the lists
markers should be set up inside of the
list item content boxes by default the
list item this guy right here is set up
to be outside of the position when the
list items are displayed on the screen
here I'll show you list style position
let's do outside and then we'll do
inside for the other one so you can see
the difference
side bar list 2 is going to be the guy
underneath of it let's set this for
inside then we'll change this to upper
roam and just cover something else see
when we have it inside that is basically
you can see that the difference between
the distance there and the distance
there and how that lines up so inside
make sure that those list items are
bounced inside so that they line up that
way and otherwise if you list them as
outside they're going to be outside of
the box something is just used for basic
alignment another thing we can do is we
can target that we want certain data to
show up before elements and so let's say
for this paragraph here we wanted to put
a star before the paragraph begins let
me say paragraph and then para - 1 is
its name and before it if we want to
slip some content inside of there we say
content I'm gonna be using this a lot
and let's say I wanted to put a star
inside of there now you can see the star
shows up right there I could also do a
very similar thing have it show up after
any element so again for the paragraph
at the very end of it if I want to slip
content inside of it let's say I want to
put an @ symbol for some strange reason
and now you're going to see an @ symbol
shows up right there another thing we
could do is auto generate numbers
content so let's say we have all these
different lists right here we want to
auto generate a number that's going to
appear before those well I know this guy
favorite movies is an h3 tag bounce over
here and just look at that yep you can
see this is an h3 tag and this is an h3
tag and these are all h4 tags so what
I'm going to do is I have the setup so
that I can number them because they all
share a common element type said I'd be
covering just about everything so here
we go h3 tag
let's go font size let's make this 90m
first then I have to define the name for
the variable that's going to increment
in this situation I'm going to give it
the name of num you're going to see here
in a second how this works out I do a
very similar thing for all the h4 tag
once again these are the h3 tags
favorite movies and others and then
these are the h4 tags all these lists
inside of there you'll see how they
number and let's just change the font
size again just so that they show up a
little bit different so when 70 M I have
to give it a new counter increment name
and in this one I'm going to call it sub
and let's say that I want them to
increment by 2 I would do that by a
increment by 1 by default and just doing
this just to have things show up a
little bit different then I have to
actually define how they're going to
work so again I want to target before
the h3 tag so I go d4 like that and then
if I want to slip content inside of
there I go content and then I go counter
like this and then the number I want to
show up inside of there and if I want to
put space there you can do that and then
I can do a very similar thing for the h4
tag to generate or auto generate
numbered content change out the h4
before and I'm going to say number dot
period right there and then counter if I
want to get the value it's in sub and
then put space after that do that I
reload you're going to see what it does
say auto-generated that one and then you
can see that these are incrementing by
twos 2 4 6 8 10 12 it's just something a
little bit weird might come in handy
another thing we can do there are
numerous what are called CSS facade oh
classes I'm going to show you a couple
of them right here and they basically
are going to allow us to style
individual weird elements
so let's come in here let's say inside
of paragraph 2 I want to have the first
letter be capitalized or larger than all
the rest I can do that so I just have to
target paragraph 2 right like this and
if I want to target the first letter I
can do so and then I can say font size
and let's say I want it to be bigger
than it is
let's change that to 25 points and there
you can see the I grew in size show you
a couple more of these let's say in
paragraph 3 the first line and this is
going to be the first line it's not
going to be up until a period or
anything let's say I want this to be set
to a background color of yellow I can do
that
boom say change thiele I can even color
in the first child span inside of a
document or the first of anything inside
of an element so if I wanted to target
let's say a span that is the first shot
inside of an argument or inside of a
document I just go there you are
spam first job and I can change the
background color again let's in this
situation let's say that we want it to
be orange and there you can see covered
up the very first band in the document
orange I could also select every
paragraph element that is the last child
of its parent I go in paragraph last
child you do this for any of the
elements last child change that color
reload there you can see went and got
the last child paragraph colored at that
tan color and these just go on and on
forever I'll show you this one this is
going to allow us to sit check these or
select the second child span so and
child to and of course you can put three
four or five whatever you want to put
inside of there and you can see it went
in colored this guy that same tan color
we had before let's say you wanted to
have a hover effect on all of your h3
tags so that whenever they're hovered
over they change to orange for some
reason you do that so it's not just tied
to links you can do it to any of your
different elements as long as you target
them other things kind of neat is we can
change our cursor so let's look at
something here here we go we have a span
with the IDF common quote whenever we
put our mouse over that we're going to
have the cursor change so we'll call
this common quote change the cursor to a
pointer and there you can see whenever I
put my cursor over that it changes right
like this and the different cursors that
are available to you our pointer
crosshair move text weight progress help
and of course you're also going to be
able to define your custom cursors so
whatever that is right like that with
URL if you'd like to another thing we
could do is draw a box around an element
so let's say the fourth paragraph we
have here one two three four let's say
I'm going to draw a box around that just
target that for like this call outline
say I want it to be two pixels and let's
make it solid blue there you can say
it's outline it could also come in and
draw a border in a very similar fashion
so for paragraph five let's do border
instead two pixels solid and let's make
it black this time reload it now you can
see how that shows up now let's do
something a little bit neat let's go and
create some buttons okay so as you can
see right here I have a list called
button
and each one of them has a class of
sight button and I'm also going to do
sort of a slideshow type of thing over
here to demonstrate some other effects
you can have so I'm going to target the
buttons list that I have there and let's
go and give them a width of 150 pixels
like that target a specific item with
the class name of site button like that
could do text align you can do anything
text align with that of course let's
make it Center say I want to give it a
margin bottom five pixels so that those
are divided up and then let's say that I
want to come in and specifically target
the links inside of those and have those
displayed as block elements and let's
say that I want the color on that to be
white for those buttons and of course we
want to get rid of the text decoration
because we don't want those to be
underlined custom style for the link
have this be backgrounds set for blue
and then also give it a border of five
pixels solid blue and then whenever it's
hovered over just paste that in there
slight button a:hover let's change the
background color on this again I don't
know something that'll really show up
like green and let's let the border be
the same paste that in there and there
you can see are the little links middle
menus and whatever you hover over them
they change to green so that's sort of a
way of making buttons I have these
little pictures down here let's turn
these into a sort of like a slideshow
type of thing so that whenever we hover
over these different images they'll show
up so we'll go DL and kids pix this if
we look at them over here there's kid
pics I have a list and then each of the
list items is going to contain an image
with a width and a height these are
going to be the thumbnails and also are
going to contain another image is going
to be the larger version I give this the
class of hidden and they're all going to
be hidden by default your going to see
here exactly how that works out a image
hidden let's go and find the visibility
so that they do not show up by default
they're only going to show up whenever
we hover over the smaller items position
and let's say we want this to be
absolute make sure we spell it right
position it from the left 110 pixels so
we're only going to be positioning
the large items and they're going to be
hidden by default and then top I don't
know what this is going to be let's make
it like 400 pixels we'll see what it
looks like later and then if we want
them to show up whenever the link is
hovered over
that's the little thumbnail we just go
visibility and make it visible where
does it show up at and here you can see
there is the image there shows up right
there we would want this to be lined up
down here of course but if we hover over
it you can see how the pictures change
so just trying to show you everything
humanly possible now we can see some
examples of text decoration here is
underlined and of course this would be
underlined this would be lined through
just like we have there there's over
line and lowercase these were previously
uppercase as you can see if we come over
here see lowercase and we change in the
lowercase uppercase is going to make all
the letters uppercase and capitalized is
just going to capitalize the first
letter as you can see there so there is
text-decoration:underline line through
over line and text transform lowercase
uppercase and capitalized now we'll go
in here and we'll preserve any white
space that we have in these guys you can
see here the white space is not
preserved and here see there's white
space here so let's go and fix that it's
actually kind of easy to do we just go
and type in the ID name and that is
white space - pre and if we want to
preserve the white space just go white
space like this and pre and it does
exactly what you would think it would do
we could also set this up so that the
white space will collapse however there
will not be any line breaks unless you
actually put a line break inside of it
and that's white space and nowrap
so basically no rap is going to say that
we're not going to have line breaks and
if you watch this guy you're going to
see that that happens say goes on
forever and ever and ever we could of
course preserve the rap by typing pre
rap in there for white space and
reloading it and as you can see right
there there's white space and it's also
going to rap and lastly we're going to
also be able to define how our text is
laid out so let's say we want to go from
left to right we would define Direction
like this and just type in ltr' left to
right and also we could go in and do a
similar thing in this situation we're
going to call this right - left and then
here this will be our tea
Ehle and you can say that that worked as
well now let's go in and edit some
tables so that we just have the tables
on the screen and let's define some
generic table properties here give it a
width of 600 pixels we can define where
we want our caption to show ups caption
side and we'll have this be top we can
define text alignment and have this be
Center so every column is centered and
let's define a border as well make it
solid and black
reload and you can see all of the tables
have been set that way we could of
course come in and add some borders this
will affect everything of course every
table any way to pixel solid in black
now you can see all those different
parts are going to be bordered and we
could also give everything a fixed size
the table layout fixed like that you can
also see that this shows up even though
there's no information in that specific
table well this guy right here is fixed
and no matter how big the text is inside
of here it's going to remain fixed
however for the table right here let's
go down so you can say see here there's
nothing in there if we want specifically
to have that collapse what we're going
to do is say table spacing is the ID for
that and we can go order spacing 10
pixels and 15 pixels and in this
situation board spacing is going to
apply 10 pixels of space on the left and
right and 15 pixels on the top and the
bottom and then we can also say that we
want to hide anything that's empty so
empty cells and hide and then we could
also collapse our border so a border
collapse and then just type in collapse
you watch the change and there you can
see it there's a couple different ways
to play around with tables I'm going to
be playing around with some divs as you
can see right here we just have some
blocks inside of here and these are all
just divs that's it and we're going to
style them to add in some different
blurring effects and so forth and so on
so I went and created some generic divs
right here some borders and so forth
it's go in and do like a drop shadow
effect on this div and to do that you
just go box shadow like that and you're
going to have your horizontal position
the offset so I'm going to go five
pixels to the right five pixels down the
blur amount I'll just have that be five
pixels size of my shadow let's say to
pick
and the color that I want to use for it
I'm going to say gray and you can see
that that shows up right there let's go
into a couple more of these this one's
going to be div 2 this time I'm going to
create an inner shadow so we could
pretty much leave everything exactly the
same except I'm going to say inset like
that and there's an inner shadow and
then also let's say we want to do like a
glow effect well what we would do with
that is say div 3 and we would set both
of these to 0 so the first two are going
to be 0 and this is going to give like a
glow effect because there's not going to
be an offset we can change this to 10
pixels to make that sure that shows up
and change this to 5 pixels again these
are the same this is going to be the
blur amount and this is going to be the
size of the shadow and I guess a yellow
would look better as a glow effect so
there we are
and relive and there you can see it's
sort of glows now let's go in and add a
drop shadow to this text right here went
and automatically created this and add
it in a font just to shave a little bit
of time I can just go do four and here
we want to use a text shadow and again
we're going to say let's say two pixels
to the right two pixels down three
pixels is going to represent the blur
amount and then let's say we also want
that to be gray and while we're inside
of here let's also go and define div
four or div five in this situation text
shadow as well and if I want to add a
glow effect I'll just turn these to zero
see there's no inset da da da da and
change the CGL well there we are
and reload and there you can see is the
drop shadows and the glow now let's mess
around with RGB colors once again the
only thing I did here was floated
everything to the left and Here I am
going to define my background but
instead of using hash codes I'm going to
use RGB red green blue
I want a red of zero just let zero and
this is going to give me a bluish color
I could also come in here and change the
opacity for the next one in line so just
do this and change this to seven and
change this to eight we're going to do
all of them of course I want to change
the opacity to this you can actually do
it a couple difficult two different ways
there's opacity let's say I want to be
50% there it is now it's 50% and I could
also go RG
be a alpha opacity same sort of thing
and here change that to five and reload
it and now you can see how those show up
let's go and also do something similar
with hue saturation and lightness change
this to nine change this to hue
saturation lightness 2:05 bluish type of
color 100% set the lightness to 50% also
be able to add alpha into this for the
next one so let's say we want that to be
50% alpha or opacity and reload it and
there you're going to see all those
different colors for the next one I'm
going to set it up so that we can
actually round the corners I previously
had this all marked off let's go and get
rid of this and let's round the corners
on these divs as well as create circles
and tabs do that we just go do 11 and
then we're going to go border-radius and
change this to 30 pixels that's going to
round it create a round rectangle and if
you round it enough it's actually going
to look like a circle so just change
that to 50 and then for this last one
let's say we want to just round one
corner we would go order say we want to
do the top right top right radius and
then let that be 30 pixels there you can
say that's exactly what they did now for
the next one I'm actually going to put a
background image inside of here so
background image said I would cover this
in the past so URL and I have an TT logo
ping like that could also layer the
backgrounds so let's say we want to do
14 and we could do that with background
size and let's say that we wanted our
image to be 200% so we say 200% both
horizontal and vertical and then let's
say that we also want it to be 50 so
that it's going to have multiple
versions of that background image
squashed in there at 50% and change this
to 15 and reload and you can see there
it sumed in at 200 and there it fit my
background image in four times because
they divided it up 50 percent okay so
now we're going to get into some fun
things we're going to talk about
gradients and animations and interacting
with different elements on your screen
as you can see I'm in CSS Tut 8 dot HTML
right here and style sheet 8 CS
if you want to get these and play around
with them on your own I just have a
whole bunch of dibs over in the HTML
file where we're going to be getting
into are some odd types of different
ways of using css3 they're implemented
different in different browsers and you
can see here our browser prefixes Moz is
for Firefox MS is for internet explorer
OS for opera and WebKit is for both
Chrome and Safari and I created a
generic div here with - weight and
margins and borders you can see them
over here and the very first thing I'm
going to do is create a gradient and you
can see here all of the different
prefixes for all of the different
browsers and to create a gradient what
you would define is the direction the
gradient is going to be going in this is
45 degrees and then you're going to have
color stops and it's going to shift
between red yellow and blue and if we
save that and reload it you can see
there's your gradient now you can also
define that your direction is going to
come in a different way meaning that
you'll be able to define the direction
as left right top or bottom and you're
still going to use the same exact color
stops in here you can see if I want to
go from the left top like that I can do
so and save it and reload it and now it
goes in the opposite direction another
way we could do gradients and I just
wanted to go through this really quickly
as you can also define how much of these
total space each of the grading is going
to take up so 20 30 and 60 and no those
don't need to add up to 100 and you can
just play around with them until you get
the type of gradient you're looking for
and another thing we can do with
gradients is actually repeat the
gradient over and over again so that it
looks sort of like a cylinder type of
shape and in that situation you would
put repeating linear like this instead
of regular linear like that again I'm
going to find I start in the left top
and then here I'm dividing up all the
space between the different color stops
and if we reload that you're going to
see that it has sort of like that
cylinder type of look as well and then
the final gradient we'll look at or
actually radial gradients and you'd find
those by typing in radial gradient
instead of linear gradient and again I'm
dividing those colors up based off of
just arbitrary numbers let's save that
and reload it and there you can see your
radial gradient which is a little bit
scary looking so there's different ways
we can play around
gradients and put them in backgrounds
inside of divs and you can use them for
a whole bunch of other different things
now I'm going to go in and actually show
you how you can interact with your
different elements to make them scale
and skew and move and do things like
that so let's start off with a basic
scale and again we're just going to type
in our prefix right here with transform
and then follow that up with scale by
two so we're going to say that we want
our element to scale by two and
specifically when we hover over it so
you can see there it went and it's
scaled I could probably move it and that
would look a little bit nicer but either
way that is how we can scale we can also
similarly come in here and rotate and
let's say I want to rotate this item 45
degrees whenever I hover over it you can
see that scale scaling and this is
rotating 45 degrees of course you can
Rio Tate it any way that you would like
we can also come in and skew items and
here we'll have a skewing based off of
the X direction and here based off of
the Y direction like I said play around
these things that would be the best way
to learn how they work and you can see
exactly how we can skew or item and then
we could also come in and move the item
so here I'm going to translate or move
it 20 pixels to the right and 20 pixels
down and you can see it's moving 20
pixels to the right and 20 pixels down
and next what we're going to do is sort
of animate a cube there you can see a
rectangle or a square that we have over
here and we're going to make the edges
round and at the same time change the
color you could say I just have a basic
div here with all this different things
here and you can define how you want to
transition from one thing to the next
and what we're going to be transitioning
to is a background of red from orange
and then the border radius is also going
to change and of course you can play
around and change all these things and
please do that it's a lot of fun
actually then what we need to do is
define exactly how we want to ease from
the orange and regular old square to the
rounded edge square and the color red
how we do that is with the prefix
followed by transition and then the
period of time we're going to take to
transition and then how exactly we're
going to transition you can see the
different types of transitions you have
right there you can see if I go and save
that and reload this we're going to
change the red and also round the edges
that's kind of a simple animation so now
we'll look at a little
more complicated in this one again we're
going to have a basic div right here and
then we'll be changing a whole bunch of
different things here we're going to be
moving this guy around on the screen and
how you do that is in this situation
we're going to use a WebKit way of
creating keyframes and then a standard
old syntax for creating keyframes as
well
and we're going to start this off with
at and then we're going to define all of
the keyframes so from the zero point to
25 to 50 to 75 to 100 and from each
transition we're going to change the
background color so this is going to be
the first transition and we're going to
start off with red then we're going to
slowly transition to change the
background color to yellow we're going
to move it to the right 200 pixels and
then we're going to move it to the right
200 pixels and down 200 pixels changing
the color and so forth and someone we're
doing exactly the same thing down here
and we're giving it the name example you
can see example where that shows up
right there then all we need to do is
define the duration of the complete
animation and the delay before the
animation starts and you're going to do
that the same no matter what type of
animation you are doing so after we have
that set up we can save it and reload
and you're going to see there it moves
whoop went off the screen and then it
came back down so we can come in here if
we wanted to make it go down instead of
going up we can change this to positive
200 and do the same exact thing right
here positive 200 and reload it and
there's a two second delay as you can
see moves over moves down moves left and
moves back to its current position
there's a look at a bunch of different
ways we can animate and interact with
different elements using cascading style
sheets and to clean up everything and
finish up everything I'd like to talk
for a second about all using alternative
style sheets we're also really a common
thing to be used we're going to here
define our default style and you can see
basically what we're focusing in on our
mobile or handheld and then a printable
version for your website as well as a
large text format for people that might
have trouble seeing and this is all
we're going to do we're going to define
a different media type we're going to
give it a different title that the user
will be able to switch between and then
of course point at a different style
sheet for each
the different options so now let's
continue on here and basically what I'm
going to do is show you different ways
to sort your content into different
columns this is pretty much the final
thing we would want to look at here so
what we have here is lorem ipsum text
over here and we have a basic height
width border and overflow in the
situation is saying that if the text is
bigger than the area that we are
defining for the element that it's going
to contain we want the overflow to be
hidden and you can see right there that
that indeed is happening now let's say
that we wanted to create some column
blocks that are going to take all this
information and sort it inside of those
columns again we're going to be using
the different prefixes for the different
browsers and let's say we want to take
all of the content that is in the ID of
lorem and sort it between four different
columns this is how we would do that and
we could bounce over here and reload it
and you're going to see indeed that it
went and sorted all that information if
we stretch this out there you can see
four columns and anything that goes
beyond that point of course is going to
be hidden because overflow is marked as
hidden we could also come in here and
define let's say we wanted to have lines
between all of this different content
well we could go lorem again and define
that we want little rules that are going
to be dashed and black into pixels wide
with column rule right like this and
reload it and you can see that those
little lines go in there another thing
we can do we have these guys down here
so it's bouncing over for a second just
to look at what we got here we have a
bunch of divs we have a big div called
container and then we have three
different divs inside of there we're
going to be able to define the amount of
space taken up by the elements in the
containing element that we have here and
we're going to be able to do that by
bouncing over here and defining our
containers height and width and border
and then we're going to define the
container as a WebKit box and this is
going to create what are called flexible
boxes for our content then what we just
need to do is focus in on the divs that
are inside of this main container div
and define exactly I'm just going to use
WebKit here just to keep this simple
because I'm using Chrome but you could
of course use the other ones and we'll
define
and this div right here specifically is
going to take up two of whatever the
total space is and then we're going to
do that for the other divs as well so
it's bounce in their bounce in their
change this to two and change this to
three and then let's say we want this to
be 2 and this to be 3 this is going to
take up the larger part of it and file
and save it and reload and there you can
see exactly how all of that space is
divvied up between all of the different
divs so there's a run-through of pretty
much everything you could ever want to
know about cascading stylesheets port 3
hope you guys enjoyed this it's a really
crazy tutorial that I didn't even know
if it would ever work out
but either way please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
