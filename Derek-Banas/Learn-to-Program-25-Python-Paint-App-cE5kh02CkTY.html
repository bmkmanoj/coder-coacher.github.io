of my learn to program series and this
part of the tutorial I'm going to finish
up my TK enter tutorial by creating a
fully functional Python paint
application and with what I cover here
and if you can go buying it with things
like the toolbar and the menu bar and
things like that you're going to be able
to make a totally fully functional paint
application and of course I'm going to
cover canvas and how you can draw on it
in numerous different ways all of the
code is available in the description
underneath of the video and I have a lot
to do so let's get into it alright so
the very first thing I'm going to do
here is import the things that I know
that I need so I'm going to need to can
enter and I'm also going to want to
write text on to the canvas and so to do
that I need to K enter fonts now I need
to think about all the things I'm going
to need to make so the very first thing
of course is I'm going to define my
class so there you go that's the very
first thing I want to do and what else
am I going to need I'm going to need to
define class variables and the name of
the class is going to be let's just go
and do that right now here just so that
we have something I'm going to call this
paint app and everything is going to be
inside of this one class all right
alright so now let's get into the meat
of how this is going to work well of
course everything's going to be
controlled by the mouse so I'm going to
need to know when the mouse button goes
up so I'm going to say catch mouse up
and likewise I'm also going to have to
catch whenever the mouse button goes
down maybe I should have done that in a
different order but whatever a hen's
what else do we need we also need to
catch we want to be able to allow them
to draw like a pencil tool so I'm going
to say that we need to catch mouse move
and the other things would will I just
said I want to draw with a pencil so I'm
going to whoops don't do that
let's go and draw with the pencil see
everything is all logically put together
so we don't have to think too much Oh
what else are we going to do well now
it's just the functionality I want them
to also be able to draw a line and I
also want to allow them to draw an arc
and that's also going to be like pie
shapes and things like that draw an oval
and everything just as I listed here is
going to be the functions that I create
inside of my class
draw a rectangle and draw text so I
wanted to do that and is there anything
else that I want to show you how to do
well finally I'll just say initialize
and there we go all right so those are
the different things that I need to
create here inside of my class to make
my paint application work so now what we
need to do is think about the type of
things that we're going to need to store
well one thing I need to know which one
of these things I'm going to be drawing
so it just makes sense that I just go
and create a class variable inside of
here and I'm going to call it drawing
tool and by default I'm going to put a
line in there and that of course will
change I'm going to keep this really
simple the changing of the difference
drawing tools and all that stuff that's
going to be up to you to create inside
of your file menu okay it's something
that is so extremely simple I'm not
going to waste time because I don't want
to have this program be huge I want you
to be able to look at it and completely
understand it and then use it to make or
complete your paint application believe
me it's going to be very functional it's
just not going to have things you click
on in a menu bar that's about it I'm
also going to want to track whether the
left mouse button is in the up or down
position and I'm going to have it be in
the up position because of course that's
where it starts off whenever I am
drawing with the pencil I am of course
going to need to have the exposition for
where the mouse is on the screen at the
time and the Y position and I'm going to
give those both none for default values
now whenever I am drawing with
rectangles and arcs and ovals and all
those different things what it's going
to want is the x1 position and it's also
going to want the y1 that's going to be
upper left-hand corner
point and also it's going to want to
know the X 2 and the Y 2 position which
is going to be the bottom right hand
corner now I'm going to go let's just
put line inside here for now of course I
might want to come in and change that
later on so I'm going to go and throw
all these inside of here
and there we go and then I'm going to
give those all the value of none by
default all right so do we need anything
else well as far as I know we don't um I
think that's enough information you want
to keep your class variables you know
short you don't want to have a bazillion
of them if you have a lot of them that
means you're probably doing something
wrong so for now we're gonna keep our
class variables right there so now I
need to track when the mouse button goes
up so well very first I'm going to do
and come down and I'm going to
initialize this guy so we'll go and
initialize this and this guy is going to
be past roots and what are we going to
do well I'm going to have a drawing area
which is where I'm going to create
canvas and you need to pass route so
there we are we're going to have our
canvas area we're going to draw on and
then I'm just going to keep it very
simple I'll just say drawing area and
pack it inside of our interface and then
we need to add in all of our differents
bindings so that we can catch events so
we're going to go bind and we're going
to say that we want to track motion
because we said that we want to track
motion previously and whenever that is
called I'm going to call self motion
alright and that is going to be a
function I'm going to create here very
very very soon so we got that guy and
we're also going to be tracking the
button press 1 and that is the left
mouse button and whenever that is going
to be clicked on we are going to be
calling our left button down function
and let's get rid of that extra self
inside of there you silly thing all
right and what else do we need well
we're also going to be tracking button
release 1
so whenever that button is released we
will know and for this one I'm going to
have this B left button oh alright and
that's all I need to do to initialize it
remember if your functions are nice and
short that is a good thing that's a sign
that you're doing things right all right
so now we'll go in create route RTK
objects and then we will create our
paint application and there's paint app
and we're going to pass it route of
course and what else do we going to do
well of course we have to call main loop
so that everything keeps running so it's
initialized and we got route created and
we got our paint application going so
now what we need to do is go up and
create all these functions okay so we
need to come in here and decide what we
want to do whenever the mouse goes up
and I just said that the function is
going to be called left button down
let's change this to down and this stuff
down and up just that was bugging me I
said it before now I'm going to do it
here okay so here we are now we're going
to track whenever the left button goes
down so what's going to happen well
there's going to be an event and we're
going to give that a value of non case
nothing came through there and what do
we want to do well up here
remember we are tracking whether the
left mouse button is down or up so we
want to come in here and make sure that
we have that set for ourselves
and it is situation now it's down all
right what else do we need to track well
whenever we are going to be clicking we
want to track the X&amp;amp;Y position for the
click so here we're going to say self
and X one line points and to get where
they clicked we go event and we go X and
likewise we do almost identically the
same exact thing what you doing over
here
we do almost exactly the same exact
thing for the Y position so there we go
and as far as I know that's all we need
to do for catching the mouse down we
want to know where they click that
that's it and we want to mark down that
it's down
all right anything else we might not
need this at all I don't know I'm just
writing this out of my head so let's go
next thing we want to do is track the
mouse going into the up position so I'm
going to say left button up and for this
guy of course web selves in there
already we want to track events and set
that for none all the codes available
like I said before in the description if
you want to take a look at that it might
help a lot because it's heavily
commented and left button and now it's
in the up position so let's track that
also and what do we want to do well we
want to reset our x and y position since
they're in the up position now so we're
going to say self and we're going to say
position is going to be equal to none
and we're going to do exactly the same
thing for the Y position and there it is
and we'll set that for Y as well and
then we are also going to want to set
our x and y whenever the mouse is
released so we are going to track
whenever it is clicked and then when
it's released okay both of those guys
and that's going to allow us here you
can use this for the starting and add it
up so what this is going to do for us is
allow us what I'm going to do next is
going to allow us to create things like
rectangles and ovals that need the
bottom right hand corner x and y
position plus the upper left hand x and
y positions so here I'm going to go X to
line points and we are going to also get
the x position on that guy and we're
going to do the same thing for the Y
position and so that will allow us to
draw rectangles and ovals and everything
else anything else I want to do well I
need to track here what's going on which
function am I going to call whenever the
mouse button is released well here I'm
going to say if self and drawing tool is
equal to
line in that situation I want to call a
function that I'm going to call line
draw and pass it the event in just in
case we need that information and as far
as I know for now I'm going to have all
the other events go in there but for now
I'm just going to keep it just working
for the line so now what I need to do is
track whenever we want to use the pencil
tool and also track the mouse movements
and for this guy I'm just going to call
it motion like I defined below with the
binding and then with that also I'm
going to get the events and what am I
doing here
well mainly what I'm doing with mouse
movement I don't care about mouse
movement all I care about is X&amp;amp;Y
whenever I'm drawing everything but I do
care about mouse movement when I'm
drawing with my pencil so I'm going to
say here if self and drawing tool is
going to be equal to pencil well in that
situation I'm going to start drawing so
first thing I want to do is make sure
that X and y both have a value before I
try to draw so I'm going to say self
exposition is not none and self y
position is not none so that means I
have an x and y position and now I can
draw on the screen and then to do so you
just say events widgets create line that
is the function you call and inside of
it you draw you pass in the exposition
and you also pass in the Y position and
then I'm also going to get the current x
and y position and then in this
situation I'm going to say that I want
this to be a smooth line so true then
after I have that all set up you come
out of here and I'm going to say that I
want to store the current X position
with the Y so that's going to allow me
to drag the mouse and it's going to
constantly update X&amp;amp;Y so it's going to
grab X&amp;amp;Y as quickly as humanly possible
and keep switching them so it's going to
go from
X&amp;amp;Y where it was to the X&amp;amp;Y where it is
going to and then that's going to flip
back to the beginning and that's going
to allow us to draw smooth lines with
our mouse so I'm going to come in and
I'll say X position is equal to event if
there's anything that I say that doesn't
make sense
feel free to leave a comment and I will
answer it and here I'm going to do the
same exact thing with the Y position
because you have to understand as you're
moving this function is going to be
called over and over and over and over
again that's why the one x and y to
constantly update so what else do we
want to do here well actually you know
what I'm going to do here this is what
happens whenever I code out of my head
I'm actually going to have this be a
little bit more simplified I'm going to
come in here and I am going to copy
inside of the motion I'm going to break
this up and put the more of the pencil
port down here alright so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to I'm going to keep
this part inside of here the pencil part
but then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go self and call pencil draw
and pass it the event so as to not junk
up my motion-sensing function right here
so that's all I'm going to do there then
what I'm going to do is come in here and
define and this is going to be pencil
draw of course and self and event and
make that be none and then in my pencil
draw area down here I'm going to say if
self left button equal to down and now
I'm going to break this out of a Mosin
section and put it down here where I
think it makes a little bit more sense
I could normally edit out this part of
the video and make it look like I'm
smarter but I'm showing you my thought
process instead because I think that's
valuable so here what I'm going to do is
take this guy and take all of this stuff
and I'm going to cut that out of there
okay so now we have motion nice and
tight and now we have pencil draw down
here and then what I'm going to do is
paste it inside of there so now the
motions only doing what motion sensing
should do and the pencil parts only
doing what the pencil part should do
so hopefully that
a lot of sense and I think that all
looks really good and the last thing I
want to do before I run it and test to
see if everything I'm doing here is
correct is I'm going to come in and
allow them to draw regular straight
lines along with pencil lines so draw
line and event is equal to none and how
are we going to draw regular old lines
well we're going to do something quite
simple now I could type out if this long
thing and this is going to get a lot
longer because now I'm going to have to
check for four points because a line has
an X and y at one end and an x and y at
the other end or I could go if none not
in and throw all these different guys
inside here so so and x1 and that's
going to allow me to check all of these
different guys instead of just one at a
time so there's that and then we'll also
check for the other two options so throw
it both those in there and just change
this to in this too okay so we want to
make sure we have an x and a y before we
try to draw our line now I'm going to do
pretty much exactly the same thing I'm
still going to be drawing a line so this
time we're just using x and y and the
dot let's just paste that in there and
the difference here is I'm going to use
these guys so I'm going to copy this
paste that in there and why don't I just
do this I'll make a little bit more
sense
copy paste all of those in there and the
only thing I want to add here is I want
to change the line color so that you
know how to change the line color and
I'm going to change that to green and I
think that's all I need to do for that
so what we're going to do here first is
we're going to test the application
using the line and then we are going to
test the application using the regular
old pencil tool let's come down here and
see what this looks like and everything
looks pretty interesting all right so
let's run it and it opens up here's the
default and let's say can we draw lines
yep and there are also green lines okay
so pretty cool stuff we were able to
draw straight lines all right it sort of
is a paint application now so now what
we're going to do change it into pencil
run it again we come down here there we
are
and now let's see if the pencil works
and it does look at that it's beautiful
so now we're able to draw lines and
pencil and of course you could change
those with the tool ball or presses and
all the stuff that I covered previously
because the only thing you'll need to
change whenever the tool bar or a file
menu item is clicked on is this okay so
I'm positive you can handle that and
that is your homework all right so now
what do we want to do well we want them
to be able to draw arcs so we'll just
come down inside of here and to happen
of course we were inside of our class
and we're going to call this arc draw
just so it's like everything else we are
covering event is equal to none once
again and we want to check that there is
an x and y because an arc is actually
going to use an upper left-hand x and y
position and a lower LexA line position
so we're going to copy this guy so I'm
going to copy that and paste that in
there to make sure that those guys exist
and we will tab that in of course and
what are we going to do inside of here
after we check that they exist well we
are going to have to pass in coordinates
a for drawing arcs so I'm going to call
this chords is equal to and it's going
to be these guys again so let's just go
and copy them we know they exist and
they have values and everything's
wonderful so there we go now we have our
coordinates all set up for drawing our
arc and let's move this over here so you
can see a little bit better all right so
there's everything so now what we're
going to need to do is define our arc
and to do so we say event widget and 3/8
arc pretty easy to remember and then you
pass in your coordinates you're then
going to pass in start and have that be
0 and start is just going to be the
starting angle for the arc or slice that
you're going to be drawing inside of in
degrees and then you're going and you
can change those and see how they change
things then you're going to have extent
and that's going to be the width of the
slice in degrees and we're just going to
put 150 inside of there for that and you
could also put fill inside of there
and that would be to fill the guy and
then we are going to put style and have
that the arc to draw an arc if you would
instead prefer to draw like a pie slice
you would type in pie slice and if you
prefer to draw a chord you would type
chord inside there okay but we're going
to leave it be arc because we want to
draw arcs and that's it that is all it
is that's all it takes to be able to do
that but we want to be able to draw our
arc so arc draw is right there and we
want to come up here where is our little
guy where we were checking and there we
are if self drawing is line while we
want arc to be another option for us so
we're going to say L if lips now we are
move that back over here if it is going
to be equal to arc well then we want to
call arc draw and there's arc drawn and
we come up here and change this to arc
pretty simple let's run it see if it
works
and there we are and you can go in there
and test let me say there's an art look
at that arc of course it's going to be a
little bit different because of how we
change to draw straight lines with arcs
also and so forth and so on and of
course you can change fill to be able to
change the fill color and all that other
stuff okay so we can draw with a pencil
we can draw lines and now we can draw
arcs next up we want to draw ovals since
them up here I'm just going to change
this to oval already and then I'm going
to come down here and I'm going to say
that I want to be able to draw ovals
throw that inside of there and change
this to oval and this is going to be
called oval draw and now we come down
inside of the oval area define and oval
draw is what we're going to draw here
and guess what it's going to be passed
event just like previously and just like
we previously did we're going to check
to make sure there are x and y positions
because ovals are also going to track
all of that stuff at upper left-hand
corner and the bottom for our bounding
box so it's called and then we have
create our oval and oval is going to
have a whole bunch of other different
things that it does and we call create
oval in this situation and this guy is
going to once the X&amp;amp;Y positions and all
that stuff so we are going to provide
that to it just copy that and paste it
inside of there put a comma and then
we're going to change some different
things so let's say that we want to
change the fill color for our oval we
can do so and we'll use midnight blue
for that and this is a built-in color
for using TK enter and if you want to
see what all of them look like that is
in wiki tcl/tk this guy right here this
is all the built in TK enter different
colors and your you can see midnight
blue right there so there that is and
that link will be in the code of course
and what else do we want to define here
with our oval well let's also say that
we want to change the outline or the
border for it and let's have that just
be yellow and then what else do we need
well let's change the width of our
border and let's make that too okay
that's it that is how simple it is and
let's run it and here it is and let's
test it and there we do now we can draw
circles and we can draw ovals okay just
like a regular old paint application so
there you go all right so the next thing
we want to do is draw rectangles let's
scroll up here and let's change this to
rectangle and then we will come down
here and provide that option for drawing
rectangles and paste that in there and
we'll say rectangle and we will call
rectangle draw and there that is so now
we need to create rectangle draws and
it's pretty step-by-step and just for
the heck of it we are going to come in
here and copy all of this and because
you're going to draw rectangles in much
the same way you draw ovals paste that
inside of there over there
get all this stuff all lined up now of
course we're going to come in and check
X&amp;amp;Y positions in the upper left hand and
lower right hand corner and here we just
need to go and change oval into
rectangle it's going to get all of this
other stuff it's also going to get let's
just go up here whoop drag infill let's
have it be midnight blue and yellow as
well and let's have the width B - okay
so well the only thing we need to do is
change this to rectangle draw and let's
run it and let's see if it works and yes
that is a rectangle and there you are
now you can draw a rectangle sounds
pretty easy wasn't it and that leaves us
with the final thing which is drawing
text so let's come up here and we'll put
text inside of here so there's text and
then we'll come in and do LF with text
change this to text change this to text
draw and then we are going to come in
here and we only need to check two of
these items so let's just grab this copy
it well we have to go to fine text draw
and of course it's getting events it's
equal to none we're going to check that
we have those two values that are going
to be needed for our stuff here close
that off put a colon after it and if you
want to see all the different fonts that
are available this is a shortcut way to
do that you can go TK enter and font and
then families and that would print out
in the console all the different font
options that you have available just
throwing that in there just so you can
see and then we're going to need to
define the font we're going to use on
our screen and you go TK enter and font
and then font with a big F and let's say
we love Helvetica so let's use Helvetica
here
fedka and what else do we want to use
well you can also define the size for
the sky so let's make that 20 points and
you can define the weight for this guy
and let's make that bold and we can also
define if we want it to be italic or not
and you go to slant
and italic and that is a way to define
the text that you want to use in your TK
inter canvas and lets you draw that text
you just go event widget and create text
you pass over to it the x and y position
and there that is and there's y1 and
then the text color is going to be fill
and I'm just going to make this B green
you're going to define your font and
that's just going to be text fonts which
you just defined above and then you
define the text you want to be you want
to put inside there and we'll just have
it be Wow okay let's run it wow wow wow
wow wow wow wow wow wow and what more
could I say about this awesome tutorial
hopefully you guys enjoyed it like I
said for your homework go in with a menu
bar and the tool bar and make it into a
fully functional paint application
it's about 98% there so hopefully you
guys enjoyed this and just like always
please leave your questions and comments
