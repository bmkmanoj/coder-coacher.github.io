three in my visual basic tutorial in
this tutorial I'm going to cover if-else
if-else select cases ternary operators
for for each do until do-while raise and
much more and of course all of the code
and a transcript of this video is
available in the description underneath
the video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it ok so here I am in
Visual Studio again and I'm going to
create another windows forms application
and I'm going to call it VB Tut 3
because this is the third part of the
tutorial and that's a classy name and
I'm gonna hit on OK and there it's going
to create my form now what I'm going to
do is come in here and I'm going to
resize this a little bit and then I'm
going to come down here and click on the
toolbox and open that up and I'm going
to find myself a text view or a text box
that is and there it is and I'm going to
drag it up here and I'm going to drop it
right there just like I did previously
I'm gonna leave the name textbox 1 which
is right there just because that seems
to work ok and I want this to be a
multi-line box again so what I'm gonna
have to do is come in here and change
multi-line to true so just click in here
and right there I'm then going to find
my scroll bars and change those to a
vertical just like I did before and then
what else do I want to do word wrap I
want to make sure that word wrap is set
to true as well and there's word wrap
and it is set to true alright so that's
all good and I'm going to come over here
and grab it and resize it on the screen
here that looks perfectly fine also I
want to come in here and increase the
size of my font because I want you to be
able to see it here on your screen so
I'm going to change this to something
like 18 and click on OK then I'm going
to come in and grab a button drag it and
drop it right about there that works and
come over here and change the name of
this to button update and let's also
change the font on that so you can see
it so that that looks a little bit nicer
and font and 18 and click
okay and also come over here and change
the text inside of it from button one
well not the tax that would be silly to
update okay and hit enter and there we
go and then I'll resize the button so
that it is really big on the screen now
I'm going to jump in and start writing
the code by double clicking right here
and Here I am okay so what we're going
to do first off is talk about
conditionals those are if-else if-else
and select case and the ternary operator
but first I want you to be able to read
this so I'm going to click on tools and
options sorry about the double mouse or
the double cursors that is something
that Camtasia is having an issue with I
can't get rid of it and if anybody knows
a better screen capture software I will
buy it immediately but I can't find
anything better so I'm going to double
click on this and I'm going to change
this to 38 and click on OK and now
everything is really really big so
alright so into conditionals what I'm
going to do first is I want to be able
to update the text in my text box and
how I'm going to do that is I'm going to
create something called text output you
can name it anything of course as string
is equal to and just have it be an empty
string and now the if statements
basically just going to be used to
perform different actions depending upon
different conditions which you probably
are aware of so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create an integer here and
it's going to be called integer age and
I'm going to give it a value of 7 and
you're going to be able to compare
values using just the equal sign like
this this is going to be not equal this
is greater than less than greater than
or equal to or less than or equal to
that's how you're going to be able to
convey your values and visual basic
first I want to show you a single line
if statement which is different than the
ternary operator as you're going to see
here in a moment and to create it you go
if and I'm going to say int age is less
than 18 then I'm going to go text output
and I'm going to add on to that string
which I'm going to be updating here in
the text box in a little bit and I'm
going to say you can't
and then I'll go ann's and environments
and new line and there that is Anna
might as well come out here and update
my text boxes well then let's move this
down and to update the text box I'm
going to go and reference its name which
is textbox 1 and then text is going to
be equal to text output and there that
is alright so that's going to update
that for me now if you would like
additional statements to be able to
trigger with this single line if
conditional all you're going to do is
put a colon inside of there and keep on
making them so I'm going to put in here
text output and equal to you can votes
in and I'll say and and I'll put 18
inside of there int age I know this
isn't going to make sense if the person
can vote but whatever I'm just doing
this just to be able to show you an
example and I'll change this to years
and then I'm going to throw in the
environment new line again so
environments and new line and there that
is okay so that's how you make a single
line if conditional if we run it just
click on start up here you're going to
see how that goes and there it is click
on update you can't vote and then it
says you can vote in 11 years okay so
there's a single line if statement now
I'm going to show you if else if and
else so to do this what we're going to
do is I'm going to say if and see visual
studio typed in lowercase I F and it
went corrected that form a visual studio
the new version is awesome okay so we're
going to go int whoops get rid of that
int age is less than 5 what I'm going to
do here is determine what class a
student should go into based off their
age so I'm going to say if their age is
less than 5 then I want to go to the
text output and equal to and I'm going
to say something like too young for
school now I'm going to put in another
conditional so I'm going to say else if
int age is equal to so you just do a
single equal unlike other languages and
we'll say then
and here I'm going to put the text
output again let's go and copy that well
actually let's come in and do
environments and a new line there that
is now we can copy this guy right here
and paste it in right there
all right so in the situation in which
they are the age of five I'm going to
tell them to go to kindergarten so go to
kindergarten I don't know if everybody
goes to kindergarten but that's when we
use here and then I'm going to say LS f
int age and here what I'm going to be
able to do is use logical operators now
that logical operators are going to be
four as well as and and what they allow
you to do is to come back with a
positive which is going to allow the
next line of the program to execute if
this situation if you're using and if
both are true and if you use an or if
one or another is true and in this
situation I am going to say int age is
greater than five and int age is less
than and I could say 18 or 19 or
whatever I'm just going to leave it be
18 then I'm going to go and create a new
integer
I'll call this integer grade is equal to
int age minus 5 and then I will come in
here and say what grade they should go
to so I'm going to say go to grade put
space inside of there come outside here
and I'm going to go int grade and then
the new line is going to trigger so
that's going to calculate that and now
if I want a default I'm going to say
else and then for this guy I'm going to
just say for everybody else go to
college go to college and there we go
all right so that is how if else if and
else worked inside of Visual Basic and
then of course the end if comes down
here to close off the if statement and
if we run that guy and remember the age
is 7 click on update it's going to say
you know you can't vote but they're
right here it's going to say go to grade
2 all right so there that
other thing that's important to know
whenever you're working with
conditionals is how to compare strings
and in many cases if you're comparing
strings you're going to want to ignore
the case of the letters so I'll create a
new string here and I'll call it Derrick
and I'm going to in this situation go if
and if you want to compare strings you
should use string compare and then in
this situation what I'll be able to do
is just put in all uppercase letters and
compare it to the string name that I
just created here and say that if these
come back is true I want to put true
there and in this situation what's going
to happen is if the strings do indeed
match what on what it's going to do is
return a zero in this situation so I'm
going to say that this is going to come
back as true if the comparison gives me
a value of zero and if it's false it's
going to come back with another
different value so here I can just go
text input again and I can say something
like these strings are equal and then
have the newline on there let's go and
do another one here so you can see
multiple different pieces of output at
the same time I'm going to talk about
the Select case comparison operator and
basically you're going to use this
anytime
it makes your code more readable so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to say
select case integer age and what you're
going to be able to do here is type in
single digits or multiple digits so
we're going to say okay so what you're
going to be able to do here is you're
we're going to be trying to find the
value of int age here so we're going to
say if the value of int age is and you
could put in a single value or you could
put in multiple values and I'm going to
show you another shorthand way to do
this so if the value of int age is one
two three or four I'm going to come in
here to my text output and say too young
for school another thing we're going to
be able to do is like I said put in a
single digits or a single value and in
this situation we'll say go to
kindergarten and there that is and also
here is the shorthand way to cover a
range of values we could say case six
2:18 and in that situation
I'll just go create a integer again so
int grade is equal to int age minus 5
and then throw in my text output and
just like I did before I'm going to say
go to grade and then I'm going to throw
in the grade that we just calculated so
it grade and then in the situation in
which you you know we just wanted a
fault you're going to say case else this
is going to basically work as the
default situation that does not match
any of the above I'm going to throw in a
text output again and here I'll say go
to college so you can see how to do
basically exactly the same thing with
just if and else if instead of case like
we did right here so we can save that
and what the heck let's also cover the
ternary operator and then we can run
this and see all the code now the
ternary operator is basically going to
assign one value if the condition is
true and it's going to assign another
value if it isn't true so here I'm going
to say go create a boolean and I'll say
can vote as boolean and here we'll go
equal to if and here is the conditional
int age is greater than or equal to 18
and in that situation if that is true
it's going to assign the value of true
to this variable right here otherwise
it's going to assign the value all false
to that variable right there and then
finally let's come down here and put
some information so we'll just say can
you vote and we know the answer because
the age is 7 and I'll say and and
boolean can vote and now we can run all
three of those and see what happens so
update and there you can see right there
those strings are equal and you saw that
based off of using this string compare
function go to grade 2 was calculated
from the case statement because the age
was 7 and can't vote comes back as false
alright so there's a rundown of all the
different conditionals available to you
and visual basic and Alma
take a look at looping okay so a for
loop is going to allow you to execute
code within a set number of times so
that's what four loops are so we're
going to say in this situation create an
integer num and we're going to say that
we want to count ten times so in this
situation all we're going to do is print
out some text input which is going to be
all of those different values so we'll
just go it num and if we run that you're
going to see that it's going to count
from one to ten whoops what I do on my
silly man come in here get rid of that
and go in Nome and now run it and you'll
see what happens okay so there it goes
and updates and there you can see it
went and print it out one through ten
all right so we can do of course much
better things with our for loops let's
say for example we would want to
automatically what it does is it
increments the value here by 1 each time
through the loop so let's say that we
want to instead increase the value to 10
so here we'll say for int
num is equal to 0 and we're going to go
to 50 and we want to change the step
from 1 to 10 that's how we do that and
here we will throw in the value once
again so in Nome and then another thing
we can do is let's say that as you are
looping you would like a condition
inside of here in which you will leave
the conditional so let's say we want to
say if nth num is equal to 40 in that
situation I want to prematurely jump out
of the loop I can then say then and exit
for all right
and then that's normally break in other
programming languages and if we run that
indeed you're going to see updates and
here we will indeed print out 0 10 20 30
40 and not 50 even though we originally
decided we wanted to print out 50
another guy we have available to us is
the for each so let's get rid of this
and I'm going to say for each and what
it's going to allow me to do is to cycle
through arrays for example so let's go
and let's create an array first
going to get more into it'll raise here
in a second so I'm going to say that I
want to create an employees array and
they are going to be strings and I want
to go and sign values to them
as I create the arrests I'm going to say
that I have an employee named Paul
another one names Sally and another one
that is named Jack there you go i
created a array and now i'm going to use
the for each to cycle through those
arrays and so i'm going to say for each
and employee is going to be the
temporary holding cell for each one of
these as they're being pulled out of the
array so i'm going to say for each
employee as they are strings i have to
say that in employees and i'm going to
reference the employees array and here
we will just print out the employees
names let's get rid of this and say
employee like that and we run it and
you're going to see that we are able to
come in and print out all the employees
names now let's come in here and do a
little guessing game so that i can
demonstrate how do until loops work for
us so i'm going to create a number guest
and i'll just let it assign integer to
this by default and i'm sure you have
been wondering how to generate random
values well now you'll know so what
we're going to do to generate a random
value is you're going to have to define
an upper bound in this situation i'm
going to have that be ten and you're
going to have to define a lower bound
and in that situation i'll have that be
1 and then to generate the random value
random value we go see int and that's to
cast this float into an integer and I'll
say math.floor and then inside of it you
put upper bound the maximum value you
want - lower bound and then you're going
to add one to that then you're going to
multiply that guy times random and then
that'll close off like that and then
we'll go Plus lower bound so that's how
we generate random values inside of
Visual Basic and now that I did that
going to go over to the do until loop
and in comparison you also have a
do-while loop that is going to execute
as long as a condition is true
so do until is going to execute until
something is true - Wow is going to
execute as long as something's true but
we're going to use do until and for
homework you can try out the do-while
loop so I'm going to say number guessed
is equal to random value I'm going to
say I want to continue looping until the
number that the program is going to
guess is equal to the random value that
we generated then inside of here go text
output and I'm going to say something
like computer guest and I'll throw in
the computer guests here so we go and
number guests and then just to make this
very simple I'm just going to increase
the value of number guest so I'm going
to say number guest and increase the
value by one also it's good to know that
you can prematurely exit a do loop so
say something like number guest is equal
to 10 then exit do ok so that's how you
get out of there and then after the loop
part right here we're going to know that
the user guessed the value and we're
going to say it equal to and and then
outside of the loop which ends with the
word loop right here I'm going to go
text output and we know if we got down
here that they guess the value so we're
going to say the computer guessed it and
just three loop in that new line and if
we run this guy you're going to see
number guessed 0 1 2 3 4 and then it
gets 7 and then it jumped out of the
loop and it says the computer guessed it
ok so that's how do until and I'm sure
you can understand how to do while loops
org as well and looping in general
inside a visual basic so now I'm going
to jump over and talk about a raise now
the very first thing I'm going to do
here and arrays are just going to be a
way for you to store multiple values and
assign them to one variable so if we
want to define a fixed size array that
means an array that once you set the
value it
can't be changed I'm going to show you a
way to change it though but by default
it's going to be fixed in size so I'm
going to come in here and I'm going to
go customer and put it in ball but Sally
and just to mix everything up here a
little bit I'll throw my Lea
now I meant to put Manny inside of there
so there's man all right so where we go
and now what I'm going to do with these
guys is assign a value to the third
element this is going to be the zero
index one index two index so if you want
to assign something to the third
elements what we're going to do is go
customer and let's change this to
customers so customers and if I want to
sign something the third value I have to
put a two inside of there and let's say
that I want to get rid of Manny and put
Paul inside of there you can do so just
like that I can then get the value
inside of an array so let's come in here
and we'll say something like number one
customer and then to get the value out
of it
I can go customers and zero and that's
going to give me the first customer that
I have inside of there we're also going
to be able to come in and sort the array
based off of the order alphabetically we
could also come in and reverse the array
just by throwing customers inside of
there as well like I said previously
we're going to be able to change the
size of the array and preserve the
values that are in there by going re
dimension and then preserve if you
wouldn't put preserve inside of there it
would automatically go and delete all
the values and you'd have an empty array
so we're going to change the size to
five and preserve the values that are
already inside of there and of course
you're also going to be able to cycle
through your array using for each I'm
going to say customer as string in
customers throw in my text output to
output to the screen and here just to
keep this very simple I'm just going to
print out each customer's name like that
and we can run this to see how that's
going to work for us and update and you
can see it printed out number one
customers Bob
and remember we reversed the order of
the array and here it printed out all
those guys and now to finish off
covering arrays I'd like to talk about
multi-dimensional arrays basically a
multi-dimensional array is a matrix it's
going to be values that go both a
horizontal as well as vertical and to
define one you just come in here and
define the size you want you define what
is going to go inside of there and then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
populate this guy so I'm going to use a
for I is equal to and I'll go 0 to 3 and
then inside of here we're also going to
be able to do what they call nesting of
a for loop so this is for loop nesting
so I'm going to say J is equal to and
here I will go 1 2 3 let's change this
to 1 as well so there's that and then
you're going to be able to visualize
exactly what this matrix or
multi-dimensional array looks like so
very first thing I'm going to do is I'll
go matrix and I and J and I'm going to
say that they are going to have the
values of I and J like this then after
that I am then going to output this
information so I'm going to basically do
exactly the same exact thing so when we
just copy this and let's paste it there
that is right there and here what we're
going to do is output that information
so we'll go and whoops figure out about
this and there we go and here what I'm
going to do is to output that
information I will go and refer to the
matrix and I will say I J to get the
value out of it and then after the next
down here that's where I'm going to put
my environment new line so let's go get
rid of this altogether and come down
here and go text output and is equal to
and in like that and I'll throw in the
new line and you'll be able to see the
structure of this guy and then of course
we can update our text box so let's save
that and let's run it and update and
there you can see
we're able to print out all of those
different values inside of our matrix
like that and maybe we should throw in a
space so it's a little bit easier to
read so I'll jump up here and go and
like that and run it and update and
there you can see exactly how all of
those guys layout all right there you go
guys that is a rundown of conditionals
as well as looping and arrays with
visual basic check out the code in the
description as well as a transcript and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
