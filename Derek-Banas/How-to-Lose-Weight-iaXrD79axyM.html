weight that your family members start to
think you've contracted AIDS this is a
diet for you dieting is actually very
simple all you need to do is lower your
calorie intake by eating more foods that
make you feel full while at the same
time increasing the amount of fiber that
you need so that you crap your pants
this is what I look like in november of
last year at 248 pounds I'm the one on
the left to now look in the way that I
look right now I was 248 pounds and now
I weigh 171 I did it by starting every
day by eating a muffin like this and
then I have about a cup and a half of
all bran bran buds and lots and lots of
coffee that's why I shake constantly if
you like pancakes here's the ones for
you here's the syrup for you I normally
either eat a turkey burger which isn't
real turkey but it tastes like real
turkey or a veggie burger for lunch
which doesn't really taste like anything
with that I eat low sodium ketchup and
this is the best tasting and healthiest
cheese that I've ever found people also
say you can't drink soda whenever your
diet coke zero one of the major mistakes
people make in regards to diet is they
do not create alternatives for
themselves what I said that I would do
in my diet was I would avoid fat
cholesterol and sodium and in exchange
I'd be able to eat as much as I want it
here alist the absolute best things you
can eat it's also important to eat foods
that make you feel full here's a list of
some things that you can gorge yourself
on and here are some other things that
are high in fiber and very low in
calories you also need to use a website
like MyFitnessPal to track your calories
as well as your fat intake here's an
example of what i ate the other day
you're so i make spaghetti canola oil
garlic then we get some no salt added
diced tomatoes from Del Monte we hit it
with some fresh herbs super low in fat
super delicious this is the type of
pasta you should eat it's healthy locale
and loaded with fiber here's how to make
some ass exploding muffins 501 blueberry
mix then to beat the fat egg beaters
instead of regular eggs dump that in
ignore the directions don't put oil in
this three fourth cup
of water now based off my alterations
each one of these bad boys and they come
in at a hundred calories with five grams
of fiber my baby likes her fiber to
these are waffles right here we got 70
calories and five grams of fiber you
want some more fiber
you
so I hope that helps you lose your
weight Phil I lost one third of my body
weight I'm sure you can do the same in
five months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
