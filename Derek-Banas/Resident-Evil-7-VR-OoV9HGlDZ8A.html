gear on here hopefully you guys can see
me and I'm gonna try to do a Resident
Evil here 7 obviously and it's pretty
crazy I haven't played much of it at all
the only bit I did play is the part
where just so I could set up everything
so that I would be surprised and also I
am skipping all of the opening video
it's about Ethan and Mia and Mia went on
a babysitting trip and something
happened to her they presumed dead and
then Ethan goes and finds out she's not
dead but she tells them not to come get
her and of course
Ethan goes to get her so that's the
opening video cinematic and now I'm just
gonna jump in and hopefully you guys can
see what I see and everything is VR I'm
gonna move around and hopefully it
doesn't mess up things too badly so I'm
gonna jump into it here oh I guess I
first have to open up the console here
this is fun programming videos start
again tomorrow just tomorrow morning the
next programming videos up I just
thought I'd do this for fun and I want
to do more live streams once a week I
will try to do a live stream because you
guys have asked for it alright so into
the game so here we are sorry bear with
me here I have to get this adjusted so
everything isn't blurry and all I did
was skip the opening cinematic so here
we are dr. death I don't want to do that
I don't get out of this in that
turn to the main menu now oh there we
are okay so here we are I just drove
across country to find ya and as you can
see everything is three-day and there's
my beautiful car right there and now
we're off so it can run if we hold down
the left joystick hopefully you guys can
hear everything
maybe I should pause for one second just
to make sure everybody can hear this
sore as I can tell everybody can just
pause bear with me
alright can everybody hear me oh my god
I'm just gonna assume everybody can hear
me and I'm just gonna play through this
alright okay oh I didn't see 50 million
messages saying they can't hear me okay
so here we are I'm approaching a creepy
house check my objective how do I do
that
find me yeah that's my objective I'm
guessing and this says email from Mia
turn on the email okay I don't need to
read that so here is our creepy house if
you want me to I'll look around so you
can see I assume you can see every
single thing that I see as I look around
it's pretty cool I mean it's not you
know super fancy and this is lost
let's see it's a little bit there's
different options you can use for
looking around you can either look and
then it'll go that direction or you can
do this clicky thing and go in that
direction like I said I didn't do much
of this I just wanted to test that it
works so that basically you're seeing
every single thing that I'm seeing I'm
just checking to see if there's anything
here
and there's nobody in there as far as I
can tell all right cool
and I'm just gonna play this until it
looks good except her gift that says try
to do this there's both and it's all 3d
it's really ridiculously cool
I mean it's I've never tried the oculus
or the vive I can't see your chat
messages by the way oh there's a dude up
here but it won't let me run after not
here can I go down here no will not let
me go down there basically the whole
idea this game is just to freak you out
and supposedly people got sick playing
it like when it first came out but I
think they have corrected that
damn Birds over here make you jump okay
so I guess the only way I can go is over
here oh I've had to say crotch for a
second it says Crouch
alright that was weird
and then on crouch and just so you know
there is potty talk in this there's not
much but there's a little potty tuck in
his game say if you don't like potty
talk don't watch the game I'm not known
for my potty talk but if I get scared
bad enough I might accidentally say
something but I'm pretty good about that
since I have kids around me all the time
so and there's dead birds everywhere
crows okay
something's burning up here
and there's the house dude what's
burning over here still hey there's
something pick it up and I can
manipulate it and I found a driver's
license don't know if that's good for
anything is there anything else in here
I assume this is Mia's purse because
Mia's driver's license is in there and I
can't do anything with it except rotate
it so there it is you know here's the
house can't see inside of it game does
make you antsy I can tell you that just
the eeriness of it all and me not being
used to VR maybe that's part of it also
it just gives you an eerie sort of
feeling with sorry if I'm talking too
much you know
previous Resident Evil's there was
always a gun or something somewhere and
it's pitch black
my eyes adjust or something well that's
okay okay so in a room is this where I
came from where is this where I'm going
there's a door
is this the way I came from unless I
have to make an exit and somehow yes
shut door
is there a reason I'd want to shut the
door picture of some trees I've actually
been in a house like this one time and
well a couple times actually one time
went to a house for a job that I had was
two brothers if I would have ever found
out that those two brothers were serial
killers I would not have been surprised
I can just tell you that wasn't quite
this bad but it was very close because I
showed up with I assume I don't have a
gun which is real smart
and I knock these games over oh look at
that that's cool water don't work
together and there's bugs everywhere and
bottles can I knock them over yeah
that's cool let's see what's in here
that's a burnt photograph I guess still
no gun
I guess that's locked I'm sure I want to
look in this pot that's nice yeah and
there is the obligatory potty talk told
you about still looking for a gun or
something bullets anything knife still
not seeing anything good - see what I'm
saying
nice
this is ridiculous what this looks like
in VR all right there's like nothing
here
I'm not seeing anything
I have no idea what that is I can't
touch it
I guess it's mold there's one of them
fish
should I go upstairs or should I stay
I'm gonna get it this way cuz I have no
idea where I'm going hopefully you guys
can hear me cuz I'm not sure okay and
there's nothing in here so far is a
whole bunch of empty rooms with pictures
I guess where should I go up the steps
I'm gonna go up the steps any point in
time alright so now we're going upstairs
that's a pretty picture okay
and if you're just joining me Resident
Evil 7 in VR obviously I was I have
something strange in my head what's this
do
it's not responding okay almost feel
like this is a joke previous vrz always
found something alright so there's a
this does can i play this oh okay so
this allows me to save it okay
you went over right yeah I guess so okay
so that's how we save files I thought
that was gonna play some creepy story or
something but no and derelict house
footage okay so another room basically
empty room with a VCR tape so hopefully
there's a VCR somewhere in this house
then I can do something with that I'm
not too easily freaked out by things
didn't shot at a couple times not at me
I was just involved in a gun fight
that's a story I can tell all right
photograph and the fuse box what's that
say stairs ah I bet you that's gonna
make the switch work upstairs but I
don't have that so I can't do that
I'm doing something really stupid
hopefully that's a nice way to everybody
know you're here I didn't played this
game before
I just basically played it enough to
make sure that it would work and that's
it
so when I just heard that noise Oh
something looks like the owners okay
interesting
oh these you are look at that I was
being stupid so let's try that
hopefully it's not just this hey I only
work with professionals speaking of
which who I can move so I'm actually
moving within we do a walk through the
inside first then we shoot the intro
just like we always do just try to say
the show's name this time okay tonight
another worthless fucking kid this is
really cool how you're inside of the
video
pretty cool or at least I'm going into
the same place and all this stuff's 3d
these moths let's go just really cool
seem to have any oh I mix my arms I
can't punch so this time you ever prep
what's the fuck how was it anchor you
know nothing
what's the story hundred abandoned
farmhouse missing family foul play
suspected the usual how long do you say
this place has been abandoned three
years let's make a great cut away so
hillbilly Jonah's family go missing not
hillbillies the Baker's jack and
Marguerite Baker and they were quiet not
backward a lot of bad rumors about their
son Lucas bad seed apparently shit my
good shoes I had my shots although just
to make a great backdrop Andre what do
you think Andre Andre Andre Clancy you
see where Andre wins
where is he fucking believable this is
the last time I work with that guy
I mean producers they come and go but a
good cameraman like you Clancy you stick
with me
well you man
so they took the vco all right New Deal
we find Andre and we go me fuck this
show
you first need a nice hero shot of meat
coming down the ladder what do you see
what is it boy it's like The Blair Witch
Project or something I don't think I was
supposed to do anything different
my guess it's a VCR tape okay well
anyway I figured out how to get out of
this room Jesus I go over here and I
crouch and there's supposed to be
something down here
there it is they're gonna be dead dudes
everywhere here and there's roaches
still no gun still nothing to defend
myself with and down I go
so I fell down that and I guess I can't
go back up
still no guns still no knives if you're
checking in here
so this is the only way to go okay and
now I'm in the sewer I think I don't
even know what this is underneath the
house this is wonderful
what this bubbles are
okay see well there's a dead body
pictures everywhere people I don't know
maybe me it was on one of those pictures
I'm gonna look no syringes in it
oh boy
is there somebody in there maybe I
should find a weapon here first what's
this piece of paper it says turned
turned dead there's a bunch of people on
there look he is that's a weapon
pull the bolt cutters use that and
that's it let's see who was in here
this is gonna be zombie Mia what do you
