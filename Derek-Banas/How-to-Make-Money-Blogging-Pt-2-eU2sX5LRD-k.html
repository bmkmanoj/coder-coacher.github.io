I showed you how to make a money-making
blog through the use of WP o matic what
WP o matic does is it automatically
calls information from RSS feeds and
throws them onto your website the only
problem with that is you only get an
abbreviated version of whatever was in
the RSS feed this short little bit of
information well I found a way to get
you a lot more information as you can
see right here and how I was able to do
that is through the use of another
wordpress plugin called postie and you
can see here you set this up just like
any other plug-in meaning add new type
post en automatically install so forth
and so on and then you get to the
options pane which is where we are right
now you assign your mail server it's
probably gonna be pop3 the port's
probably only 110 you can make
corrections to time here and of course
you're going to put your mail server
here your user ID and your password
after you do that you then want to go
over to the user part of the system and
you can define what role you will play
and find if you want your post
automatically published of course you
want to check no you do not want anyone
to be able to post and you want to put
an auth right address down here which is
going to be your email address that you
use to post on to your website then
under the message frame you can define
your categories you can define a default
title and numerous other things so
that's postie so now we have a great way
to post to your website as long as
you're able to feed larger RSS feeds to
this email address well that's where
yahoo pipes comes in and that can be
found at pipes yahoo com and i went and
created a couple pipes here on my own
this is a drag-and-drop interface that's
extremely easy to use so let's look at
the huffington post why i'm able to pull
down a lot of information from any site
is that yahoo pipes allows me to not
only access the RSS feed but also to
access the link to the original post
since it allows me to do that i'm able
to pull all that information from the
original post and as you can see these
are much much much much longer are
and if I click on get as RSS you can see
that not only did it pull down an
abbreviation of the RSS feed it actually
pulled down all of the article along
with all of the images that lie there in
so i was able to do that well basically
everywhere website works the same way
what we want to be able to do if we jump
back over here in the pipes and then
click on edit source of course we want
to create your own pipe you would click
on create a pipe this right here is a
drag-and-drop interface fetch site feed
came from right here I just drag it over
dropped it on there and then what I what
this fetch site feed actually does their
fall called modules all of these little
guys here what it does is if I post in a
URL to any website what this guy is
going to do is it's automatically going
to pull the most popular RSS feed from
that website then what I'm going to do
is for each new entry in the RSS feeds
I'm going to loop through them and I'm
going to grab the original content from
the original article let's zoom in here
so I'm this is the RSS feed it's going
to shoot out the first entry in the RSS
feed it's going to go into my loop then
by defining item dot link what I'm
telling it to do is to jump to the main
page where the whole entire article lies
and cut content from what this is going
to do is it's going to pull all of the
content from the original article and I
am defining where to start and where to
end in regards to copy and content from
that article how did I figure out that I
should start at div class equals entry
body text it's real simple jump over
into the huffington post now i'm just
using this as an example just random
it's a website many people know about
that's why i'm using it so i'm going to
jump down here into RSS didn't even have
to do that but most websites have their
RSS link both at the top as well as at
the bottom and you can see here with
firefox it's actually up here next to
the URL itself but if i wanted to access
the feed i could either right click on
it and copy link location and then jump
back into yahoo pipes and paste that
item right here but of course i would
use this module instead because i know
what the site feed is what this what
fetch site feed does is it actually
finds the RSS feed
for me so I'm going to jump back over
and I'll Huffington Post just click on
feed and then here's an actual article
and you can see how dramatically smaller
the article is in the feed I'm going to
jump into here and then I'm gonna go
view page source and i'm gonna scroll
down here and i'll see the beginning of
the article starts off with the words i
caught so i'm going to jump into the
page source and ctrl f and then type in
i caught what's going to do is it's
going to take me to the article
sometimes not on the first try let's
click on next i caught and you can see
here this is the original article so
what I'm going to do is copy the tag
that lies before the beginning of the
original article that I want to grab I
just copy jump back over here and paste
it into cut content from and it's going
to cut all the content that lies between
here this div and this closing dip then
I want to make sure i have a sign
checked and have all and type in item
description what this is going to do is
it's going to create a new RSS feed and
what the item description is is the
description for that RSS feed then I
want to pipe that down here into the
pipe output and bingo I just created an
automatically updating RSS feed that is
going to pull all the content from every
article on the huffington post now let's
say for example i only wanted to pull
content of a specific type so let's jump
over here eat pray love Hollywood
alright so let's just say I want to
filter the data that's coming through
here great there's an operator over here
called filter drag it down block items
that match all of the phone let's say
instead of block permit items that match
all of the following let's say I only
want to accept titles that have the word
Hollywood in them well that's exactly
what this is going to do now if you want
to disconnect two modules you just
simply click on any of these nubbins and
you'll see a little X come up and if you
click on that it'll go away then you
just drag over here and drag over here
and now it's only going to pull up
articles and throw them into an RSS feed
if the word Hollywood is found in the
title so you have to click on save and
then run pipe you have to understand
what Yahoo pipes is is it's an RSS
creator and you can see here there was
only one article available at the
huffington post that have the word
hollywood in it so you can see here you
can search i could have also searched
based off the description and only
pulled articles that had for example the
word real-life tail in them or whatever
you would want to pull from any website
whether it has an RSS feed or not I'll
get into that later on so that's the
basics of how to use the most basic
parts or yahoo pipes so let's jump back
over here we go and here I pulled
articles from Reuters specifically the
oddly enough articles from Reuters and
you can see they are right here however
I pulled these in a different way
previously I auto discovered the RSS
feeds here I actually provided the exact
RSS feed for the Reuters articles that I
wanted to pull down and I'm not going to
go into how I found these it's exactly
the same soft in the post as it is in
most websites then what I did was I took
again item link which means i am asking
yahoo pipes to figure out what the link
is to the original content and then i'm
defining what part of the original
content I want to pull down by defining
the beginning of and ending of said
content dumping it into item description
I'm using another operator here where
I'm defining that I want to make sure
that all of my titles are unique and
it's doing that for me and I'm also
using another folder where I am blocking
any articles that contain the word job
or jobs and then I'm dumping it again
into pipe output I'm able also to fetch
what are called comma separated values
don't know what those are I'll show you
what I got here is population changes in
every united state state and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to tell Yahoo
pipes I want to pull certain information
from this gigantic pile of numbers and
create something useful so let's jump
back in pipes again and I have state
population changes right here remember
I'm pulling all of the information in
this pipe from this page which is a CSV
file so let's jump over in pipes again
and you can see that what I was able to
pull out I'm defining the population of
the state of Michigan in the year 2000
along with every other state and then
the population in 2009 and then I'm
calculating the net population change
from 2008 to 2009 and then on top of
that I'm ordering everything so that all
of this data is based off of which state
lost the most in population and it's
providing this additional information so
how do you do that click on edit source
again what I did was I copied and pasted
the URL right here into the fetch CSV
area right here I defined that all those
numbers are separated by a comma that's
what we got right here then I told it to
use the row one as the title for all of
the other columns then I took all that
data drug it over here and then I said
each item name and you can see all of
this information automatically popped up
it pulled that from the CSV file you can
see these names up here pulling those
from the CSV file and Yahoo pipes does
that for you which is absolutely amazing
and then I'm assigning or creating a new
name for each one of those columns why
that's great is I'm going to now take
all the data that I created right here
and drop it down into this regular
expression editor regular expressions
allow you to edit text I'll just keep it
simple like that I did a whole entire
tutorial on regular expressions
basically what this code here means is I
want you to take everything that is in
the item description so what I'm saying
is I want the description for each part
of the RSS feed I want to replace all
the text in it and put this guy right
here in so i'm going to put pop in 2001
colon and then what i'm doing here is i
am referring to a variable that i
created up here so what it's going to do
automatically for me is pull that
information and throw it into the
description and then what this guy over
here does is it takes pop change there's
pop change over here and it sorts every
item in the RSS feed in ascending order
based off of population change so those
states that had large amount of
population change meaning it's going to
be a negative number are going to be at
the top and those states that have the
largest amount
increase in population are going to be
at the bottom and again you can see all
of this information see where it says
pop in 2001 colon and automatically
pulled all that information in air
forming in collaboration with yahoo
pipes that create feeds of infinite
varieties and just a simple yahoo mail
system that automatically forward your
feeds over to postie so that postie can
post that feed information directly onto
your website I've now shown you another
way that you can automate the whole
process of running a website and making
really good money off of it if you have
any questions or comments leave them in
the comments section below in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how to do
even more advanced things with yahoo
pipes till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
