23 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps today I'm gonna cover a whole bunch
of things I get asked for all the time
today I'm going to show you how to use
Google Maps inside of Android as well as
how to set up a splash screen we're also
gonna cover all the API keys and
generating signed apks and a whole bunch
of other different things so why don't
we just jump over and look at the
finished app okay so here's the finished
app I called it map II and you can see
the splash screen right there and it's
going to dissolve and then show the
Google Maps and you can see everything
all labeled right there and here you can
see a little marker that I put as well
as the little blue dot which is my
current location and I'm gonna be able
to zoom in on whatever I want to zoom in
on and you can see the satellite type of
hybrid map right there and that's gonna
zoom into my current location and
basically I'm gonna be able to pinch and
zoom or use the zoom buttons and move
around do pretty much anything that I
want I mean pretty much all the
functions you've won from Google Maps is
gonna be here except for directions
which if you guys really want that just
leave comments below and I'll get into
that a little bit I just want to keep
this as simple as possible and you can
also see here's the little marker and
whenever I click on it it says hello so
why don't we jump over and write all the
code to make it work okay so you saw the
finished application now I'm gonna walk
you through the entire process of
getting API keys which really seems to
confuse people what do you want to do is
you need a Google account of course
you're gonna have to go to consult
developers.google.com/live project
da-da-da-da-da right there and whenever
you do you're going to see this screen
and you're gonna come up here and click
on create project and whenever you do
you're gonna give it a project name it's
gonna give you a project ID
automatically in here and click on
create then you're gonna see this screen
right here
and you're gonna click on enable an API
and then you're gonna see all whole
giant lists you're gonna have to scroll
through specifically you're looking for
Google Maps Android API version 2 this
is what you're gonna use it might have
version 2.2 or something later on if you
are watching this tutorial later on but
whatever and you're gonna come over here
and click on the off button and that's
going to open that up and it's gonna say
do you want to enable this put a check
here and click on accept after you do
that you're gonna go over to api's and
authorization and click on credentials
right here
you're gonna say that you want to create
a new public API key right with this guy
so just click on this and then this
guy's gonna open up and we're gonna
click on Android key and then you're
going to see all of this stuff here and
I'm gonna show you exactly how to go
through and get these keys and all that
then what you're going to need to do is
go in inside of Android studio where you
have your project where you want to use
your Google Maps this is all for Google
Maps if I didn't say that before and
we're gonna click on generate a signed
apk under build and whatever you do this
is gonna pop up and we're just gonna
click on next and then this is gonna pop
up and you're gonna click on create new
and then you're gonna fill in all your
information where you want this to be
stored you're gonna want to give it a
password this is going to be done alias
you're gonna use another password just
leave this way it is and then type in
your information right here then click
on OK and whenever you do that's gonna
fill in all that information for you can
decide if you want to use remember
password or not click on next and then
you're going to go in here and type in
your password again and click set
password after that this is gonna open
up and we're gonna click on finish and
then what you're going to need to do is
go into your terminal or command line if
you're on Windows and you're gonna type
in key tool - list - V - key store and
the name of your key that you want to
use you're going to enter your passwords
gonna be the same password as before and
after you do that all this stuff is
gonna pop up here and then finally
you're going to get this key right here
sha-1 this is going to be very important
you're then gonna pop back over into
your browser where you had this and
you're going to type in the key the sh a
key and then you're gonna put a
semicolon and the name of whatever your
project is so calm new think tank is
gonna be whatever it is for you and then
it's gonna be whatever and it's gonna be
min my situation I called my project map
II type in all of that stuff and then
click on update after you click on
update it's gonna give you a private API
key this is what you're going to want to
copy and paste over into your Android
manifest here in a little bit and this
is the Android manifest file and this is
exactly what you're going to do right
after the activity ends and right before
application and your
type in all of this stuff the Android
name and it's gonna be Maps dot v2 dot
API key and then right here is we're
gonna paste your API key once again that
API key is this right here which is over
in your browser and that's all you're
gonna need to do on that end and I'm
also gonna get in the end of the
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
fix a very common error that comes up
whenever you're trying to implement
Google Maps inside of Android so now I'm
gonna jump over and start creating our
application okay so I'm gonna show you
how to set up a splash screen as well as
also setting up Google Maps just like
you saw at the application at the very
beginning of the tutorial we're gonna
use five different files here we're
gonna have activity splash screen dot
XML splash screen Java the Android
manifest of course which you already saw
and we're gonna add more to it
activity main.xml and mainactivity.java
your also this is inside of Android
studio you're gonna want to go into your
Gradle scripts right here and double
click on this and you're going to want
to make sure that down inside of here
one of your dependencies is the Play
Services guy and what we're gonna do
with this to make this work is we're
gonna open up the SDK manager that's
this guy right here just click on that
and it's gonna open up on your screen
load everything you're gonna go way down
here to the very bottom and you're gonna
want to make sure you put a checkmark in
here next to Google Play services this
is where the Google map stuff is and
you're gonna want to install it I have
already installed it and I'm sure if
you've done this put a check inside of
there and then click on install packages
and then authorize it to install so
that's what you're gonna have to do
there then you're gonna go into your
application up here and right click on
that and then come down inside of here
and look for open module settings click
on that and then this guy's gonna open
up right here and here and click on
dependencies and then you're gonna want
to come down here and click on the plus
sign and library dependency and you're
gonna see a whole bunch of these guys
open up the one that you're gonna want
to load in here I already did load it in
is Play services this guy right here so
you're gonna click on that and you're
gonna click on OK but I already did it
as you can see right here there is my
dependency loaded in there then after
you do that click on OK and you're gonna
have everything set up and this is
actually going to automatically
inside of your build.gradle file you
don't have to put it inside there so
that's great okay so we got all the hard
stuff out of the way and like I said at
the very end of the tutorial I'll show
you a workaround if you're having any
problems so this is our splash screen
and to be able to put an image inside
here I just went into got the Google
Maps and I'm gonna click on this and I'm
gonna go down here to copy Google Maps
like this you can copy in any way you
want to do it and there you go over to
your drawable folders and you're gonna
right click on it and click on paste and
that is going to paste in the Google
Maps logo and you're gonna be able to
use that as your splash screen so now to
get this to work for our splash screen
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create an image view and you can see
right there is the width and I'm just
gonna have that be wrap content like
this and also have this be wrap content
you're gonna want to come in here and
give it an ID click on that and I'm just
gonna call this image logo because
that's what it is and of course all the
code that's in this tutorial you're
gonna be able to find in a link in the
description here and I'm gonna say that
I want this to be centered in parent
there that is and I'm gonna mark that as
true and then I have to give it a source
and that's just going to be in the
drawable folder and then I called it
Google Maps
logo and there it is and that is all
you're going to have to do for activity
splash green dot XML now let's jump over
into splash screen java and set all that
up okay so here we are first thing we're
going to do is create a constant that is
going to define how long these splash
screens gonna wait before it jumps over
into activity main so I'm just gonna
call this splash screen delay like that
and give it a value of 3,000 that means
it's going to wait three seconds before
it jumps over into the activity main
which is going to have our maps and
everything inside of it come down here
inside of on create and I'm going to use
a handler like I did in the last
tutorial as a timer so that we'll be
able to wait here and the handler that
we're gonna have to import here is going
to be import Android dot s OS dot
handler that guy right there
so we import that I'm down here and then
we're gonna go post delayed and we're
going to
a new runnable for it here and we can
just come over here to this little light
bulb and click on implement methods and
we're gonna implement run of course and
click on ok that's gonna put all that in
there for us don't worry about any of
these errors now what we want to do is
open up main activity after 3 seconds
goes by so that means we need to issue
an intent or create an intent to open
main activity and we're gonna have to
splash in here with the splash screen
dot this and then define what we want to
open which is gonna be main activity and
class that off and then just start
activity and that is basically as easy
as it is to go in here and actually have
main activity open after three seconds
of course we also want to kill the
splash screen so that it is not used and
then come over here move this over a
little bit and then right after this guy
we're going to define how long we want
the delay to last and put a semicolon
and that is almost everything we need to
implement our splash screen next we need
to go into the Android manifest and
define the splash screen as an activity
as well as the main activity as an
activity so here we are in the Android
manifest and I have all the permissions
that we're going to need I'm gonna walk
through rather than type them all out so
we're going to be able to use Google
Maps we're going to need to get all of
these guys and get permission to be able
to use all of them so the permission for
their internet access network state
right external storage access course
location access fine location and
Internet as well as this guy which
Google Android providers GSF permission
once again all the code is available in
the description and it's free of course
also gonna come down here put this
permission inside of here and you're
going to use whatever your package name
is for this guy right here so you can
see it right there and if we jump over
here you can see our package name that's
right there so just copy and paste that
over yes this is supposed to be
signature I don't have anything there on
purpose this is for using OpenGL you're
also going to need that and you have all
of this information once again need to
go in here for the Google Play services
and make sure this automatically should
go inside of there if it isn't inside of
there wasn't setup with the beta
the Gradle build that we handled before
you're gonna have to type that in there
and then that brings us down here where
we're going to have to define that we do
not want mainactivity open but instead
we want splash screen Javad open
whenever this is all loaded up so just
come in here and type in splash screen
and that will open up that first and
then we'll jump over in the main
activity after we're all done with that
we are still going to have to define
main activity as an activity though so
activity and the name for this is going
to be main activity of course and let's
go in and give it a label and just go
out string app name works good enough
and then close that off and then down
here is where you're going to put your
API key
if you don't really remember from before
this is in the browser you're gonna copy
and paste this and paste it over inside
of the Android manifest and that is all
you're gonna need to do for your Android
manifest file and now I'm gonna jump
into activity main.xml and put
everything in there in regards to the
google map okay so here we are and I'm
just gonna come in here and create a
fragment we're gonna have this match
parent and we're gonna have this be
match parent as well I'm gonna give this
an ID there we are and I'm just gonna
call it map and then we're also gonna
get a bit a name and I'm gonna have this
be calm dot Google Android dot GMs OTT
Maps dot map fragment and you're gonna
want that to be the same and then close
that off and that is all we're gonna
need to do to get the Android Google map
to work and the final thing we need to
do is go into main activity and define
exactly all of the parameters we want to
use with the google map okay so right
inside of main activity the very first
thing I'm going to do is define the
latitude and longitude that I want to
put a mark in here for lat and long and
let's just call this Derrick position is
equal to new lat long an input latitude
and longitude so it's 40 and negative 79
works out then we're gonna have to
define our google map class so we're
gonna be using a lot here so google map
and then make sure that you have all the
proper inputs or imports and I'm just
going to call this Google map to keep
this simple and then I'm going to go
down inside of here inside of on create
we need to verify
that we can interact with a Google map
so I'm gonna put a try block inside of
here and I'm gonna say if Google map is
equal to null and I'll go Google map
equal to map fragment and then get
fragment manager and then find fragment
by ID and I'll just go r dot ID dot map
and that's what we named it and then
after this go dot get map there we go
then this guy's gonna want to catch
block underneath of here so let's go
catch and just keep this simple
exception e and then e print stack trace
and I put an extra equal sign in there
let's get rid of that and now that we
have this set up we can define all the
different attributes we want our map to
have so the first thing I'm going to do
is show a satellite map with roads
there's a couple different ways to do
this but I can just go google map dot
and I can set my map type and there's a
couple options like I said so we can go
google map dot
and you can see right here hybrid none
normal satellite terrain all the
different options you can have there in
regards to the map type you're gonna
show I'm gonna have this beam map type
and it's very easy to go in there and
change it just like that so if you want
to have some sort of button or something
on the screen that'll allow you to
change the map type you know you can
just go in there and do that let's say I
also want to place a dot on my current
location
I can just go map all right set my
location enabled and then say true and
it's gonna put a dot on the screen where
I'm located I could also turn the
traffic layer on Google Map dot set
traffic enabled and just type in true
you could also have these be false of
course Google map if we want to enable
indoor maps set indoor enabled also
marked is true of course that's gonna be
only where it's available google map
again if you want to set 3d buildings
again where that is an option mark that
is true if you want to show the zoom
buttons we go get UI settings and then
go set zoom controls enabled and mark
that as true and that's gonna bring on
those little zoom buttons which are
helpful or get rid of them if you want
to clean your interface if you want to
create a marker on the screen for pretty
much any latitude and longitude that you
have you can do that as well
just go google map don't add marker
you could add a ton of markers if you
want have an array of them or whatever
new marker options and then right after
this you're gonna go and put your
position inside of there and then Derek
position was the latitude and longitude
that I had to find right here oh there
it is this guy right here and then if
you want to have a title pop-up if they
click on that marker you can just come
in here and we can do something like
hello and there you go that is all
you're gonna have to do code wise to
make this guy work and if you do ever
get an error this is probably going to
be the error you're gonna see you're
going to see that basically it's going
to say ensure that the Google Maps
Android API is enabled and sure that the
following Android Keys exists if you see
this in your logcat panel inside of here
all you need to do is copy and paste
this guy copy all of this the whole way
down to the end of your project name and
then jump back over into your browser
right here where we typed in what we had
previously and copy and paste what we
had in that error message into here and
click on update and what you're gonna
see is a new API keys going to be
generated of course you could come in
here again and click on edit allowed
Android applications and create a whole
brand new one and it's not gonna get rid
of the old API key unless you click on
delete so okay guys that is how we're
gonna set up splash screens how we are
going to use Google Maps and how to
generate signed apks hope that covered a
lot of questions I've been getting
otherwise please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
