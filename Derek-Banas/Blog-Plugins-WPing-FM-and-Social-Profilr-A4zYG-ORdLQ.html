video response to some people who asked
me some very specific questions to find
very specific plugins to help them solve
their issues so first off I was asked to
find a tool that would allow person to
put links to social networking websites
and I got that it is called social
profiler with no e at the end of
profiler and secondly I was asked for a
better tool than socialite which you can
see right here they were looking for a
tool that will allow them to tamat 'post
all of their WordPress or website posts
directly to multiple social networking
sites and i found that and it's called
WPF found both dynamite plugins that i
wouldn't have found if i wasn't asked so
keep the comments coming now I answer
them the best of my ability first off
let's keep it simple social profiler got
it right here i'm going to show you you
install it just like every other plug-in
and then it sets up extremely easily
just click on settings then you go on a
social profile and click on that and
this is all you do you just simply type
in a description decide you want it to
be a vertical or horizontal decide how
big you want the icons to the social
networking sites debate now you type in
your ID for each one of the social
networking sites that you want click on
on each one of them click update
settings and boom you can see I have it
right here and if somebody would click
on this tool they'll be sent to my
youtube channel and it works that simple
and that's all you need to do and it
just simply works so there you are to
the person had a question about have set
up links to their social networking
sites social profile PR 0 fil are now a
more complicated question how to
automatically send to over 30 or 40 to
for social networking sites you know I
went through a whole bunch of the tools
and the only one I could find that works
really good is called w ping Don FM now
if you go to the settings area for that
this is what you're going to say you're
going to need a ping FM account first
off so we might as well just go right
into that all you do is sign up for an
account they don't really ask you how
many questions it's all fine then what
you would do is click on the login you
can see here these are the social
networking sites i have set up already
right here and you're going to need an
application key for this plugin to
properly work you can see i have mine
black down down here but you're going to
need that key and how you get it is by
clicking right here application keys and
it will give you that key once you plug
that in the whole doggone thing pretty
much works on its own you can add
networks here meaning social networks
that you want your plugins to
automatically post him take you through
that process just click on add more
networks and let's pick one that I
haven't set up yet let's try friendfeed
all you do is click on add network I
don't have an account there click here
to get your FriendFeed account already
have account no sign up with your email
address and these all pretty much work
exactly the same one I'm going to leave
this checked for poblet or unchecked so
that its public create my account I
don't feel like doing that don't smell
like doing there Oh everything is all
set up so now I jump back over here link
ping FM front feet it's going to all of
these work almost exactly the same all
the social networking sites click on
allow access networks been added and
that's pretty much all you do on some of
these you'll actually have to just jump
back over my dashboard so that you can
see friendfeed there it is right there
and now whenever I make any type of pose
it's automatically going to go to all of
these different websites so what you do
on the settings page on in the wp pain
FM is you can put a message here at
shadows not to I left these unchecked
because I thought it would be
aggravating that every single time I
change at post in any way that people
would be notified so I left those
uncheck that leave that to you do
whatever you want all that I have
checked is update paying off that win
the new post is published so only time
anybody's going to see any things that
then you have a little message it
automatically pulls the title if your
post into their link title to blog have
that set up and then save options and of
course again you have to put your
account ID in here right there now let's
go over here is a draft i have set up
marketing examples see it right here
just a regular post that i have set up
already what i want to do is click on
publish and you can see automatically
friendfeed automatically new posts
marketing examples rating coffee part to
automatically updated every social
networking sites every single time I
make a new post and you can see here add
more networks twitter facebook myspace
there are tons of social networking
sites that this automatically works with
so thank you guys for your comments hope
