3 of my programming in Python tutorial
today we're going to talk about strings
if you didn't see the other tutorials go
check those out because you probably
don't know what idle is an idle is what
we use to create Python programs let's
start this off string examples this is a
comment up here and to create a string
variable type I want to give it that man
and then just put it in quotes and then
if you want to print it out and you'll
see the output over here well this is a
sample string now what I'm going to do
is show you the format option that's
available with the print function
because some people had some questions
about that I'm just creating this is an
integer which I talked about in previous
tutorial and then I'm going to create
another string variable I'm going to
call it cats I'm going to pull up the
print function alright these little
curly brackets here allow me to insert
variables put quotes and then the dot
format type in num1 comma or 1 sure you
close that off hit f5 I have two cats
and you can see they automatically go in
based off of their order and here I'm
going to show you how to combine two
strings we're going to call it combined
STR is equal to I have blank plus sign
now we're going to need to convert this
variable name num1 into a string with
this string function right here the
reason why is it is an integer if you
try to send an integer you're going to
get an error which is bad now if I print
that you can see I have two cats printed
again and it printed here the first time
and here the second time so that's how
you would be able to combine strings in
two different ways you could also append
information so let's say combine string
let's say I want to put the value I
think at the end of this string this is
how I would do it plus equals to equals
comma space I think and then if we print
combined string you can see I think
showed up right over here I'm going to
create a string called string variable
to let me show you a bunch of different
functions that are available I'm going
to show you the for statement what we're
doing here is it is going to cycle
through all of the letters that are in
the string value that you see up here
and this is this is called the iterator
often but I prefer the cycler because I
think it makes more sense in other
languages or other people might think it
sounds worse but either way iterator or
cycler that's definitely not a that's a
made-up term that I created because I
think it makes more sense people
understand it what it basically will do
is it will jump through here and the
this basically what this says is for as
long as there aren't letters in this
string I want to to individually place
the letter in the value of I as you
cycle through all the letters in the
variable that's name string there too
that's basically what that says and what
this is going to do is print them out on
the screen and you can say just another
string now let's say you just wanted to
print the first character in this string
be real simple
remember you want to because of
whitespace roles in Python you want to
go down a line you don't want the
indentation we're going to do here is
print and let's say I want to do a
newline that's what this symbol does
backslash n
means that a new line is issued we're
going to type in the close that off and
we're going to put a bracket here a
square bracket and 0 the index of the
first letter of the string of every
string is 0 then goes 1 2 3 4 5 and
onwards and onwards and onwards and
onwards we'd have 5 link you can see it
printed all the strings and then it
created a new line right here and then
it printed out the first letter in the
string is J and if I went and change
this to 1
I'm gonna see you show up and that's
exactly what you see there on your
screen now you see how all of these
letters are printed on individual lines
let's say we wanted to be able to print
them out all on the same line exactly
how they go in there well whenever you
create a for loop it automatically
creates a new line as it cycles through
well what I'm gonna do here is I'm going
to override that new line and instead
tell it to just simply put nothing there
so I'm going to put print input I comma
n is equal to and this basically says
after you print this I want you to do
put this right here which is nothing you
can see it's just printed out just
another string not like it did right
here so moving on to other things you
can do with strings let's create string
3 is equal to just like I was able with
the backslash B 4 what I'm going to do
here is actually create a multi-line
string and throw the newline character
in there again as long as I use those
triple quotes this guy right here will
be I'll be able to make this as long as
humanly possible if I print this out
let's see over here this is a multi-line
string now if I didn't want this to skip
to the next line I would just put a
backslash in here and it prints
everything out on one line you could
also let's say if you want to
to print a quote inside of these quotes
what would get confused if you had quote
let me just show you we tried to print
this this will give you a syntax error
because it wouldn't know where the
string ended so if you want to correct
for that again you put a backslash in
there and in another backslash and it
won't pay any attention to that again we
could also use single quotes as well to
alleviate that issue all together and
there is also backslash characters for
single quotes let's create string for
just ramble on I'll print this out this
is some really long strings here well
that's really bad English that's what
happens when you do something completely
on the fly now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you how to search for
individual words inside of a string just
do that here with the find function and
what it's going to do is it's going to
give me the index for the word really
where it appears if you count over the
letter R will be the third indexed
character inside of this string now if I
want to grab that text and print it onto
the screen I would just simply go print
string for bracket 13 being the first
character and really 19 actually being
this space right here this dead space
because you always have to go one ahead
to grab everything and if I save and
print you can see it prints out the word
really right there on the screen now
let's say that I want to replace all of
the letter E's with the letter A inside
of this string that's how I do it with
the replace function that's built into
every string variable in python now
have to print this out and you can see
here placed all the letter YZ with the
letter A is so everything's spelled
incorrectly there are tons of functions
I'm just going over some of the more
useful ones like for example I'm going
to create a string here that has too
much white space and this is very usable
especially whenever later on I'm going
to teach you how to automate a website
you're going to be doing things like
this all of the time so I got all this
additional white space and if I print it
all the lakes by shows so let's say I
want to get rid of the whole that
additional white space you might think
well that would be really really hard
but it's not just type in strip
and all that whitespace is gone let's
say we want to split up all of the words
in the string and again this is
something else that you would do all the
time
just to save time here I'm just gonna
eliminate the strip part right here and
instead type in split see automatically
goes and splits every single word into
this little guy here you're actually
going to be able to see just for the
heck of it what value this is now
because it's no longer a string it is
what is called a list and that's what
we're going to cover in the next
tutorial now that you split all these
different values apart what I'm going to
do now show you how to rejoin them so
I'm just going to copy that line of code
just to speed things up here a little
bit and I have to define what how I want
basically what's going to do is it's
going to get rid of this quote here and
all of this space here and it's
wondering at least Python wants to know
what do you want me to put there so what
I'm going to tell it is I want you to
put a single space there and then I'm
going to use the join function to join
all of these previously broken up items
that are stored in a list and of course
I got to tell it which variable to use
and if I jump out here copy that
boom they're all joined right back
together again and like I said you're
going to be doing this a lot you want to
know the length of this string just take
an L en boom 34 characters and if you
want to skip like remember before when
we're using the backspace character well
there's something called raw text and
how you create a raw string inside of
Python is to precede any string
declaration with lowercase letter R and
we're going to actually be using this an
example so if you don't quite get this
don't worry about it
and then we'll print this out I don't
want to see previously that would caused
a new line but because I put that little
R there automatically escaped from that
and that is a heck of a lot of the
different things you can do with strings
in Python if you have any questions
leave them in the comment section below
in the next tutorial I will cover all of
the different lists that are available
in Python until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
