much fun it is to actually draw inside a
flash what I specifically use is the
brush tool inside a flash and I choose
just a random point like this and i'm
using a Wacom tablet which I got for
under a hundred dollars off of ebay it's
the bamboo fun which is in my opinion
after testing a bunch of different
tablets about the best tablet for flat
and this is the different options i'm
using just using a basic straight
circular brush and paint normal and so
forth and so on when i draw inside a
flash I like to draw actually with a
gray I don't know why but I drew these
really really really fast and I'm just
going to show you here real quickly how
we could draw a girl character inside a
flash and I'm just going at this rule
basically and you can see flash
automatically Styles everything for you
so that makes it really neat how it
comes out because it's a girl give the
obligatory eyelashes see how it just
automatically goes and pulls that in
it's really neat
and say I want to give her our big kind
of goofy nose few little nostrils on
there and let's say I want to give her a
big smile cheeks actually get from open
mouth catch that smooth that out what I
like about flash is that it just makes
it so simple to draw I mean it's like I
don't draw it all like this in real life
but you can see like my real drawings
are a lot tighter and I normally
whenever I would be doing this I would
be doing this very painstakingly and
tracing an image and so forth and so on
but i just wanted to really bring across
the idea of just how free you can bay
and i'm on purpose going to be sloppy
here because i have smoothing set up it
automatically is correcting the artwork
and I'm going to want to tighten this up
make sure that everything stays
connected and it just makes the whole
process of drawing just very very easy
and simplistic give this a little bit of
a swoosh give it a weird ear up here a
kind of out of place but either way and
it just puts little accents which I
really like it forces me to not be
little goofy order it forces me to be
goofy and cleans up my artwork and makes
things just work and it's just kind of
neat then what I'm going to do is come
in here select everything and then
change it to black for some reason I
can't draw as well with black as I can
whenever I have it like this and then
I'm going to real quickly come in here
color that go jump over the eyedropper
grab this paste in there grab the
eyedropper again and yes I could use
your cuts and in real life I do but in
these videos I try not to it's kind of
neat sort of looks like the teeth are
going right there and here paint the
eyes jump back over the brush tool
switch this the white clean here make a
highlight
a lot of times inside a flash this is
what people do they actually go and to
do highlights this is locked down here
and they draw with the line tool like
this and then bend it in words and then
what you could do I'm actually you know
what I'm doing so go in here paste in
that area then get rid of the line but
they drop down inside of there that's a
really easy way to do different
highlights inside a flash do the same
thing here just bend that up I'm
actually going to catch cut that and I'm
going to come over here real quickly
allows me to get a darker color of that
brown drop that down inside remove the
line again and of course I could come in
here and add additional highlights with
the brush tool just that easily and of
course come in here actually grab these
blacks and convert them to the brown
highlights that I have here they
automatically go to that brown color so
just some quick little ways to use flash
to draw I mean it's so so so simple to
do to really neat add some highlights
and the eyes you can see it's just kind
of a neat sort of way to play around
inside a flash and it shows you just how
easy it is to create cartoony type
characters just not hard at all shout
out there I guess that's a little bit
overdoing it those are some different
ways you control and stop flash and this
is all just like made up in my head and
I nitpick everything go inside here in
the eye
area clean that up and there you have it
of some neat things you can do with a
tablet inside a flash to draw cartoon
characters if you have any questions or
