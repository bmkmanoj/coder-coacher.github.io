tutorial on how to install the canoe
compiler collection I've been asked for
this tutorial probably about thirty
times this week so I decided to show you
how to install GCC on both windows as
well as Macs and also I provided a link
in the description if you want to see
all of this written out so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay I'm
gonna start off with the Windows users
out there what you need to do is go to
sourceforge.net forward slash projects
forward slash min g.w and once you go
there you can just come down here to
this nice little download button and
click on it and whenever you do that
you're going to get the little installer
down here just click on it and go open
and then this little thing is going to
pop up just click on run if you trust
that and then click on yes and it's
going to open up a little wizard hit
next hit next use prepackaged repository
catalogs yes hit next accept the
agreement hit next
put it here this is where you want to
put it inside of the C Drive and then
min GW that'll save you a lot of
problems hit next then you need to
choose the different compilers you want
to use there C I'm going to get that C++
Fortran I don't want Objective C I'm not
going to use atom I'm not going to use
I'm not going to use any of these other
things and I'm gonna hit next
installing there's all the things hit
install and there it is it's installed
display the win log now I don't care hit
finish and now that you have that all
set up you can do a couple different
things I'm going to open this guy up
right here and we can go down to all
programs you're going to need your
command line so we're going to go into
accessories and look for command prompt
there it is open that up then after the
command prompt is open what you can do
is go set path equal to C and then a
backslash and then min G W back slash
bin put a semicolon inside of there and
then put a percent on and then type in
path and then another % and hit enter
then it'll be on your path or if you
don't want to do it that way we can do
it a different way we can instead go
open up windows and specifically look
for the control panel this is Windows 7
open that up now with the control panels
open hits its demand security then
you're going to want to go and click on
system and then over here advanced
system settings click on that then all
this opens up Wow all we're interested
in is environment variables this down
here click on that and then you want to
come down through here bounce through it
until you find path then you want to hit
edit and then inside of this at the very
end you want to put a semicolon already
did it put a semicolon and then the path
to mingw and then make sure you put the
bin at the end and that's all you do it
ok and now it is in your path now you
may have to restart your command prompt
if this doesn't work but then to test
that its installed and go GCC /v like
that and if it shows you this then you
know everything is installed and I
actually type in dir and there's
documents inside of my Documents folder
I'm going to type in change directory to
documents inside of there dir dot a dot
C programs right there change directory
to C programs there are C programs dir
and there you can see it actually worked
before I'm just going to come in here
and go GCC you can use all the same
commands I'm using now testing is the
name of AC file I have there it is it
compiled and I can just type a and you
can see testing GCC it worked and that
is it that is all that is to setting up
everything inside of Windows and you can
use notepad you can use notepad plus
plus whatever and that is it you're
ready to go now back in the Mac world
things get a little bit more complicated
actually really not so much what I'm
gonna do is I'm actually going to show
you how to use Mac ports you just go to
Mac ports dot-org this is going to make
your life so much easier first thing
you're going to need to do though is
figure out what version of OS X you're
using and here are all the different
versions of OS X that are likely to be
out there if you have Tiger then you're
going to be 10.4 leper
10.5 Snow Leopard 10.6 lion 10.7 and
mountain lion finally and how you find
out which version of OS X you have you
can bounce up to the happy Apple logo up
here and say about this Mac and whenever
you do you're going to see in my
situation I have ten point seven point
five that's ten point seven and based
off this information that means I have a
lion okay so that's how you figure that
out now the reason why that is important
is you have to install the right version
of Mac ports so we're going to go over
here to available downloads click on
that and you're going to cycle through
all these different versions until you
find a version of Mac ports that fits
I have 10.7 lion this is what I need so
I need to click on that dmg and that
opens up on the screen and double click
on it and yes you want to continue and
then you're just going to go through
this and just even keep hitting continue
over and over again continue continue
continue to continue install you must
agree to the terms I agree either da da
da and so forth and so on
and then finally hit install while I
already have Mac ports installed that's
all you need to do is hit install
everything's going to work so I'm not
going to bother installing it again and
then what you need to do is open up your
main computer file there c macintosh and
go to applications and then you want to
look for utilities which is in here
somewhere and utilities is going to look
like this double click on it and then
inside the utilities folder you're going
to see terminal you want to open that up
and you probably want to save that down
on your dock then terminal is going to
open up for you my computer's name
scarlet so that's the reason why that's
up there then what you're going to want
to do is type in sudo port self update
this is going to update Mac ports and
you have to type in the sudo part
because it's going to ask for a password
which I just typed in and then it's
going to update and this could take some
time and there you go and after it's all
updated you're going to see the port's
tree has been updated dah dah dah dah
dah then everything else you're going to
do is going to be done inside the
terminal from this point onwards you're
going to type in sudo port install and
the current version of the canoe
compiler collection is going to be GCC
48 you're going to hit that and it's
going to install it I'm not going to go
through that because I don't think you
want to wait now you need to after that
all goes through you're going to want to
change the default version of GCC inside
of your computer so you're going to type
in sudo port select set GCC MP - GCC and
everything should be almost exactly the
same pretty much the only thing it could
change is this 48 at the end and what
this is going to do for you is like I
said before change the default version
of GCC will cross your entire terminal
then you're going to type in hash GCC
and hit enter you're just going to hit
enter every single time after you type
in these different things then you're
going to type in GCC - V just like you
did in Windows if you saw that and all
this is going to pop up and that means
everything is properly installed if you
see a matching GCC 48 down here and
there you go that is how you install the
good new compiler collection if you have
any questions like I said before all
this is in text format in the
description please leave any questions
or comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
