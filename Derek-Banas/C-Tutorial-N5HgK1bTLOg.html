new C++ tutorial in this tutorial I'm
gonna teach you C++ through problem
solving and I will cover everything for
both Mac OS as well as Windows and I'm
gonna be using NetBeans and if you don't
have that installed in the description I
have a link to how to set that up on
both Windows and Mac OS also in the
description I have a full transcript as
well as a cheat sheet for the entire
tutorial and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it okay so here we see NetBeans
on Mac OS and here we see it on Windows
say exactly the same exact thing okay so
what I'm gonna do here first is I'm
gonna create a new project on both and
you'll be able to see how that's set up
so we're just gonna go file and new
projects and this is the Mac OS version
and what we're gonna do is come over
here to C C++ application and click on
next and then cpp application this is
gonna be where ever you want this to be
located I'm gonna call this CPP to
toriel and I'm going to leave everything
exactly the same and click on finish
after you do that you're gonna be able
to go over here source files and click
on May and CPP and that is going to open
up for you as you can see right there
alrighty and I have my output window
over here yours is probably gonna be
down here in the bottom all you do is
you just drag it wherever you want it to
go and that is going to define where
your output window goes okay so I'm
gonna leave mine on the right also you
may be asking yourself why is this dark
yours is probably white what you're
gonna want to do is go to tools if you
want this and then go to plugins if
you're gonna want that you're gonna see
I already have it installed right here
see it says dark EULA LAF and that means
well if you want it what you're gonna
have to do is go to available plugins
and then type in dar dark EULA whoops
dar C and it will pop-up I already have
it installed so it doesn't show up there
but if you don't care about it being
dark don't worry about it and if you
have any problems with that don't worry
about it either and to create a new
project in Windows you're gonna do the
same thing you're gonna go up here
you're gonna go file and new project
this is gonna pop up I'm gonna go and
choose CPP this guy right here C++
application click on next and then I'm
gonna call this CPP tutorial once again
click on browse to define where I want
to save it I'm gonna go in my C
directory and then I'm gonna go into
users and then pick my name and then in
my documents directory you can see I
have C++ tutorial I'm gonna put it there
okay so c++ tutorial I'm gonna say open
and that's where everything's gonna be
stored and I'm gonna click on finish and
then once again over in your source
files you can just double click on main
dot cpp and you're gonna see there are
all of your all of your code okay so
here we are once again on I'm gonna go
and get rid of this you can see right
here is an example how to create
multi-line comments so you're just gonna
put a forward slash and a star and then
to close it you're gonna have a star and
a forward slash I'm just gonna get rid
of all this stuff I'm gonna be bouncing
back and forth between the Mac OS
version and the Windows version here
just so I cover everything now the very
first line we have here is include and C
standard library what these are called
are preprocessor directives and what
they're gonna do is load files and
objects which contain pre-made functions
and objects for your use and this guy
right here specifically the C standard
library is gonna contain functions for
converting from one data type to another
random number generators memory
management searching math sorting and a
whole bunch of other general-purpose
functions we're gonna go and also
include another one and if you don't
catch what I say don't don't worry about
it because I'm gonna cover things
multiple times over and over again I'm
not a big guy in memorizing I believe
that you will naturally just remember
what you need to remember through use
this guy right here is gonna provide a
whole bunch of functions for performing
input and output operations let's go and
throw a couple more inside of here just
to get them all the ones that we're
gonna need you're gonna get string also
and these are called preprocessor
directives and we're also going to get
vector and what vectors are going to do
they are going to be resizable arrays
and if you don't know what array is I'm
gonna cover that in this tutorial and
also I'm going to use SS stream and what
this is going to be allow us to do is to
manipulate strings which are just a
series of characters now we get to this
guy right here this namespace by using
this you are going to well if we want to
output information on our screen we are
going to either have it be like this and
hello world for example okay so that is
a way for us to output information on
the screen if you have this guy here
that is going to allow you to eliminate
the use of typing in STD by using this
however you may have conflicts
if you define functions that share a
name in the standard namespace so in
this tutorial series I am NOT going to
use it so I'm gonna get rid of it all
together so we're just gonna have to
type out this part right here and a
little bit more typing but it will get
rid of a couple potential problems later
on now you can also come in here and if
you just wanted to use this for
outputting information to the screen and
that's what this does it outputs
information to your terminal or over
here in your little output box you could
also come in and just type in using
standard C out like that and then you
would only have to type in C out also
but I'm gonna get rid of that also
alrighty
that brings us down to this line now
execution of all of your code is gonna
start with your main function and argc
and argv are going to be optional data
that is going to be passed to your
program if it should be executed on the
terminal and if you decide to use it
this guy right here is going to store
the number of arguments passed to your
computer to or to your program whenever
you run it and this is going to be an
array that is going to point to a whole
bunch of values or strings in this
situation that are passed your program
whenever it's executed from the terminal
I'm going to show you what that works
like or how that works here in a second
and I'm also gonna show you how
everything works exactly on Windows as
well just so you are a hundred percent
positive that everything's gonna work
the same now I put this guy right here
as a newline another option that you
have available
to you is you could also do a new line
with STD like that and en DL and that is
also going to give you a new line
provide you with a new line option okay
and we could actually come in here and
check that this works we could come in
and execute it just by clicking on this
little guy up here and whenever I do
that you're gonna see HelloWorld pops up
right there and I went and enlarged the
right side our output window here just
so you will be able to see it if you
want to know how to do that you just
right click and then come here where it
says larger font and also if you would
want to enlarge your text inside of this
this is on Mac OS what you're gonna do
is go NetBeans and preferences and fonts
and colors and here you're gonna be able
to change your font in color just by
clicking on that picking what you want
and also on windows you're gonna do
pretty much the same exact thing except
you're gonna go to tools and you're
gonna go to options and you can see
fonts and colors and then you click on
this guy right here and change your font
in color alright so good stuff l and
this is how you move your output window
say I just grabbed it I'm gonna drag it
over here like that and now you can see
the output window on the right side of
your screen and just like before you're
gonna be able to come over here and
right click inside your window and go
larger font to increase the font to
whatever size you want it to be okay so
just to be technical what's going on
here right right here is this guy right
here see out is going to represent your
console or your screen this guy right
here is called the stream insertion
operator and what it's doing is it's
taking this string and also this new
line and it is sending it to your screen
okay pretty simple stuff it just looks
crazy and foreign but that's all it's
doing it's saying hey I want the screen
to receive this string and this new line
and I want to put it on the screen okay
simple stuff and what I want to do is
show you how to make these guys work
even though you're not really gonna use
them very often but I just want to you
know cover everything so what we're
gonna do first is we are going to check
if any arguments were passed now if a if
no arguments are passed what you're
going to get as a value for gr or Arg C
is actually going to be one so we're
gonna say if it's not equal to one that
means we received something and we're
gonna be able to process it then what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna print out what
they actually sent with our
I'm gonna go see out and I'm gonna say
something like you entered and then I'm
going to say what they entered and
that's argc arguments and you can go to
the new line like that that's not gonna
cause any problems
somebody got arguments and that's gonna
print out the number of arguments that
they pass so I'm just gonna throw a new
line in there instead of and L like we
normally did then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to cycle through every
single thing that is in this guy right
here which is an array now to do that an
array is just a box of values that's all
it is and each of those values is going
to be stored sequentially in memory and
each of those values is going to be at a
specific address just like your house
has addresses arrays have addresses
however we are going to refer to
addresses at least in this situation
with arrays by the name of index and the
index starts at 0 and then goes to 1 2 3
4 and upwards and forever now if we want
to cycle through those values we just
need a way to increment the index so
that we will be able to print out every
single all right one way to do that is
with a for loop and you may need or may
not be aware of how for loops work and
this tutorial series is going to get
progressively more complicated it's
gonna get complicated quickly so if
you're thinking that's kind of boring
and I know all this stuff don't worry
we're gonna get to it so what I need to
do is first start off with index 0
that's what I'm doing right here and int
just means this isn't an integer that
means there's no decimals involved and
what we're gonna do is we're going to
continue incrementing the indexes as
long as I is less than the number of
items that were passed into it so we're
going to cycle through all those and
then what we want to do this is a
shortcut that says that we want to
increment the value of I so we're going
to go from 0 to 1 and it's going to be 0
as we execute the code and then it's
going to come back up here and it's
going to increment the one they're after
so what we need to do is access the
information that is stored and the
indexes of our array so we go argv this
guy right here and if we want to access
a specific index we just go and put the
I inside of there and
then I'm gonna throw a new line after
that and there we go and that's gonna
provide us basically to cycle through
all of those different items and this
guy down here where it says return zero
what that is saying is whenever we
return a value of zero that means that
our program executed properly if we
would return a negative one that would
mean that some type of an error occurred
so that is every single thing the
meaning of every single thing you see on
your screen so we're gonna save that and
we're gonna copy it and just to show you
that everything's the same I'm gonna
come over here and I'm gonna select all
I'm gonna paste in everything that we
have over there and we're gonna run it
because this is about the only thing
it's gonna be different between Mac OS
and Windows now on Mac OS I'm gonna run
this in the terminal and I could
actually run the terminal inside of
NetBeans but I'm gonna do it in a
different way
so I'm gonna get command and space I'm
gonna type in terminal like that hit
enter and then this guy's gonna open up
I can go LS to see what I have you might
have to change your directory to
wherever you want to go but I'm actually
in the directory where I want to be and
if I want to come in here and execute my
program and pass in a series of values I
can do that inside of here what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go G plus plus and
main dot cpp and there that is and that
went and compiled it and now to execute
my code
I'm gonna go dot /a dot o UT I'm gonna
say I love C plus plus and it didn't
work and the reason why is probably
because I'm in the wrong directory so
let's go back in different directory to
LS ah there it is so I want to change my
directory the c++ tutorial no problem
make sure I spell it right an LS and
then what we can do we can just press up
on your number pad so you want to go
through all these different things and I
can go in here and compile this that we
are and then I can go and compile this
and there you can see hello world you
entered four arguments a out prints
that's the very first one that's the
reason why we checked if there was not
equal to one because this comes out by
default if nothing is passed in and then
you can see we cycled through every
single string that was then passed into
our array and printed all of that stuff
out now over inside of Windows we're
going to use the command line and said
that's a
guy right here and I believe I am in the
correct directory and got a dir to see
what's going on here no I'm not let's go
and change to see PP tutorial and then
go directory and you can see all the
different files that we have here and
we're gonna type the same thing if we
want to clear the screen just go CLS and
we're gonna do the same exact thing
we're gonna go G plus plus main dot CPP
and that's gonna go and compile our
program for us we can go dir and we can
see a list of all of our applications we
have here then we can go is go a dot exe
and I love C++ and whenever I do that it
goes low world you entered for arguments
it prints out the application and I love
C++ okay so there is all of the
differences between Mac OS running C++
by applications that's how to get
arguments into our program which we're
probably never gonna do ever again but I
just want to cover it just so you knew
how that worked out and now I'm gonna
jump over into our second example okay
for this example I'm gonna talk a lot
about datatypes so I'm going to go and
get another preprocessor directive and
this one is going to be called limits
and it is going to be used basically to
find the minimum and maximum values for
a whole bunch of different data types
and I'm also what I want to do here
basically whenever we create a variable
what we are doing is telling the
computer how much memory to set aside
for the value and what we'll name we
want to associate with that data that
we're gonna be storing and variable
names are gonna need to contain letters
numbers underscores yeah but no math
operators spaces and the very first
value in your variable name cannot be a
number if you would want to define what
is called a global variable which is
going to be a value that is accessible
everywhere in your program you're going
to just outside of your main function or
any of your functions you're just in
this situation I'm gonna create an
integer and I'm gonna put a G in front
of it this is referred to as Hungarian
notation you can either use it or you
can't and if you do you're going to
either put an i or an representing that
this is an integer don't worry about all
this stuff I'm just going to put random
number is equal to zero
and just know that that value right
there can be accessed anywhere
another thing is sometimes very useful
is to use constant values and this just
means that once you assign a value
you're not going to be able to change it
and this is going to be a double which
means that it has decimal places I'm
gonna put PI inside of here and we can
do some like 3.14159 blah blah blah blah
blah and there you go and that is going
to be how we define constants now the
different data types that are going to
be available to us are going to be
boolean x' which are either going to
have a value of true or a value of 1 1
and true or the same thing or false or 0
and to define them you just go bull and
I'm gonna use some garyun notation here
again I could say something like married
is equal to true ok so there is boolean
we also have character types which are
going to store one of 256 possible
characters and these are basically going
to be the characters that you see on
your keyboard and to define it we can go
CH and my grade and then surround
whatever character you want inside of
there with single quotes and there you
go now you have a character you're also
going to be able to have unsigned
integers and the reason why we are
potentially maybe going to use an
unsigned integer is we know that we are
never going to need a negative value so
what that's going to allow us to do is
to well let's go let's work our way up
here slowly so we go short I'm gonna
show you here in a second how to find
out the minimum and maximum values for
all these so I'm creating an unsigned
short integer this actually has a
maximum value of 65535 and what do you
think the minimum value is it's unsigned
short integer 0 so if we would want to
come in here and define one of those we
could do something like use 16 an age is
equal to 43 and we could go short
integer they have a maximum value of
32,767 so this is a short int the reason
why is it has a minimum value of
negative negative 32,000 and such so
we're gonna do
something like wait is equal to 180 and
I also have regular old integers and
then go and days is equal to is equal to
7 you can also have long integers &amp;amp;
Spell long or correct long and I'm just
gonna these are gonna be very large
numbers so I can go as long as it
doesn't have any decimal places in there
and I want a big number that's a very
good option for us we also have floats
and we could do pi once again or
something like that and you can use i'm
what i'm using here is camel case for my
variable name so you can see each time i
have a new word inside my variable name
i'm i'm using upper case letters and i
go something like 3.14 that and then we
have after that we have doubles and i
could do something like DB and big float
is equal to one point and i'm actually
gonna put 21s inside of here and i'm
going to use this an example here in a
second to show you the different
precision that these different datatypes
provide and then also we have long
doubles and those are even bigger
doubles so there we go
whoops one for i know somebody in the
comment sections gonna get on me if i
don't type that in there okay so those
can be even bigger another thing you can
have is you can actually have the
compiler go and assign your type for you
and if you do that you just type in auto
and i'll say something like what will i
be is equal to true and it's going to
see true as the value and of course it's
gonna turn that into a boolean
automatically without you doing anything
now if i want to see how big these
different values can be I can go
standard see out and then I could do
something like minimum bull you already
know what that is but I'm gonna show you
how to get all of them and then to get
the maximum I can go standard and
numeric limits and I can also like I
said before come down here to the next
line if it would be a little bit easier
for us to work with and numeric limits
and then inside of it I'm gonna put the
datatype that I want to look at so I'm
gonna go bull and then I'm gonna follow
that up with men if I want to get the
minimum value for our boolean there we
are and I'm gonna do something very very
similar for getting the maximum so let's
just change this to maximum bull and
then we'll change this to max and then
we can go and save that and run it and
you're gonna see the minimum boolean
value is zero and the maximum boolean
value is one and so you didn't have to
watch me type all that out I went and
did that for every single data type we
have here so I'm gonna save this and run
it and you can see right here the
minimum value for short int 0 da da da
da and they're short intz there's an int
there's long you see how big little
Long's get there's floats and there is
long doubles ok so those are all of the
minimum and maximum values for most of
the major data types that you will ever
use another thing that's interesting is
you can get the number of bytes used by
a type so let's go in here and I'll show
you how to do that and don't try to
memorize this stuff that's why I provide
a cheat sheet somebody go int and size
and to get that you can just go size of
and then you can throw inside of there
and if we actually keep dots you're
gonna see that we have 4 bytes and an
integer another thing that's important
to know is that these different guy
these different data types lose
precision during calculations and that's
very important if you're trying to do
very precise calculations so I'm gonna
do here first is demonstrate how a float
could lose precision so let's go get rid
of this well let's keep this guy let's
get rid of these guys okay let's
demonstrate how floats either get or
lose precision so I'm going to change
this guy's name to big float I'm gonna
change this to 1 and then put 10 ones
after it I'm gonna copy that and I'm
gonna create another one I'm gonna call
this big float 2 and it's also gonna
have 10 decimal places after it and then
I can create another one I'm gonna call
this float some is gonna be equal to and
to add values just use addition just
like you would think the addition
operator so I'm gonna go big float plus
big float 2 and then
we're gonna do is we're gonna see how
much precision is lost now we can still
use the see print F function for
formatted printing if we'd like and we
could do something like F float some
precision and then if we want to come in
and show ten decimal places what we're
gonna do is put a percent sign and a
period and then ten that means we want
to see 10 decimal places on our screen
and this is a float so we're gonna put
an F inside of there and then a new line
and then we're going to refer to the
data that we want to be shown right here
whenever our program executes so we're
gonna go up float and some and like that
and we can execute it and you can see
right here where we lose precision with
floats so 1 2 3 4 5 6 so we have 6
places of precision with using our
floating-point numbers okay so that's a
good thing to remember now without
changing anything here too dramatically
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
instead change this into a double and
then you're gonna see so I'm gonna
double this up to 20 decimal places and
we can go and call this DB big float and
paste that in there and then DB big
float 2 and then change this to a double
and then change this to a double and
then we're going to change these this is
going to be DB big float some let's get
rid of that altogether so let's just
call it DB float some so let's get rid
of the big part and then we'll just
throw this in here and throw this right
here and then change this to a double
and then whenever we output this we
actually can still have that be an F but
in this situation let's say we want to
have 20 points of precision and throw
that there get rid of this and there we
go and change this also and I get rid of
this guy ok so you save it execute it
and there you can see as our precision
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 points of
precision using a double vs. the six
that we have will afloat ok so that's
the major difference that we have aside
from the mere size difference between
floats and doubles and I just thought
that was something in
didn't think about another thing is
there's a whole bunch of other different
things we can do with print f so we can
go print F and let's say that we wanted
to show a character we can have a
character and then we can have an
integer with a % D and then we can say
that we want to reserve 5 spaces in our
output that's going to be justified
right with a decimal so that's 5 D and
then let's say that we want to have 3
decimal places for a float that we're
planning on printing out and that we
want to print out a string so those are
all of the codes that we're going to be
able to use for using all the different
common data types that you're going to
use so then what you're gonna do is
inside a single quotes you're going to
put a character and then you can have a
decimal and I'm gonna put a 5 inside of
they remember that's gonna be right
justified if you put a negative sign
it'll be left justified whenever it
prints out 3 point 1 2 3 4 that's gonna
convert that to only 3 spaces and then
hi is going to be the string that we
want to output and have that set up and
there you can see is the right
justification you can see there's a 10
and this has been cut down to 3 decimal
places even though we had 4 and there is
our string printed out so those are just
a couple examples of different ways we
can use printf and different data type
sizes and so forth and so on and now I
want to show you how we can work with
both math operators as well as receiving
input from the user
okay so let's come in here and very
first thing I do is I want to show you
how to create a string so we're gonna be
able to go standard and string and let's
say that this is going to be a string
that we want to store that we want to
output on our screen so we can say
something like enter number 1 what we're
gonna do here is we're going to receive
data from the user and then we are going
to show different math operations on to
two different numbers I'd also like to
create some empty strings that I can
store some values in so I'm gonna go
standard again and this is string you
can go
and initialize multiple different
strings all in one line and we can go to
like this and we could also come in here
and give them a value if we'd like and
we can do that for both of them but
whatever and so what I want to do is if
I want to output information onto our
screen we're gonna go see out and I'm
gonna go s question and that is going to
give us that information I do not want a
new line in that situation if I then
want to receive user input and store it
I can go get line and this is going to
be a reference to our keyboard
that's what standards see in that's user
input and then what I want to define is
where I want to store it so I'm gonna
say s number one is where I want to
store that in a string then what I'm
gonna be able to do is I can also output
of course standard C out and I can have
them enter another number number two
like that and then I can go get line
once again and again I'm gonna say
standard input and then where I want to
store it is in the second numbers
drawing that I set aside now to actually
perform calculations on these I need to
convert from regular old strings of
characters into integers I want to use
and I use a function called sto D to do
so somebody go and define some integers
num 1 is equal to standard sto I so
string to integer and then I just pass
in the string that I want to convert and
it stores it for me and then I can grab
this guy right here and change this to 2
and change this to 2 okay so we
converted our strings into integers now
what I want to do is print out perform a
whole bunch of math calculations and
print out our results on the screen so
I'm going to say is I want to get the
integer that they passed in plus the
second integer they passed in is equal
to and then this is going to be the
result of our math calculation so to
have those go into place once again let
me go n1 +
num2 and then perform my calculation i
can either do it outside or directly
inside of our print f function
and once again any place that you have
the commas you can go and go and
separate those so it looks a little bit
neater maybe it looks neater i don't
know and there we go so there we go
so that's how we can perform addition so
very useful skill to have and then we
can also go and perform some subtraction
on these and we just need to change this
to subtraction and then we can do
multiplication i'm going to get a lot
more into all the different math
functions we have as the tutorial series
continues and if you have anything
specifically you want me to cover
definitely leave that in a comment and
then we have modulus also which is going
to give us the remainder of a division
and because we use these to represent
different values you know that we want
to put in here the percent signs if
we're using printf and we want to
actually use a percent sign just put two
of them inside of there and then it
works perfectly fine and % and we can
save it and run it up and it gave me a
little bit of an error let's go and put
that extra colon inside of there and it
says enter a number like what five
inside of here and i can put two inside
of here and you can see it performs all
of the different calculations as you
would expect them to do once again
modulus gives you the remainder of a
division so two goes into five two times
what's left over one and there you go
you can see your result alright so now
what i want you to do is we're gonna
come to our first problem of many I have
provided you everything you need to know
to be able to solve this problem what I
want you to do is to receive user input
and I want you to convert miles to
kilometers so basically all you need to
know is that a kilometer is going to be
equal to whatever miles are multiplied
times one point six oh nine three four
so that's a bit of information going to
need you're also going to need an
example of what I want your program to
look like so your program is going to
say enter miles for example the users
gonna enter five but now as an example
and then you are going to enter out
five miles equals 8.0
four six seven I only want you to show
four decimal places and then kilometres
okay so that is going to be the program
you can pause it and try it out yourself
I'm positive that you can do it and
otherwise I'm going to show you how to
do it right now okay so what we need to
do first is we need to create the
variables we're going to need so we are
going to go and create a string and this
is going to contain miles that's going
to be the data we get from our user
we're gonna have to use doubles now
instead of using integers so d miles and
D kilometers all right we're then going
to have to ask the user for input like
we have right there so I'm gonna go see
out and then I'm going to say enter
miles with a colon and then I'm going to
close that off with a semicolon of
course I'm then going to get the data
from said user so standard whoops C in
and then I'm gonna store the value they
pass in into my miles variable that I
created which is a string and we know
that because there's a little s right
there I then want to convert my string
into a double so I'm gonna go D miles so
we went and when converted our dot our
string into a double and to do so you're
gonna use a function called sto D so
there's that okay so there's D
kilometers that's what I called it up
here right yes D kilometers is equal to
I'm gonna go D miles times one point six
oh nine three four and then what I need
to do is output our results know you
could Evi the either used printf or C
out depends on whatever you feel like
using and I'm gonna say percent point
one F miles equals and then we go
percent time point four half kilometers
and then throw in a new line and then
after that we're going to go D miles and
D kilometers
right and if I typed in everything right
and run it enter the number of miles and
I said that only used five as my example
and whenever I ran it I got 5.0 miles
equals eight point zero four six seven
kilometers okay so hopefully you guys
got that if you didn't get it that's
okay especially because my little error
inside of there and I hope you guys
