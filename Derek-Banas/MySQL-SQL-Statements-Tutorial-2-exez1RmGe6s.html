2 of my SQL statements tutorial here I
will talk about the describe statement
the insert select where talk about
comments operators count function as
well as the group by statement well if
you saw the last tutorial you now know
how to create tables and what all the
different data types are so let's check
our work with the describe function if
you typed in describe all by your
database name this is what you would see
in your terminal down here below the
describe function prints out all the
information pertaining to your tables
attributes as you can see here if null
doesn't have a value that means that a
value must be set by default if null was
set the word yes would appear in this
column if the cell is a key the column
would tell you what type of key it is
and I'll cover keys in a future tutorial
the default contains any default values
that are set and extra contains any
additional information that is available
about a given column you can display all
the tables pertained in a database also
by typing show tables you can see all
the databases on the server as well by
typing show databases now I'm going to
talk about inserting data into your
database now you have a table how do you
enter information into it with the
insert command and here it is just type
in insert into the name of the table you
want to insert information into and then
list all of your values in order based
off of how you have your column set up
in your table as you can see here I'm
entering customer information this
customers name Paul Jones he lives in
Pennsylvania this is a made-up birthdate
he's a male is entering choosing can't
or no value that's why we see the null
value there then we are typing in a
timestamp or a date and he owes us $54
96 cents you don't know what this means
or what we're what we're doing here that
means you didn't see the first tutorial
so go take a check it you could also
insert data into a table with the
following command just simply type in
insert into whatever your table name is
in this case it's customers then list
the two values that you want to change
in this table being last name and first
name followed by the values keyword and
then the values you want insert it into
the
variable speaking last name in first the
final way you can load values into a
table is with the load data function you
can submit a tab-delimited list of
values as long as they are in order each
line will have the values separated by
tabs
hence tab delimited list and nothing
else in Microsoft Excel in any
spreadsheet software you can create a
tab delimited list you can also save any
of your files as tab delimited and if
you look at your specific spreadsheet
you'll know exactly how to do that after
you have that prepared just type in the
following load data local in file and
then your tab delimited list wherever
it's located followed by into table and
the name of your table which is
customers in this case the Select
function provides you with the ability
to access and sort your data in a
multitude of ways the general format of
a select function looks like this first
you have the statement select then you
would follow that with what you want to
select then you would have the statement
from which table or tables and finally
where followed by conditions you want
the data to satisfy and I'll give you
here I have select followed by a star
sign from customers which is your table
this returns all of the data in the
table customers that's what the star
represents note you can put a comment in
SQL with the number sign symbol or
surround the comment that goes over
multiple lines with the opening
characters forward slash star and the
closing characters star forward slash
here's another select statement here I'm
choosing to select all the first names
from the table customers and this will
output all the values stored in the cell
first name here I'm using the Select
command again to give me the last name
and birthdate from the table customers
you can use the where attribute to
specify that the data retrieved fulfills
your specific conditions here are
examples here in this first example I'm
going to return all the information on
anyone that owes us more than $10 and I
do that with select star which is
everybody from the table customers and
the clause is where money owed is
greater than $10 then in this other
example you can see here I'm selecting
the first
and last names and birthdates from
customers where birthdate is greater
than 1990 January failure again I'm
returning the first name for any
customer that I was US over ten dollars
and lives in the state of Pennsylvania
you can see here I used a logical
operator and I'm going to describe it
there are many operators available for
comparing data we have the addition the
subtraction the multiplication the
division the modulo which returns the
remainder of a division and here's an
example if we use the modulo operator on
a division of 5 by 2 you would get 1
because the remainder of that division
is 1 here are all the logical operators
available to you you have the + or the 2
n symbols you can use either one they
both do the same thing and this will
return a value if both conditions are
true then you have the order which
returns a true value if either condition
is true we have the knot which returns a
true value of the operand is false not
in essence just makes everything the
opposite of what it is so it was a true
condition then it would turn it in at a
false and if the condition was false it
would turn it into true there are some
paracin operators you can use with the
where statement you have equals less
than greater less than or equals greater
than or equals and you have the not
equal to and also you can see here if we
use the in statement which we're going
to explain more on later you will return
true if X is one of the values in the
list here the item is being represented
by these fake variable names y1 y2 and
so forth we'll cover the end statement
in the later tutorial then we have
comparison operators between if we put X
between y and z it will return true if
the value of x lies between y and z the
like statement returns the value true if
the value of x matches the value in y
based off of pattern matching and I'll
get more into this a later date not like
is just the opposite of like then we
have the regular expression statement
here represented by the characters are
eg exp it allows you to use regular
expression tests on data and you can see
a regular expression tutorial I have
elsewhere if you don't know how to use
regular expressions and
have the not regular expression which is
the exact opposite of the regular
expression statement and finally we have
is null which will turn true if a value
equals null and then we have is not null
which is the opposite of is say you'd
like to count the number of customers
that owe you more than ten dollars
here's an example of how you can do that
first you type in the Select statement
followed by the count function and it's
saying to count all customers from the
table customers where money owed is
greater than ten dollars you could also
see how many male versus female
customers you have with this statement
here we're just checking the column
value of sex we're counting all of those
values from the table customers
returning that information to you how
about stating the places the states in
alphabetical order and the number of
customers from each state do you do that
with the Select statement here where
we're calling for this state value
followed by the count function from the
table customers and then we're grouping
everything in alphabetic order by state
if you wanted to sort in reverse
alphabetic order you could you would
just simply type in the de SC value
after your order by and that is how you
would get a reverse alphabetical list
would you like to change names of your
columns to something nicer then you
would want to use the as statement the
following statement will change all of
your titles you just see as you can see
here between first-name you can see this
statement as and here what we're doing
is we're going to make all of our
columns names change so instead of
having that underscore character in
there we're going to have a nice
uppercase F and n in first name and our
columns and we are able to achieve that
because of the a statement well that's
all I'm able to cover in part two you
can see here in part three I'm going to
cover the like statement regular
expressions in not in and delete which I
was not able to completely cover in this
tutorial catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
