7 of my JavaScript video tutorial today
I'm going to show you how to implement
form validation now you're absolutely
going to have to see the previous two
tutorials to this to understand this
completely in the last tutorial I go
over the beginnings of understanding
regular expressions inside of JavaScript
and then in a tutorial preceding that I
go over the dome or the document object
model inside of JavaScript because we're
going to use both of those to handle
form validation so I'm just going to
assume that you've seen both of those
tutorials I'm going to jump right into
it and if you want to see what this
codes actually going to look like after
I get it done in this tutorial let's
come up here to the name section and
let's say that they didn't enter a name
it's going to pop up an error message as
you can see right there and you could
see it popped up an error message in the
street area and it's going to use
regular expressions to validate that all
of this information is entered properly
and you can see here with state code I'm
going to put KL which is not a real
state error message pops up and we put
in a valid state code it's going to
disappear and it's also going to check
and allow for you to enter really
convoluted crazy telephone numbers and
validate that they are entered correctly
even as they morph into multiple
different things and also validate email
so pretty neat first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to create all of the
different elements inside of divs that
are going to make up my form validation
text input boxes so I'll just start off
with div and then I'm just going to say
enter your name and of course I should
put all of this inside of a form but to
explain form validation all I really
have to do that here is everything else
is basically the same okay so I'm
creating identification of name for this
input box and give it a name of name and
I'm saying that it's going to be a text
box and it's going to have a default
size of 30 then what I'm going to define
is onblur or whenever the user of this
interface leaves the text box meaning
they clicked into it and then they
clicked out of it I want this function
to be called is the field empty and
using this I'm going to pass the
identification number for the whatever
is contained within this ID box and
then I'm also using get element by ID
I'm creating a child inside of here that
is going to be called name help and if
they do not fill out the information in
this text box properly I am going to
then input an error message into a span
a span is like an inline div an inline
element means that it does not force a
line break after it is triggered see
name help name help so that's what I'm
passing here I'm passing the ID for the
textbox I'm creating here and then down
here in passing the identification
number for this span that I'm creating
right inside of here and I'm not going
to put anything in the help box I could
if I wanted to but I've decided I don't
want to and then of course I need to
close the div that I created and now
basically it can just copy this so I'm
going to show you the regular
expressions behind a bunch of different
things like for example street address
and I'm just going to change this to
Street and then change that to Street
I'll leave that the same
normally the size 30 remember it's not
the maximum size just a size of the text
box on the screen and here I'm going to
call a different function called is
address okay and here I can leave these
the same except for changing the
identification ID for these different
things I'm also going to accept a city
and I'm going to give it the
identification city in the name city
everything else is going to be the same
except I'm going to put City help I'm
actually going to call the same thing as
I called for the name and no I would
never use this for pure form validation
I would always do my form validation
using PHP and the reason why as I
documented in my PHP tutorial it is
extremely easy to get in between the
browser and the server and change any of
these values using what's called an
intercepting proxy which I talked about
in length in that tutorial the PHP
tutorial so if you want to see more
about how dangerous some of this stuff
can get if you don't do validation with
PHP check out that tutorial and I'm also
going to accept a state and for statum
only going to leave space for two
characters I'm also going to show you
the regular expression that goes into
getting
number or checking that a phone number
is properly entered kind of complicated
but you understand it by the end
especially if you saw the last tutorial
and I'm just doing the same thing over
and over again I'm calling a different
function but I'm passing the
identification number for the tax box as
well as where I potentially I'm going to
print out on error message if they don't
input the information properly I'm also
going to ask them for an email and
that's it and if we reload these you can
see they popped up over here on the side
of the screen and what's going to happen
is if they enter the information
improperly in the span it's actually
next to this text box but it's going to
show up underneath here it's going to
print on an error message if they didn't
fill the information improperly but
first we have to create those functions
I'm going to do that up inside of here
in the script area now the first
function I'm going to create inside of
here is going to be the most complicated
one but you saw it two tutorials ago
whenever I went over the DOM and what is
it is going to accept is a regular
expression that is passed to it input is
going to represent the information that
was actually typed into the textbox help
ID is going to be the ID for the span if
I want to print a help message in it and
help message is actually going to be the
message that gets printed inside of it
if they make an error then what I'm
going to do is run a regular expression
using test and here I'm specifically
testing if the wrong information was
entered then what I'm going to do is
inside of this if help ID is not equal
to null what that means is that there's
no value in the span where I'm going to
print that information Wow
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
delete everything that could potentially
be in that span even if it's multiple
child elements so what this is going to
do is let's say somebody clicks in the
street address and they click out and
it's going to put an error message in
that span that's going to tell them
please under a proper street address
well without this it would continually
print that so if they clicked in there
again and then clicked out it would
print another error message right next
to it and create two children inside of
that div so what this guy is doing is
it's deleting all of those potential
children that could be created inside of
there this is exactly the same
Niq I used two tutorials ago what that's
doing is removing all of the children
elements that exist in there until there
are none left that's it
now that that span is empty I can append
or add another child element to it which
is going to be the error message that I
want to be displayed and it's going to
be whatever help message they told me
they want printed inside of there I'm
gonna say return false and I'm going to
close that off else scroll this up and
then if the information was entered
correctly I want to call and delete any
error messages that might show up inside
of it and I'm doing that in exactly the
same way saying while there is
information inside of it keep deleting
it until everything is gone because an
error no longer is occurring return true
close off that statement close off that
statement and there is the edit node
text guy basically what it's doing is
checking to see if the text that they
entered over here in these boxes is
equal to the regular expression I
defined if it is it eliminates any help
or error messages to pop up and if there
is an error in the text that they
entered it creates one and along the way
as it's creating these guys it's also
deleting any help text that's no longer
needed so I'm going to create the
function again is filled empty and this
is about the most basic type of form
validation you could use again it's just
accepting the identification for this
box right here and also here accepting
the identification for the span that
doesn't exist over here right now and
basically just going to receive that and
it's going to pass it up to edit node
text and the basic format here is I'm
going to put a carrot inside of here
and then I'm going to say that I will
allow them to enter uppercase letters or
lowercase letters and also I'm going to
allow them then or periods quote spaces
dashes and I'm going to allow them to
enter two to fifteen of those and then
I'll have a space and potentially that
space will not be needed so I'm going to
put a question mark inside of there like
I said this is like the most basic of
basic of basic things I'm just showing
it to you just to show you what basic
looks like I'm actually just going to
copy this in this first to a certain
extent is going to be
people that have multiple names you know
like mary-louise Dreyfus or whatever and
I closed that off please
enter a valid name and that's all that
function is going to do I send that
regular expression over along with the
value that they put in there the
identification number for the span and
the error message that we want printed
if the regular expression does not come
back true for the value that they
entered and then function is input field
up ID I'm going to trust it you know
what all those mean now with this
regular expression with the caret I'm
going to say that that's going to be
fine the beginning of the information
they entered then here I'm saying I will
accept uppercase or lowercase letters
numbers periods back slashing them
spaces or dashes and I'm going to accept
between 5 to 30 of those don't worry the
next regular expressions and be
complicated and then I'm going to expect
the string to end at that point in time
then I'm gonna close that off is state
this is going to be a little bit more
complicated
again value entered and the error or
help message you want displayed and here
I'm going to say that I expect the
string to begin and if it has an a is
the first letter after the beginning I
want it to then be followed by a lk s zi
are a e or P those are all the valid
potential state codes so that's what
that means if you'd ever need to do that
then I'm going to say that I also if
they enter a C is the first value I want
the C to be followed by an A and O or a
T if the in red D is the first column I
want that followed by an EEOC and I'm
going to continue but I'm not going to
type all those out and bore you to death
ok and there's the last couple with W
I'm gonna put the delimiter inside of
there the value that they entered the
help message the help ID is the ID for
the span I was about ready to type in
uppercase but what I'm going to do
instead is come back here and put an eye
there that's gonna allow them to put off
her case for lowercase and that's that
now I'm going to go through an even more
complicated regular expression I'm gonna
show you how to pick an extremely
complicated telephone number or match
for complicated telephone numbers that
Renard okay so here's a complicated
regular expression I'm gonna say what
they were going to enter beginning with
the beginning of what they send and I'm
putting this little brace inside of here
this parenthesis so that I can later on
designate that it's not important that
they enter it just stick with me you
understand okay what I'm saying here is
that they can enter a number between
zero to nine which could then be
followed either by a space or a dash but
they don't have to say this is negating
this question mark is going to gating
this it's also saying there can be one
of these or they can be none of these
right so that's what's going on there
then what I'm going to do and this
remember I said you understand a minute
this and this are saying here that we're
going to negate the fact that they even
enter a telephone number
what this is is right here if they would
enter something like 1 - 4 1 - we're
saying that's valid but I'm also later
on gonna say it's valid for them to say
to type that in but I'm also this
regular expression is going to allow
them just type that in okay so just
stick with me here then I'm going to say
that I want a parenthesis to potentially
be entered so that's why I'm back
slashing that out but they don't have to
enter that and then I expect 0 to 9 and
numbers 3 in length and that's all I'm
accepting and then closing parentheses
but again we don't need that so I'm
going to put the question mark in there
or I'm going to say that I expect the
number 0 - 9 3 in length parentheses and
then it's followed by a space or a dash
but they don't have to enter them again
and then followed by number 0 through 9
Green Lang followed by a space or - but
again they don't have to enter that and
then a number 0 through 9 and then just
to jump to the end of it here this 0 - 9
is going to be 4 digits in length or I'm
gonna allow them to enter up to 7
letters or digits so that's basically
going to allow them to enter just a
basic number so if they just typed in
their number 4 3 5 6 7 8 9 I'm going to
say that that's legitimate and I'm going
to allow them that or that so that's
what that means
and then I'm going to put in the same
information we did before and we're
actually almost done here I'm going to
validate the email say
strings going to begin with a through Z
upper case or lower a dot an underscore
or a dash followed by at symbol followed
by a through Z upper or lower zero
through nine dot dash followed by
backslash the dot because it stands for
any character that is not a newline in
the regular expression definitions to
four in length if you understand that
you understand it a lot about regular
expressions there we go we created the
whole entire thing inside of here and if
I file save that you can see here if I
click inside one of these boxes and then
click out see please enter a valid name
shows up if I click in the street area
enter a street pops up city and you can
see all the error messages popping up on
the screen as I do not properly fill out
the information and if I reload that you
can also see here and if I enter let's
say a single name it's expecting me to
add at least two names so I shall and
now the error message doesn't show up
one two three main and it doesn't show
up however if I would come in here and
just put one two three you can see that
that error message pops up now let's
come down to the state code area and
let's say HK which there is no such
state code you can see that error
message pops up however I can put in
something really crazy for the telephone
number and you can see an error message
did not pop up and even though I just
chopped that out it didn't pop up again
and so forth and so on so there is a
really complicated form validation tool
all the codes available on my website of
course it's all free there's a link in
the underbar any questions or comments
