1 of my UML 2 video tutorial today I'm
going to talk about the basics of you
amount or the unified modeling language
as well as show you what a use case
diagram looks like
now you emmaus just a graphical way of
describing software systems that's all
it is and there's going to be basically
two types of UML sketching and
blueprints whenever you decide you want
to go through a UML sketch your major
goal here is just to communicate an idea
sometimes to laymen that do not know
anything about programming and you
basically just want to use it to rough
out ideas and go through different
alternative approaches that might make
sense in this situation your aim is not
to be specific but just to get your
basic ideas out in front of you so that
you know what you really have to
accomplish in the creation of this
system then you have the UML blueprint
these on the other hand are going to be
very detailed and they're going to
contain all kinds of design decisions
that a programmer very well might be
able to directly translate into code
then we're going to get down into this
which is gone as the model-driven
architecture and this is either going to
be platform independent or platform
specific and I'm guessing you probably
understand what that means but either
way platform independent of course would
be a UML model that is independent of
any specific technology or any specific
language however on the other hand
platform specific of course would be
model specific to an execution
environment or a chosen programming
language then we get into the
development process you're basically
going to have two different ways of
developing a UML diagram and your system
in general you're going to have the
waterfall way to break up a project and
in this situation you're going to
complete the following in order analysis
after analysis is complete then on to
the design and then on to coding and
then finally after those three are
complete you're then going to move into
the testing process so everything is
completely done in order before you
proceed to the next one the iterative
way to break up a project however solves
all of the different pieces of your
project in pieces so you're going to
define the different pieces of your
functionality of your system right from
the beginning and then you're going to
go through the process of analysis
design coding and then testing on each
of these individual pieces before you
move on in most situations the iterative
way is going to be
preferred over the waterfall way and
that is just simply because most of the
time when you're building a system or
program of any kind you're going to have
all sorts of changes just come up that
we're not predicted in the beginning of
the system so just plan on using the
iterative way because the waterfall
while it is preferred in many situations
more than likely you will not use it
then we get into the planning process
here we're either going to be predictive
or adaptive and a predictive plans just
going to be a plan for the whole entire
project that is going to be created at
the very beginning of your project and
every single person is going to be
involved and on the same page and it's
just going to be peachy keen and very
easy to work with as you're probably
guessing this is not often used then we
come to the adaptive planning process
which is what you're going to use most
of the time in the adaptive planning
process you're going to treat change to
your requirement lists as just being
inevitable and as an adapter you plan on
working with users continually
throughout the process to continue to
add additional functionality and if you
plan on using the adaptive planning
process to a certain extent this is
known as agile development and it
basically comes down to this if you can
very very easily in a guaranteed manner
list out your requirements and you're
almost 100% sure they are not going to
change use the predictive planning model
but as you're probably guessing the
adaptive planning model is what you're
going to have to use whether you want to
use it or not and now we're going to get
into the meat of this whole tutorial
which is going to be use case diagrams a
use case is just going to define how
your program will solve a problem or
provide some level of functionality and
use cases define what is required of
your program and how those requirements
will be met of course you're not going
to try to write code as you're going to
see here in a split second with a use
case diagram you're just going to look
at everything from a global perspective
and pretty much narrow down on what
exactly you absolutely have to have and
that comes to requirements you're going
to have two types of requirements you're
going to have shall requirements which
are going to be requirements that are
required for a project to be considered
completed then you're going to have
should requirements those are going to
be requirements that are going to be
considered useful however they are not
critical so what you need to do whenever
you're working through a project is get
the shell requirements out of the way
and guarantee they are done and then
worry about the should requirements if
you have any more time left now whenever
you're creating your use case diagrams
all of the steps that you're going to be
listing are normally going to include
interactions with actors and these are
either going to be human or external
systems as you're going to see here in a
second and here is a very basic use case
diagram now you're going to come up with
there's all sorts of jargon terms that
you're going to hear about a whole bunch
of times if you ever hear about a
stereotype what this does is it just
describes the role of an element and
they can be either people or systems or
what have you and we actually have
couple stereotypes here one right here
is a little person and this stereotype
is going to be representing the bank
customer in this situation also this
guys here is known as an actor as is
Bank security which you can see on the
right side of the screen now whenever
you're defining actors you can either
draw them as little people like we have
here on the screen or you can put their
name right here inside of what is called
a Guillemette and you would do this of
course if you'd like to save yourself
some space which who couldn't use more
space over here this is known as a note
and this is a symbol for a note and
inside of the notes you're going to
provide certain comments a lot more
information than bank customer but maybe
not and they also these notes can be
known as tagged values so let's say that
we wanted to put Bank customer inside of
here but we also wanted to connote that
we would like the bank customer name or
account number or whatever to be
assigned inside of here to better
represent this little character that's
right here we could of course just put
Bank customer inside of here inside of a
gilliam on and then list out all those
different tagged values that we would
like to associate with this element and
this is an ironclad stuff here you can
kind of bend it make it look the way
that you want it to look but this in
general is what a use case diagram looks
like and this is a use case anytime you
create a use case which must accomplish
some sort of task inside of your system
you're going to surround it just like I
have right here with an ellipse this guy
right here is known as a communication
line and all
does is connects your actors to your use
cases right like that this great big
giant huge box right here is what is
known as a system boundary line and all
it does is it surrounds your system and
separates your system from actors which
are on the outside of the system
boundary line right here you can see the
word include and what include means is
you use this whenever you want two or
more elements to use a use case like
right here whenever they insert their
card we're going to verify the card and
also whenever they enter their pin we're
going to verify their card so this is a
use case that is going to be shared
completely by these other two use cases
right here and hence we're going to say
these include verification of the card
extend on the other hand is used
whenever a use case is optional so here
let's say that we try to verify the card
and we decide it is not a good card we
can here decide to extend and mark this
as a stolen card and either eat it
destroy it or whatever however we are
not required to do that so that's what
extend is its extended functionality
however it is not needed hence that's
the reason why it says extend instead of
include and then finally down here I'm
showing you a general use case and you
use little diagrams and arrows just as I
have to right here so let's say they
want to come in here the bank customer
and select an amount let's say an option
or a more specific use case would be
that they would select amounts in the
values of tens or twenty dollar
increments this would be considered a
general use case while these would be
considered more specific use cases so
that is basically all that you need to
know to understand use case diagrams
except for the fact that most of the
time whenever you create a use case
diagram you're going to first create a
use case description so let's take a
look at one of those now whenever you
create a use case description of course
one of the parts of that is going to be
the description and I'm not going to
read all this but basically it just goes
through and goes over all the different
things that your system is going to do
like the user enters their card and pin
security verifies the
the user selects the account to use and
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah whenever you
are creating a use case description part
of that that would make a lot of sense
to include would be a description of the
overall system then you're going to list
a trigger and this is just what is going
to happen before your system is
triggered hence the Machine receives a
card or the user enters a pin you
actually technically don't even need
that part because the system
automatically starts as soon as a card
goes into it and that is what is called
the trigger then you have what are
called actors these are the people
outside of your system boundary lines
and you as you saw previously those
actors in this system or both the
customer as well as bank security then
you're going to list preconditions these
are going to be conditions that
absolutely must be true for your system
to be able to start operating so of
course they're going to need a secure
connection to the bank and that bank or
ATM machine needs to have cash so those
are two conditions that must be true
otherwise your system really shouldn't
even start then we get into goals or
successful conclusions sometimes people
actually break these into two separate
parts but in this situation I'm just
going to list them as one under goals we
want to first make sure that our client
accounts are secure and secondly provide
the customer with funds if we have them
on hand so those are our two goals so
I'm just breaking everything down into
pieces then you're going to list all of
your failed conclusions these would be
situations in which your system has
failed or has ended processing before it
would go through the entire use case if
they enter an invalid card of course
that's going to end it if they enter an
invalid PIN of course that's also going
to end it early if the customer has
insufficient funds or the ATM has
insufficient funds or the rover their
daily limit this would be another
situation in which we would not be able
to process through our entire use case
then we have extensions and often
extensions come from the different parts
of your use case diagram that use the
extend word these would be situations
like a pin is entered three times
incorrectly and you eat the card or the
card is marked as stolen and you eat the
card so you know use these things as you
would like and then finally you're going
to have your steps of execution again
these are often listed both as steps of
execution and honest
separate lists as requirements but in
this situation I'm just going to show
steps of execution because this is a
pretty simple process so we have
customer inserts card and then I'm going
to mark off all of these additional
things that could happen card is invalid
eject a card whatever and I'm basically
going to try to list out all of the
possible things that could happen
throughout my system card is validated
customer enters pin
however pin is invalid or PIN is invalid
three times or card is marked as stolen
these are different things that could
occur and mess up during stepping
through the execution of my system
however if the pin is valid and the
account is selected and the amount is
selected and they are not over their
daily maximum or over the account funds
that are available to them or over the
mission funds available to the machine
we are then going to proceed through all
of these additional steps so that is a
basic use case diagram as well as a
basic use case description as this
tutorial continues we're going to get
more and more complicated so of course
feel free to leave any questions or
things that you want me to cover in the
future one day end this tutorial by
saying that right now the next tutorial
that's going to follow my UML 2 and my
refactoring tutorial is either going to
be an androids games / C programming
language tutorial or a Java Enterprise
Edition with development frameworks and
