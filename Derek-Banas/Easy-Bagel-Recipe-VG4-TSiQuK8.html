show you how ridiculously easy it is to
make bagels at home whenever you'd like
them so I have a lot to do so let's
start cooking so this is all you're
going to need if you want to make plain
bagels at home 1/4 cup of water 1
teaspoon yeast 1 tablespoon of sugar and
then 3 tablespoons of sugar later
whenever we boil the bagels 3 and a half
cups of white flour and 2 teaspoons of
salt that is it you're going to get
yourself one teaspoon of quick we're
eyes yeast and you're going to throw
that in a container that can hold it
leaf of 1 and 1/4 cups of water then you
get yourself 1 tablespoon of sugar and
dump that in as well and then put in 1
and 1/4 cups of water and stir that up
and let it sit for about 10 minutes and
now inside of a food processor to save
ourselves a new enormous amount of time
we're going to be adding some white
flours precisely we're going to add 3
and 1/2 cups of white flour and then
we're going to be getting ourselves some
regular old granulated salt we're going
to be adding 1 teaspoon of salt to this
mixture and as you can see our yeast
mixture is real nice and frothy that's
exactly the way we're going to want it
we're going to want to turn our blender
on high and then we're going to slowly
add in our yeast water mixture and in
the summer months we normally add 1 and
1/4 cups of the water and in the winter
months we tend to add one and a half
cups of water so we'll just adjust just
depending upon what's going on of course
you might have to wipe down the inside
of the blender everyone's to want to
make sure it's consistent and it's
winter when I'm making this woman add in
another 1/4 cup of just regular old warm
water don't add yeast to it or anything
and then as we're blending you're going
to see that it eventually starts to form
a ball that's when you know it's pretty
much done now to this formed a ball I'm
going to take some flour and put it on a
clean surface and I'm going to scoop out
all of the dough onto this and there's
going to be a very minimal amount of
kneading you can see exactly what I'm
doing here i'm going to put some flour
on my hands so it doesn't stick and i'm
going to roll it a bit and this is the
basic kneading process if you don't have
a food processor you have to do this
whole entire thing by hand and whenever
you can touch it and it doesn't stick it
is right
then I'm going to get myself a big giant
pot and I'm going to throw it inside of
there and cover it with a warm damp
cloth and let it sit for an hour and
after one hour I'm going to dump it out
of my pot I didn't have any will in
there by the way if you were wondering
and then I'm going to cut it up into
eight pieces you could divide it up into
six you can win big bagels or sixteen if
you want little bagels but I use eight
and that seems to work good for me and
the kids and I'm going to take the tip
tuck it underneath and put a hole in the
middle of it and then put it on a pan
that has parchment paper on it and let
it sit for about fifteen minutes covered
with a damp cloth and now while those
bagels are left to rise I'm going to
bring a pot of water to a boil then I'm
going to add three tablespoons of sugar
and I'm going to stir it until all that
sugar dissolves then I'm going to take
my bagels and I'm going to I normally
cook two at a time I'm going to throw
those in there and I'm going to let them
poach for thirty seconds per side and
then I'm going to flip them and then I'm
going to take them out and put them on
parchment paper again and then after all
of them on the parchment paper I'm going
to go and mix a 50/50 mix of either egg
whites and water or egg substitute water
or egg beaters and water and I'm going
to put that on top of them I'm going to
cook these bagels at 350 degrees for 25
to 30 minutes until golden brown and
that's it you got homemade bagels so
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
