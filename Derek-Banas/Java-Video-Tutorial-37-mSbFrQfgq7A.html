37 of my Java video tutorial series
today I'm actually going to show you how
to do something pretty useful what we're
going to pull all kinds of information
from a database and display it inside of
a table then I'm going to show you how
to come in here and for example add in
one of the presidents that's missing
from this HIV if you can't see this
beautiful screen it's an HD video you'll
be able to see it wonderfully like that
then just click add president and then
just like that you can now see that
brocco bomb is right here I'm also going
to show you how to come in here and
remove different presidents from the
table as well and all of the code
including how to load all of this
database information and all the code of
course is available underneath of this
video so let's get into the code well I
have a whole bunch of libraries that
I've loaded in here
so since we're going to be working with
swing interface we have the boarder
layout here I'm going to be changing
fonts I'm going to be doing different
things with events we're gonna of course
be querying a database I'm going to have
simple date format what this allows me
to do is convert from strings to dates
and then down here I have a whole bunch
of different components that are gonna
lie inside of my frame now of course any
time you're gonna be working with frames
you need to extend jframe just like i
covered previously and what we're gonna
do is just start off real simple here
I'm gonna go to static J I need to
create some labels first name last name
and then we're going to have the state
then we're going to have the birth date
those are going to be all of my
different labels and I'm going to use
inside of my GUI interface then then I'm
gonna have text fields that are going to
allow us to add additional presidents
and of course you could do this for any
number of different other types of
applications you might want to build and
I'm just putting TF in here for text
field and of course all of these things
should be done in separate methods but
so that it's easier for you to follow
along I'm going to do everything inside
of the main method inside of Java
eventually we're going to get into
design patterns and you'll be able to
use those as well then I'm going to go
Java you to I'm going to be working with
a date yes of course you can type this
out longhand one of the reasons why I'm
doing is because I was asked if you
could do it this way
SQL birth and don't worry necessarily
with all these mean you'll get to it
here eventually then since we're going
to be using a J table which is going to
pull information from a database we're
going to create a object
multi-dimensional ray and it's going to
contain all of the information for each
row of the database I'm going to call
that database results if this capital R
so it's easier to read and then I need
to define all of the column names for
this table as well I'm just going to
call that columns and how you add these
defaults is right here with curly
brackets and we go first name last name
state and birth date and then close it
off with curly brackets and a semicolon
so those are going to represent the
column names inside of my table and then
what I need to do is I need to define
static default table model and this is
the tool that I'm going to be using to
load information into my J table and if
you don't remember this is the J table
here that contains all this database
information and then of course this is a
jlabel down here this is jtextfield
and all that and then these are j
buttons so let's close that again so
we're going to be using this default
table model to define the methods that
the j table will use and we're also
going to be overriding one of these guys
called get column class just like I did
actually in the previous tutorial sort
of bringing a whole bunch of different
tutorials together here and doing
something useful and then what you need
to do is pass database results which is
all the information for each row in the
database as you see right here and then
also we need to pass columns which is
the name for all of the columns in our
database but since we're going to be
overriding the method that I talked
about previously I'm not going to put a
semicolon there instead I'm gonna put
public class and the guy that I want to
overwrite is called get column class and
I'm doing this so that I'm going to be
able to properly sort the dates because
without this Java considers everything
to be a strength and we're going to go
class return value and all this does is
whenever you pass in a column it tells
you what is the class of all the
different things in that column that's
all not that complicated one thing we
want to do here is we want to verify
that the column actually exists so if
they pass in a negative column well
that's not real so we need to protect
against that and we also are going to go
and check that the column is
larger than the total number or the
biggest column that's available for us
to use that's all it's doing and if
everything is okay we're you're just
going to go get value at we're going to
go call them we're going to call the
method get class which is going to get
the class for said all them that they
passed over and this is the column that
I am talking about else if they are
calling for a column that doesn't exist
we're just going to go return value is
equal to object class and then outside
of this we're going to return return
value that's all that method does is it
goes in there and make sure that the
proper class is passed and that like I
said before is so that I can properly
sort this information and put a
semicolon there after that guy and now
it's time to create my J table I'm going
to go static J table I'm going to call
it table is equal to nu J table and like
I said the fault table model is going to
be used to find what methods can be used
so I'm going to pass that to it then any
changes that I make to this default
table model is automatically going to
affect the J table and now I'm going to
start playing around inside of main
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to create my J frame which is going to
be the window that pops up on the screen
whenever the application is executed all
Actos and then I'm going to go frame dot
set default close operation if you have
any questions leave them below I'll do
my best dance or anything that you guys
send to me and then all this is going to
do is close the window if the user of
the application it's close just handles
that for us then we need to create a
connection to our database to pull in
all that information that you saw and
I'm going to set it from null always
like to give everything a default value
now because whenever you try to access
the database numerous different problems
can occur I'm going to put everything
inside of a try block which is going to
catch any of those errors or exceptions
then I need to go class for name I need
to get a driver that is going to allow
me to talk to my MySQL database and
that's pretty much what this guy does it
translates everything for me so I send
questions to it automatically figures
out what should be done and with the
connection we have here I need to call
driver manager and Driver managers used
to handle a set of JDBC drivers like
this driver the
right here and then we're going to go
get connection and get connection just
establishes a connection to the database
and whenever you're doing this of course
you need to define the location for the
database and since this is on localhost
for me and probably for you know my
school board / localhost localhost is
the part that you'd be changing if you
would be trying to get a hold of a
different database and then your honor
that's that and then you need to pass
along your user ID and your password and
that would allow you to connect to the
database and then we're going to query
the database and we do that by creating
a statement object and I'm going to call
it SQL State and then we're going to
call create statement and all this is
going to do is return a statement object
then we're going to go string select
stuff and we're going to give it exactly
the query that we want to send to the
database so in the database there's a
area called first-name lastname state
and birth and I'm saying that I want to
get all of that from the table that is
called president it's all it's saying
it's saying give me the first name the
last name the state and birth from the
table called president that's all we're
doing there real simple and our string
now we're going to go result set rows is
equal to SQL state see there's SQL state
same guys right here which is going to
be this statement and the results that's
going to contain all of the table data
that comes back whenever we query the
database so that's just going to contain
all of our answers from our database and
then we created this statement object so
that we could use it to execute this
method which says passed me a query and
I will send you back the results of said
query then we're going to go object I'm
going to create temporary object array
we call it temper oh and then what we
need to do is just cycle through all of
the results that came from this guy and
all of the results are stored in rows
just like you see up here the results
that so what is this it's just all the
query information it came back and then
we want to cycle through all of the
results of said query so basically what
this says is while there continues to be
results I need to go temp row is equal
to new object we're going to throw
everything into my temp object array and
I'm going to go rows and since the very
first thing I'm going to
pulling from these results is a string
which is the first name and that's where
the one comes in I'm going to put get
string and then the next three things
that I'm going to be pulling are also
going to be strings so save yourself
some time just to have to change this to
two and change this to three and then
the last thing I want to be pulling in
is a date so I need to change this to
get date and then I need to change this
to four which is going to be the fourth
result of my query close that off I got
all that set up and you can also instead
of get string and get date you can also
do get int get float get double and get
boolean get long get short so those are
all the different methods that are
available now that we have all of this
information we need to call our D table
model which is directly tied in the J
table we need to say hey we want to add
temp row which is an object array all of
those results to our table and that's
exactly what that does now since
everything's in a try block we're going
to have to catch any exceptions that
might get thrown so one of those
exceptions is laughs not found exception
I'm just going to throw you inside of
there and it's actually one that should
come in here before this will go catch
SQL exception e and these can throw all
kinds of different errors I'm just going
to go you print stack trace just to keep
everything simple so that's just going
to print out just your generic error
message and throw that right there now
inside of my table if I want to also
increase my font size I went over this
before but what the heck let's do it
again just need to go table which is the
name of your J table set font and then
inside of here I'm going to go new font
and I'm just going to go to serif font
plain and I'm a sent the text size to 26
there you are for the whole J table
that's going to change all the fonts now
I'm going to go table dot set if you're
increasing the font size you best
increase the height of all of your cells
we're going to go to table get row
height so we're going to get the turn
size for the ero I'm going to add 16 to
it and there you are that's going to
increase the row height so that we can
accommodate the fact that our fonts are
bigger now if we want users to be able
to come in here and sort through the
data we just go table set Auto create
row sorter and that's going to allow
them
if set the true automatically sort
through
thank however remember we had to
whenever we created our default table
model this guy right here
get column class this is going to make
sure that everything is sorted properly
like I said before everything by default
kind of gets sorted as if it's a string
and if it's a number or a date that just
does not work so we're going to continue
to go through this what's something else
we need well we need to add an option
for scrolling our table so we're going
to go J scroll pane I'm going to call
this scroll pane is equal to new Jews
grow pane and then I want to put the
table inside of this scrollable
component so now just with that one line
of code I'm able to go in here and throw
the whole entire table into a scrollable
area and then I'm going to go frame add
scroll pane remember the frame is the
window and I'm going to say that I'm
using border layout and I want my table
to go into this center of the screen
that's how simple that is then I need to
create my button that's going to allow
me to add additional presidents to the
table so just go J button add Prez is
the name I'm going to give it new J
button and I'm going to put the text
inside of it and press ident then well
of course we need to handle if somebody
presses the button wanted to do
something just go add pres and we want
to go add action listener we go new
action listener like this and then we're
going to jump directly into it and
define exactly what's going to happen
well we're going to go public void
actionperformed this is going to be the
method that's going to be called if an
action has occurred meaning if the
buttons been pressed we just need to
catch action of n e really isn't going
to matter then what we're going to do
inside of it is we're going to define a
bunch of strings in first name and I'm
gonna give it a fault value of nothing s
last name give it a default value of
nothing s state and then s date which is
going to hold the birthday and here you
go now I'm going to go and get all of
the text that is in the text field and
assign it to one of these strings that
is listed out here so we're just going
to go s first name is going to be equal
to if you want to get the text that's in
a text field in our GUI you just type in
whatever the text fields name is and get
text and
you go now you're able to get all that
I'm going to copy this save us all some
time paste paste phase and we're going
to change this the last name and this is
last and then this is going to be state
and this is going to be date weather I
think I call this birth date yes there
you are that's how we're going to pull
all the information out of the text
field and what we need to do is we need
to convert this string here that is a
date into an SQL date that could be put
into the database to do that we're going
to go simple date format we're going to
call this guy date formatter
I know that I'm covering a ton of things
but this is much what happens whenever
you start to learn Java you're able to
throw things together if you understand
how all these different things work
basically what I'm going to say is the
date that they are going to send you
date formatter should be of the form
year and then this is going to be two
numbers in a represent month and then
day that's what it's on the date
formatter this is what you can expect
well
whole bunch errors can occur so we're
going to say that we want to use a try
block again let's scroll that on all
right so we're going to go date birth
date is equal to when we go date
formatter and we're going to parse the
string date that was inside of our text
field and we're going to go SQL birth
date is equal to new with Java SQL dot
date here we're gonna go to a birth date
or call the method get time which is
going to convert like I said before this
string version of the date into SQL
birth date which is the SQL version of
said date so that is what was going on
there anytime you have a try block you
need to catch any potential problems and
we're going to go catch since we're
going to be parsing something that means
it's going to potentially throw a parse
error and then in this situation again
we're just going to I'm going to scroll
up your copy eprint stacktrace just to
keep this simple and then we're going to
type e x right there now that we have
our date in the proper format we need to
add it to our database or to our table
so what are we going to do again we're
going to create an object array this is
pretty much what you're always going to
do and I'm going to call it president
basically I just have to load everything
inside of here now
first name s last name these are all
strings so that doesn't matter and then
we're going to go SQL birthdate and make
sure that's SQL and anytime you want to
load information into this table you
just have to put it in an object array
that works best then after you have your
row of information you need to call D
table model and add row and you're going
to add your present object right to it
and down here you're going to see a
little error inside of Eclipse the
reason why is there needs to be a
semicolon there then after that we need
to create some other additional
components mainly we need to create a J
button and it is going to be remove
president is equal to nu J button and
it's going to have the name remove
president then we're going to go remove
press we're going to go add action
listener then this is going to handle if
somebody clicks on the button going to
know what to do and that curly brace
let's just scroll up here save himself
some time public void this is the exact
same thing when you're used below so
right here just go public void
actionperformed and basically what we're
going to do here is we're going to say D
table model remove row we're going to
call the remove row method for this
putting the table we're going to get
selected row and that is going to say
whatever row is currently selected I
want you to remove it and it's just that
simple
come down here put a semicolon in which
is going to close off that guy now we're
in the homestretch we basically just
need to come in here and define all of
our labels so equal to new J label these
are going to be all of our labels for
our swing GUI interface just going to
change this the last name state birthday
to 8th birthday now we're going to
create our text fields and we're going
to also define for our text fields the
size that they should be and I'm going
to put 15 inside of there for that one
too so there's before those two go with
each one of the labels last it's going
to be state and this one here is going
to be birthdate keep this at 15 keep
this at 15 which changes the two since
it is a state and then we should also
tell them what sort of format they
should put the date in so that it's
correct of course I should be setting
this up so that I collect different
errors and so forth but as you can see
these tutorials can go really really
long I just have to make a decision on
what
want to cover I'm going to create a J
panel because I want to put all of these
different components inside of a panel
and then add it to the frame if I don't
do that
whatever the last item is that I try to
put inside of that bordered layout is
going to replace all of the other ones
so you have to put everything inside of
its own separate panel like that rid of
that problem then we just have to put
all of our new components we just
created inside of input panel basically
going to be doing the same thing over
and over again so it cell first name
there's going to be eight of them
because you just created eight of them
so there's going to be L this is to be
last name and this is going to be state
and these all come from up here
so actually what these two show up right
you should put TF inside of there you
want to put the label and then the text
field first name then you're going to go
last name for our label and then this is
going to be TF t f last name and then
we're going to label called L State this
is going to be called TF State and then
for this last one we're going to go L
birthdate and then here we're going to
go TF birthdate pretty simple and now
we're also going to go input panel add
we're going to add our add president
button to this input panel as well and
we're also going to have our remove
president button and add that as well
and we're just going to call that remove
because that's what's called and then
after we add all those different
components we need to go frame by ad and
we're going to add our input panel all
of those things all put together border
layout we're going to put that in the
southern position and then two more
lines here we're going to go frame we're
going to set size for the window that's
going to pop up on the screen to 1200
pixels wide by 500 pixels tall and of
course we need to tell the frame or the
window to be visible true there you are
that's how to do something pretty cool
inside of Java leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
