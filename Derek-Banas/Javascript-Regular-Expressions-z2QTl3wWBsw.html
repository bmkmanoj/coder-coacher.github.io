take you through what is considered by
many people to be one of the most
complicated things to figure out in
regards to JavaScript and that is called
regular expressions
what are regular expressions and why
would you use them well if you saw the
eventhandler tutorial I had just posted
previously you could see that one of the
ways we use regular expressions is to
validate form data and I'm going to take
you through that today how you use a
regular expression is to use a series of
characters that state what you expect
the data that is being analyzed to look
like here are some examples if you
expected somebody to list a number of
any time you would state that in the
regular expression by using the forward
slash followed by the letter date if you
expected anyone to enter any type of
whitespace character you would state
that in the regular expression by using
the forward slash followed by the letter
s regular expressions are used to verify
that a visitor to your site entered a
correct phone number or address or name
for any battle you would use a regular
expression to state in this example that
the phone number is correct first off
you would want the data enter to contain
at least seven digits and here's an
example it may have different symbols
interspersed with these numbers and you
would want all-out for that and also it
may be preceded by additional numbers
here is your first regular expression
that will go through what exactly does
have this strange set of characters me
well the forward slashes surround the
regular expression the caret symbol
signifies that the letters that preceded
will start the value you are looking for
then this bit of code signifies that you
expect the user to type between one and
six digits and finally the dollar sign
means that the value should end at this
point now I'm going to take you through
a function that will analyze any regular
expression that is thrown to it the
function is named edit node text and
what it accepts as variables is the
regular expression I'm going to test for
the identification number associated
with the textbox node and if you don't
know what that
means check out my previous tutorial the
identification number for the text I
will be changing and the text I will be
adding to the helper text node here in
the highlighted text in black I'm asking
function test to check if the text
located in the node with the
identification name input is Val here if
the text is not valid I check if helper
text is empty meaning that the text in
the helper text node is empty if it is
empty I place the helper message in that
node with the append child function if
the right information was entered
however I clear the helper text message
here is the div definition I've created
back in my HTML code when a visitor
clicks out of the text field that is the
filled empty function is called this is
the HTML page from my previous tutorial
where I talk about event handlers as you
can see here when a person leaves this
text field all of these functions are
triggered so for example one of the
requirements of this webpage is that
some value be entered
so in leaving without entering any value
you can see here helper text pops up so
this is an example of how these
functions are being triggered each of
these areas of the web page are
associated with different div files if
that doesn't make any sense
check out the HTML tutorial and whenever
people do not enter the proper
information into these text boxes that
is whenever these functions that I'm
talking about right now we're triggered
as you can see here whenever an on blur
event handler is triggered that is the
filled empty function is fired and what
is it passed it's passed the value of
the text area and it's also passed an
identification name for the helper text
which I'm going to be changing this
function will be called to test if a
text field note is empty and it accepts
the value in the text box and the helper
text identification number which was
just passed to it here you see your
second regular expression being forward
slash dot operator plus sign and
it is requiring that the value contained
in a text field be first off with a dot
operator any character number or
assemble and with the plus operator that
there is one or more occurrences of the
value that precedes it meaning that
there is something entered into this
text field being a number and character
for a symbol and there can be one of
these different types of values or there
can be many so that's what that regular
expression expression here is a function
that will test if a valid address is
entered here we can see that the first
value entered is expected to be between
one and six digits in length with the
backslash followed by the letter S we
expect there to be whitespace of any
kind then there will be a word that is
between three and 16 characters in
length and we expect an additional
whitespace character then we expect
another word between two and eight
characters long so we would expect
Street Avenue a word like that to be
entered and then with the backslash
letter W star and then the dollar sign
then we expect that there may be
additional words that could be of any
number of additional characters here we
are checking to see if the state code
that they entered is okay it is asking
if the value entered starts with an ACD
FGH etc and it is doing that through the
use of the or symbol if it does start
with one of those letters then it is
asking if the letter that precedes it is
one of the characters that is contained
within brackets if it is then it's
considered a valid state code here we're
checking to see is the phone numbers
okay question marks says to match a 0 or
1 occurrences of the item that precedes
it and that item is expected to be
either a digit between 0 and 9 then an X
code means you can consider the number
valid if it starts with any number of
numbers between 0 and 9 that are
followed by the dash symbol but this is
not a requirement
this covers if someone enters an
international code in there
phone number which isn't very common
then the last series of characters means
the person can then enter three digits
using the numbers zero through nine but
they don't need to this would be for
example an area code the next series of
characters state that if they didn't
enter those characters and is okay to
enter a three-digit number between zero
and nine and follow that with a dash or
not this would be the prefix of the
number for example if this is the number
eight two eight three two oh eight two
eight would be the prefix next series of
code means you expect them to enter a
four digit number using the digits 0
through 9 and finally to end the regular
expression if none of the other checks
passed your tests you will simply accept
7 of any number or character uppercase
or lowercase here we're checking to see
if the email that was entered is okay
first series of code means the email
will start out with any number of
numbers or letters uppercase or
lowercase next series of code states
that it is valent use the symbols that
precede their or adaption the email
address or it is perfectly valid to not
use any of those symbols of course if we
are checking to see if an email address
is valid we are definitely going to
require that the Act symbol be located
in it somewhere
and then this series of code states that
the @ sign will be followed by one or
more numbers or characters uppercase or
lowercase then it is valid to use the
symbols that we have here being a period
and so forth number or character upper
case or lower and of course it is not a
requirement to use any of those symbols
and finally we end the regular
expression by stating that the email
address is expected to end with a period
followed by two or more of any character
uppercase or lowercase in this case it
would be org.net column etc and that is
pretty much everything you need to know
about regular expressions if you didn't
quite get it just watch the video again
it'll all sink in and you might want to
pause the screen and read over all the
information that I contain in the
presentation of course if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below thank you and I'll
see you next time
