tutorial on late lists and how they are
used with Java we're going to cover how
to make them how to change them how to
search through them and a whole bunch of
other things and I'm going to present
this in numerous different ways so by
the end of the tutorial you will
completely understand linked lists so
let's get into it so what is a linked
list well first what you have to
understand is a link is just simply an
object and each a link that you create
has a reference to another link in the
list and the linked list is just another
class and it has only one reference to
one of the links in the linked list and
that is the last link that was added so
let's look at this in pictures to make
more sense of that basically this is all
that's to it what you see here on the
screen you have one guy right here and
his name is linked list and he is just a
simple object and in regards to all of
the links in the linked list he only has
the address for the newest guy in town
or the last link that was added to the
list that guy is going to be named first
link and he is going to be saved inside
of a field inside of linked list first
link is just a link and he has the
address for the guy that moved in before
him that is it he doesn't know about any
of the other links and the guy that
moved in before him is going to be named
next and then next is going to have
another reference to the guy that moved
in before him to the list and so forth
and so on so if the length list class
wants to get ahold of next over here
he needs to contact first link and say
hey what was the guy's name or the
address of the guy that moved into town
before you and he will be able to
provide it to the linked list and that
is how they are structured so let's
start building some links and then some
linked lists and make this all clear
okay so what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to create a linked list group of
books popular books so I'm going to have
book name and I'm setting this for
public so I don't have to worry
about getters and setters and all that
stuff then I'm going to have millions
sold so each link that we create is
going to have a book name and the
millions of those books that were sold
then what do I need to do well I need to
reference the next link in the length
list and like you saw before that guy of
course is going to be a link and its
name is going to be next just like we
saw previously then just simply I'm
going to create a constructor here a
million sold and then assign the book
name and the millions of books sold and
there we are
like I said linked lists are confusing
only because they're a little bit weird
but once you understand that previous
frame that I just showed you they're not
that hard okay well then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to put in display and
all display is going to do is provide us
a little bit of information on our books
which are our links so that's going to
put out the book name the millions of
books sold and there we are
so that's all display is going to do I
mean technically we did pretty much
everything we needed to do with link
list just having data inside of it and
having next because remember all the
links no is the address of the previous
link that was added to our linked list
so then just to help things along I'm
going to also put two string in here and
whenever two string is called it is
going to return whatever the books name
is that's that link is done don't need
to do anything more with it so now what
we need to do is come in and define the
guy that knows about the last guy to
move into town like we said before his
name is link list and like you saw
before the last guy to move into town
his name is first link and this is just
a reference to the first link in the
list or the last link that was added to
the linked list now we're just going to
go to link list and I'm going to put in
null here I don't really need to do it
but I'm just doing it here to show that
the first link always starts as a null
value when you create a linked list so
that's the only reason it's in there of
course we all know that by default
objects get a value of null then if I
want to check if my linked list is empty
all I'm going to need to do is check if
first link is equal to null if it is
that
means that nobody has moved into town
yet so now let's take a quick look at
how to insert a new link into a linked
list to insert a new link into our
linked list a new link needs to be
created its next field is going to be
assigned to the reference to the
previous link that was created and the
length lists first link field is
assigned a reference to the newest link
added let's take a look at that as
pictures so we're going to create
ourselves a new link that we want to add
to our linked list we're going to take
the value of first link that is in the
linked list store that inside of next
and then store a reference to link as
the value or reference in the field name
first link all this stuff just moves to
the right that's all it does remember
linked list knows about the newest guy
that moves into town and the newest guy
that moves into town is named first link
and then the previous guy that moves
into town is going to be moved over here
and stored in the field for next so
let's build that in code so we're going
to go public void insert first link and
this is just going to be a string again
let me just grab that so it's going to
be book name and millions sold don't
like to type if I don't have to and all
the code that is here is available link
underneath the video then we're going to
go new we're going to create a new link
because a new guy just moved into town
and we're going to assign his name and
how many books he sold so there we go we
created a new link just like I said
before now I just need to connect the
first link field that is stored inside
of the link list to the new link so I go
a new link next you now know the address
for the guy that moved into town
previous to you and that is stored
inside of next and then I just go first
link is now equal to the last guy to
move into town and that's how I do
and I just added that guy into our
linked list so now let's look at how to
remove the very last guy that moved into
town to remove the last guy that moved
into town the length lists a first link
field is just simply going to be
assigned the value of the current first
links value for next that is it let's
look at that in pictures so if we want
to remove this guy right here
well first link has a reference to this
link here stored inside a first link if
we want to remove this link altogether
we just take the reference right here
which is a reference to this link move
it over here and store it inside a first
link and this disappears let's look at
that in code so we're just going to go
public link it's going to remove or send
back or return the link that was removed
that's why that's in there so then I'm
going to just go in here and go link
reference is going to be equal to first
link and just remember first link is
this guy right here we're doing all this
coding inside of our linked list that we
created so that's first link reference
to the last guy that moved into town now
just to be nice we're going to say is
the town empty and if it isn't we're
gonna remove the link from our list by
going hey first link was the guy's name
that moved into town before you did I
want to get that because you're going to
get it vic today I always need to know
about the last guy that moved into town
and that's exactly what you just did
else we're going to say empty linked
list and then remember we said that we
want to return this guy right here the
guy that was deleted if it was deleted
and there you go right there
so how do we cycle through a linked list
very simple all we need to do it is
cycle through a list of links is start
at the reference stored in first link
remember linked list knows about the
last guy to move into town so in essence
we're going to be cycling through first
the last guy to move into town and then
the guy that moved into town previous to
that and then the guy that moved into
town previous to that so we just start
at the reference stored in first link
inside the linked list object and then
we get the references stored in next for
every link until next returns a value
for null this is what it looks like in
pictures we say hey first link who's the
last guy that moved into town it
provides that answer then it goes to hey
the last guy to move into town what was
the guy's name or address that moved
into town before you oh I have that
stored next then he gives it to him and
we come over to this guy we say who's
the guy that moved into town before you
and he says nobody I am the very first
person to move into town well in that
situation next is going to have a value
of null which means we're at the end of
the list and we are done cycling through
because we have go
through every neighbor in the
neighborhood let's look at that in code
so in this situation we're just gonna
display everything just like we did
previously and since we're displaying
everything we don't need to return
anything because there's no point in
that so we're going to say link we're
just going to say the link is equal to
first link which is the last guy to move
into town and then we're going to create
ourselves a while loop and it's going to
say wow the link is not equal to null
meaning that we got to the last person
in the neighborhood we're just going to
keep getting references stored next for
every link until we get to no and then
we're going to go the link dot display
which is a reference to display inside
of link which is this guy right here
it's going to just print out the book
name in the millions sold and then let's
say we also want to print out the next
link value that is stored in each one of
these books to do that we're just going
to go the link next so that's the reason
why I didn't want to use getters and
setters and confuse everything then what
I'm going to do is say okay well the
current the link we want to get the
address for the next guy we want to look
at in town and just get the value of
next for that and then I'm just going to
throw a newline in there so how exactly
are we going to be able to find a link
in a linked list well we're going to
check the data for the first link
reference stored in the linked list and
see if it matches what we're looking for
and if you don't get a match continue
searching every reference stored inside
of each objects value for next until
next returns null which means we got to
the end of the list of links or in other
words we're going to say hey first link
inside a length list do you match what
we're looking for if the answer is no
we're going to jump over here and say do
you match if the answer is no we're
going to come over here and say do you
match and if the answer is no we're
going to say there's nobody else in the
list which means null and we're going to
pass back that there were no matches but
of course if there was a match we're
just going to return the match
so let's write up all the code for this
we're gonna go we're going to be
returning a link just like you saw and
let's say we're going to be searching
for book name or you could reference
this as a key or whatever you wanted to
do and then the link is going to be set
at the beginning as first link of course
we're going to check to make sure that
it's not
empty and if it isn't empty we're going
to continue searching as long as book
name is not equal to the book name that
we are searching for and of course put
that in brackets we're also going to
check if we're at the end of our length
list and how do we know we're at the end
of our linked list well next is going to
return a value of null and if it returns
a value of null that means we got to the
end of the list without finding a match
and we're just going to kick ourselves
out of this method by returning all else
we're going to get here if we found a
matching link inside the linked list
we're going to assign the link is going
to be equal to the reference inside of
next then we're going to bounce down
here and do an else and we're going to
say empty linked list print that out on
a screen otherwise we know we got a link
or a match and we're going to return it
so how are we going to remove a specific
link well this looks a little bit more
complicated but don't worry about it
what we're going to do is we're going to
cycle through all the links until there
is a match you already know how to do
that if the referenced link stored in
linked lists first link matches we're
going to store the reference next inside
a first link as the value for first link
or the reference and if a match occurs
elsewhere we're just going to find a
link that's next equals the reference
and remove it then we have to get the
reference name next in the link to
remove and assign it to the link above
let's look at that in pictures so if we
find a match for what we want to remove
inside of first the link what we're
going to do is we're just going to say
okay first links next this guy right
here this reference we're just going to
store that as the value of first link
and this is going to be deleted or this
guy right here is going to be deleted so
we're in essence just going to move this
guy over to here assign the reference in
next the first link if however another
link matches other than first link so if
we want to get rid of this guy we're
just going to take whatever the value of
next is right here and move it over into
this link and this will diss up here so
let's look at that in code so we're just
going to go public we're going to return
the link that matches or that we
removed if we find one anyway string and
we're going to be removing based off of
whatever the books name is and here
we're going to take the current link
that we're working with and it's going
to be first link because that is where
all of our searching is going to begin
and then we're going to go previous link
and because there is no previous link
for first link we're going to store
first link inside of there then we need
to keep searching as long as a match
isn't made so we're going to have to
create a while loop and we're going to
be searching for book name we're going
to be searching while we don't find a
match and then pretty much same sort of
thing is going to go on here we're going
to check if we're at the last link
inside the length list which means there
is nowhere else to search like that and
we're going to come to the conclusion
that the book name was not found in that
situation we're going to jump out of
this method all together by going return
null else we'll know that we already
checked here so we need to look in the
next link inside of our linked list so
we're going to take whatever the current
link is assign it to previous because we
have to look in the next one and then to
get the new current link we're going to
go current link next and that's going to
get us the next guy in the neighborhood
that we want to search for and that's
going to be current link there we go
then down here if current link is equal
to first link remember there were two
different ways of solving this one if we
got a match for the first link and one
if we got a match that wasn't in the
first link we're going to handle the
first link first because if we get here
that basically just means there was a
match in the reference stored and first
link inside of linked lists so it's very
easy to remove a item all we need to do
is assign next to first link so we're
going to go first link is equal to first
link next and there we are we're done we
just removed it else that means we got a
match in a link other than the very
first link and if that happened we're
going to go previous link next is equal
to current link next like that and then
of course since we want to return
whatever was deleted we're going to
return current link so let's save that
let's jump up here inside a main and
start executing some stuff now the very
first thing that we're going to have to
do inside of this is create a new linked
list
new linked list is equal to new linked
list and then if we want to insert new
links or new books that's real easy we
already did that insert first link
because that's what we're going to be
doing and let's just put a book inside
of here and then change this into 500
million and it will throw a couple more
books inside of there okay so that's how
easy it's going to be able to add links
to our linked list now if we want to
display our linked list quite easy just
go display bought it out it off and
execute and you can see that it is going
to be outputting them in the reverse
order of how they were put in and you
also see that Don Quixote here it's next
link is null that means it's at the end
of the linked list and Harry Potter in
this situation is going to be the value
of first link this guy right here for
the first link because he was added last
and then if we want to remove the last
item that was added we're just going to
remove first which is going to be Harry
Potter so let's just cut that out of
there paste that in there and you'll see
Harry Potter doesn't show up anymore if
we want to search for say Lord of the
Rings we're just going to go the linked
list and do a find on the Lord of the
Rings in this situation and then if we
want to have it output book name just do
that then we could say something like
was found boom and then you say Lord of
the Rings was found and then if we
wanted to come in here and remove a
specific book we're just going to go
remove link and just to save some time
I'm just going to come in here and do
the Lord of the Rings since we found it
we know what's in there and in this
situation I'm just going to cut that out
of there
paste that in execute and now you see
Lord of the Rings was found but it isn't
being printed out because we deleted it
and also remember the reason why Harry
Potter isn't getting printed out is
because we said remove first and that is
basically all I'm going to cover about
linked lists I hope you completely
understand those basics because
everything builds from there if you
don't leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
