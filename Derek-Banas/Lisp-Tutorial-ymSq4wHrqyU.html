list video tutorial in this one tutorial
I'm pretty much going to cover
everything you'd learn by reading a
400-page book on Lisp and basically Lisp
is one of the oldest languages being
that it was first created in 1958 except
over the years it has changed quite
considerably and it keeps getting better
and better
many people feel that it is a good idea
learn Lisp because it actually will
teach you how to program better and I
personally think that that is indeed
true and in fact numerous capabilities
that you find in pretty much every
programming language out there actually
was first created in the programming
language of Lisp you probably know it's
widely used in the field of artificial
intelligence among many other different
subjects and probably lisps greatest
strength is the capability to use data
to generate code so I have a lot to do
so let's go over and look at how we're
going to install this on both a Mac as
well as Windows now if you're on Macs
it's very easy to install Lisp just go
to Mac ports org install dot PHP and
you're going to want to follow these
little rules here install Xcode and then
you're going to come down here and
install the proper part of macports
depending upon whatever your operating
system is then after you install that
which is quite easier just going to go
into a terminal you're going to type in
sudo port install see list that is it
you're done and it's going to say all
kinds of things like you should update
and da-da-da-da-da don't worry about
that just left that on there so that if
you see all these warnings you weren't
afraid of them and that is all you need
to do on a Mac now let's take a look at
what we need to do on Windows now on
Windows you're going to go to seat list
dot org right there and then you want to
come over here and click on win32 if you
want to save yourself a little bit of
time however you could just go to
sourceforge.net and this is project c
list files latest download and you're
going to want to download list there
then after you download it's going to
allow you to set everything up you're
just going to click on next
and then you're going to say I agree and
then you're going to just leave
everything the way that is and
next and it's going to say exactly where
it wants to install this click on next
just remember where that's installed in
case you have to look that up which we
will be doing whenever we are compiling
our programs click on next and it's
going to install then after it installs
is going to put this little guy here on
your desktop and you're just going to
double click on that and it's going to
open up this guy now on both the Mac and
Windows and Linux and everything some
people really prefer to use this I am
NOT going to use it in this tutorial
because I want to be able to type a
whole bunch of other description things
out on the screen and that doesn't work
very well here but basically with this
little program here you're going to be
able to come in and do everything I do
in this tutorial so if you feel more
comfortable doing everything here do it
here otherwise do it in a test file and
then you will be able to compile so now
everybody has all that installed so
let's go over and start writing some
code ok so I have a basic text editor
here on the left side of the screen over
here I have my terminal if you're on
Windows it's going to be command line
and if I want to open up C lisps I just
go like this you can see exactly the
same things that we saw there whenever
we were using Windows and I could also
come in here and I could just say print
hello like that and boom you can see
that it shot it right back out you just
wrote right there a list program and
you're going to save your files with the
extension dot Li SP that is the
extension we use with lists and like I
said you can do everything in this
command exactly like this or you can go
and do them otherwise so I'm going to
quit out of this and this is how you
quit out of it and you can see it says
bye it's very nice and we're going to
come over here and write ourselves some
programs now the first thing to remember
there's a bunch of different comments
and I'm going to be doing some things
very few but a couple things that are
going to be styled in a not Lisp way so
that it's easier for you to understand
as a new programmer with Lisp so I'm
going to be doing things with
parentheses sometimes that make the code
more understandable but aren't Lisp
rules so if you want to put a comment
that's going to describe your program so
at the top of your program you're going
to come in here and put a four
semicolons that is a comment and that is
the only time you'll ever use for for
the most part you're going to use three
and this is just a basic comment
and then we have additional rules if
you're going to put a comment that is
indented with your code you're going to
put two little semicolons and then put
another comment and then if you're going
to put a comment that comes after a line
of code you're just going to put one
also we have multi-line comments inside
of Lisp and you're just going to put the
number sign and two little or statements
there and we could say multi-line and
then we're going to put two or
statements and then a closing number
sign so that's how we do multi-line
comments and that's pretty much
everything you need to know about
commenting inside a list I'm going to
show you a whole bunch of different ways
to output data basically the thing
that's a little bit odd with Lisp is
everything is going to be surrounded
with parentheses so if we want to output
text inside of our console over here or
our terminal one way to do it is with
format and if we type in T that's saying
that we want to use our terminal or
whatever to print everything out and
here is a basic hello world and if you
want to throw a new line at the end of
this you just put tilde and a percent
sign exactly like that
save that come over here we can also use
C lifts to be able to come in and
execute our programs if we'd like and we
can just type in C list and like I said
before you do this inside of windows and
remember you just need to know where C
Lisp is installed inside of your machine
to be able to execute it and you can see
right there hello world prints out real
nice so that's one way to output text on
a screen another way we could output
text on the screen is by using print and
there's a whole bunch of these different
things and I'm actually going to show
you here how to read input into your
program and then provide custom output
so I'm going to say what's your name
that's a print statement without a new
line and then we're going to be creating
variables now you can do a whole bunch
of things with variable names inside a
list you're going to be able to use
letters you're going to be able to use
numbers you're going to be able to use
plus and dashes and underscores and
multiplication equals even you can do a
whole bunch of different things I think
I got most of them here but you can use
all those different symbols inside of
your variable names and normally letters
inside of lists are all going to be
lowercase and that's because Lisp is not
case-sensitive however remember you
can't use whitespace and names because
as list items are going to be separated
with whitespace now if you're going to
be defining a global variable which we
are going to be doing right here you
just do define variable exactly like
that and global variables are normally
surrounded by asterisks and they don't
need to be but this is just a general
rule so that you can spot a global
variable if you ever see it if you want
to read data from your console you would
just put inside of here read and that's
going to create a new variable called
name and it's going to read data from
the console and store it in the variable
called name well we just jump right in
here I'm going to do like a simple intro
and then I'm going to get into more
detail than afterwards let's create a
function and to do that you just kind of
type in defined function and let's call
this guy hello you remember a white
space inside of here for the function
names either and this guy is going to
actually receive the name value it's
going to be passed inside of there and
then just to keep everything nice and
neat I'm going to indent this again you
don't need to do that with list but
that's a good idea to do it going to put
T inside of there which says that I want
to output to the terminal I'm then going
to want to put the name inside of there
so I'm going to put a tilde and an a
that's where the name value is going to
go inside of there and let's say I put a
little exclamation mark and then I can
do a new line right like that just like
I did before
go put a name inside of there like that
and then close it off this is something
you're not normally supposed to do with
lists you're not supposed to go down
here but I'm just showing you exactly
where that closes that off as you can
see right there and in fact if you see
if I put that parenthesis there you can
see exactly how its closing the top off
and it gave me a warning when I put too
many parenthesis on there the thing I
want to do is by default Lisp is going
to output all data in uppercase letters
if I want to set that so that it's going
to instead only capitalize the first
letter of something that prints out I'm
just going to come in here and I'm going
to say print case and I'm going to say
capitalize if I would want everything to
be outputted in lowercase letters
instead of putting capitalized there I
would put well actually if I wanted to
do uppercase I would put up case and if
I wanted to do a lowercase I would type
in down case so this guy or this guy
could easily go in here instead
depending
on how you want your output to show on
your screen and then if I want to call
the function hello you I would just go
hello you inside of parentheses and then
I'm going to pass inside of here
this name value like this and if we
execute that you're gonna see what's
your name I'm going to type in my name
and it's gonna say hello Derrick just so
you know if I come in here and I get rid
of this let's come in do that
what's your name and you can see it's
all uppercase so that's exactly what
that does and that's situation it may
have a couple questions about format
what's going on right here let me just
show you whenever you have a tilde or an
A you know that the value of this is
going to be transported and put inside
of there and that's just going to show
the value wherever you put that little
symbol you would put a tilde and an S
it's going to put quotes around that
value and then you could also add ten
spaces for the value with the extra
space on the right by just putting in
like this or if you want the extra
spaces to show on the left you would
just put it in that little @ sign there
instead then of course you can come in
here and change this and it actually
makes more sense to change that because
this is not a global variable and you're
going to get exactly the same results
just like that
say hello Derrick all right so we got
all that cleared up now let's go and
explore a little bit more like to talk a
little bit about some of the things that
make Lisp a little bit different than
other programming languages let's keep
this inside of here and then we'll
continue there afterward now you're
going to hear about things called forms
basically a form is a list with a
command function name at the beginning
and this would be an instance of that if
we wanted to add the values of five and
four that's exactly how we would do it
and basically this right here is going
to be the function name and this right
here these two numbers right here are
going to be the parameters or the
attributes that are going to be sent to
this value and of course the opposite of
this would be nine another thing that's
interesting is that you're actually
going to be able to nest your forms
inside of forms so let's say that I
wanted to add a value and we wanted to
add five and then I wanted to take
another value and subtract it and have
it be six and two well I could do it
just like that so this would subscribe
to from six give me a value of four and
then
add five and four together which would
ultimately give me a value of nine as
well I know it might seem a little bit
confusing using all these functions
inside of functions but as you practice
with it and just look at it it's going
to eventually make a lot of sense what
you have to understand is basically
everything is a list inside of Lisp and
all of these different individual pieces
are going to be held inside of things
called con cells or consecutive cells so
for example if we would have + + 5 + 4
like that these guys are actually going
to be in cells and they're going to be
like this and this is where you may be
able to see how by learning Lisp other
programming languages might be a little
bit easier to understand and you can see
right there all those guys are going to
be inside of cells and actually the last
cell always is going to be nil which
also represents value false it's used
for many different things but it's just
a sign that the list has ended for this
command that you want to execute now I
already talked about how to define a
variable let's just go in here and
define another one let's say we have one
that's just called number like this and
we're going to give it default value of
zero well we could come in here then
again and change the value for number
just like going set F providing the name
change it to 6 and areare so that's how
we're going to be able to change and
define our variable names and as you're
going to see you in a little bit you can
also use something called let to define
variables inside of a body and so forth
but I'm going to leave that out for now
let's take a little bit closer look at
format and exactly how we can use that
to output data in different ways
so here's format and we're going to put
t so we goes to the console and we could
say something like number with commas
automatically added in there and we
could put a tilde sign followed by a
colon and AD that is automatically going
to throw in all of our commas that we
would like and you can see that it
automatically threw those in there
there's a whole bunch of different
things here when I just go and show you
exactly how they work you'd also be able
to come in here and print out pie with
five characters just by putting a tilde
and then
number of characters you want to show
here on our screen we can just save that
execute it after that a little bit of a
mess let's throw in our new line so we
can see this a little bit better this
and now you can see there is the numbers
being printed out with commas here you
can see that we only have five
characters one the period two three four
here we're also defining the number of
decimals by putting in a comma before
the number of decimals and you can see
there we got four and this guy will
actually print out a percent I'm showing
you pretty much everything here as well
as this one's going to automatically
turn the ten into a dollar format
there's a whole bunch of different ways
we can use format won't we go and look a
little bit deeper at different math
functions we can use okay I
automatically went in here and just to
show you we already covered exactly how
we're going to add these different
values together and there is a final
value how we handle subtraction how we
handle multiplication how we handle
division however you can see that this
is a little bit weird because it's going
to actually output the division exactly
the way you see it if you want to show
decimals for your division you're
actually going to have to have one of
these be a float with a decimal and then
REM as well as mod or both going to
return the remainder of a set division
and you can see exactly how we're able
to come over here and put in these
different functions and exactly where
they are going to go in each of those
situations so pretty easy to format and
automatically input all these different
math calculations now let's go look at a
couple more math calculation okay and
now you can see right here how we're
going to be able to perform all these
other different math calculations like
square root and exponent of 1 as well as
log and this is actually going to come
out to a value of 3 because 10 to the
power of 3 is 1,000 that's how logworks
thought I'd just bring that up gonna get
a little bit more into how we're going
to be able to compare different values
to see if they are equal or not this guy
is automatically going to pop out a
value of true as you can see right there
floor is going to round down ceiling is
going to round up Max is going to give
the max of the values that are passed
into it as well as minimum we can
actually check if a number is odd or if
it's even nil is exactly the same as
false and we could also check if a
Lu is a number and you can see right
here null and nil and false are all
exactly the same exact value inside of
Lisp and along with all these other
different functions of course we're also
going to have all of these other
different things like sine cosine
tangent arc sine da-da-da-dah so now why
don't we jump over and actually look at
equality and how that works inside of
Lisp now basically let's come in here
and let's define a parameter you can
also define you can do things in so many
different ways inside a list what's
absolutely amazing let's define another
guy here again it's going to have the
value of name and I'm going to define it
as a symbol in this situation then if I
wanted to come in here and actually
check for equality so let's say that I
say I'm going to use EQ in this
situation I'm also going to use equal
here in a second so name and check that
is equal to itself as you can see right
there and let's go and throw a value out
here in a new line of course I could
then pass in EQ and Derrick right like
that and you can see if I execute it
that indeed those two things are true
basically you're going to use EQ any
time you are going to be checking for
equality in regards to symbols
everything else is basically going to be
compared with equal instead for the most
part so let's come in and just compare a
couple of these different guys here you
can see I'm doing a comparison between
symbols so that indeed can be done with
just equal instead of EQ and there you
can see the output over there is nil or
false we're also able to check for
equality between numbers just basic old
numbers with equal also going to be able
to work with that with floats also going
to be able to handle strings and the
only reason why I have this backslash
inside of here is because I have a quote
right there and I want to differentiate
and say that that quote right here is in
fact not this quote and how we do that
is with a backslash and you can see that
it also is going to verify that they are
not equal these strings right here by
putting nil out because this is a lower
case and that's an upper case equality
does pay attention to the case of the
values and we're also going to be able
to check equality between lists and
we're going to get a lot more into lists
here in just a moment if I were you'd
like to compare strings of any
and integers - floats you could also
come in and use equal pee and how that
is set up is let's go do that we type in
equal P and you can see right here I'm
going to compare a float to an integer
to check for equality and to get that
value of course we're going to type in
equal pay in exactly the same way and
then we can also do a comparison with
our different strings even though the
case might be different again I'm going
to put a backslash inside of here well
let's go and put it back slash here and
then another backslash with my name and
then here whenever I'm to actually check
in the Equality I don't need back
slashes of course it's very good see
whenever I clicked on that that
automatically close this a little blue
and you're going to see here whenever I
hit the next one this is going to light
up below so come over here and watch
over there see they both lit up below so
it's pretty easy to get used to the
parentheses and how they work and you
can see that even though the case is
different in these strings these come
back that's true and you can also see
that even though one of these is an
integer and one of these is a float this
also comes back true there's a couple
different ways of working with equality
or checking for equality now we go in
and take a look at conditionals okay so
what I'm going to do here first off is
I'm going to define a parameter and I
could use define variable we could just
do the variable it doesn't matter both
the going to work exactly the same way
this is going to be a global I'm going
to give it a starting value of 18 now
you're going to have a bunch of
different relational operators you're
going to have greater than and less than
and greater than or equal to less than
or equal to or just simply equal to and
you're also going to there's going to be
a way to use or check for not equal
which I'll talk about here in a second
let's just stick to that and I'll get
into the logical operators here in a
second now if I wanted to perform a if
conditional what I'm going to do is say
if and then I'm going to say equal and
I'm going to type in the to the variable
that I want to check against versus the
value and the way this guy is going to
work is it's going to perform the first
thing here otherwise if that condition
is false it's going to perform something
else I'm going to say something like you
can vote otherwise if that
addition is not true I'm going to come
down here and say you can't vote so you
can see there's no else inside of here
it's automatically built in and you can
either go and put your closing
parenthesis here or follow the rules of
Lisp and put them right there you can
see if we execute you can vote pops up
so that's how we would use those
different relational operators as well
as how we would use if if you would in
fact want to check for not equal it's
actually pretty easy all we're going to
do is come out here again put a
parenthesis and we're going to put knot
and then we're going to go like this
like that and boom you can't vote pops
out so that's how we would check for not
equal to even though not equal to is not
a necessarily option and of course all
this code is available in a cheat sheet
format in the description underneath the
video sorry I didn't say that earlier
you're also going to have a whole bunch
of logical operators you're going to
have and or and not you just saw not and
with those you're going to be able to
perform even more complex conditionals
going to put the and outside instead of
in the center of these conditions which
might seem a little bit odd this
situation when it's check to see if age
is less than or equal to 14 and normally
the end would be in here but it's in
here not a big deal and then we're going
to do another conditional check greater
than or equal to age and 67 in this
situation and then we're going to
perform this if both of those are true
and I'll say time for work otherwise
else we could say something like work if
you want you can see there you go work
if you want comes back something would
actually make more sense in this
situation as if we would use the or
statement however because basically
we're looking for situation in which our
age is going to fall in the middle which
means that one or the other of these is
going to be equal to each other however
not the other one and to check for that
we would just type in or instead
actually you can see right here that
would make a little bit more sense to
take this and put this up here and then
go time for work right here right like
that that would actually make more sense
in this situation there you can see time
for work pops back so that is different
ways we can use our logical as well as
our relational operators let's come in
here
and find a couple more of these guys
define variable and we'll have just a
number and give it a value of two and
there we go to find three different
variables all with the default value of
two to start out now you might ask
yourself well how do we perform multiple
different statements inside of an F
because that's something that we're
definitely going to want to do I default
you're only going to be able to perform
one of them well you could do something
like this and then num2 so you can say
if num is actually equal to the value of
two then if you want to put multiple
different statements inside of them
you're going to type in Prague and like
that and you're going to find all the
different things that you want to set so
let's say that you wanted to define or
set the value of num two to be equal to
multiplication of num two times to do
that and then you could also change the
value of num three just making stuff up
here just to show you different things
and let's say that that would be a
multiplication of three in that
situation well we're then going to close
off the prog n part there you can see it
closed off and then here we can just do
we could do another program for the else
but here we'll just keep it simple and
we'll just say something like not equal
to two and then close those off so
that's how we'd be able to execute
multiple different statements in the
situation in which this is true or if we
want to put Prague in down here multiple
different statements elsewise and just
make sure that we would go in here and
set these to set F and execute this and
you can see right here how the values
changed because the original value of
num was actually equal to two another
conditional operator is the case
statement let's define a variable called
age it's going to perform a limited
number of different options depending
upon the value of a certain variable so
we come in here and define a function
and we could say something like get
school and it's going to be passed in
age then we could say case age which is
going to be the variable value we're
going to be checking against we're going
to check that the value is equal to five
and in the situation in which it is
equal to five we could say something
like kindergarten and that would be
output to the screen otherwise we could
check if the value is equal to six
and in that situation we would say first
grade and then we could continue onwards
and onwards but just to keep this simple
I'm going to have the default if neither
of these are true and you define the
default with word otherwise and in this
situation I would print out and middle
school and of course we could come in
here and call this function by going get
school and then pass in the value of age
and you can see kindergarten pops back
if you would ever want to put in a new
line after the print like this function
you're going to use for that it's just
going to be ter PRI that just puts in a
new line as you'll see whenever we go
and put some more information here on a
screen and now let's take a look at wind
which is basically going to allow you to
execute multiple statements whenever a
condition is true and how you use it is
just go win and in this situation we'll
check for age to see if it is equal to
18 when it is equal to 18 we're going to
go set up and we're going to define
number 3 to 18 come up here and just
throw that in there and then if we
wanted to output information you could
say something like go to college you are
18 close that off if we jumped up here
and change the value of age to 18 you'll
see when we execute that that is going
to say go to college or 18 other thing
you could do is very similar is it's
called unless it's basically the
opposite of when we could say something
to like unless and then we'll put
something like not leave that exactly
the same and we could just set this to
20 and say something random something
random and you can see there something
random print it out there's a difference
between when and unless another
conditional we have available is
something called conditional and it's
very very similar to the way that if
else and elfis work in other different
programming languages to use it we're
going to say something like let's define
another variable and have this be
college ready and let's give it a value
of nil to start off then to use the
conditional I'm going to type in Co nd
let's say something like if the age is
greater than or equal to 18 on this
situation that is indeed going to be
true well then
you can just go in here and tab in as
much as you'd like say something like
set F for college ready - yes and then
we can command and put in anything else
we'd like to do such as format and we
could say something like ready for
college and then close that off and now
we would have our else statement which
we would be very used to in other
languages we could say something like if
age is less than 18 and we can just
borrow this guy up here copy that
tab in there and we could change college
ready to no and then say not ready for
college and then finally we would have
your default which would be else and
this is basically be saying if you get
here which is put a T inside of there
for true and by default we're going to
say something like don't know and in
this situation you can see ready for
college pops up there's a ton of
different ways to use conditionals
inside of lists now let's go and take a
look at how looping works
now basically loop is going to execute
code a defined number of times for us so
we're just going to type in loop and
hopefully you're getting used to the
parentheses and we're just going to say
loop for X from there's a whole bunch of
these some of them are easier to
understand and other ones are more
usable so in this situation we're going
to loop from 1 to 10 and then inside of
this we would define exactly what we
want to do this as we iterate through
our loop and in this situation we'll
just do something like real simple like
printing out the value of x you can see
it did just that we could also use loop
to loop until a condition is met and
then jump out of our loop and we could
do something like let's just come in
here and set a value of x value of 1
then we could say loop and again print
out the value of X then we're going to
increment the value of X each time it
goes through here and how we do that is
just with plus sign and x + 1 and then
we could put our when statement inside
of here which is going to jump us out of
the loop and we could say when X is
greater than 10 and then we could do
something like return X and that would
jump us out of our loop basically going
to look like the same sort of thing as
you can see right there could also use
loop to jump through a series or a list
of different
Jax say 4x in now let's create ourselves
a list so we'll have Peter will get a
lot more end lists here in a second list
I'm not saying list then we would say do
again and we can cycle through these
guys and print them out on our screen
for ourselves close off that loop Peter
Paul and Mary print it right out there
on the screen and we could also we
wouldn't have to start at one by any
stretch of the imagination we go loop
for y from 100 to 110 do and then it's
out of here defined that we want to
print out all those different values as
well and there you can see those print
it out do x is another looping structure
that is going to allow us to iterate a
specified number of times and use it two
times and you're going to find Y and
let's just say we want to loop through
here twelve times there we go and print
Y and there you can see went from 0 the
way to 11 starts out at 0 by default and
as we go I'm going to give you a couple
more examples of looping but that's
pretty much all that you're going to
need for the most part so now let's go
and take a look at consecutive cells or
lists and how they work because they are
very important inside of Lisp now let's
say that we want to link together two
objects of data how you would do that is
by typing in Co NS or consecutive and
here I'm going to work with some
superheroes so I have Superman and
Batman
okay so there's some different guys that
we connected together inside of this
list I could then create a list by
actually using the list function so you
can get a Superman Batman and flash and
I could also come in here and add an
item to the front of another list by
using consecutive as well we go
Aquaman and here you can see is another
list Superman and Batman
okay so there's just some quick ways of
working with those I'm going a bit of
course be able to store these different
list items inside of any other variable
just like any other variables so there's
nothing it's particularly fancy about
them the one thing that is a little bit
fancy is let's say that I wanted to get
the first item out of one of my lists
how exactly would I do that
well I would use a function called car
so let's go and create a list item here
to try to keep this simple we'll have
Superman Batman and Aquaman inside of
our list there it is sokar is going to
give us the first value inside a list if
you execute this you're going to see
first is equal to Superman it does
exactly that now if I would want to get
everything else outside of the list I
would change this from an A into a D and
let's just change this to everything
else and you can see now I get Batman an
Aquaman but I do not get Superman now
this is very important to understand how
the differences between the DS and the a
is work and may show you a whole bunch
of examples so I guarantee you're gonna
get this so now let's say that I want to
get the second item out of a list this
gets a little bit more complicated but
not so much so let's say I want to get
my second item out of my list and this
is going to be Superman Batman Aquaman
flashing Joker just so I can show you a
whole bunch of these now if I want to
get the second item out of the list
remember the a is going to give me the
first item out of the list now what do I
want I want to get everything else if I
want to get the second item what I'm
trying to do is get Batman so what I'm
gonna have to do here is I want to get
everything else so I want to have a D
right here but then I want the first
item in that new list so what do I do
I put an A right there if I save that
you're going to see the Batman comes
back now this is very important to
understand what we want we want to get
everything else if we want Batman out of
here if we had an A inside of here that
would give a Superman so I want
everything else that's my first little
block off so I'm going to put a D inside
of there that's going to give me
everything else and then with this new
list I'm going to say that I want the
first item out of that new list and
that's exactly how this works and how
using these A's and d's inside air
allows us to grab specific data out of
lists of course if I would want to go in
and get my fourth item out of that list
what would I want to do well I don't
want this I don't want the Superman so I
want everything else so that's going to
give me a D let's get rid of that now in
the next situation
I want the fourth item which is going to
be flash so I don't want to use an A
here I want to get this part right here
so what do I do I put in another day so
now I stuck with
Aquaman Flash and Joker well I want
flash so I went to ignore Aquaman so I
put in another day and now I have flash
and Joker
I want flash so I put an A and right
inside of there and if I do that and
execute you're gonna see that I grab
flash it's actually not the third item
in that situation would be the fourth
item all right so that is how we're
going to be able to traverse inside of
lists I put a little bit more emphasis
on it than is necessary but I just
wanted to guarantee that you understood
exactly how those work if you would
however want to come in here and get the
Joker sadly you're not going to be able
to come in and type in another day
you're only allowed to use four of these
different characters inside of your
lists so I'm going to show you other
different ways to traverse and grab that
out of lists here as we continue just
wanted to show you that example and
actually in the description there's a
link and it has numerous different
examples if you're at all confused with
how to work with lists inside of Lists
another thing we can do is we could
actually check to make sure a list is a
list so let's just change this to is it
a list and how we would check it is with
list P and of course this is going to be
a list Batman and Superman and you can
see right there comes back it's true
we're also going to be able to check if
for example three would be inside of a
list so let's say is three in list and
then we'll come in here and change this
up a little bit
instead of list P we're instead going to
say if member and we're going to say
what we're looking for inside of the
list and we say two four and six and
then here we will provide a situation or
an else in which they would not be true
and you can see it comes back as nil
you're going to be able to pend
or join together list with the command
append so you can say just some random
words we're also going to be able to
push an item on the front of a list so
let's say we go define parameters nomes
and let's create a list inside of here
and we wanted to push on to the front of
our list the value of one onto nums
that's how you would do that and then if
we
to be able to get pretty much any value
inside of our list we could go format
and then what we would be looking for is
the nth item which we want the second
item out of the list called numbs you
see the second item of the list is for a
couple other different things we can do
with the lists inside of a list we
create what's called a P list which is
going to use symbols to describe the
data that is inside of them and how you
do that is define variable like this we
could say something like Superman and we
could say list and here is the key
that's going to provide information on
the data stored so Superman's going to
be his public name and secret ID is
going to be his secret identity so Clark
Kent like that let's then go and create
another list which is going to hold all
of our heroes
so we'll go call this hero list give it
a value of nil to start off we could
then add heroes to our list so we could
add Superman to our hero list just that
easily and then if we wanted to cycle
through all these different guys we
could do do list and hero which is going
to be the temporary holding cell for all
the different heroes that are popped off
of this there's only going to be one of
them though because that's what I got
and another thing it's kind of cool is
we can have all of this data
automatically output in the right way
from the list course put the parentheses
inside of there for format and how we
would do that is by putting a tilde in
that parentheses right there tilde a
we're going to be getting Superman and
Clark Kent and then we'll go and get the
next one a and then close it with tilde
and the closing curly brackets and then
we can pass in hero right like that
cycle through you're going to see
Superman secret identity automatically
pops out there on the screen so if you
didn't catch that exactly what's going
on it's cycling through hero each of the
items in the hero list and it's
automatically because I have this tilde
and curly brace and this tilde and this
closing curly brace it's grabbing
Superman out of there automatically for
me so I didn't have to say at once
specifically the name and then Clark
Kent directly out of there and putting
that inside of there
that's another neat little trick way to
cycle through all this different stuff
is a lot of information on this but now
let's go and take a look at Association
lists because they're kind of cool as
well and all the neat little things
we'll be able to do with those basically
let's go in here and we'll say define
parameter and we're going to call this
heroes now what we're going to be able
to do is go and put Superman inside of
here and then Clark Kent inside of there
and add in a couple other different
heroes now we'll be able to go in and go
something like Superman data and grab
specific data out of that list by using
associate and here we'll go Superman and
then heroes so that's going to allow us
to grab from the heroes associated list
information that's specific to Superman
and you can see there is the Superman
data Superman and Clark Kent
automatically pop out there for us we're
able to associate those two guys with
each other and because this data is
actually stored as list we're actually
going to be able to use our little tools
here our CA RS and CA DRS and
da-da-da-da-da so we can go and get this
list data right here which is going to
be returned from the association right
here and automatically get just
Superman's secret identity printed out
on the screen Superman
is Clark Kent we can do other things
with Association lists let's go and
create another one this time we're going
to be storing different pieces of data
about our different heroes inside of
this list then once again if we want to
come in here and get Superman's data
like in this situation we wanted to be
able to find out the height of our
superhero
well again CIDR if you don't remember
how this works we don't want Superman we
want to get the star right here and then
we want to specifically get the height
so we have D and a right like that and
you can see that we were able to pull
the Superman height directly right out
of that list and I'll put it here on the
screen and work with it there's a brief
explanation of sociation lists and lists
and so forth and so on now why don't we
go and take a break and look at some
simpler things like functions okay so
functions inside of lists we've already
going over this a little bit but let the
heck let's do it a little bit more
to define a function just type in de fu
n and let's say we would just want to do
a really simple thing like this then we
can put a whole bunch of functions
inside of our functions of course and
then if we wanted to go and put in a new
line in that situation here about that
all the time it's the only reason why I
keep bringing it up and if we wanted to
execute our function and there we go
hello pop that on the screen really
simple now let's do something a little
bit more complicated so again find a
brand new function and this one's going
to get an average of two values that are
passed inside of it of course we just
put the attributes that we expect to be
passed inside of it like this we'll just
do a division right there and then we
would add up our different numbers that
we have inside of there and then finally
put the two right there close that off
and then we could go in here and just
call our function inside of this format
like this and there you can see that
works there are so many things you can
do inside of Lisp with functions we
could also define some of our parameters
as being optional inside of our function
very easy so create another function
let's have this one be print list and
then we'll just have WX and then
anything we want to be optional we would
just put optional before it with that
and sign and then we could continue
putting in an additional different
values inside of here and then we could
have these all output on our screen and
then call our function print list just
like we have been and in this situation
we're only going to pass in three values
you're going to see exactly what it does
automatically goes and gives the last
value a default value of nil could also
set it up so we'll be able to receive
multiple values we'll define a variable
and we're going to need to call this
total give it a false value of zero and
now we can come in and find our function
and let's call it sum and with rest
you're going to be able to receive
multiple values and I'm just going to
call this number will then be able to go
do list num nums going to sort through
all the list items guess what this does
the rest
turns gnomes into a list and as its sort
and throw it's temporarily going to hold
each inner iteration of the nums list
inside of the variable
I'm numb and then we could set the value
of total by adding numb to total each
time we go through there and then we
could close off the do list part right
there and we could do something like sum
is equal to and then the final value of
total and then whenever we wanted to
call this we just go as far as we want
it to go and know that it's
automatically going to be able to handle
all those different values we're also
going to be able to use key words and
what are called keyword parameters so
that we'll be able to pass values to
specific parameter names inside of here
and we'll just call this print list
again and we could do we can also stack
these guys up so we let's say we wanted
to make everything optional we could do
that and then let's also say we wanted
to have key values y&amp;amp;z like this and
there is our list and a new line and
then we just go list x y&amp;amp;z and now we
could call print list again using
optionals
as well as keys if we want to give a
value specifically to the x value just
put a little : X and the value you want
to sign and then if you wanted to assign
a value to Y you'd do that as well right
like this and you can see that that
automatically works as well
now defaults by default are going to
return the value of the last expression
that's executed so this is actually what
would be considered the return value
however you could also return a specific
value with something called return from
followed by the functions name just make
sure you remember you always want to put
return from and whatever the functions
name is so let's have this B difference
and it's going to get number one and
number two and then if we want it to
return a value we would say return from
and then the functions name difference
this guy right here is going to go right
there and then inside of it we could
just do a simple subtraction so num1
num2 and just call difference ten and
two
or better yet let's just throw this
aside of a format statement like that
and there you can see exactly how that
works
now let's take a look back here at
Association lists and functions I'm
gonna just want to talk about something
called quasi quoting which is going to
allow us to switch from what is called
code to data mode and this is kind of
cool so what we're going to be able to
do here is define a function and let's
say get zero data is the name of our
function and size is what's going to be
passed inside of this we're going to be
able to do is go format but then we're
going to be able to go in here and pull
in specific hero data we're basically
going to be able to switch back and
forth between data versus code mode so
we'll be able to execute code and put
the code right in the middle of the data
it's really neat so I'm going to go down
the new line so we can see everything on
one line so here we go so this is going
to be quasi coding mode and then if we
want to convert something into actual
code so that we can run this code inside
of this actual data say we can just put
C aar inside of here and size is and
again we want to run a function again
inside of this data really cool we can
do that and again we're going to run
another function inside of here c DD a
our size now what we'll be able to do is
come in and go get hero data and pass in
hero size and you can see that it pops
back Superman 6-foot 3-inches and 230
pounds so just another neat little thing
you can do with Lisp you can pretty much
can't do with any other language another
thing we could do is we could actually
check multiple different items and run a
function against them so we could say a
number and then use map car which is
going to take a list and run a function
over and over and over across all the
different items in the list and the
function that you want to run against
those has to start with a number sign
and then a quote and let's just say in
this situation if we wanted to just
check to if each item inside of our list
is actually a number or not of course
you can use any function you can imagine
so let's just go F and G and you can see
that comes back true true true nil nil
so that's map car and how it works and
how you can use very easy in one line go
and check a whole bunch of different
things inside of a list you can also
define functions local only to a
specific area and you do that with
something called F let in the way this
guy is going to work
is you're going to have a function name
inside of here and arguments that are
going to be passed inside of it and then
you're going to have the function body
it's going to be just whatever it's
going to be all that stuff and then
you're going to have the body that is
going to execute that function so let me
just show you so image some people get
confused by this so let's go F flat and
then we can go let's create a function
inside of it called double it and double
it's going to get a number and then what
it's going to do to that number is
multiply that number that it receives by
two and then inside of here
we're going to be able to execute it so
you can put functions inside of
functions you could also come in here
and have multiple functions inside of F
flat so let's get rid of that right
there and then it will put another one
inside of here which will be triple it
which is also going to receive a number
and then inside of that we could find
and multiply that times three and then
close that off with three parentheses
and we could do something with double
and triple ten and then we could do
triple it and with the heck we could
also go and double it so pass the value
of double it into triple it and then
pass a ten inside of that and then let's
get rid of that so you can play around
with that a little bit another thing is
we can use labels and they're used
whenever you want to have a function
call itself or if you want to be able to
call another local function inside of a
function I'm covered pretty much
everything here so let's go labels and
you could go double it and there's a
number that's passed inside of it and
then you can define what you want double
it to do multiply num times two and then
triple it also receives a number and
then of course you could throw double it
with its num and then multiply that
times three I mean I'm just playing
around here this is definitely something
you guys want homework all the time come
in here and just play around with these
guys experiment and check around you
know check out exactly what's going on
and understand exactly what's going on
there's your homework and then you could
go triple it directly inside of here
which is kind of cool okay so there's a
whole bunch of different things we can
use function wise
we look at a couple more we're also
going to be able to return multiple
values from a function and how we do
that is let's say we have something
called squares I don't know I'm just
making this up as I go along here and if
we want to return a value
there we go values and then define the
different values we want to return so
multiply this two and then we could also
return exponent num and 3 and then we
could get multiple values from the
function of course so let's go multiple
value bind put a and B here a B and then
call squares passed to inside of there
we can go and get those two values from
there and those two values of course are
going to be a and B and you can see they
output right there on the screen so it's
kind of cool passing multiple values
getting multiple values and using
functions inside a function it's just a
whole bunch of craziness all right so
now let's talk about higher-order
functions and basically with these
you're going to be able to use functions
as if they are data so let's come in and
just define a function let's call it x 3
and basically it's going to receive a
value and then it's going to multiply
that value of x 3 pretty simple and then
let's go and create another one and this
one's just going to be x 4 and you
guessed it it's going to multiply
whatever it gets x 4 but basically what
this is going to allow us to do is pass
in the function without any attributes
just like it's a variable so let's
create another function and this is
going to be I'm going to call this
multiples and here is going to be the
function it's going to be passed inside
of it so let's call this multiple
function so one of these guys is going
to actually get passed into this
function and let's say we wanted to go
and automatically multiply a list of
numbers up to this maximum number x 3
and x 4 and you can totally change the
way this function works based off of the
function that you pass inside of it
because it's really powerful so let's
use do x again and here we're going to
say x maximum and now what we're going
to be able to do is go format c and
cycle through all these different items
up to that maximum number
we can go and output all the different
values here so it'll be easy to see what
we're multiplying times and then we're
going to take X so X is going to go
right here and then if we want to use
our custom function we call fun call
like that and the function that we want
to execute and the value we want to pass
into that function so this guy one of
these guys is going to be passed inside
of here and X is going to be this guy so
as its cycling through here it's
temporarily going to get this value
stored right there so it's going to pass
that into that function and it's going
to print that out on the screen now what
we're going to be able to do is go
multiples and then if we want to pass in
our function we have to put a dollar
sign and I quote right there n times 3
and then the maximum value we want it to
print out or print up to and then of
course we're going to do the same thing
for 4 just to show you that it both
works seamlessly and there you can see
it dead went in here multiplied
everything times 3 and then down here
multiply everything times 4 here you can
see that's how we use higher-order
functions and then pretty much the last
type of function we're going to talk
about are lambdas and basically it's
going to allow you to create a function
without giving it a name and you're also
going to be able to pass this function
just like you pass variables so let's
use map car again because now of course
kind of cool
again allows you to cycle through a list
and perform a function on it so to call
it will just go lambda and it's going to
get a value of x and it's going to
multiply everything or all X values
times 2 and then let's go and create
ourselves a list there we go and there
we are we just created a lambda function
and just so you can see how it actually
does something let's go and throw print
inside of here and that like that and
there you can see I've printed out all
those different values on the screen
that's a brief explanation of how lamb
does work but I think because I talk so
much about functions in general you'll
be able to get it so why don't we talk
about macros now basically a function
runs whenever it's going to be called to
execute while macro is compiled and then
after it's going to be compiled it's
going to be available immediately like
any list built-in functions and it might
help to better understand macro
in regards to they are used to generate
code rather than necessarily perform
actions now to explain them a little bit
better what I'm basically going to do is
just create a couple macros that solve
some problems so let's say we have
variables here we have num and then
let's go and have num to give it a value
of zero so I'm going to change something
it's a little bit irritating whatever
we're working with if statement it's
sometimes it's kind of irritating to
have to use prog n if we want to be able
to execute multiple different functions
inside of here if this comes back as
true and one way that we can solve this
or at least one canned way them going to
force macros to solve it is I'm going to
create a macro that is going to fix that
now to find a macro we just go to find
macro exactly like that and I'm going to
call this if it now what it's going to
do is if it or if it function is going
to get a condition pass to it and then
it's going to get a list of statements
that we are going to store we're going
to use rest for that as well and that's
going to be the body of the function
that we're going to be working with here
so we have a condition and then all the
statements that we want to execute here
are going to be those statements right
there now in this situation I'm going to
use quasi coding again which is going to
be this back space right there that
quote right there and this is going to
generate all the code remember I said
macros generate code so the code that
this is going to generate is if and then
we're going to follow this with the
condition and then inside of it we can
put prog N and then the body of the
statements that are passed inside of
here we're going to put this comma right
here to automatically turn this from
data into code mode just like we did
before and how we're going to get that
is type in body like that with the @
symbol and then we could do something
like format this would be the else part
of it can't drive like that and then
we're going to close that off and there
we define a macro it's basically it's
just going to change the way that the if
is going to work it's going to have the
F it's going to have a condition it's
going to need to take Prague it's going
to get all the statements and put them
inside of the Prague block and then it's
going to use this as else otherwise so
now let's go and use it so we could do
something like
set age equal to 16 and what this is
going to allow us to do now is use our
new if it function we're going to be
able to pass in or check if the age is
greater than or equal to 16 and now we
can completely forget about using prog
in in this situation and just go you are
over 16 and then print time to drive and
then we could throw in a new line like
that and you can see here if we execute
it you are over 16 and it's time to
drive all automatically prints out so
that's how we can create a macro let's
go and create another one maybe to clear
some things up here a little bit more
now let is something else that is or can
be a little bit confusing or irritating
with all its parentheses so let's go and
have num1 and num2 and so if we wanted
to add all of these together we'd have
to go let some and then add together one
that's passed in and num2 that's passed
in and then format and then go num1 num2
and some so instead of using let in this
situation what I'm going to do instead
is define a macro to clean it up so I'm
going to go define macro I'm going to
call this let X and it's going to get
two values passed inside of here again
it's going to have the body section
let's kind of this be rest sorry about
that body section and then inside of
here define exactly what we're trying to
build so we're going to put let inside
of here which is what we want to show
and then we're going to put in those
double parentheses right here so we can
get rid of them whenever we're working
with our code and we put our variable
here the second variable value here and
then the body will then follow
afterwards like that now what we're
going to be able to do with our let's go
to create another function because let's
call it some track num1 and num2 and now
we'll be able to use let x2 define the
value for diff right here without all
those quotes because that's exactly what
let's doing it's basically taking this
value right here and assigning it to
this variable right here so in this
situation we got rid of all those quotes
and we're going to be assigning this
value right here to this variable right
there and then we can use exactly the
same format statement here except
instead
put diff inside of here instead of some
and change that to a minus sign and now
what we'll be able to do is go to
subtract ten and six and you can see
that that automatically worked and it's
a little bit cleaner looking and those
are just some you know just common
things that we use macros for just want
to give you a couple examples again go
in play with this stuff and you'll get
better and better and better so now a
lot of people don't realize that Lisp
actually can be used to create classes
and to create a class inside of here
because we call define class and let's
go and create one called an animal and
what we're going to do next is we're
just going to define the different
attributes we want for our animal class
so we want our animal class to have a
name and eat sound we can then come in
here and define and animal objects let's
call this dog and then to actually
create it we call make instance and then
animal we define the type of object we
want to create now if we want to set the
values for our new dog object we go set
up and we go slot value these are slots
and dog is what we want to change and
name specifically is what we want to
change and in this situation let's call
our dog object spot we're then going to
do the same thing pretty much for sound
and so if we want to change this to
sound and then we want to change this to
wolf there you go that's how we can set
as well as create dog objects you can
want to get the values from that dog
object pretty simple say something like
says and then to pass in those slot
values we just go to slot value the
objects name dog and then this specific
thing we want to get out of it and then
we could do the same thing for sound of
course so there we are just change this
to sound and then of course close that
off and you can see spots as wolf you're
also going to be able to define the
initialization so that it's a lot more
complex than this where there's
basically nothing being defined right
there and how we're going
do that with is with a whole bunch of
different keys so let's define a brand
new class fine class make this one a
little bit more complicated and this one
I'm going to call mammal I'm going to do
it pretty much the same exact way here
we'll define name and then here I'm
going to define the key that I want to
use to assign to this slot and that's
going to be name I could then come in
and define that I definitely want a
value if you ever create an instance of
mammal I definitely must have a value
provided for the name slot otherwise I
want to show an error and I can put
anything in here so I could say must
provide a name whenever we're creating
that and then close that off show you a
couple other different things we can do
as well and for sound again we want the
key to be associated with this to be
called sound we could also come in and
define a default value for our all of
our sounds and let's say that we want
that to be no sound and that's how we
would do that and we could also come in
and have things called getters and
setters automatically generated by doing
this is going to be the way we're going
to get in set is this guy right here but
by putting accessor inside of there
you're going to automatically generate
getters and setters you can change the
value for sound and do the same thing
for name of course and if you would only
want them to be able to get or read the
value you would put reader inside of
there if you would only want them to be
able to set you would type in writer but
for the most part you're going to use
accessor and those are ways that you can
expand on initializing your class now
what we're going to be able to do is
come in and define a parameter and let's
call this guy King Kong and we're going
to make an instance of the mammal so
we're going to say mammal and then we're
going to define the name which of course
is going to be King Kong that's how
that's where the name part this sort
right
right here comes in and then we're going
to define the sound in the same exact
way so sound and let's say we want this
to be whatever and there we go and
that's how we can initialize with all
these other nice little tricks we have
and of course we're going to need to
able to output all this information on
the screen King Kong says roar as you
can see right there of course if we
would have come in here and tried to
create a King Kong mammal without
providing a name it would have print
this error out on their screen you could
go and test that and try it out just to
make sure let's go and create another
mammal and let's call this guy fluffy
again you're going to do pretty much
exactly the same thing as we did here
with King Kong except this is going to
be called fluffy instead and we're gonna
have him say meow do a couple more
things with fluffy and you're basically
going to have things called generic
functions which are going to have a name
and a parameter list but no
implementation and the reason for this
is because in list methods don't belong
to classes but instead belong to generic
functions which are responsible for
executing the correct method based on
the data that was passed as you're going
to see here let's say let's define a
generic function define generic and
let's have this be make sound like that
and it's going to be passed a mammal now
what we need to do is define a method or
that and we'll call this make sound of
course because that's what the generic
has right here then inside of this we're
going to have the mammal which is
actually going to be the value or the
name that the mammal object is going to
get inside of our method and then we
need to define what type of object it is
it's a mammal and now we could come in
here and do pretty much what we had
right here so let's just copy that paste
that in there except in this situation
now we're going to be able to accept any
mammal and that's where the mammal part
right here comes from that right there
and there we go we can pass that in
there and now what we're going to be
able to do is no matter what object type
we're using or whatever object it is we
can call make sound and call King Kong
like that or we could call make sound on
fluffy and know that both of those will
work and I just forgot to put this one
parentheses there that
no big deal and I could see King Kong
says roar right here and fluffy says
meow
right there another thing we were
talking about how we were able to set
and get values we'd also be able to
define our own setters and getters and
we're going to do that again with
creating a generic function so defined
generic and here if we want to define
the setter we'll go set up and let's say
it's mammal name and then we would type
in value and then it would be the mammal
this would allow us then to go in and go
define method for this setter set of
mammal name value and then inside of
this we would put the mammal followed by
mammal which is the class type and then
inside of this function or this method
we go set up slot value la mammal which
is going to be the object the value that
we want to set and then the value we
want to give it so that's how we would
create that again we would create a
getter function in much the same way to
find generic mammal name and it's going
to be passed a mammal object and then
we'll define our method mammal name is
what the function is going to be called
or the method is going to be called the
mammal to find the object type for it
and then here it's going to be slot
value the mammal and the name for the
getter is going to be returned in that
situation what this is then going to
allow us to do is come in and go set up
and call mammal name like that pass in
the specific objects that we want to
change the name for and then inside of
it provide the value that we want to
change it to and you can see right here
mammal name where does that come from
well that comes from this guy so that's
the function we are actually calling
mammal name and what are we doing we're
passing an object inside of it and what
is that mammal it's a mammal type and
here we're going to have the value of
the the mammal and we're going to change
that kind of straightforward and just
wrap your head around it just play
around with it you'll get it and then of
course we're going to be able to call
mammal name again
and passing King Kong to get the getter
and you can see right there I am Kong
prints out on our screen now of course
for the sound class inside of here the
sound attribute er slot we said that we
automatically wanted the accessors
created for us and we wanted their name
to be a mammal sound like that so in
that situation we don't need to create
the getters and setters we can just go
ahead and use them and to use the
automatically generated getters and
setters which is what you're going to do
90% of the time you're just going to go
mammals sound make a call to that guy
and let's just have this be King Kong
like that and then inside of it we could
give it a new sound and then of course
you'd be able to print that out on our
screen just going like this and changing
this to mammal sound as you can see I've
printed out the new roar and pretty much
the only thing that I have left here is
to talk about inheritance and basically
inheritance is going to allow us to
automatically inherit all the attributes
of our superclass and then call methods
that are going to accept the superclass
so let's just come in here and go define
class and let's call this dog if you
want to inherit from the mammal class
for example you would just put mammal
right there and then you would follow
that up with two open parentheses and
there you go you just created a subclass
called dog of superclass type mammal you
could then come in and create a new dog
type let's call it R over and then make
instance like that and you want it to be
a dog type you want to define its name
as R over and you want to define its
sound as wolf and that's how easy that
is and now you can automatically use any
of the methods as well that will accept
mammals just make sure you call it R
over with the star and there you can see
Rover says wolf now let's take a look at
some data structures that are available
to us in Lisp and let's makes a lot of
sense to start off with arrays if you
want to create an array you can just go
create to define parameter and let's say
I want one called names and
gonna call make array three like this
there we go I made an array that's going
to hold three pieces of data we can then
add a value using set F and then we
would just go a re F names so I'm going
to make a reference to my names array
and in the first part of that array I'm
going to put in a symbol called Bob I
can then get a value from that index as
well a reference names and I can
specifically get the first item in that
array and I could come in here and go
format T and you can see Bob pops out on
the screen just like that can also make
multi-dimensional arrays as well so
let's say that I wanted to make a three
by three array this and just make array
and then inside of here define then I
want it to be three by three and you can
also come in and do initial contents of
the array right at the initialization so
for this guy going to have this and it's
going to be a three by three array so I
can just all I want to put a space in
between each of those and then space
between all of these as well and six
seven and eight and there we go we went
and made a three by three array and we
just want to close all those off and
there that is of course I'm going to be
able to cycle through and print out all
of these and let's just use two times
because that's about the easiest and so
I'm going to start off with value of X
I'm going to increment up to three for
this and then also do times throw a Y
inside of that increment up to three for
that and then let's just use print here
because that's the simplest array
reference number array is what I'm going
to be using and then I'm going to cycle
through and get the x and y index for
all those arrays I trust if you're
watching this you probably understand
indexes and how they work close that off
like that and we could use bad styling
and do that and and if we execute you
can see that those all print out so
that's a basic rundown of arrays and how
they work inside of lists now let's take
a look at hash tables which are a
collection of key value pairs and you're
going to
them in the same similar way in here
define parameter and let's say that I
want one called people and to make this
I go make hash table pretty simple now
I'm going to be able to set the keys for
these guys so I can say set up get hash
and go 102 people so I'm assigning or
making reference to the hash table
people here and I'm giving it this
specific key right here and then I can
just assign a value to it so let's say
I'll close that off say I want to put an
item inside of here that's going to be
Paul Smith added that inside of there
and of course we can go in add a whole
bunch more I'm going to keep it fairly
simple let's say that the next key is
going to be 3 and this is going to be
Sam Smith we can then get the values
stored in the 102 2 key if we'd like and
to do that we just go get hash and then
we would just type in whatever the key
is and then the hash table that I want
to be pulling that information from and
there you can see Paul Smith popped back
and then we could also use map hash
which is going to execute a function on
multiple items inside of a list like we
saw before so let's just say we want to
go map hash and the we want to run a
function so we have to put a number sign
and then a quote and let's just use a
lambda function here again we're going
to have keys and values for this guy and
what we're going to use for our function
is format T and then just to keep this
simple
is equal to just going to output the
keys and the values associated with
those keys and I can just go K and V and
that's going to go inside of there and
then at the end of this I can say people
is going to be the list that I want to
use you can refer to that meaning the
hash table as any other list with map
hash like that and there you can see we
pop through and we got all those
different guys we could also come in and
delete an item from this since I showed
you how to add them rym hash 103 from
the people hash
and that would delete it all right so
there's hash tables and arrays why don't
we go and take a look at strux
and its trucks basically a user-defined
data type that's going to have multiple
different data types inside of it and to
define one we just go define struct and
let's say we want it to be called
customer and we say we want each of
these to have a name and address and an
ID there you go you just create a
destruct we're going to be able to store
data inside of there quite easily just
set Q give it a name so let's say we
want it to be called Paul Smith Paul
Smith there we are and to make one we go
make customer and it knows what you're
referring to and then you use the
different keys to assign different
values to this struct we're working with
so we have name address and three main
and then finally let's give it an ID of
1000 and then we can close that off up
get rid of that right there that's the
reason why that went that way and there
we go
so there we went and put data or created
a custom struct we can get a value
stored inside of this as well just by
coming in here and saying customer name
and then pass in a specific one which is
going to be Paul Smith like that but
make sure that you have this closing
quote right here Paul Smith
and you can see Paul Smith popped back
right here and of course we're also
going to be able to come in here and
change the value and a struct and we're
just going to go set up and we'll go
customer address if you decided that
this guy moved so Paul Smith and then we
just go one two five main and stud and
there we go
and we could also go in and go right
Paul Smith and you can see it another
different way that we can output the
information and the struct on a screen
there's so many there's so many
different functions that are built into
Lisp it's unbelievable and we could also
come in here and make a struct let's say
I'm going to go Sally Smith and put a
special ID inside of here just for the
heck of it and make customer like
and then we come in and go name Sally
Smith pretty easy and she has an address
and let's have this be one to six main
and then give it the ID of the ID that
we put inside of there and then close
that off and of course you could come in
and print all that stuff out in exactly
the same way and basically the only
thing I haven't covered here is file i/o
if you wanted to write some piece of
information to a text file you would
just go with Open File and you would
type in my stream you're going to then
define inside of here the text file that
you want to write to and if it hasn't
been created it will be created for you
as long as you have permission of course
and we define the direction which is
going to be output we're going to output
to the file and then what if it exists
we're going to say super seed in this
situation there's a whole bunch of
different things you can do here with
output and I'm just providing the basics
here so that means it's just going to
overwrite anything that's in that file
and then for example we could come in
here and print something to it as well
with print see some random tux and write
it to my stream and there we go that's
how we could write to it and then we
could go and read data from it just go
let and we'll say in and we'll say open
and we'll define the file that we want
to read from we can say if does not
exist
well then nil you can see those all
closed off and when n does have some
values inside of it we're going to say
that we want a loop for line is equal to
and then we can read all that data out
of there by using read line until
there's nothing left or nil which is
basically what that means and then while
there is data from this that's going to
be coming out to us we want to say
format and let's say that we want to
print all that information out to the
screen all those lines of text that are
being read from that text file are going
to be stored inside of line they're
going to be printed out for us and then
after
we don't have anything left we will
close the input stream and then we will
close everything else you can see we run
that I was being silly and wrote right
open file I instead want that to be with
open file yes a long tutorial and I also
want to make sure I put a little
parenthesis right here after supercede
sorry about that
and if I run it you can see some random
text gets printed out there you go guys
there is a heck of a lot of information
about Lisp hopefully I covered
everything that you would ever want to
know about Lisp and if I didn't please
leave your questions and comments below
