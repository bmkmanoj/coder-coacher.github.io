tutorial on the basics of jQuery and
Ajax but believe me by the time you're
done you're going to know everything
about jQuery and Ajax and be a complete
expert so what exactly is Ajax there's a
lot of confusion that surrounds
asynchronous JavaScript and XML first
off
Ajax is not a programming language ageac
provides you with the ability to
communicate with your server pass
information back and forth from the
clients browser to the server update
your web pages content without reloading
the web page that's where the
asynchronous part comes in and for the
most part you should have no problem
using Ajax techniques if you understand
JavaScript that is what Ajax is it's
just a series of techniques used to talk
to the server and do multiple other
different things within the browser
without having to reload the web page so
how do people use Ajax they write
JavaScript code that is triggered to
perform some action when a certain event
occurs on the website when that event is
triggered javascript is used to get data
from the server using an object called
XML HTTP request I'll go more into this
object in the future the new information
is inserted into your web page without a
page reload this is called asynchronous
data retrieval the only negative is that
you can only pass XML or regular text
between the JavaScript code and the
server in addition you can use
JavaScript code to call PHP code to
receive information from a database and
I will cover that as well on the fly CSS
changes through JavaScript code is also
referred to as an ajax technique in the
future tutorials i'm going to teach you
ajax at the same time as i teach you
about jquery because they work very well
together so what exactly is jquery
jquery is a javascript framework or
javascript library it provides you with
ready-made functions that you can use to
perform common tasks in javascript if
you don't come from a programming
background what this means is that you
can reference the jQuery code and then
use all the functions it provides as if
you wrote them yourself so why do people
like jQuery it allows you to easily
perform complicated JavaScript tasks it
is cross browser this mean
that the jQuery functions will
automatically handle differences between
the many browsers out there it allows
you to easily modify individual nodes on
a web page and if you don't know what
I'm talking about
with nodes you need to see my JavaScript
scripting tutorial and it also allows
you to easily modify web page content
through the use of Ajax techniques
without reloading the page and also
jQuery + Ajax techniques provide you
with the ability to easily communicate
with the server without page reloads
jQuery comes packed with great animation
effects you can use on your web page
these effects work the same also on all
browsers jQuery is extensible being that
you can add more pre-built functions
with plugins jQuery is small and doesn't
noticeably increase page load time and
the jQuery library is completely free
and available at jQuery com so how
exactly do you access those functions in
the library all you do is download the
library from the website I mentioned
before and store it in a public location
on your web server you then can link to
the library with following line of code
which will be in your HTML page the
source attribute must contain the
location of the jQuery JS file and this
script tag needs to be located before
any of your other JavaScript code the
next tutorial I'm going to show you how
to select an edit elements in your web
page using jQuery and Ajax functions
before I leave you I'm going to show you
exactly what we're going to cover in the
next tutorial in the next tutorial I'm
going to show you how to make this page
and talk about all the code that is
behind it let's say I want to turn this
bold click button as you can tell the
screen did not reload I can count the
number of paragraphs I can delete this
whole entire div I can bring it back I
could change the text right here I can
make all of these individual paragraphs
the same I can change the style in this
paragraph right here I can mess around
with the last and make it italic I can
make the fourth paragraph blue I can
slide this guy up over top of the fourth
paragraph and I can add as many
paragraphs as I want
next time we meet I'll show you how I
made it till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
