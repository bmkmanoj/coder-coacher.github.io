42 of my java video tutorial series if
you didn't watch part 41 watch it now
there's a link above because I'm going
to continue to fiddle it off the code we
created in that part and underneath the
video all of the code that I have here
is available for you to do whatever you
want with it alright somebody kind of
improv through this because it's pretty
easy and this is our lesson 41 dot Java
file that we created last time
and here's web.xml which we created last
time you can't see this just view it
full screen HD video a couple things to
keep coming off project Explorer what
you see over here if you don't see that
click on window and then show view and
then click on project Explorer that's
all you need to do
and another thing keeps showing up is
you guys want to know how to start your
server all you got to do down here is
click on servers and then click on this
play button right here and that will
restart the server so the first thing
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build an HTML
file because what we're gonna be doing
is passing information from an HTML file
to this servlet and then doing
calculations passing all kinds of
information so what do we need to do
only need to come over here where it
says web content under project Explorer
and right click on it then we're gonna
go new and then we're gonna go HTML file
make sure you do this in web content and
this guy is gonna be cold
say hello dot HTML then I'm gonna click
on finish alright so now let's open up
say hello well there it goes that opened
itself up just basically just go through
here and explain what's going on not
gonna make that many changes though
inside of body which were right here I'm
going to create a form and forms by
default in HTML use the get method but
I'm going to use the post method not
that it was really gonna matter if you
set up everything right you can use
either one and then we're gonna go
action is equal to and then I'm gonna
point towards a location of my servlet
which is localhost e80 forward slash
lesson 41 and then forward slash don't
forget that forward slash close that off
get ourselves some space to start
playing around creating our form inside
here first thing I'm gonna say is what's
your name and then I'm gonna throw a
break statement after that I'm sure you
guys know HTML then we're just gonna put
in input name is equal to your name I'm
not copy this break statement throw
another break statement at the end of
that and I'm gonna ask it for a number
as well just copy all this right here
paste that in there
I'm gonna call this first Nam then we're
gonna go second number base that in
there and I'm gonna call this second
number then we're also going to pass a
hidden field over to this guy so like
that
and since it's a hidden field we're
gonna go type is equal to hidden and the
name is gonna be I'm gonna say language
and then let's say that we want to pass
over that this is using English just to
do something different and then of
course the last thing you need to do
with a form input type is equal to
submit and close that off and that's all
we need to do with our HTML file so
let's just file save that and if you get
any type of errors like null values are
being passed or something ances or you
forgot this forward slash so make sure
you remember that now I'm going to open
up web dot XML because there are some
changes I need to make inside of here
let's get rid of this so that we can be
more standards compliant and in this
situation we're gonna go servlet and
what this file in general does is it
states what servlets to deploy and where
they are located that's it it's not that
complicated so we're gonna need to say
what the servlet name is in this
situation I'm sure you know it's lesson
41 and then after that we have to define
class for the servlets or servlet class
and it is hello servlets died lesson 41
and if you're wondering where that's
coming from if we click on lesson 41 see
package right here hello servlet so
that's where that's all coming from and
then the name of the class itself is
less than 41 let's jump back over in
here again now I need to define exactly
what the URL location is for this
servlet so servlet mapping we're gonna
come up here and it's always better to
tab these in here so it's a little bit
easy to read and then we're just gonna
go to servlet name again and this is
going to be a lesson 41 come down here
and then URL pattern and it just means
that what servlet to call whenever a
person goes to a certain URL which is
gonna be localhost lesson 41 right like
that and there you are you're done with
that so now web dot XML is fixed now
we're gonna jump back in the lesson 41
and fix this guy out so we don't really
have to change that many different
things inside of here what we are gonna
do a lot of changes in is going to be in
the do get method that we have right
here remember this is called whenever
the form is using the method get but
also it's gonna work if they use host
and I'm actually going to verify that
right now I'm just going to go do post
like this I'm just gonna go
request/response
there you go with that one little
addition now this is going to work for
both post requests as well as get
requests I'm been able to leave pretty
much everything else here exactly the
same except we're going to add couple
new features because we're going to have
to process some information so one thing
we're gonna process is a strength and so
I'm gonna create a new string called
user's name as equal to and if you want
to get the value for a parameter in a
form all you have to do is type in
request dot getparameter and then type
in the name of that element inside of
the form for your HTML page we click
over here you're gonna see exactly what
that is say your name right here this is
what we're getting so we're gonna be
able to come in here and just copy this
because we're gonna grab a couple other
things while we're at it we're also
gonna grab the language so I'm just
gonna go the line and then the only
thing we need to change here is language
and I'm just playing around here I
thought it would be good to put
uppercase letters just so you know that
you can use uppercase letters then we
were getting past numbers well if we
want to perform an addition for say
we're going to have to convert those
numbers because everything that gets
passed to this guy is gonna be passed as
a string so you don't remember integer
parse int and then we're gonna do pretty
much the same exact thing and then we're
gonna have to come in here and type in
first num and then put a semicolon at
the end so what this is gonna do is it's
gonna get the value for first num which
is a string it's gonna convert it into
an integer and and save it into this guy
now we're gonna do exactly the same
thing for second num and your blah blah
blah blah and then this is called second
nom on the HTML page and there you go so
now you got that and then let's say we
want to go some oh no and we want to
just add those two things together so
we'll just go first num plus second home
right like that this is how we perform
just basic operation for us now our
response is still going to be an HTML
text so we can leave that exactly as it
is we're still going to need the
capability to be able to write out to
the browser just like we did last time
so we're gonna leave that exactly the
same way I think we're really gonna be
doing here is changing a couple things
right here so what are we gonna do well
we're gonna go hello like that and then
we're gonna actually type in the
person's name which is users name just
like we defined right up here so that's
good now we're gonna close that off try
to keep this a little bit neat copy this
paste that on there
of course but our double quotes inside
of there in this situation I'm gonna
throw a little break statement inside of
their double quotes and then I'm gonna
go Plus first numb I'm gonna put a plus
sign their quotes and inside of this I'm
gonna show the calculation that was made
like this and then second numb like that
and that'll be the end of that output
print line err I'm gonna go equals plus
some own um plus and I can put my quotes
inside of here close that off throw
another break statement inside of it and
then we're also going to say speaks plus
the line which is going to be the
language that the person's gonna be
speaking again plus and close that off
right like that and like I said this guy
right here if they use a post method
it's automatically getting shot up here
and it's automatically going to do all
our work for us let's save everything we
look down here we see the Tomcats
running click on say hello right click
on it and then go open with web browser
it's gonna open directly inside of here
and I got an error of course let's just
go do get sorry about that what happens
when I completely improv these guys so
let's kill this right in here
everything's saved and now let's run it
again open with web browser name three
four submit and there you see hello
Derrick pops up on the screen three plus
four is equal to seven and I speak
English remember all the code is
available underneath I also have a link
underneath the video for you guys to get
the opportunity to vote for my next
tutorial leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
