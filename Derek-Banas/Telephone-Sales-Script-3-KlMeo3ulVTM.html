of my telephone selling presentation by
all means most definitely should watch
the last two videos if you found
yourself here there are links provided
below to those videos because otherwise
this isn't gonna make any sense but for
people who have seen the other tools
let's move on
what are they telephone you never want
to ask for permission if you're acting
in the clients best interest why ask if
you can help
I'm fusing that analogy did you see
somebody who's stuck in a train track
and a train is coming in for them once
you take the time to yell to them do you
need help
absolutely don't pass would be okay if
we meet onto this very large scale if
you do this then this is true of
everybody if you ask for permission in
this way 98% of people you talk to
everybody you have to assume you will
provide better products and/or services
that your competitor at all avoid
questions that don't have a yes or no
answer if you're not sure you can help
why are you even wasting this person's
time and calling them successful
salespeople do not ask for prevention
why do we do this anyway because fight
through you we're taught to ask for
permission that's where it all comes
from this scale right here this skill to
not ask permission will be the most
difficult skill for you to develop in
your brain you're gonna stay here so
you're gonna make
uses above being complaint know if
you're trying to help somebody it is the
difference this one skill here's some
additional edge tips all employees must
have they own on here Eddie buries
nothing to keep that conical on here
on your desk you should have a script
leads pen drink and telephone that's it
the phone should never leave your ear if
you have a headset obviously you're just
gonna but if you have a regular normal
telephone there's no reason for the
telephone leader here just hit the
disconnect button dialing in an auto
dialer tracking system is definitely
worth the employer keep a scoreboard
every time somebody makes a sale or get
some appointment write it up there cheer
for everybody that's fun that's a
Briana's fear never leave the desk
before you why is this great because you
have to in the bathroom just think of
how much that's gonna push it and really
make that appointment or sale so I mean
it's just little little tips don't blind
yourself dumb people we were honored
where when you did just get out of this
you're all do don't also book an
appointment more than three days in
advance because so likely that
somebody's going to cancel if you give
them longer than that so what are you
doing a general call come let's say you
mailed something out to somebody will
follow up with it obviously paying
attention to the new call of laws I'll
let you look at it I suppose you would
you simply say there's my call is
recently we mailed you some information
regarding Larry's we may have seen that
right they say no fine
I understand well let me check my
information to make sure I'm talking to
the right person is this mr. Paul Jones
again establish the SF Paul I have an
information for you and I will be
providing an on Tuesday or Wednesday
this week which works best for you
what objection get almost every single
time
well I don't I don't why don't you just
mail that's what everybody's gonna say
almost always in this circumstance I set
them up well Paul I tried that once
before you didn't get it I wouldn't want
that to happen again and then you follow
up with me for clothes store and it all
public key what's caught in the
double-bond here's some additional
scripts this is what I use for debt
consolidation hello Bob yes yes we've
set up for you to be receiving our news
right yes and you'll live a
one-two-three Main Street varieties yes
and then some it's for PA right yes it's
just a simple yes set they follow up
with I'm not interested well I apologize
if I was going too fast just simply
assume people love they think your life
long simply say I'm well I apologize if
I was going too fast everyone I would
talk with once to not pay interest on
their credit cards right what am I doing
here establishing the bandwagoning
principle I forgot to tell you we will
allow you to do exactly what you want
I'm establishing what's called a
consistency principle will allow you to
transfer all of your balances and not
pay interest on those either that would
make you happy right again establish the
F set yes I just need to verify and then
go into the rest of your presentation
if you're trying to sell small products
this is a fine way to go
well Paul yes hi this is Eric ban from
Sports Illustrated how are you doing
today pretty good yes yes we called the
verify some information to make sure we
catch your magazine to your house your
name is Paul challenged right yes
interested we understand you're looking
sick money right yes again I'm letting
them off almost like in an apology way
as I did before all our customers are
like you again Stanley that's why we now
are going to give us sign for 75 cents
dollar 15 an issue that you pay now
again establishing consistency principle
I just need to verify and then follow
through current customer call hi
Marianne yes this is Derek man's from
ABC insurance how are you doing today
pretty good yes yes our customers like
you couldn't save you made a lot of
money with us their ham we won't
apologize for not getting to you sooner
and bandwagoning but we found a program
that will save money and next week I'll
be meeting with your neighbors again
bandwagon are you a morning or afternoon
yes we'll meet at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday
or 5:00 p.m. and Thursday which works
best for you
again stretch top tried tested mortis
but how do I get to the secretary if you
leave a message just your name number
and then simply say hey mr. secretary
everybody could use a smile could you
try a little smiley face on that note we
found that this would give us a 30
percent increase in returned calls from
said boss why because it was the only
note the smiley face on it did the
secretaries normally follow through with
this it seemed so there's just a quick
tip getting through the secretary again
mr. secretary I think desperately trying
to keep in touch with the boss for weeks
I could really use your help what would
you suggest I do get a few minutes of
stuff people don't do this to
secretaries they are caught off guard
and really they wanna come she would say
who is calling you could simply say I'm
a salesperson with XYZ I promise I'll
just challenge you until I can speak
with mr. boss you can help me with that
just a little bit economy we tried and
all of these just so happen
if they ask what is this my first step
well we are predicting personalized
brochures for you and we were wondering
what bothers you - I'm Phil eliminate in
your office except for salespeople like
Maine again something that we tried and
it worked if you see you also must
remember that if you sent the first
you're trying to get a hold of a direct
mail or letter you do have the right to
say they are expecting my call this is
another tip for getting through when
should you call between 7 a.m. and 8
a.m. or from 5:15 p.m. to 7 p.m.
gives us best results try calling a sub
supervisor purchase manager or anyone
any decision-making power at all who's
underneath the boss and then referencing
their name say something like hi mister
boss this is Eric Vanis I was talking to
where the sub supervisor is and I owe
you this much when you call me I'll feel
ya
these are answering ECU messages another
one you could use this hi mr. faucitt
stearic dance I was calling again sub
supervisor and you were right will you
call me on pillow or time mr. boss is
there yes I appreciate what you have
done please give me a call I'd like to
talk personally you would use this last
one if you saw a notification regards to
the newspaper and that is basically the
presentation on telephone sales if you
have any questions feel free to comment
below thanks for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
