I am playing around here
Internet if anybody can see me that
would be very useful if you would say
something in the chat system if at all
possible playing around with new
streaming software trying to do
something I've never done before and if
anybody's out there I'll be really
awesome if you could help me out and
send me a message YouTube says I am
streaming let's see good yes streaming
you are live all right cool
sorry for not informing everybody I was
doing this ahead of time I've been
really sick and I wanted to stick to my
schedule where I have a video every
Saturday and every Wednesday but I've
been really sick yay somebody answered
her hey cool so um what I wanted to do
was to upload a basically do a live
stream and see what you guys want me to
do for tutorials awesome okay so and
everything looks good so what I have
over here
hello everybody what I have over here on
the left side of this screen
it's basically everything that everybody
asks for on a regular basis awesome
thank you guys for telling me that I'm
out there do I sound ok you know tell me
if I'm messing something up because I
normally don't do this sort of stuff
you're very welcome
what I have here on the left side of the
screen is all of the things you guys
have been requesting for like the past
year or more and what I want to try to
do is narrow down and decide what I
should do next
and what I can do here is sort of give
you an idea um awesome everybody can see
me good what I have here what I
highlighted are the types of things that
I was planning on doing with Python and
ok so I see a game maker tutorial
alright so I see that's this one and
basically see when I'm having a hard
time a lot of you guys don't know what
what goes into these tutorials sorry
about the delay on the chat if it seems
sort of weird I will try to fix that
next time into a live stream I'm using
OBS someone's cold yes OBS and this is
the first time I'm using it so sorry if
it's thanks Rome doing a bad job
well basically whenever I try to do
tutorials I'm just want to give you a
sort of a mindset of what where I am so
that you guys understand and then also
to get your input basically I'd like to
do a pie cutie tutorial now a pie cutie
tutorial is something that a lot of
people have asked for and it is
extremely easy to install on Windows but
it is an absolute pull your hair out
situation to install it on Mac and Linux
for some really ridiculous reason so I
could go that route but you know you see
the potential types of problems we have
there kivi is similar why do you guys
want Python library tutorials and please
tell me which types and once you have
you guys it just posed as stuff like
crazy guys are funny so basically yeah
so just post what you want to see here
on in the chat system and then I'll sort
of go through it and I will tally up a
score and I just wanted like the
hardcore type of fans that like watch me
to have input on all of my my videos
because you guys control me I wouldn't
be doing Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons videos right
now if I didn't get a whole bunch of
requests to do them um also I get a lot
of requests for a gimp tutorial and you
guys want me to do vegan tutorials no
the reason I haven't been doing vegan
tutorials is I ran out of ideas so and a
whole bunch of people are asking me for
candy tutorials I don't know about that
but so basically what I'm doing is just
asking you guys for you know your
requests here today on what you want me
to do and I guess I'll just tally up
whatever gets the the most requests in
the in the chat system um there's a
Django tutorial
and all of those different things all
right cool let's see if I can enlarge
this so that it looks a little bit
better without breaking everything else
there we are
look it looks a little bit better you
guys are very very welcome so basically
this is everything that I have here and
I'm just wondering if there's anything
really that I am missing or or anything
else that you guys would like me I'm
seeing a lot of the same sort of things
that I have here all right
all right cool stuff so yeah and if you
guys alright so basically what I'm gonna
do as you can tell I've been really sick
so I haven't really planned out what I
was gonna do with this to this tutorial
asides from this there's more go laying
tutorials and angular to neural networks
magnetic needles what that means or
whatever and you guys can also feel free
to you want to do and ask me anything I
keep saying that pop up here I didn't
ask me anything a while back and I'd be
happy to I just took some nyquil so my
throat is cool until the nyquil wears
out so that's the reason why I didn't do
a tutorial today I already did a vegan
cheese tutorial umm how to catch the
biggest fish I am a horrible fisherman
how to vote justly old if you want to
know how to vote for something just
leave a comment and I will tally up
every request in this tutorials you know
in the comment system and that is how I
will decide what I'm going to do next
but to put the to seeing a lot of neural
network stuff artificial intelligence
stuff okay
MATLAB seen a lot of MATLAB tutorials or
requests really surprised by that
all right cool beans
all right you guys are basically doing
everything that I that I was hoping that
you would do all right so this is really
cool I guess this is what's awesome
about having 500,000 subscribers so I
would personally wanted to thank you all
for subscribing I can't believe I have
as many subscribers as I have that is
like ridiculously cool and okay so you
guys are requesting a whole bunch of
things everybody's had lately been
asking for ask me anything type of
things ask me anything
what do you want to know about me I
haven't done it asked me anything and
forever and a day so feel free to ask me
anything you want to know and I'll be
more than happy to answer any questions
that you guys have sitting here waiting
for a question sorry I have to drink
water because my voice is terrible when
sorry if I'm doing this in an
unprofessional way I normally don't do
live streams but I might change that
someday
hmm okay I'm just sitting here reading
all your chat and all your chat things
and we twirl and I have a tutorial on
how I make tutorials it's called
something like how I make youtube videos
thank you guys for all of the
compliments I greatly greatly appreciate
them how old am I am 41 am would be 42
in December how I got into programming
is I won a science competition I made a
VR system and I got hired by Apple and I
was a horrible I was a grunt programmer
at Apple I wasn't a big deal that was
back in the days when Steve Jobs wasn't
even at Apple um okay a lot of MATLAB
requests my next tutorial is gonna be
whatever you guys request basically I
should drink warm water ah my full-time
job I mainly focus on shopping card
applications and Android development
I basically was self taught how to
program because thirty years ago when I
started programming there were no books
so there was really no option
I do use Linux I I don't know how to say
it I guess it's not dual boot I I'll
just say dole but I dual boot on my
Macintosh Windows 10 Ubuntu and
obviously OSX
see felicity Toros all right you guys
are just posting stuff like crazy this
is cool
and thing how long does it take for a
beginner to master programming um
everybody's different and that's hard to
that's really hard to say in this day
and age it's extremely easy what I think
a lot of people make a mistake about in
trying to learn today's they're not
taking advantage of all the
opportunities that are out there so I'll
be the first one to tell you that if you
want to learn you shouldn't just learn
from my tutorials you should learn from
numerous different video tutorials
numerous different books take advantage
of what is out there and if it's
something doesn't start to make sense
for you just switch to a different
tutorial haven't I've been in the same
room as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the
same time but I had no very little I
didn't talk to either of them it was
forever ago hmm
social engineering I have a whole bunch
of tutorials on what is called NLP look
in my on my channel and look for
psychology videos I have a whole bunch
of stuff on that road and stuff yeah
this is my cheap soundproofing things I
moved recently and that's I got this
stuff I forget how much this cost
I think it cost about 50 bucks I don't
know something like that I it is very
easy to learn a whole bunch of different
programming languages if you will learn
very very well one object-oriented
programming language and one functional
programming language than the rest of
really easy to learn
so I'm nothing special I'm not
particularly smart but I do know
multiple languages first language I ever
learned was basic because I started off
with a trs-80 and the only option really
with the trs-80 was to use basic my
hobbies basically are hanging out with
my kids and my wife and making video
tutorials and I run a lot
I run running as one of my my hardcore
things that I do I didn't run a lot
that's the only reason why I'm not like
huge is because I run so much
artificial intelligence languages I mean
to start off you could start off with
Python but probably more than likely you
want to go the c++ direction in regards
to that
and
I don't know much about elm yes I do
know are ours a really kind of a tough
language to learn and it's sort of hard
to mmm
I could definitely teach it but it
doesn't seem like there's that much in
regards to requests for me to cover it
is there any videos that are any
tutorials that I could do that I don't
have lifted listed over here on the left
side of screen anything like that yes
there's ageism in the id industry I
think I don't know if it's ageism I just
think that it's better
there's ageism in like so many and I'm
not complaining about this by the way
I'm just saying um there's ageism in a
lot of different industries like for
example somebody my age trying to get a
job as a stockbroker it's like good luck
because you know that's one awesome
thing about being 20-some years old is
that you can you can work more hours
than a person like me I might be able to
I might be able to be more efficient but
I don't have sort of the gusto that is
very very important how much do I run at
my highest level of running I used to
run 13 miles a day every single day and
now I'm down to especially because of
how hard it's been
I'm down to averaging 9 miles per day
now I run every every day so it's just
my thing
it's something I've conditioned my body
to do um here you want to just saw some
random things you want my opinion on
what are the best running headphones and
I have a ton of them I have a bazillion
of them I was loved that's gonna do if
nobody was on here in my opinion and
I've used everything I've used I have
stuff that I don't even have here these
are Jabra these are terrible head
Jabra sport pace these are terrible I
broke these I sweat a lot because I run
so much and I broke these in three weeks
so those are garbage I broke these LG
HBS's these tone headphones I broke
those I think they lasted three months
the j-bird these are supposed to be like
indestructible
I broke those in three months just from
sweating and in my opinion I know they
get a ton of bad press and that's why I
didn't buy them and this is definitely
not sponsored because you know nobody's
gonna sponsor me the powerbeats are the
best so far they've lasted me over five
months so I don't know just random
things some tips on running this is cool
now I can talk about some random things
tips on running what's the most
important thing I learned about running
this is a weird one you're not gonna see
this one coming if you run a lot you're
going to get what is called and excuse
me from if this is like offensive to say
but I'm just gonna say it anyway if you
run a lot you are going to get nipple
chafing I don't care if you're a man or
you're a woman so my number one tip on
running is to get what's this stuff
called next care waterproofing first aid
tape waterproof first aid they all hear
this I have lots of this stuff this
stuff so there you go
that'll solve that problem for you ah as
for running I'm not even joking about
that as per running the thing to do is
to take it slow and if you just walk
them for I think the quantity of time
you spend is more important than the
speed and especially I think new runners
the biggest mistake they make is that
they try to hurt themselves for some
unknown reason they try to run too fast
and
and yes nipple cherry is the worst ever
so buy that tape or something like it
basically I would say that you should
take if you want to really get serious
into running you should first off
especially if you don't have any
experience with it because you're gonna
hurt yourself is to say I'm gonna walk
for an hour and then to slowly increase
your time that you spend or slowly
increase your speed over time and there
was a guy that did a a video on that let
me see if I can find it here walking
sorry about this and trying to find the
trying to find the guy Jeff Galloway
this guy in my opinion is and you don't
have to you can find out about it
basically Jeff Galloway is the guy you
don't have to sign up for one of his
programs or anything like that if you
just look on the tutorial or on the
internet you can find it and basically
what it does is it just slowly trains
your body to run by walking and then you
run as long as you can you start to get
out of breath and then you run a little
bit more and that's the how I got into
running and then you want to try and
land on your on the front of your foot
when you run you don't want to land on
your heel you want to get yourself some
good equipment I use Brooks glycerin 13
or the running shoes I use but
everybody's feet are different so it's
just whatever is the most you know the
most comfortable for you and some some
running stores will get you good running
you know stuff um you don't need
expensive running clothes well this is
here I'll show you the best stuff I got
here you go sorry about that
all right you want to know what I run in
because the running equipment is
extremely expensive not for me I use
Game Gear shorts these costs I think $10
see these things these cost like $10
I've worn these for like over a year and
a half they look brand-new it's 10 bucks
they wash they're awesome
and Tesla shirts these cost like 10
bucks also they are Tesla shirt so I
don't think they have anything to do
with a car company and they're like 10
bucks so there you go don't buy the
Brooks and underarms or stuff and it's
just overly expensive in my opinion and
there's alternatives to Under Armour
stuff out there
I think Nike shoes are terrible I don't
like Nike shoes yeah you can run naked I
guess if you'd like to but I'm not
kidding some truffle hair I'm not ever
gonna do hacking tutorials I don't need
to get in trouble with the law and I and
I just don't know that stuff anyway I
mean at one point I used to know it and
now I I don't I think Lisp is a great
language to learn because it'll make you
a better programmer but aside from that
you know there's not that many people
out there doing Lisp programming but it
is a great language to learn just to be
able to get become a better programmer
I mean Lisp has been around for forever
for good reasons
oh um I just wrote tests because I
didn't know if this streaming software
would work so sorry about the confusing
tutorial name there if that confused
anybody
and algorithm tutorials I was planning
on doing algorithm tutorials with Python
I haven't decided if I'm gonna do that
yet and I'm basically gonna tally the
votes up that you guys leave in the
comment section it's sort of depend to
determine where I'm going
typescript is next so that is the next
tutorial it should be up on Wednesday
and then the reason I couldn't record is
I lost my voice because I had a really
really bad cold no my eyes don't almost
never hurt from programming
I prefer Java over C++ but it's mainly
just because I use Java more than C++
C++ is a great language as well and that
this is all my opinion so for whatever
that counts for
with three Olympic events what I wanted
to yes I'm a vegan but I may be once
every couple months I might eat shrimp
it's like cuz I'm not a technical vegan
it's just that's the only thing that I
cheat on I can do a gumbo recipe that
doesn't have sausage in it my kids love
love that so I might eat a piece of
shrimp whenever I do that but aside from
that yeah I don't eat dairy I don't eat
cheese and it's not it's for health
reasons how do I keep my eyes healthy I
don't know I don't do particularly
anything I go to the eye doctor once and
then every year and a half the easiest
language to learn as a beginner is
Python without it out it's hard for you
to get up I can tell you one thing one
thing that made it hard for me to to be
completely active all day and night and
it was coffee or caffeine I absolutely
love coffee and caffeine but once I
stopped drinking coffee and caffeine in
general I found that I overall
throughout the day had much more energy
and never got tired that worked for me
and I think everybody's body is
different so there's that
so just try different things out there
for your Ernie for you all right
cool thank you guys so much for voting
on what you want to see it really really
really really is gonna help and I am
gonna go through every single one of
these comments and I'm gonna answer
every single one of them any time
everybody anybody ever asked what's my
favorite color I always say neon pink
but I have two girls so a little bit
weird how to get good at programming
just write lots and lots of programs and
get good at learn things like
object-oriented design algorithms design
patterns things like that and write lots
and lots of lots of programs yes I make
shopping carts and Android applications
how long did I go off a coffee before I
saw a dramatic change definitely within
a week you vote for what you want to see
and it doesn't have to be this stuff
over here it can be completely new
things that I'll do tutorials on
anything except for playing musical
instruments because I do not know how to
do that but mostly anything else I will
do a tutorial on first language to study
in my opinion Python
I'm definitely not running for president
if you in regards I saw a question about
debugging in regards to debugging I
found that I would end up wasting a lot
less time debugging if I spend a lot
more time in the beginning to creating
use case descriptions which is just a
long list of what the program needs to
do and then sequence diagrams and if you
the more time you spend planning your
program in the beginning before you ever
write a single line of code is going to
cut down dramatically on your debugging
time my opinion on that
I am debugging I'm spent very very
little time debugging if I spend a lot
of time creating sequence diagrams
yeah if you guys would like to meet his
livestream something I don't know more
fun than this I'm open for it
I don't know languages very well either
um spoken languages was that I swear I
saw something about IKEA on here
no I don't fit Java zone okay for
beginners language but it's not
something that I would his Java better
than C++ yes but I think pythons better
language what's my favorite thing to eat
um pizza no doubt that's my favorite
I am definitely open to doing more
cooking tutorials but currently I can't
think of anything to do tutorials on I
I'll do the gumbo tutorial because I'm
probably gonna make that for my kids so
I'll do that for you guys since I've
been seeing that a lot already did a
Scala tutorial
I already did know jazz tutorials
thank you guys for of all these comments
this is really really cool I wish I
could see you guys program should I
write as practice write programs that
you are interested in do fun stuff
program is about doing fun things it
shouldn't feel bad do you have any
special pattern for eating like umm yes
I eat vegan pizza
I get vegan cheese I get that deal yeah
my daughter is a lactose-intolerant
so we are both eating that Emma Watson
or Emma Stone I think I know that those
are one of those harmony grains her from
sorry I'm old
hello Brazil hello Portugal yes this is
my home I recently moved
wrote a sports prediction program and
there are people that are swearing now
mm-hmm yes I've used Xcode yes I used to
make iOS applications I mainly do
programming Trump Android tutorials now
but I'd be open to doing iOS tutorials
if you guys really wanted to see that I
can definitely do those Hillary are
Trump I will not vote for either one so
that's my opinion on that I drink water
in the morning this is has to be like
the strangest asked me anything ever I
drink water with ice that's what I drink
every morning I drink water with ice all
day long all right oh I'll put a spawn
here I don't get that requests very
often that's why I don't have it on the
list
hello India India I think is a second
most popular country that watches my
videos which is really really cool
I don't know about cybersecurity that's
not really my thing I can look into it
what score did you wow
craziest programming experience I once
I'm gonna say who I worked for what we
did but basically one time I worked for
a company in which we were working very
very extreme hours and a lot of people
started to have developed things called
cluster headaches which are you get
nosebleeds all kind you can look up
cluster headaches it's extremely painful
and we were working such ridiculous
hours that basically people were getting
developing cluster attics from the hours
we were working that was the craziest
thing that I ever did and that was when
I was young remember I said when you're
20 people can get you to do crazy
ridiculous things and they got me to do
crazy ridiculous things when I was 20
Wow thank you for all the questions here
a lot of the stuff is sort of the same
type of things I've already asked for a
little Finland I can't believe people
from other countries watch my videos I
still can't believe it
the sound dampening equipment Sam in a
weird type of room and there was some
echoing LD everybody always asked me
what headphones I wear and I'm sorry if
this hurts your ears these are game calm
playing tronics headphones that's
whatever and IA haven't in bought
different microphones because people
always tell me my voice sounds good so
that's the reason why I don't I don't
invest in that my age is 41 I'll be 42
in December
I keep seeing people pop game tutorials
actually if you look in my job a
tutorial around part 50 I juice make a
Java game and I'm constantly thinking
about doing tutorials on games I just
haven't done it yet
sorry if is a boring yes I always we're
running oh oh how I dress yes I dress
like this all the time that's one
awesome things about being self-employed
this is normally the way I dress I wear
running shirts that are really really
comfortable and I wear khaki pants and
I'll see you soon I wear these pants
like khaki shorts all the time and then
I wear the clothes that you saw before
hello Korea kind of things do you do
maintain focus while programming um
basically if I get I normally keep
multiple different projects running at
the same time and if I get bored with
one project I move on to the other
project that's why I never get bored
best animation software sorry I do not
know
um I would do adobe tutorials but I
don't have any of the updated software
all my software is old so that's why I
haven't done any more of those already
did a Lua tutorial done tutorial on
being self-employed the most important
thing is to manage your time or manage
your money and your time but if you're
ever going to get if you're ever going
to start your own business that's the
biggest mistake I see people spend a ton
of money up front and then they thinking
that their first idea is probably going
to be successful and the opposite is
normally true your first idea is
normally a massive failure as is your
second third fourth fifth and sixth and
by the time you get to your seventh or
eighth idea which is probably going to
be popular you run through all your
money so always manage your money well
if you are running your own business
that's the tip I could give you jet
plane designs fire I don't know anything
about that how do I find clients um
basically I approach people and I asked
them if they'd like me to build them a
shopping cart for free and then I get
paid a percentage of the profits pretty
simple
I have tutorials on how to increase your
sales abilities as well on my channel
and I think they're the best sales
tutorials because I don't try to sell
anything in them as silly as that is but
they've ranked horribly on YouTube
because there's tons of people on
YouTube who make sales videos and and
you know there's scams in my opinion
I think my my sales tutorials are pretty
good but I made them forever ago but the
sales of sales nothing changes I could
do a unity tutorial I'm not gonna do 3d
print game development until I do 2d
hobbies I make videos on YouTube that's
my big Abhiyan and playing the kids and
that's basically my hobbies
I look like Stuart from Big Bang Theory
don't know if that's a compliment I'm
guessing it isn't how did I decide to
make tutorials um a long time ago I was
gonna start a a company that very very
inexpensively could get people I have
people develop skills that would get
them a job so for example web design
sales so forth and so on and it failed
and for example when I say cheaply there
were like six weeks courses eight-week
courses that the person would probably
have to spend $100 to take all the
classes included like every single class
and so yeah cheap but that idea failed
and so I basically just started doing
video tutorials so from the beginning
that was the goal that's why I think
it's so awesome when people post that I
help them get a job because that was the
original idea TV what do i watch me and
my wife watch things we never watch
anything live we always end up watching
normally Netflix or Hulu and the last
thing we watched was the first season of
Fargo which was awesome
loved it and I like I like the the
preacher it's a little bit you know um
my wife hasn't watched that yet
we've been watching we what III don't I
we watch series the whole way through
and then we quit but most of the stuff
that I watch gets cancelled me and my
wife were watching brain-dead which I
loved that's been cancelled every time I
like a show it gets cancelled life on
Mars got canceled freaks and geeks got
canceled Pushing Daisies got cancelled
I'm naming like all my favorite TV shows
ever like almost every single one of
them got cancelled so those are the type
I like really weird tutorials
mr. robot yeah watch the first season
haven't watched anything since yeah you
can be a programmer for forever no I do
not smoke marijuana actually I think I
might be allergic to it because I had a
roommate in college that did it and I've
never I can honestly say right hand over
got our right hand over my heart that
I've never done it but I don't look down
on anybody that may do it
I'm just me personally I I don't do I
like anime I used to but I haven't
really watched it lately yes I've seen
all the Sherlock's Firefly never quite
got into sorry if I offended anybody
fire fight I have to go look at Firefly
again because it definitely fits into
the type of things that I should be
interested in so maybe I could really
get into it second season of mr. robot
went south yeah that's what I've heard
that's why I haven't bothered to watch
the second season yet I personally
prefer cheese pizza but I eat fake
cheese because my daughter's
lactose-intolerant and I'm vegan so
there's that I really like the jetbrains
IDs yes Twin Peaks was ridiculously
awesome anybody that follows my videos I
constantly put all sorts of things about
Twin Peaks in my videos so yeah I think
it's pretty well known that I'm a huge
fan of fun Peaks
if you want to get good at programming
mode first off I don't really think it's
a great skill to be able to program in
multiple different languages I'd much
rather be extremely good at one or two
languages which I I really am I mean
there's a core like five languages that
I use all the time and the other ones
are just basically first side projects
learn Haskell and learn Java if you
learn Haskell and Java well you'll be
able to learn any other language so easy
um I'd be open to doing vlogs but like
you can say I'm not really something
this isn't something that I normally do
so there's that yes I played video games
but I mainly play like indie games like
don't starve and think shank things like
that yes I watched the flash TV show I
was a hardcore flash fan of comics when
I was younger and I thought it was
alright I don't know the whole love
triangle thing was sort of weird I used
to always think the awesome thing about
the flash was that it could be so dark
I'm talking about the comic here it
could be really really funny and then
switch over and be really really dark
and I wish they would've did more of
that in the series but the series in
general was pretty good especially
whenever zoom beat up the flash in a
second series the second season I really
liked that
mainly don't start right absolutely love
don't start one of my favorite video
games of all time
what's my favorite language um mmm
sorry that's irritating everybody might
have a sore throat what's the best book
to learn Pearl I think it's called
learning Pearl is the best I have a
CoffeeScript tutorial already don't
really could use CoffeeScript that much
but I have used it and some people
really like it why am i vegan um mainly
I I did started to know I don't swim I
don't know how to swim very well
actually mainly I start about the ALMS
mainly I was I saying oh okay
whenever I decided to hardcore run I
started it started to really change the
way that I ate because it started
getting like acid reflux every time I
ate anything kind of weird and sometimes
things they don't weren't that weird and
I discovered that if I ate spaghetti
that that was like the greatest thing
for me to eat and I could run faster and
longer if I ate spaghetti so I I do eat
a lot of carbs and I also discovered
personally again I'm talking about my
own metabolism here and I'm not talking
about your metabolism but personally if
I ate fat large quantities of fat anyway
that it actually slowed my it made it
harder for me to run so I progressively
start eating healthier and healthier and
then eventually I just went pure big and
then my like I said my three-year-old
daughters lactose-intolerant so I so
that's it
and that's why I'm vegan
to digital
lose weight it's very easy to lose well
it's very simple to explain how to lose
weight cut down on the calories that you
consume that's the only way you lose
weight if you consume less calories you
will lose weight that's it so that's the
way the body works all these fad diets
or just that fads in me I don't even
know if I could say my opinion that's
that's just a doggone truth sorry I
don't know the best language to get a
job easily in Canada I still think Java
is the most popular language for sort of
high-end corporate jobs but to increase
your odds of getting a job there's a
heck of a lot more web developers out
there so if you get really good with a
language like PHP I think that would
probably be the best PHP that's the way
I would go what's a shopping cart you
know like an online store and I have
tutorials in which I show how to make
basic online stores for nothing so
there's the how to get a job easily in
Canada I learned PHP unless you want a
higher end job than I learned Java but
you better go to college if you want to
get a job like that more than likely
what type of music do I prefer I listen
to a large eclectic group of different
things
why Haskell Haskell is just a great
functional language that if you learn
Haskell it'll be easier to learn other
functional languages the reason why I
brought that up was was because somebody
asked me how to how what they needed to
learn to make it easy for them to learn
multiple different languages and I said
learn Java and learn Haskell Java to her
object-oriented Haskell functional
language you learned them both it's very
easy to learn pretty much anything else
which is the best to learn Java or
JavaScript
it depends lower and development work I
guess JavaScript higher and enterprise
level programming I guess Java
yes you could do um lists for artificial
intelligence most definitely can you do
event sourcing sorry I don't know what
you mean by that
if I'm not answering questions yes I've
heard of deadmau5 it's because I've
already answered it already so I don't
know if this is how you do an AMA this
is always how I do in AMAs I basically
sit here and read the chats and just
answer questions one after the other so
how did I get my first job I was
underage but I really wanted a job so I
could make money and so I could buy
myself a computer and I didn't lie about
my age I just applied to work at a at a
golf range it's like a big giant field
where people hit golf balls slash mini
golf slash rabbit form slash farm in
general and I worked there that was the
first I grew up on a farm so getting
paid to do farm work was a lot better
than not getting paid to do farm work so
that was my first job that I ever had
and I absolutely loved it and it's
probably one of my favorites favorite
jobs I ever had
I prefer PHP over spring I live in
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania I've already
made tutorials on how to make WordPress
themes plugins and all that stuff sorry
my stuff is very his is unorganized I do
the best I can normally the best way to
search through my tutorials is actually
to use my website and my is to go there
and search yeah it's just kind of hard
the way that YouTube works I wish I
could do a better job but that's that's
the problem with having 800 I think I
have 800 videos so thoughts on religion
I think that everybody has their own
opinion on it and that is awesome yeah
III that's something I don't really have
questions or I just don't comment on
other people's beliefs so sorry about
that yes typescript tutorial is going to
be up hopefully on Wednesday if I can
completely chill my self out
Borgan jervey eski you've been properly
shot it out sorry if I mispronounced
your name if I had to learn either Perl
or Java I think I'd go the Java route
the Perl is a really awesome utility
language why not my question game smart
I'm not skipping anybody here I'm just I
may have just missed you I apologize for
that
let's see if I can find you if I want to
be a programmer in future what although
I work towards now just get good at
programming get good at solving problems
that's all programming is is getting
good at solving problems in general
languages may change but the whole thing
that's one thing that computers are not
very good at is in regards to automating
jobs is they're not very good at
creative problem solving so creative
problem solving is probably the the
skill to learn that's it why are you not
planning on doing Swift stuff I would do
a Swift tutorial in a heartbeat if
enough people requested it and it's on
list see where is it so if you list
there it is Swift already did a Swift
tutorial and there is an iOS tutorial so
that is it
yes I read books basically to make sure
that what I'm teaching in my tutorials
is a hunter hunt a hundred percent
updated so I always back up the
knowledge that I already have with books
to make sure that I'm not teaching you
guys bad stuff
node vs. PHP that is totally up to you
and up to employers and so forth and so
on
you could eat you could easily use
either one in my opinion laravel would
be a sort of a similar PHP alternative
to node it's over here to somewhere I
don't know where's laravel there it is
on to Tron getting a girlfriend take a
look at my video getting people to like
you
there you go I don't really do a lot
with rails I'm married to a woman so
that answers the sexual orientation
question I could do an iOS tutorial no
problem I just need enough people to
request it I think what do I think about
college programming I think that a
professor is gonna teach you better than
I could ever teach you if it's a good
professor if you have a bad professor
obviously nothing can beat a good
professor
pretty much anything thing can beat a
professor that doesn't care if they
teacher or not
and right
any languages that I don't know I'm sure
it's occasionally somebody will ask me
some bizarro language that I've never
heard of so at what Lang at what age
would a Virgo retire
I think everybody's different
Cole always glad to hear that I was able
to help people get through college what
age did you start coding I was 10 on a
trs-80 first language was basic I'm more
than open to do in iOS tutorial sorry I
have no idea my IQ is but I don't
believe I'm that smart
angularjs vs jQuery they're kind of
different things learning with a fester
oh you
okay what type of language do I listen
or what type of music do I listen to I
keep getting this question so I don't
really think there's anything I listen
to a mixture of a whole bunch of
different things um I'm not really I
listen to a lot of kids videos or video
or music mainly cuz I have kids I don't
know I listen to a random group of music
IIe old new whole way back into probably
the 50s I listen to a lot of different I
mean I have I'm just looking for
something weird that I have let's say
something old okay I paperback right or
by the Beatles so there's something
really old and I have music that just
came out and I listen to a combination
of some bands in Pittsburgh where I live
so I listen to a lot of random stuff
Scala or Haskell Haskell no I don't know
Hindi I apologize I'm not very good with
spoken languages
so I know mm no I do not know I mean yes
my tutorials are fast and the reason why
my tutorials are like that is because I
go out of my way to try to make
different tutorials so that's the reason
why my videos are the way they are is I
go out of my way to make different types
of videos that's it languages that I
consider myself an expert in I'm pretty
good with JavaScript PHP Java C++ that I
name everything that I use constantly
yeah and that's not including all the
different frameworks so that's pretty
much everything that I use on a daily
basis so there you go I use other things
but those are the core languages that I
use all the time Ruby rph pay page pay
in my opinion
what am I getting here Surrey KITT I'm
just going to look this up because I
have no idea what you're asking for um
sorry if that's messing that up
Able's I'm us to work with Siri okay if
I do iOS tutorials I will definitely
look into that yes I worked at Apple I
wrote device drivers I didn't do
anything particularly fun or awesome but
I guess I did work at Apple but it was
back in the days when Steve Jobs wasn't
there
the software I used for editing is
iMovie
this is OBS what I'm using right now and
I have the the OBS software hidden see
oh look at me how sneaky I am so
Oh No is it too late to start
programming at 16 most definitely not
yes I'm self-employed yes I'll do a test
driven development tutorial I plan on
creating a language of my own I mean
that's something that's sort of out
there that I could do but am i rich I'm
I consider myself to be very lucky am i
rich based off of United States States
terms absolutely not
but I'm happy and I have more money than
I need but I'm also extremely frugal so
you know sorry about the delay guys he's
first I'm doing a livestream and like
probably a year
do I like mmm he's all right I've
listened there so I'm sure there's an
Eminem song on on my Spotify thing that
I listened to I'm positive there's
all right what's my favorite ID I liked
JetBrains videos but I also you know I
used sublime text
what's this writer I'm using Adam over
here so you know there's all kinds of
things out there free alternatives and
JetBrains puts things out also study
best way to study I made a tutorial
called study methods if you look that up
you'll see everything that I I do anyway
maybe it'll help you out
my favorite programming language
I don't know it's it's a hard it's a
hard thing to say
definitely I'm more of an object
oriented programming guy to say what my
favorite language is is kind of hard I
don't know sorry I can't give you that
question I like job a lot I'll say that
my favorite musician I'd have to say my
favorite band
period if I had to say one one band
I guess I'd say REM yes you can ask me
anything that's answering is this a Q&amp;amp;A
that's what it turned into originally it
was supposed to be a vote for the next
video tutorial and now it turned into
and asked me anything
what is this sorry guys if I'm missing
some of your questions I'm scrolling
through the chat system here not certain
what that request was
trying to answer all your questions all
a spark ql sorry i don't know what that
is that's something that I haven't used
so that's not something I've looked into
I can put it over here and take a look
at it that's the first time I've ever
heard about it does it spark I'm sure
I'll find it
I've never really been i've only been
involved in one larger game development
system and it sort of fell apart i
definitely do more in regards to game
development but I've run marathons in on
my street but never in real life because
I don't like the idea of waking up super
early and running at four o'clock in the
morning so that's why
programming podcasts no I've never
listened to whole programming podcasts
electron I know I have that on the main
list it's something that isn't requested
very well the same is true with elixir
it's not requested very wet very often
what is the most impressive you've ever
programmed
I don't know Mac or Windows I would use
both idle boto dual-boot OS X Windows
and infante oh so a rat guys
I'm very slow runner I can run forever
but I'm slow I run like nine minute
miles but I run you know nine miles
every single day so that's how much I
run all right guys well thank you so so
so much for all of your input I'm gonna
be going through all of your comments
and making decisions on which direction
I'm going with you know future tutorials
thank you so much for contributing and
help me out my voice is starting to sort
of die on me though so I am gonna have
to go here very soon if I possibly can
so please feel free to continue leaving
you know other requests
in the tutorial and just so you guys
know when I do at the video tutorial
after I upload it I always sort of chill
and read all the comments so if you guys
ever want to do ask me questions at the
end of a video feel free to post those
questions and I will do it
Damir said filipova k-- there you go so
always feel free to leave questions in
the comment section I have read all of
them and I'm always happy to talk to you
guys so either way just thank you for
being awesome and answering the clutch
my questions and hopefully I was able to
answer a lot of your questions so
otherwise I'm gonna take off here and
try to get my voice all set and then I
