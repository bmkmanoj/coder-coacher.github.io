in and asked is it possible to plant
ideas like they did in the movie
Inception and he also went on to ask how
do you influence people well today this
presentation is gonna teach you how to
influence people to do pretty much
anything or if you'd like inception
techniques you can use the plant ideas
and motivate and no we're not putting
anybody to sleep to do this because we
live in an extremely complicated
environment we use shortcuts to make
nearly every decision our mind flashes
back to previous events instantly when a
decision is to be made and we act
accordingly based off of those previous
results if you are able to understand
the shortcuts that people use you will
be able to use those against you to get
them to do what you'd like like I've
mentioned in other previous videos
familiarity in the presentation of
information speaks more truth than the
facts that are actually being presented
hence if you are able to present
information in a way that a person will
be able to understand it it doesn't
matter if it's true or not because it
falls in line with their level of
thinking think of it this way we can
easily fall into a habit of going to the
same restaurant or store because it is
familiar and you know what you will get
there we develop these habits because
our brain likes to have access to
shortcut information or solutions to
problems hence you feel hungry so you go
to McDonald's what many people don't
know is that we have numerous habits
that we are unaware of as well a recent
study revealed that the word because
holds an immense amount of power it
showed that most people are very likely
to follow a direction just because the
word because is used and later learned
that much of the power found in indirect
hypnosis is provided with specific
conjunction and you can find out more
information on these conjunctions in the
video I have here on the screen what
they did was they had a woman go into a
library
use different techniques to cut in line
at a photocopier and the results were
quite amazing 60% of the people let her
cut in line when she asked me I used the
Xerox machine 93% of people let her cut
in line when she asked me I use the
Xerox because I have to make some copies
94% of people let her cut line when she
asked me I use the Xerox because I'm in
a
and over 75% of people were inclined to
conform when the person just said mate I
used the Xerox because numerous other
studies have also proven the power of
conjunctions influencing others and you
can see here of course she needed to use
the Xerox to make copies she was not
giving any real reason that really shows
you how powerful the use of conjunctions
are in the English language by
reciprocating I just mean that when we
are given a gift we are inclined to give
one in return this rule is responsible
for the creation of societies across the
planet if people didn't share we would
have never created towns and then large
metropolitan cities a long time ago we
started sharing food for pottery and so
forth and that tradition continues today
this role is so powerful that there is a
general distaste for anyone that takes
and makes no effort to return in kind
studies were done to back up the power
of the reciprocation when a marketing
company sent out a questionnaire with a
check for five dollars they received
twice the number of returned
questionnaires as those that promised to
check for $50 upon receipt of the
finished questionnaire the Harvey
Krishnas proved that by forcing an
unwanted gift of a flower or pamphlet
they could dramatically increase their
donations they received so many
donations that they were soon banned
from airports altogether people could
not trust themselves to not donate after
a gift was given so laws were imposed to
protect them from themselves have you
ever wondered why so many nonprofits
send address labels the reason is that
the inclusion of them spikes donations
from 18% to 35% what is amazing is that
we can get people to conform by offering
them nothing but a concession by
concession I mean asking a person will
you do this and they say no and you do
not force the issue but instead ask them
will you do this then instead 76% of
people actually agreed to give blood
once as a concession after being asked
to sign up to give blood on a regular
basis on the other hand when they were
asked to give blood without the use of
the concession only 29 percent agreed
now we have what is one of the most
powerful principles which is the
consistency principle while I agree that
reciprocation can be very powerful it
pales in comparison to the consistency
principle once we make a choice we will
continue to pressure ourselves to the
mave consistently with that commitment
we have a need to remain consistent this
pressure will force us to continue to
act in ways that justify our past
decisions in fact the person that
doesn't follow this role is labeled as
mentally ill by society let me show you
how to companies dramatically increase
sales by using the consistency principle
when the Cabbage Patch Kids were first
introduced the toy companies had an
amazing idea
why don't we heavily advertise them
knowing that we won't have enough on
hand to satisfy demand you see prior to
this product toy companies made most of
their sales during the Christmas holiday
but few throughout the rest of the year
so they use the consistency principle to
create additional sales throughout the
rest of the year here's how it works
children are heavily marketed to desire
a specific toy the parent promises them
that they will get the toy for Christmas
over and over again the toy is not
available for the parent to purchase the
parent then makes a substitute purchase
so that there's something under the
Christmas tree and whenever the toy
becomes available in the future the
parent buys it because they feel
obligated because of the past promise
studies have been done to test the
consistency principle further a group of
people were solicited to fill out a
questionnaire and one of the questions
buried in it was if you were approached
to donate three hours to a charity would
you if a person answered yes on that
questionnaire the researchers found that
they were 700 percent more likely to
volunteer in the future when asked
versus another neighborhood that did not
complete the questionnaire another group
of researchers went to a neighborhood
and asked people if they could put a
large sign in their yard with the words
drive carefully printed on it 17 percent
of people committed to allow this
another group first asked the people if
they could put a small three-inch sign
in their yard when they returned and
asked if they could put the large sign
76 percent versus the 17% of the people
gave their approval
why because to remain consistent with
the previous implied belief that driving
carefully was important they felt the
need to conform once more proof only
consistent principle during the Korean
War the Chinese were very successful
with getting American soldiers to betray
each other they would rat out any
soldiers planning to escape and betray
classified military information why well
the Chinese didn't use the tool of
torture but instead the power of the
written
commitment here is how that was
accomplished soldiers were first asked
to make minor statements such as America
is not perfect they were then asked to
list the reasons America was not perfect
then they were asked to sign the list
afterwards then read the list in a group
atmosphere and then write an essay
expanding on that list
finally the essays were recorded and
broadcast for the other prisoners to
hear like boiling a frog the Chinese
knew it would be easy to turn the
soldiers if they slowly turned up the
commitment but why written statements so
effective well they can easily be made
public companies dramatically lower
cancellations by getting customers to
sign order forms even though by law we
are all given free look privileges and
you have probably even been marketed to
through the consistency principle and
don't even know it
Procter and Gamble and many other
companies regularly offer contests in
which they ask people to write an essay
explaining why they love their product
does that sound familiar if you are able
to make a person go through any level of
pain to get something they tend to value
it that much more that is why hazing and
colleges work so well giving a person a
sore wrist after you force them to write
2,000 word essays also works also to
improve results make sure the person
knows the commitments will be made
public must be backed up actively will
require future and present efforts we
also determine what is correct by
finding out what other people think is
correct this is called bandwagoning
bandwagoning is so powerful that 95% of
people base their decisions on what the
majority is doing versus the proof or
facts this rule becomes even more
powerful when we observe the actions of
people that look like us a Bible
door-to-door sales company increased
sales by 119 percent just by showing
people testimonials given by people that
look like the potential customer so men
were shown testimonials from men of a
similar age and appearance as for women
even more shocking research has proven
than immediately following a front page
suicide story the number of suicides
increase dramatically on average each
suicide publicized by the media is
responsible for 58 additional suicides
many people are just waiting to see if
others think suicide is a potential
answer before they choose to end their
own lives in another example of people
following their
in 1988 customers caused a massive bank
failure because of bandwagoning a bus
strike created an abnormally large crowd
in front of a bank Passard buys panicked
and got in line withdraw their funds
from what they thought was a failing
bank because bandwagoning works best
during periods on certainly this created
a perfect storm for this principle as
you will see during periods of
uncertainty we were aligned most on
these build and responses people also
like and trust others that look like
themselves this is the basis of the
lacking principle for example Tupperware
sells 2.5 million in products because
their friends are offering the products
to them furthermore with referral from a
friend a sales person has a 50% better
chance of making a sale let me take you
through an extremely profitable
advertising campaign to see if you could
avoid falling prey to the liking
principle in the 90s MC I decided to
call and tell you how much money you
could save your friend instead of
yourself they increase sales by 20% and
this is basically how the call went
imagine the name of your best friend
I'll use the name Mike now a
representative from MCI calls and says
that they are calling because Mike
recently signed up with MCI they then
tell you if you switch to MCI for no
additional cost Mike will be able to
save a lot of money on top of that you
will save money every time you talk to
your best friend Mike even better yet if
you give MCI your other friends names
they will make the same offer to that
then you'll be able to talk to each
other for free so MCI will facilitate
saving all of your friends money and
will allow you to now talk to them for
free at no additional cost
just say yes sounds pretty good doesn't
it that's the writing principle at work
if you ever thought good-looking people
are lucky you were right take a look at
the other benefits of being attractive
in political elections the results have
shown that attractive candidates receive
2.5 more votes than unattractive people
attractive people get 12 to 14 percent
more in regards to salary in criminal
cases attractive people are twice as
likely to avoid jail time and in civil
cases attractive people are rewarded
55.9% more money so one short way to get
paid more and avoid trouble with the law
is to become more attractive and I've
attached a video on this screen that
shows you how I was able to lose 79
pounds in 5 months
click on that link if you want to be
more track
as mentioned before we prefer people
that look sound and think like us so a
company tried to take advantage of that
so they told their survey providers to
change their name to one that was
similar to the potential survey takers
so Robert Greer would be approached to
take a survey by Bob Gregor what
happened they received a 100% increase
in compliance Joe Gerard who is in the
Guinness Book of World Records and is
considered the world's best salesman
stated how he was able to make so many
sales this man averaged six to seven car
sales per day quite impressive
what does he do he sends out a letter
each month with three words written it I
like you that's it and the reason this
is so powerful as we find it very hard
to say no to a person that says they
like us we also like what is familiar in
1980 shortly before the election an
unknown person won the state attorney
general race in Ohio how did he do it he
changed his name to brown which is a
very common name found in Ohio politics
remember during periods of uncertainty
we followed these principles because
probably nobody knew who was running for
the State Attorney General people
naturally chose the name brown because
it was common to them we can also use
the authority principle to influence
people listen to your elders well the
doctor said my boss told me these are
the phrases that created the next
principle used to make decisions the
authority principle we are trained from
birth to believe that obedience to
Authority is Right authority figures are
considered right because we always
assume they have access to better
information than we do and studies have
shown that by being labeled an authority
others will even see you differently
with each increase in status people
perceive others to even grow in height
by 1/2 an inch if you want a dress to be
seen as an authority for men wear white
heavily starched shirts dark wing tip
shoes trendy Classic suits three inch
wide lapels heavy cloth even in July
muted tones such as blue gray or black a
white lab coat if that makes sense to
you and uniforms in general work great
once someone is considered an authority
they gain a level of respect that it's
almost impossible to say no two people
are more motivated as well by the
thought of losing something than by the
thought of gaining something of equal
value here's an example of how
convenience stores sell high priced
appliances they spot someone looking an
appliance and they say I see you're
interested in this model here and I
understand why it's a great machine and
great price unfortunately I sold it to
another couple not more than 20 minutes
ago and if I'm not mistaken it was the
last one I had this is an extremely
powerful sales practice a scarcity
principle is also used on people with a
limited time offer customers are told
that unless they make an immediate
decision to buy they will have to
purchase the item at a higher price
later or may lose the opportunity all
together we are all hardwired to not
allow others to take freedoms away from
us through the use of a limited time
offer we are meant to feel that freedoms
are being taken away and so we are
forced to buy now corporate stores love
to create a powerful enticement to bind
by creating what is called the
competitive scarcity it turns out that
we won an item most when we are in
competition for it people every year
trample others to get the special deal
at Walmart why because they are left to
stew for hours surrounded by competitors
hence once the door is open they have
claimed that they were so caught up in
the moment
that nothing would keep them from that
