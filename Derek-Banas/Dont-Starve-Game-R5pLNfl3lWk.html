some fun and show you a new game that's
come out it's still actually in beta
it's called don't starve and I picked
this game particularly because I thought
it would teach you a lot about game
design and how awesome it can be so
let's jump into it and I unlock these
two characters and don't think I'm
locked up so there's currently three
playable characters I'm going to start
off with Wilson which is the guy you get
by default jumping away now there's this
weird guy I never see him ever again and
basically what this is is a resource
gathering game in which you try to not
die I think that would be a better game
for it and you just pick up grass and
seeds and different things to eat and
then Flint is very important because
it's gonna help you make tools and
there's all your tools over here which
I'm going to show you here in a second
and it's really amazing how a simple 2-d
game can become so much fun and you can
see just the importance of the design of
the game and how important art is to
game designs which i think is often
disregarded especially by programmers
okay so now I have enough stuff to make
some tools and first I'm going to build
here is an axe and now I can chop down
trees what's neat about this game is
constantly something happens that you
don't expect like for example if you
chop down trees long enough without
planting cake corns and here's acorns
right here and you can plant them to
plant new trees and if you do not do
that
a tree will come alive and try kill you
it seems very simple but it just
continues to build up and add new and
new features new tools to build and it's
really a great game okay so now here's a
carrot and I'm going to get it to catch
a rabbit and there's all kinds of tools
you can make over here so I'm going to
build over-under survival a trap now if
I can find a rabbit I'm going to catch
it
there's rub it and just going to lay a
trap down here and bait it with a carrot
and then go pick up some resources and
hopefully we'll catch a bunny you can
see they're getting closer and there it
is and then maybe I'll lay another trap
while I show you another tool whoop I
don't have any more carrots let's see if
I can bait it with some berries might
work might not sometimes it does
sometimes it does and then here's some
boulders and you can get all kinds of
neat things out of that but first I have
to build a pickaxe you can hear it sort
of like makes this weird sort of sound
I've got a rabbit with a fairy
I hope you can see there it's getting
late I need to make fire let's see if I
can find myself some spiders and here's
a map over here give you information on
where you've been up by here spiders
good okay and then you got to build
yourself campfire throughout the night
otherwise you will die
there's my campfire and then I can cook
up my rabbits make some more sauce whoop
good
a whole nother spider and kill myself
another rabbit and jump over here and
build myself a backpack so I have a
little bit more room to carries and
stuff and then cook myself up some more
morsels and you can see over here is
your stomach and there is your health
and I survive through the night
magically what I shoulda did was make
this spear right here makes a little bit
easier to live through the night
whenever you have a spear and it's
getting dark again so I'm gonna build
another campfire and I'm gonna show you
how to do something else you can go
under refine I'm gonna make myself a
rope and then under survival now I'm
gonna make myself a straw roll and this
makes it a lot easier to live through
the night roll that out and sleep away
the night and I'm starving so I should
probably go make yourself something to
eat
and if you want to see what happens if
you stay in the dark too long this is
what happens and then eventually you get
attacked and you get killed so don't do
that
and after you've explored an area for a
while you can leave what they call the
biome to go to another by you and you
mined for gold and there's gold cessful
now we're going to be able to build the
science machine which is over here as
well as the alchemy the alchemy engine
teaches you new recipes I've unlocked a
whole bunch of them
and the science machine basically allows
you to process stuff into knowledge
points which are up here there is
probably the first enemy you're gonna
meet that guy right there tries to
protect that egg right there I'm yet to
smash and egg but here I've got to do
something equally as evil because down
here I believe is a graveyard and in the
graveyard you can find gold and you can
also find graves of course and you can
dig up the graves with a shovel
so let's build a shovel and I'm gonna go
dig up a grave you can find kinds of
cool things in here I once found a
little monster called Chester that's a
melty marble that's not very
and it was like a rope it was like a
pumpkin thing that followed me around
and would carry my stuff for me saucepan
cool and there's all kinds of stuff but
I'm running out of room another thing
you can build is the thing to catch
birds let's build that and set the trap
and you can get feathers from the birds
and you can also eat them of course
scare them away it'd probably come back
and there he is
and then I can drop them and chop up and
there you are and I got a morsel that
time and now I'm heading off to another
volume and I believe this one's going to
be this swamp I'm gonna build a whole
bunch of things if this is the swamp yep
this is a small this place is kind of
dangerous but there's all kinds of
whoopsie and that's dangerous
that's the thing you gotta look out for
so now I'm gonna build my science
machine that's right there pick up these
boards and I'm gonna build myself a case
to drop all my stuff and that's a chest
I need one more board to do that that'll
help me get rid of a whole bunch of
things structures and build now I got a
chest and you can have unlimited number
of chess
and I take things like this rocket and
okay now to build my alchemy engines I
need four rocks and four boards and
there's mouth man
and build myself a more sturdy fire pit
that's gonna make it last much longer my
sphere doesn't right next to a spiders
and asked again charcoals roll easy to
make okay to burn some trees down here
I'll show you build game fire and then
just throw a whole bunch of wood on it
so we've got our trees and just add fuel
real name really do it and if that
doesn't quite do it playing a couple
trees around the campfire and boom you
got charcoal and you will burn it
so not good then after it's done burning
just do-overs just pick up your charcoal
full then I want to build myself a
fishing rod and since I'm in the swamp
there's all kinds of easy ways to live
out here forgot some things to eat and
do a little bit of fishing there's a
easy way to get food and that is the
first 8 days of playing don't starve so
I thought it would be fun I have an
extra free copy of the game so the very
