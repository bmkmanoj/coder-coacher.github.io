night Apple watch to review in this
video I'm gonna try to provide a pretty
complete review of the new Apple watch 2
specifically the night version of it I'm
going to cover how accurate it is in
regards to GPS treadmill running which
almost everybody ignores and also
specifically with the heart rate monitor
on top of that I'm also going to go over
and review 6 applications that actually
run on the phone as well as 9
applications that run on the telephone
and 2 that allow you to sync all of your
runs between multiple different services
but before I continue I'd like to
provide some perspective in regards to
what type of athlete I am in regards to
how I run as you can see in the lower
right hand corner I run a lot over the
last two and a half years I've put in
over 4,500 miles worth of running but
you can also see that I am NOT some
super athlete in regards to my average
pace over that period of time was
roughly 10 minutes per mile so I run
long and slow and a lot of trails and a
lot of hills and things like that
because I live in Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania
there's hills and trails and things like
that everywhere and that's what I prefer
to do rather than getting on a track and
running really fast that's just not what
I do so I think what I'm going to do
here is try to provide perspective for
the normal athlete not ultra runners or
people like that but also a serious
runner because that's what I am so first
off you may ask well how accurate is the
GPS the GPS is extremely accurate and
here is the watch just to prove that I
have it and it's going to be off by what
I did was I based it off of how to
actually get up and get it
this TomTom Runner which is a runner
cardio which is actually a good watch
for a beginner has some problems but
I'll get into that in a second and also
a Garmin 620 using a heart rate monitor
as well as a foot pod so these are going
to be based off of mainly the garment in
regards to the GPS and how much is it
off in comparison the garment it's off
based off the Garmin by about 0.01 to
0.02 percent no I'm not running in the
city so maybe that causes some issues
but
I can say based off where I run the GPS
is off by that much which is in my
consideration basically nothing in
regards to treadmill running I compared
it to a Garmin 620 with a foot pod and
it gets almost exactly the same which is
absolutely amazing because there's no
foot pod with the Apple watch and with
the foot pod it gets it on average I
would guess it's off by about three to
five percent which is almost exactly the
same as the Garmin this thing is
terrible this actually gets about it's
about twenty percent off if you during a
long run so that's just the comparison
regards to that and regards to the heart
rate monitor versus a chest heart rate
monitor this is risk-based obviously it
and the only real issue it's fairly
accurate over the average I would say
it's off by about 2% in comparison to a
chest based heart rate monitor but it
does have spikes occasionally which can
be off by as much as five to six percent
but like I said the average is pretty
much spot-on so it doesn't really bother
me it's not as accurate as a chest based
heart rate monitor but it is as accurate
as any other risk based monitor that I
have tested so that's a rundown in
regards to how those three things
function and now I'm going to jump in
and show you six applications on the
watch itself first we're going to take a
look at the night run Club app and one
of the best features of it is first its
built in on top of that you're going to
be able to use it without your telephone
and on top of that it also works very
well with treadmill whenever you're
ready to start a run you just click on
start and this really irritates a lot of
people but it doesn't really bother me
it counts down and then you can see that
it's going to show your beats per minute
for your heart rate your miles your pace
and minutes and seconds and whenever you
want to stop you click on pause and that
is basically the whole entire
application in regards to settings
you're going to be able to mark it as
indoor four treadmill which works great
auto pause all metrics and voiceover
which is going to tell you each time you
ran a mile and there is all the other
different types of information you have
for the night run Club app and of course
you can tell it whenever you want to run
next time then I'm going to take a look
at the run meter app as you can see it
as a ton of information for whenever
you're running this is absolutely
fabulous the major downside to this
application really is that doesn't work
particularly well with the treadmill but
everything else about it especially if
you're running outside it is absolutely
awesome so there you go that is run
meter I'll take a look at runtastic as
you can see I have a lot of problems
with this app I don't understand why it
has trouble connecting to my telephone
and a couple other different things but
you can see right here this is basically
your option just start running and it
requires a telephone it doesn't work
with just the watch like the naik as
well as RunKeeper does oh there it is
and here is run keeper like I said run
keeper is going to work with just your
watch which is great you can see here
the different options you have the
interface isn't very fancy this is the
free version of run keeper by the way
and you can go in here and just check a
couple little different things whether
you have the phone or the watch itself
and you can also see it has max
heartrate and you can also set target
paces which is kind of useful you're
also going to be able to set your max
heartrate this guy by the way just want
to mention it again works really well in
a treadmill for some reason this and the
Naik work great on the treadmill then
the major downside is that it doesn't
provide you a lot of information like
some of the other guys do in regards to
the information like it does provide
heartrate and current pace and the time
as well as the distance but other than
that that's basically it but it's still
very very good at and now take a look at
map my run again a very basic watch
application I don't particularly like
this even though the main application on
the iPhone is great you can just come in
here as you can see right here here's
some issues in regards to working with
the watch interface say not working very
well so there's a downside to the Apple
watch and you can see that it's not
really doing anything other than
allowing me to start and there's the
data that shows while you're running
and finally I'll take a look at I smooth
run this guy isn't particularly
wonderful this is the paid version also
what you with this you actually have to
start your run using your phone and it's
kind of limited in regards to what it
shows you so just want to show you that
and now I'm going to take a look at the
applications and how they work okay so
you saw the actual watch applications
and now I'm going to show you what it
looks like on the the iPhone versions
and I'm going to show you a couple more
than what I just showed you so there's
an Ike run Club and as you're going to
need to see it is kind of spotty in
regards to the type of information it
gives you you can see right here I'm
just going to use this I tested all
these applications all in one day I
basically ran one mile with each one of
them and you can see right there I have
the map it's going to have the average
pace as you can see it's going to have
the duration of the run calories
sometimes you get elevation gains
sometimes you don't sometimes you get
heart rate sometimes you don't and like
fuel which I don't care about and
there's that I can go in here you can
see the pace and how that works out for
you and that information as well as your
splits I only ran one mile so it's going
to just have one of them and that's it
so that is a comparison of exactly what
you get with the Naik run app and I'm
just going to jump through here and you
can compare them you're going to see
here now I just want to make this clear
the Naik app one great thing about it is
you can run with it without the phone
with you and RunKeeper also provides
that capability at this time over time
all of them are going to get in line and
work without the need for the telephone
but that's where they are right now this
guy right here and I also want to talk
about the price the night run Club is
going to be zero dollars comes with the
watch and this guy which is called the
run meter it costs $9.99 yes
$9.99 and it's that's a one-time payment
you never pay anything ever again and
you can see all of the information that
this guy provides provides a lot of
information let's come in here jump out
of that and let's go to history buy me
some information there it is now it
loaded all right you can see on this all
the different ways you can export it you
can export it to pretty much anything
you can see straw MyFitnessPal dah dah
dah you can also export it to things
like smash run which are really popular
by just sending an email
the GPX file on it let's cancel that
come down here you can see that it
monitored the weather the map you're
going to see the pace the elevation the
calories as well as the additional pace
information so you can see there's a lot
of information that was secured through
the run meter which I like a lot and
even more information gets passed over
to Strava and to smash run now look at
runtastic which I'm not a huge fan of
however this is the free version of
runtastic I didn't want to spend any
more money on it the full version of
runtastic goes for about $15 for three
months and I just didn't do that so this
is just snow this is the free version
and the paid version will have a little
bit more in regards to features and
basically we can come in here and we can
look up history and there's a run I
actually ran it I had some trouble with
it so I actually ran with it for two
miles just to check a whole bunch of
different things you can see here
average pace average speed max speed
average steps a little bit cleaner a
little bit nicer no elevation no heart
rate none of that information but like I
said this is the free version of it and
if you want to pay for it you can see
what other additional functionality
there is and we have run keeper and run
keeper remember works with just your
watch you don't need the ability to take
your telephone with you which is kind of
good you can see right here as I flush
through all of the information let's
come down here to activities and we'll
just pick one of these guys that did it
uh that's not giving me any information
so go to this one another one here I
believe this one has a little bit more
information yeah you can see right here
again this is not the paid version of
run keeper which runs $9.99 a month very
expensive this is the free version and
you can see it has splits still the free
versions pretty good see it has splits
and it also has some additional charts
nice charts pase elevation steps heart
rate good stuff and your shoes so that's
run keep and we have map my run which is
actually this is the free version of
that the paid versions $5.99 a month and
this is a fairly nice app as well see
right here it's going to have the map so
so going to have the total time ran and
the total distance and the average pace
average heart rate intensity calories
elevation gain and analyze this workout
I believe is a paid thing and be weather
so that's all of that information and I
don't believe it provides me anything
else let's try analyze this workout I
think it's paid thing oh no it isn't
that's good
so there's pace and you can also see
here heart rate as well as elevation and
heart rate zones you have to pay for
intensity and so forth and so on so
that's map my run and then there is I
smooth run which actually have the paid
version which is $4.99 flat never pay
anything ever again and you can see all
the information here one of the
negatives to this is that you have to
start your run on your phone don't like
that whatever go in here you can see
that it does provide you some pretty
good information though there's running
time total time total distance average
pace average speed all of that
information right there splits laps best
efforts and disappear me anything else
now I guess that's basically it's just
going to provide you a bunch of text and
this is the paid version of this guy
just so you know but it's also going to
make it very easy for you to export
you're going to be able to put in all
these different guys hit export and it's
going to export that's something that
most of them do not allow you to do and
there's ways around that though I'm
going to show you how to sync them so
that you can use pretty much any of
these different apps and have them sync
but the guy that I had the least number
of problems with in regards to
submitting is this guy once again which
is run meter it exports very very well
the night also terrible exporting and so
forth and so on but since I brought it
up and then we can also look at some
other different things here Strava and
how it is going to work for us you can
see here the run that I did with Strava
what I normally do is use run meter and
then an export to strauber and smash my
run and then you get all these nice
charts and all these additional things
that look really nice and the watch app
looks really good so there's Strava and
strawbe is going to be coming out with a
gps enabled application very very soon
endomondo is actually pretty okay let's
go in here and look at
and history you see all the different
runs I have here and let's just say on
open one you can see right there is map
there's all kinds of information regards
to distance duration max pace da da da
da so pretty okay heart rate zone it
doesn't have you have to pay for that
and so forth and so on and then you have
smash run if you want to follow me by
the way on smash run I follow back
everybody and I love the challenge so
I'll give you a push you give me a push
and regards to that and you can see here
smash run over here on the right side of
my screen and there is all the
statistics and it just provides a ton of
information I actually like this a
little bit better than Strava but smash
runs not quite as good and regards to
sharing then whenever it comes to
syncing all of these different guys
together I use two of these guys I
actually don't use them I use run meter
which does a great job of exporting to
Strava and smash run but if you don't
have that app then you're probably going
to want to use something like fitness
sinker which is free and this is
actually a website and what you can do
is just click on account and it's going
to allow you to define sources as well
as destinations for information so a
source I'm using here for example is run
keeper smash run and Strava so if
anything goes to those guys then Strava
and run keeper are going to be
automatically updated so that's going to
be really good and if that doesn't work
for you there is another syncing
application called tap Rick and this is
actually the website once again and you
can go in here and you can just plug in
everything that you want to be synced so
you can see I have run keeper straw of a
smash run endomondo I normally don't use
all of these I just did it because I
wanted to test all these applications he
hit this guy right here and everything
syncs for you so there is a rundown of
the night Apple watch too and basically
just wanted to provide a little bit of
feedback in regards to what is good and
what is bad especially in comparison to
other alternatives such as what are
provided by Garmin and TomTom and Sun 2
and all those and I'm not being
sponsored by absolutely anything you saw
here in this video so just you know it's
just my opinion basically the bad things
about this in comparison to like a
Garmin application is it is hard to set
up a training program in
a Apple watch like you would have a
Garmin Garmin's going to alert you
whenever you're supposed to slow down
change pace do things like that
the Apple watch at this point in time at
least I haven't found anything that does
that to the level of a Garmin watch you
can put training plans in here but
they're not quite as good as what you're
going to get with a garment so that's a
kind of a bad thing you know I think
you're going to see a lot more
applications come out here over the next
couple months though and there you
should probably address that so there
are training plans available with these
different applications or not they're
just not quite as good as garment
another thing watch is kind of a pain to
work with the screen if it gets wet so
that's another negative thing it's kind
of hard to always hit the button nerve
for it to register so that's definitely
another negative and another negative I
would say is the five to six percent
inaccurate spikes in the heart rate and
hopefully Apple is able to fix that but
overall like I said the average heart
rate monitoring in comparison to a chest
based monitor which at least for me it
was a major pain wearing it's pretty
negligible in regards to the positives
one of the biggest positives is the fact
that you do not need like I had a Garmin
620 I went through in an average six
month period one foot pod and one heart
rate monitor every six months and I run
every single day so you know and weather
and everything else it's gonna mess
those things up they on for me I mean a
normal person it might last them two
years but for me if I wore them for six
months they would break that and that's
seventy bucks every single time one of
them breaks and I just kind of got tired
of the constant spending money on fixing
these devices also I had other issues in
regards to charging the Garmin watch was
a major pain for some reason I had major
syncing issues a lot of those things
that I didn't like about my Garmin the
Apple watch fixed now some of the things
I did like about my Garmin like the
training plans
the Apple watch doesn't do at this point
in time so you know take the good with
the bad but those are some of the things
that I really like about it the battery
life in general I think is pretty good I
can go on a 7 mile run and that's going
to eat up about 22 to
any 4% of my battery and that is put in
the watch on in the morning going up to
that point in time running seven miles
and then stopping and you know the
battery life is down 22% to me that's
good battery life especially in
comparison to my Garmin 620 which was
nowhere near as good as that
now the 630 which has come out and other
ones supposedly their battery life is
better I'm comparing it to a device
that's a year and a half old which was
terrible was nowhere near the battery
life I get out of this watch so like I
said I haven't been able to compare it
to a updated brand-new Garmin 630 or
something
but in my comparisons to my
year-and-a-half old product the battery
life on this is superior and finally the
fact that you can use applications there
are constants there's applications that
I just showed you here I tested a whole
bunch all the ones I didn't show you to
them to you because they just really
weren't even up to the standards of what
you did see but there's going to be more
applications coming out and there's
going to be better applications coming
out and that's just something you can't
get with any other type of sport watch
so there's my opinion on the Nike Apple
watch - hopefully that helps somebody
out there I know that a lot of the
things I brought up in this video
weren't brought up anywhere else and I
was but you know that's the reason why I
made video so like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
