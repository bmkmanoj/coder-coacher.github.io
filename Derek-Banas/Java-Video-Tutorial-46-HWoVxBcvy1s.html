46 of my java video tutorial series
today we're going to do something really
cool I'm gonna introduce you to Jay Dom
- which is going to make it extremely
easy to write and read from XML files to
get the library you're just going to
need to go to Jaedong org right here and
then click on binaries under downloads
and then this is the guy right here that
you're going to want to get click on
that and it will download j.don 2.0 dot
- it's a zip file then you want to open
that up and whenever you open up that
zip file you're going to see all these
different little guys here and there's
Jade on or this is going to be the guy
that you're going to use this is the
door file then you're going to jump into
eclipse and install it so you can use it
so here I am in Eclipse right now so to
install Jade um so you'll be able to use
it I'm just going to go to Java code
here that's what my directory is called
wherever yours is called and right click
on it and I'm going to scroll down until
I see build path then I'm going to come
over here and click on configure build
path and in my situation I already have
it installed but if you didn't how you
would install it is just go to add
external jars and then you're going to
go to the unzipped directory for Jade um
and this is the guy that you want to
select right there and then of course
you're just going to hit open and that
is all you need to do there and that is
going to throw J Tom in here for you to
be able to use inside of your programs
and then once J tom is opened up you're
going to see inside of Eclipse something
called referenced libraries and J tom is
going to be one of those reference
libraries now if you want hints in
regard to what the source code means
which is going to help you out a lot and
there's all the different things you get
you're going to want to right-click on
that and go to build path and then come
over here and go configure built path
and you could have did this previously
but source attachment is what we're
going to want to get and specifically
what you want is J tom 2.0 point two
sources dot jar now your version number
might be slightly different than mine
and if it says none which it probably
does you just want to click on that and
hit enter and then come over here and
find external file you want to find J
Dom - dah dah dah dah dah sources jar
and then you'll have all of your code
hitting all right now let's start
programming with it so just going to
come in here to my default package right
click go file new and then I'm going to
create Java lesson 46 dot Java alright
so here we are we're ready to go okay
so we're going to be working with files
so we're going to need Java dot IO dot
file so that we can use this class to
represent a system file that we're going
to be using and then we're going to go
import Java dot IO dot file output
stream which is going to allow us to
write data to a file because we're going
to be writing and reading data from an
XML file and any time you need that
you're going to go Java dot IO dot
exception because you know you're more
than likely going to have some sort of
exceptions in your i/o and make sure you
put oil in there and then you're going
to need to get the document specific
version for J Dom to so we're going to
go org jom to document and that's going
to just allow you to represent your XML
document and also of course it contains
a whole bunch of useful methods we're
going to be using implore it again J
tome to and this is the element version
inside of J DOM and again it's going to
help you be able to work with the
elements that you're going to pull over
here and you're going to have your
topmost J Dom exceptions handled by this
guy we're going to be working with text
here so we're also going to have to get
the text representative for J Dom as
well and there that is and then I
normally don't do this but I just wanted
to explain you all the different
libraries that are available and I'm
going to be using in this tutorial well
then we're going to need a way to create
our J Dom document and that is going to
be parsed using sax just like previously
I've done and sax stands for simple API
for XML there we are now we can parse
all that information and then we're also
going to use a formatting device that's
inside of J dome which is going to help
us make our XML file look nice whenever
it's saved and then finally in last
library is going to be or dot J Don -
dot output and this is going to handle
the outputting of the J Dom document to
a file whenever we have everything set
up the way that we want it set up and
that's xml output err and of course
you're gonna see all these demonstrated
well then just like always public class
Java less than 46 and I'm mainly going
to be using two different methods to
handle all this stuff so I'm just going
to go write XML that guys going to be
right there and then I'm also going to
read from an XML file so I got to create
those two guys you're gonna be amazed
that how simple this is of course I have
to write before I can read so I'm going
to get this
I first call this method down here in
private static void right XML okay the
first thing I need to do is come in here
and create my J Dom document that I'm
going to be playing around here with so
just real simple document this is just
going to be the XML version of a
document that I'm going to be able to
manipulate inside here you've seen this
all before then I'm gonna create an
element named tv-shows many you'd be
using the same sort of format as I did
with all my other xml tutorials so if I
want to create a course I can call it
anything I'm just going to call out the
route and I just come in here if I want
to put a new element inside of this
document that I have here I just got to
give it a name right like that and then
I just need to go doc I'd like to set my
root element to the route that I just
created say everything's just an element
and it's it's pretty easy once you work
with this it gets pretty easy then if I
want to create any other additional
elements inside of here like I want to
create show when I'll just create a new
element or show and if I also member
show there's going to be a bunch of show
elements that are going to contain a
whole bunch of other different things
and if I'd also like to create a name
because that's going to make sense
because each show is going to have a
name I just do that it's that simple
if I decide that I want to assign an
attribute to name I just go name set
attribute so I get ahead of myself here
and then I just tell it what I want the
attribute name to be which is going to
be show ID if you haven't seen my XML
tutorial it'll really help you
understand here isn't basically
recreating that XML file and this guy
right here so you are I just created an
attribute that's going to be assigned to
the name element it's going to be called
show ID and it's going to start with the
value of show 1 if I want to add text
between the name tags also very simple I
just go name add content new text and if
I want to put a TV show in there and
just go life on Moore's or whatever
there you are now the name element has a
name it has an attribute the attribute
value and it also has text in between
the tags throw in another element I can
keep throwing elements in here over and
over and over again so let's throw
Network in here and just that simple
just give it the name network and then
I'm just going to copy this guy right
here altogether and then just set this
to network instead of name and this is
going to be country and this is going to
be the US version of life on Mars and
then here
the network name is ABC there you go now
if I want to add C remember I'm going to
have only one TV shows which is the
route and then we have multiple shows
that are also going to contain all of
this other name and network and all that
other different data so if I want to
have multiple shows I need to take these
other elements and assign them to this
element and then assign that to TV shows
which is the route
sounds complicated but it's not all I
need to do is go show add content and
then say what content I want to add
which is going to be name and network so
I just assigned those two elements to go
inside of the show element and then if I
want to put show inside of route along
with all of its children elements I just
go the route and go add content and
throw show inside of there so simple
that is pretty easy and then if I would
want to come in here and create another
show that's real simple I'm just going
to copy this there's no reason to go and
do anything crazy come right after here
and put a little divider in here so I
know where my shows are starting and
ending and of course you could throw
this into a method make it a little bit
easier so I'm just going to show you
just the show to change this to name two
I'm gonna leave these the element names
are still going to be showing name I'm
just going to give them a different
element name inside of my code here
because I have to change that to two
this is going to be a second show so I'm
going to put it to inside of there to
there actually because I'm describing
two different shows with the same name
I'm going to leave that the same this is
going to be network - this is still
going to be called network change that
to network - so if this is going to be
UK instead of US network - BBC show - is
going to be the same this is going to be
the same change that - to change that -
- and the route that's going to add in
the second show okay so I'm almost right
output all right now what I need to do
is I'm if I want to use nice indenting
this is how you do it you go XML you're
gonna see what I mean by nice and dining
here and second you go out Porter XML
output is equal to new XML output her
and then go format dot get pretty format
there you go that's going to make the
XML file look nice just that little bit
and then to actually output it I need to
create a new file so I'm going to go XML
output output and I have to say the doc
is what I'm going to be working with
here and then I need to go new file
output stream and I need to say where I
want to output to file and then this is
going to be different on your computer
but I'm going to go
source and I'm going to call this Jay
Dom made since Jay doll made it throw a
semicolon in her and how about we give a
little message whenever it's written and
then of course I'm going to come up here
to the top need to throw everything in a
try block because it could signal an
error because I'm going out to a file
that might not exist come down here and
close off a try block and then just to
be lazy I'm going to go catch the
exception e^x have N and go VX print
stack trace and then bounce up inside
here go public static void main string
just like always args and let's file
save it and execute it and you can see
over here in the console says wrote to
final let's go see if that's right and
if you come over here on the left side
of screen you can see J Tom made open a
Kyle and there you can see exactly what
it did it created the XML file and threw
all that information in there for us and
it looks exactly the way that we want it
to look now if we're going to do
something even cooler like read from
that file I'm just gonna mark outright
XML and all the code here is available
in a link underneath the video and I'm
gonna create read XML so I'm just gonna
highlight this guy right here bounce
down here and let's create it well it's
gonna be created same way private static
void and then my file and let's start
writing some code okay well I need to
parse all this data that is in our newly
created XML file so I'm going to need to
call sax builder create a new little
builder here go new sax builder simple
enough and then I'm gonna be playing
around with files so I gotta throw it
inside of a try block of course I need
to parse the file that's supplied into
AJ Dom document so I can work with it
document I'm gonna call this read doc
and then I just go builder dot build and
I'm just gonna go to a new file I'm
going to point out the file that I
previously created it's in the source
directory Jade all made dot XML I like
that and if I would like to print out
the screen the root element very simple
print line root Jade all makes working
with XML files very simple J doc get
root element and there you are that's
exactly what that guy's going to do and
you'll see that in a second if I want to
get the text that's found between the
name tags maybe I'm just gonna go to
system.out.print line of course you
could assign these to a variable if you
don't work with them that way and go
shell bounce down to the next line make
this easier and
need to work with my document that I
have here in memory and I'm gonna go
read doc to get that and then you just
pretty much walk your way through the
element tree that's created so get the
root element and then I go get child
which is going to be inside of TV shows
and it's going to be called show and get
child text from name which is inside of
here it's good like that make sure you
keep your cases exactly the same and
that's exactly what that's going to do
formula course spell system right there
we go so that's going to output the text
that's found between the nametags and if
I want to get the attribute value for or
let's say show ID that's assigned a name
pretty simple just go read doc again get
root element walk your way through the
tree again
so get child that has the name show and
then you want to get child that has the
name name right like that and then after
that you go gets attribute value of show
underscore ID at the end of that I'm
going to throw in a new line because
we're going to do something here
different and to show you what all that
looks like let's just get rid of this
try block and let Eclipse complain so
that I can go and have all my exceptions
created for me drift over to the red
part surround with try multi catch boom
pretty easy with that on a separate line
and if we execute that you can see that
it printed out the route which is going
to be TV shows and print it out the
first show that shows up and the show ID
for that show so let's say we want to
print out everything and cycle through
all the children in shows and print them
out the screen to keep the life a little
bit easier I'm going to go element route
is equal to read doc dot get root
elements so that's going to make my life
a little bit easier and I could do the
same with all these other guys but I'm
not going to right now then I'm gonna go
for element le and then I'm gonna go
route got it children of show and cycle
through these guys and print them out on
screen so I can get a system out print
line and say we want to pronounce show
name and this is an enhanced for-loop
you've seen that a whole bunch of time
so I'm not going to get into that and
then if I want to print out my show I
just go or ele dot get child text and
then say I want to get whatever lies
between the name tag pretty simple gonna
copy this boom and I can also print out
my show ID I just need to change couple
things
I'm going to go get child and get name
and then say get attribute-value named
show ID close that off and what the heck
get Network as well so in this situation
change this to show name and I'm
actually going to write a sentence here
so I'm going to type in on and put a
space inside of there leave this exactly
the same except in this situation I'm
gonna say network plus sign in there and
then go space in the leave that the same
and then I'm going to separate this down
here and get rid of this whole entire
thing right there and then go get child
and in this situation get the network
dot get attribute value and in this
situation that's going to be country
right like that and let's throw in a new
line as well just to simplify that make
it look a little bit neater on the
screen and if we execute that you can
see on the right side of the screen that
it prints out what it printed last time
of course but then it prints out real
nice and easy here life on Mars show ID
show one which is the ID number for that
and then it's going to print out this
sentence however I don't like how this
is on a separate line and I know why
it's just a little slip-up let's come in
here and change that from print line
that and there you go now it looks a lot
neater so that is J Tom to leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
