video in which i'll announce not only
the top 5 submissions to my Android app
contest but also the winner and the
winner of course is gonna get a Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 and a Samsung Galaxy gear
SmartWatch delivered hundred percent
free I pay for the shipping and
everything thanks to the wonderful folks
at Samsung you guys did an amazing job
over 34 apps were submitted and many of
them were just fabulous I wish everybody
could win a phone and a watch but that's
not the way it works out so let's go and
look at our final apps and the winner
and here are the final five I have Fort
King math balance button tap challenge
pegboard game and somebody either put
all of my tutorials in an app and the
first finalist is fort king math and it
allows you to practice mathematical
skills and it has a nice presentation
nice loading screen and basically it
just pops up little mathematical
problems on the screen and you mark them
either true or false it's very
professional and I liked it a lot and
then we have balance which is a very
simplistic game but it has wonderful
sound and it is just has great mechanics
I really really liked it and the object
of the game is just to keep the little
red ball up here balanced on top of the
gray ball and get across the screen and
it sounds simple but it takes a lot of
practice to get it over there and
eventually I think I will get it over
there I'm getting there I'm getting
close so I'm getting close I'm getting
closer and closer and this is
particularly hard to do whenever you're
also trying to record at the same time
but now I'm gonna get it right about
here and there you go and then after you
get it you're gonna get another obstacle
you have to work through it's a fabulous
game and then we have button tap
challenge which is a very simple game
again all you do is you have to keep all
of the outside buttons set to on and
then whenever you - you have to jump in
and mash on the center button to keep a
high score or get a high score or
whatever it's very simple but it's very
fun also and then we have pegboard game
which is actually one of my daughter's
favorite little games to play so I'm
pretty well aware of it and know how to
play it pretty well
and you just click on new game it has
all sorts of features allow you to log
and there's leaderboards and you can
turn the volume off it's a very
professional game and here I'm gonna see
if I can get a perfect score on it and
you can drag the pegs see everything
just works exactly the way that you
think that it should and I'm gonna move
this along disclaimer here I have played
this game before many many times like I
said my daughter loves it so I am
probably pretty good at it a little bit
better at it than most people you
probably didn't expect a tutorial on how
to win at the pegboard game but it looks
like that is exactly what you are going
to get here and I just have to move a
couple more pieces into place I've been
a little bit nervous here now I want to
make sure I get a good score and it
looks like it is gonna work out I just
got to move over this piece over here
and then move the top piece down and
this to the left and this to a rope
right okay I'm a genius it says and then
the final app we're gonna look at here
somebody actually went and took all of
my tutorials and put them all in one big
giant app something I wanted to do all
the time and never got around to it as
you saw there I'm really into yoga and
you can just click on any of the
different playlists and the videos pop
up and then it shows the description and
it links into the actual code and it
does pretty much everything you click on
play and it plays out the video right
there every single tutorial I ever did
is all right there don't know if it's
gonna update when I do new tutorials but
I guess I'll find out and while I would
like to give all you guys a free phone I
had to decide on the winner and that is
pegboard game I just really loved it
mainly because of just all of the work
that went into it it goes over how to
play this could have some pictures in it
which would be even better yet but it
has leaderboards as achievements it has
a great game overall I just really
really loved it so the maker of peg
board game can expect an email I'll get
your address and I'll send out your
winning telephone and you're winning
watch and I'd love you guys to leave
comments below I have one more phone to
give away so I'd like you to tell me
what the last contest should
be and what you think about pegboard
game all the apps are in the description
and thank you guys very much
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
