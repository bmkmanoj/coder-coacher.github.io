you how to do a purl stitch last time we
learned how to cast on and how to do a
knit stitch if you know a knit stitch
and a purl stitch you can create a
variety of different patterns I'm going
to start by knitting on the scarf that I
showed you how to knit last time last
time we cast on and then we knit 8 rows
of knit stitches which made the garter
stitch if we do a row of knit stitches
then a row of purl stitches row of knit
stitches a row purl stitches over and
over we create the stockinette stitch
I'm going to show you how to do that now
first we need to make another row of
knit stitches just to review to make a
knit stitch put your your right needle
in the first loop on your left needle
wrap the yarn around and pull through
let's try it one more time put your
right needle in the first loop on your
knit needle wrap around pull through let
the neat the loop on your left needle
fall off
let's continue doing that to the end of
our row this row is 12 stitches long as
was determined in our first video
so here's a full robe nets edges flip
the piece over and let's try making a
purl stitch to make a purl stitch you
insert your right needle into the loop
on your left needle but instead of
inserting it this way as we had been
with the knit stitches you insert the
needle towards you wrap the yarn around
and pull through that is a purl stitch I
always told the reason the purl stitch
it's called a purl stitch is because the
purl stitch sort of has a little bump at
the end of it that looks like a pearl
let's try a purl stitch again insert
your needle pointing toward zero wrap
your yarn around and pull her
so let's continue making purl stitches
to the end of the rail
here's a row of purl stitches see how
all the stitches sort of have a little
pearl at the bottom now we're going to
make a stockinette pattern by creating a
row of knit a row of purl a row knit a
row purl and it's going to look
different than your rows of knits look
your garter stitch your garter stitch
sort of looks like ribbing your
stockinette pattern is going to look
smooth you can see it's already started
this is your robe knits and this is your
row of pearls it's starting to look
smooth so the last row we did was pearl
we're going to knit again I'm going to
do this for eight rows so that you can
really see the difference between the
Garter pattern and the stockinette
pattern on my sample piece here oh ok I
have completed eight rows of alternating
knit and purl stockinette pattern over
top of the Garter pattern and this is
the front side of my scarf and you can
see the difference stockinette looks
nice and smooth garter pattern is lumpy
if you turn it over there's now a
backside to my scarf the Garter pattern
is reversible but stockinette looks
different
on back a couple now I'm going to show
you a couple different patterns now that
you know the knit and the purl stitch
one thing that you can do is vertical
ribbing let's say I have 12 stitches
across here let's say I want to do ribs
that are three stitches wide what I
would do is I would knit three stitches
that would be one rib I would purl three
stitches
knit three stitches
and for all three stitches that's on the
front side on the back side I'm going to
do the exact opposite I ended with three
pearls so I want to start with three
knits one two three then I'm going to do
three pearls I'm going to alternate all
the way across the row and I'm going to
keep doing this knitting and purling
three stitches at a time until I have
eight rows which is just Co an arbitrary
number and you can see the ribbing start
to develop ribbing is nice to use as a
trim if you're knitting a sweater you
often see it at the neck or the sleeves
and it really has a gathering sort of
effect okay i finished my rib stitches
which is pattern of alternating three
Nets three pearls three knits three
pearls and then on the back side doing
the opposite you would knit the pearls
and pearl the knits this is a wide rib
you can imagine you could make your rib
two stitches wide to nets to pearls or
even a singular rib keep on knitting
and before you know it you'll have a
Finnish scarf please leave your
questions and comments below so next
