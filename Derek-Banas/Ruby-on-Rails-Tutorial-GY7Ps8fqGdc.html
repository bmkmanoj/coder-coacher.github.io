one on my Ruby on Rails tutorial over
the course of the next couple videos I'm
going to completely cover the rails web
framework and basically I decided to
cover rails because it's really a
absolutely amazing framework after you
get over the basic differences between
developing rails applications versus
other applications you may be used to
you're really going to be able to
embrace rails and what's great about it
is it's going to provide pre-written
software functionality for creating web
applications it's going to in general
make it very easy to create common tools
used in web development for database
access templating pages authentication
all the things that are normally
complicated are very easy in rails and
on top of that it was written using the
programming language Ruby which is
extremely easy for newcomers to
development in general to grasp so
basically how do we install rails well
first off you're going to need to go get
my SQL because that's the database I
chose to use here because it's very
common and then we're going to have to
go to install rails com all right so
here we are and install rails comm and
this is the easiest way to install
everything just click on start now then
you can pick whatever operating system
you use so if you use Windows use
Windows click on that and it's going to
walk you step-by-step through the entire
process of installing as well as having
a little trouble shooting button down
here everything is right there and of
course it's great because it's going to
cover for Mac Windows as well as Ubuntu
or Linux installations of rails so walk
your way through that and then come back
to this tutorial and we'll start writing
some code alright so basically rails
uses two main concepts that you need to
grasp and like I said it's a little bit
hard to start writing rails applications
but after you get over the initial hump
it gets very easy one thing you need to
know is rails follows two different
premises one is that you should not
repeat yourself or don't repeat yourself
and this just means that we need to
avoid duplicating our code which is
going to make our web application much
easier to maintain on top of that
another principle rails follows is
convention over configuration now rails
provides default ways of doing
everything and what's great about this
is it's going to minimize the amount of
code you have to write to basically what
you've personally decide that you want
to customize about your web application
another great thing about this is that
rails defaults to follow all of the best
practice
is for web application development so
you basically just let it run and don't
worry about how it operates another
thing to understand here is that rails
is built around the MVC pattern which is
Model View controller when somebody goes
to a browser to use your web application
they are going to be routed to one of
many different controllers now the
controller is going to respond to user
events and help translate what is in the
model or the database or whatever out
into a viewable form on the browser
using what we call the view and by doing
things this way each time you change
your view you don't have to change the
model and vice versa and as you see some
examples here it's going to become very
clear while this is the way to develop a
web application another thing to
understand is the controller inside of
rails is referred to as the action
controller and the model is referred to
as the active record and the routing
part down here what's good basically
going to happen is you're going to go to
a browser and like most web applications
you would go to a directory well inside
of rails each thing that looks like a
directory is actually going to be a
different controller and there's going
to be a routing process that goes on
here between the browser and the
controller port and then the view part
of the rails application is going to be
called the action view so you have the
action controller the active record and
the action view when we jump over and
develop a rails application all right so
here we are basically I have sublime
text over here it's a nice text editor
over here I'm going to have my browser
where I'm going to load my application
when it's ready nothing's there right
now so it says no webpage is available
and then down here I have my terminal or
if you're on Windows you're going to
have a command line and I have multiple
tabs open so I'll be able to start the
server and also be able to operate
inside of your course you're going to
want to create some directory where you
want to be able to save everything I
have mine in rails code clear that out
and to develop a rails application
you're basically just going to go inside
of your terminal and you're going to
type in rails new and I'm going to be
creating over the next couple videos a
reddit type of clone and that's why I'm
going to call it read it or whatever you
want to call it there and then I'm going
to type in dash D and I want to use
MySQL so I'm going to type in MySQL and
just hit enter and it's going to
generate all the different files you're
going to need for you right there
now SQL Lite is used
database choice by default but like I
said everybody normally likes to use
MySQL and you can see all the different
gems as a ruby gems and if you do not
know Ruby
for the most part I'm going to cover it
in this tutorial but of course I'm going
to have in the description I'll link to
my Ruby tutorial and definitely check
that out it's a video that basically
covers the whole entire Ruby programming
language in one video so it's pretty
easy to use then after you go and create
this guy you're going to want to tell
something called the bundler to go out
and get everything your application is
going to need and to do that you're
going to type in bundle install like
this and if it says it cannot locate the
gem file you can come in here clear that
out and I'm going to do LS here if
you're on Windows type in dir and you're
going to change into your read it
directory and now come in here and type
in bundle install and you're going to
see that it's going to go and get a
whole bunch of different gem files and
load those in there right there let's
clear that out while we go and take a
look exactly what type of files we have
here and to do that we can just type in
LS and here are all of the files that
were generated for us now the gem file
is going to contain all the gems that
your application needs gem lock is a
file you should never touch because it's
going to have all of your gem files in
there for the bundler so don't worry
about that and the bundler basically
just handles getting gem files and other
dependencies that your web application
needs and for the most part it does it
and you don't need to worry about it
readme right here you can type in some
information about your web application
what it does Raik is going to be a
command we're going to use a lot and
it's going to basically compile our web
application app is where most of the
code you're going to be creating for
your app is going to go it's going to
have your views in there for your
interfaces the model for the functions
and the data and the controller which is
going to handle communication between
the model and the view so they can act
independently the bin directory is going
to contain all the files to run your
application config is going to configure
your routes remember the routes fan
between the browser and the proper
controller and it's going to send you to
the proper controller and you're going
to see examples of that here in a second
DB is going to contain your database
schema which is going to define the
tables and the general or
of your database configured using to
contain configuration rules for starting
your application and then all these
other different files we'll get into as
the tutorial continues now like assets
come in here well if we want to open up
our whole entire directory I'm going to
open everything up in sublime text
inside of my terminal node type in su BL
and then dot and it's going to load
every single file right here all in
sublime text which is going to be very
easy to use
and you can see right here the gem file
if we just want to open up the look at
it here are all of the different gems
and the version numbers you could easily
come in here and change the version
numbers if you need to but for the most
part you're not going to worry about any
of that
another thing that's pretty useful is if
you ever try to execute anything over
here inside of your terminal and
whatever command you put in there
doesn't work very often you can use
bundle to help you along just type in
bundle exec and then whatever command
won't work that's going to help you and
probably go in there and get any
dependencies that you might need so just
something to think about now we would
normally go in here and create your web
application and launch it inside of the
server but because we're using MySQL
we're going to have to change a couple
little things for our database and where
we're going to change those is go over
here to config open this up and then
open up database dot yml and then inside
of this guy we're going to have to make
a couple little different changes one
thing we're going to need to do is point
at the socket we're going to use for
MySQL and how we're going to get this is
you're going to open up my SQL work
bench make sure you get that with MySQL
and we're going to launch that and
whenever that launches just click up
here and you might have to enter your
password and then server status and then
right here is the socket you're going to
use so that's a really easy way to get
the socket that you might need we can
close this and then we come in here and
paste that inside of there another thing
we do not have our database set up yet
so down here we're going to comment this
out for the moment and then right here
you're going to want to put in your root
password temporarily so whatever that
password might be and then you're going
to be done with the database dot yml and
we'll get more into
later on okay so now that that is all
set up we can come over in our terminal
again and start our server just going to
type in rails server like this and hit
enter and there you can see that it ran
and we're going to be able to shut that
down by holding ctrl C what's really
great about rails is it's going to use
the web brick server and launch
everything inside of localhost 3000 so
we can just come up here get rid of this
hit enter and there you can see rails is
installed and ready to be used
now we come in here and generate some
controllers and views and to do so we're
gonna keep our server running you don't
have to shut it down or anything come
down here inside of the terminal and
you're going to type in rails generate
controller and then you're going to have
to put in a name and other different
types of actions that you want also
created so I want to create a controller
it's called welcome and I want to create
an action inside of it which is index
and you can temporarily think of this as
a directory and then another directory
inside of that you're going to see
exactly what they look like here in a
second and then you're going to hit
enter okay so let's take a look at the
different files we created here right
here you can see our controller we'll
look at that up close here real soon you
can also see here our view which we'll
take a look at here in a second and a
couple of tests and helper files as well
as assets for Java scripts and
stylesheets and so forth were also
generated one thing to bring up if you
did have a little bit of a problem here
is if you would type in rails - version
make sure that this comes back as 4.2
again this is only if you have an issue
and you also could come in here and type
in Ruby - V and make sure that it's 2.2
or something that's later than that if
it did not come back as Ruby 2.2 what
you're going to want to do is type in
our VM use Ruby - 2 point 2.0 or a later
version and then execute that to make
sure that Ruby's been updated and then
to update rails Jim update rails - - and
OH - or I with a space - - a no - or doc
like that execute that and then make
sure that all of your versions of Ruby
and rails are all up
that's just if you have some sort of
issue with the terminal now let's go
over and take a look at the controller
right so your controller files are going
to be in the app remember most things
are going to be an app and controllers
and there's welcome controller and there
it is and you can see index right here
which is the action that's assigned to
this controller and this is also going
to be the method that's going to be
executed whenever you call index what
this guy is going to do is render review
for us for index whenever index is
called inside of our application so if
we come over here and just type in index
you're going to see an error for now but
we're going to fix that here and we
could also come over here to the views
section and welcome there it is and open
up our view we'll be playing with both
of those as well
so now what we need to do is open up the
route file so that we will be able to
properly route these guys and to do that
we'll come down here this is actually in
the config directory open up routes and
what we're going to do here is come down
to the root section and uncomment that
that's going to open up our index here
by default then we're going to make some
temporary changes with route here in a
moment so let's just keep everything the
way that it is for now and we'll save
that and then we'll open up our view
again and this is an ARB file or an
embedded Ruby file and that just means
we'll be able to put HTML as well as
Ruby code inside of here so when we just
go and take a look well let's come over
here for a second get rid of this just
to prove that our index has been changed
and we'll get the index version of our
web application and there it is and
that's exactly what we're working with
now if you want to execute Ruby code
inside of here there's basically three
tags you're going to need to have the
bracket with % and this is going to be
Ruby code that is not going to output
that of the screen then you're going to
have this % with an equals and this is
Ruby code without put and then close
that off and then the final one is just
going to be a comment so % and a hash
symbol and comment there you go now you
know all of the different Ruby tags you
can use inside air so let's go and do
something a little bit
let's just leave the comment here just
for the heck of it just we see that what
we're going to do here is we're going to
output some string to the screen let's
just go percent equals so that means
we're outputting something and inside of
here we'll say something like count to
ten close that off and we can throw
break statements in here or whatever it
works with the HTML now let's say we
want to do some code execution that
isn't going to output anything like we
want to have a for loop here that's
going to cycle between zero to zero to
ten so I'm going to type in eleven times
two and as it's sorting through there
it's going to put temporary value for
this for loop in I and then we'll close
that off and now we want to output I to
the screen we can just go look at this
and equal to I close that off and then
we close off our for loop for ourselves
there you go if we save that reload this
you're going to see count the ten prints
out as well as it counts from zero all
the way to ten now I want to jump back
over into routes dot RB and do a little
bit of a change here so that we will be
able to do things like so let's say that
we come over here and while we are able
to come in and type in something like
welcome index and have the index file
pop up we are not going to be able to
come in and say create another view
let's just go create another view come
over here and let's just copy just this
part here and create another view inside
of here new file paste that there and
we're going to call this sample I'm
going to show you how to communicate
between views and we'll call this sample
as well and then name this sample dot
HTML DRB file save as and there it is so
we save that there's another view now
even though we created sample inside of
here if we would go in and then type in
sample instead of index you're going to
see what happens there's a routing error
so we're going to jump over into routes
and we'll temporarily comment this out
and use a previous version that will
allow us to route between multiple
different controllers and so forth so
we're just going to type in : controller
and this works out great whenever we are
just starting off with developing
Rubi so and then what we're going to do
is we're going to say we're going to
route to the controller and if there is
an action - then go - we want to route
to that and then if there is an ID then
we're going to round to - there we will
allow that to happen and this is going
to put a comma and then this is going to
be sent via the get method right like
that want to save that and now you can
see if we load that welcome sample
inside of the browser that it does
indeed load up so that's good now what
we can do is see exactly how we can pass
data from the controller to the
templates or views whatever you want to
call them and how you're going to do
that is first let's go and get our
controller this guy over here open that
up and there it is and let's create a
new action down here let's say Dan fine
sample and what we're going to do is
we're going to be able to pass these
using instance variables so let's call
this controller message and pass in a
value of hello from controller just so
we know that our that's coming from and
then come down here and end this
function now what we're going to be able
to do is open up sample HTML drb if we
want to get that value that was passed
there we could say something like
message from controller and then get on
the next line and put a hash symbol here
at for the instance variable and then
controller message right like this and
then close that off and this is going to
retrieve the value that the controller
wanted to pass and you can see right
there a message from controller hello
from controller one thing to know though
is you're not going to be able to send
data from the view to the controller but
you can do it the other way around now
let's take a look at how to link to our
index page from our sample basically
you're going to use the format of a link
underscore two and then you're going to
have whatever your link text is and then
that's going to be followed by whatever
your link is and inside of the link area
we're going to actually be able to link
referencing the controller in the action
using something of the format of
controller equal to and then welcome
list your controller inside of there and
then you could also give in here and
type in your action specifically which
would be in this situation
index we're actually going to do it that
way just so that it makes
so let's come in here create our link
now we have output we want to put on the
screen so we're going to put it like
this and we're going to go link to and
then whatever the link is going to be so
let's say link to index like this and
then down on the next line we're going
to type in controller and point towards
welcome and then down on the next line
for our action we're going to type in
index and then close that off and reload
that you can see it go to index is right
here if we click on it we went over the
index page another thing you can know is
since we have the sample inside of the
same view container as sample we could
actually come in here and get rid of
this all together and let's do that
save that reload it here we are again
make sure we reload it go to index and
it's still going to work exactly the
same now if we want to change the sample
view here to pass additional parameters
in a URL so let's say that we wanted to
put an ID and we wanted to pass that
over we can just type in ID we're using
symbols here which is a ruby format and
then let's say we just want to pass
something random random and that random
thing will be my name there we go
make sure you have that closed off could
save that then we could jump over into
the controller part and inside of the
index area we could say something like
if params and has key for ID and params
has random I thought it just change this
to random like this well in that
situation we're going to create an
instance variable again and go params ID
and random instance variable as well
Bram's random we could use either the ID
or the symbol itself then we want to
make those available and we'll jump over
inside of index we can do the same sort
of thing so we might as well just copy
this right there jump back over here so
if we're gonna have to put this side of
our braces here our tag if params has
key ID and random close that off throw a
break statement in there then we could
go and get the value that was passed
here using the instance variable just
gotta go in ID : and
then we could do the same thing params
will you pass numerous parameters of
course ID only need one curly brace here
copy this do this the same way then
we're going to do the same thing for
random as well this there and then we'll
type in random change this to random and
of course we have to close off this if
statement then write like that now we
can jump over here
reload there is sample click on go index
oops got a little bit of an error there
let's come back over here that's right
forgot that one little bracer reload it
again go index and there you can see 5
was passed over with the ID and random
was passed over with there that's just
one way to communicate between all of
these different views as well as the
controller now what I'm going to do is
set up the MySQL database that we're
going to be using here so just jump over
in the terminal as well open this up
fullscreen and if I want to log in to
MySQL I need to type in MySQL 5 you
might need to type in just MySQL it's up
to you I'm going to log in here first
off as the root user and then P and R in
password for the root and there is MySQL
all opened up and ready for us to create
a user just specifically for our web
application we're working with here the
first thing we want to do is come in and
create our database and I thought it
would be good to cover all this stuff
and I'm going to call this reddit
development because this name right here
is or read it whatever is a normal
convention for naming things whenever
you're working with rails and that's how
easy that is create that we could then
say something like show databases and
you're going to see reddit development
is right there there scroll back if I
want to switch over to my new database
that I just created
write it underscore development there it
is and now I want to create a user
specific lift just for this database so
I'm going to say
grant all privileges on and we're gonna
call this reddit development dot star
always do the same there too and let's
create a new user called reddit admin at
symbol local host identified by and then
you're going to type in a password for
this user so let's just make it password
just for now and put the semicolon in
there now
what we can do is say exit leave MySQL
and then log back in as that user read
it admin in this situation and there we
are back inside of here and now we can
come in and say use reddit development
and now that we have all that setup we
can go over into the database yml file
and correct all of our database issues
alright so here we are in database dot
yml first thing I'm going to do is come
in here and type in our new username for
the guy that we just created and we call
it reddit admin going to type in the
password for this of course use a better
password than that reddit development C
I use the same database name for
creating the database is what we
previously had there generated
automatically for rails save that ok and
inside of the terminal we are going to
call a rake DB : schema : dump and what
this is going to do is connect our web
application to our database as well as
create a schema dot RB file in our DB
directory so that our database can be
portable to any other hosting company or
wherever we want to host this guy and
there it is creating that right now and
everything is all set up so now what we
go in here is a final thing and create a
database table and demonstrate what
migrations are exactly how they work I'm
not going to use this anymore so just
close that up now basically inside of
rails whenever you create a table you're
going to automatically generate
instructions for both creating as well
as deleting database tables and this is
like I said before going to allow us to
move our application to another
environment and recreate all the tables
that we need now to generate our user
model which I'm going to use for our
read it reddit type of knockoff I'm
going to need to come over here and
generate a model once again the server
is still running over here inside of
this other tab didn't have to shut that
down at all to be able to do all these
other different things now if we want to
come in here and generate a model which
is going to represent our users in our
little web application we're gonna type
in rails generate model and I'm going to
call this just basically a user let's
make it uppercase user and hit enter and
you can see right here
all the different files that are created
there is our migrate file and if we come
over here to DB for our database and
migrate you're going to see the migrate
file right there we're going to do
inside of here now is define all of the
different things that are going to go
inside of our database this guy right
here is automatically going to generate
timestamps for whenever a user is first
created as well as anytime a user is
updated which we'll see when we look at
the database and just to keep this very
simple I'm going to come in here and
create a string which is what I want my
emails to be represented as and I'm
going to store an email inside of here
for our database and you can put in all
sorts of other different options like
let's say that I want the maximum size
to be 50 type in limit there with 50 and
let's say that I also don't want this to
have a value of false and if you've ever
worked with a database
you're gonna know exactly what this is
doing if you want to create another
column in another different way could
also go in here and type in column
general and I'm also going to want to
store a password for my users and then
come in and put string here see here I
put in string there here I'm putting a
string there just defining the type of
data that I want to store inside of here
and I could also come in and of course
do a limit and let's say that we also
don't want that to be null and let's say
that we want this to be a password
maximum length of 30 instead of 50 this
guy right here the timestamps thing this
is actually just like by putting that in
there is just like if you say if you
would go in and go t dot date time
created created at and then also went
and created another one of these guys
that was called updated at but you don't
need those just one a foot adjust like
that if you want to with the different
data types you can use here instead of
strings you could use strings of course
and you could use binary boolean data
type date/time of course already covered
that decimals float integer and why we
want to do this inside of rails rather
than creating these different tables
inside of the database themselves is
rales is going to allow us to switch
databases if we need it's going to
automatically generate this for multiple
different databases and then we have
text and then we have just basic time so
those are all the different data types
that are available whenever we're trying
to create this and they're automatically
going to work with the proper database
no matter what you would use and in
regards to options you have see I had
limit here and here I have null you're
also going to be able to come in and go
default and create a default value so
whatever that value would be and for
decimals you would also be able to come
in and go precision and whatever that
value would be and you'd also be able to
put scale inside of there and once again
that's just for decimals and what's also
cool with rails is your auto
incrementing IDs those are automatically
going to be created for all of the
different records every single time
they're updated for your users table you
have here another thing we could do is
like I said we're going to be able to
recreate our tables but we also could
come in here and define exactly what
would happen to end or delete our tables
so let's come in here move that end up
there to the proper place and instead of
change here what we can do is define
this as up and then come in here and
define another method as down and what's
going to happen here is this is going to
allow us to come in and drop our tables
and that's how easy it is to drop our
tables there's end so you just leave it
the way it is or you can use up-and-down
and be able to traverse backwards and
forwards now if we want to come in here
and execute our migration file clear
that off and create our tables for
ourselves you just go rake DB and
migrate and you can see right there the
table was created actually you could go
into MySQL open this up we're in MySQL
no use read it development and we could
say describe users and you can see it
automatically created the auto
incrementing ID the email the password
there's created two ATS and there's
updated at so it automatically created
all of those things for us inside of our
database and if we jump over here you're
going to see our migration file right
here so inside of here
open that up and you can see right there
where it creates our users table inside
of our database another thing that's
interesting is we would actually be able
to revert backwards and forwards between
these different migrations and I might
as well cover that here as I finish off
clear that of course get out of my SQL
and if you wanted to jump over and
revert back to a previous migration file
let's say when to revert the whole way
back to nothing so that the users table
isn't even generated you just type in DB
migrate version equal to zero that would
take you back to the very end and
otherwise if you wanted to issue a
migration again what we would do is just
get our timestamp for our previous
migration how we do that is DB migrate
colon status this is going to show us
all of our different migration files
which is just the different states of
our database creation that's all say
there was create users so if you wanted
to come in and revert back to another
migration just go migrate version is
equal to and then take this guy right
here and revert back to that but we're
already there so we don't need to do
that alright guys so there is sort of
like a run-through of a whole bunch of
different things you just an overview of
using rails and a whole bunch of
different tools you would need in the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
continue making our little read it type
of web application and cover pretty much
everything else please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
