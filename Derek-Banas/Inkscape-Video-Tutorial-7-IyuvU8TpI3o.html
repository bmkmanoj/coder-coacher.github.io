7 of my escape video tutorial today I'm
going to finish up covering everything
with a filter editor we're going to
focus in on displacement map morphology
image and convolve matrix and if you
didn't watch part 6 I provide a link to
it in the upper right hand corner as
well as in the description for the video
and it's important to watch it because
there's a little bit of a bug with
filter editor that I show you how to fix
in part 6 so if you have any problems
that's where to find your answer more
than likely so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so here we are
inside of Inkscape and here is filter
editor of course we open that up by just
going filters and then coming down here
and going filter editor and it opens up
and we're going to get ourselves an
image and the first thing we're going to
cover is displacement maps and basically
a displacement map is just going to
accept an image and it's only accept
another image known as a displacement
map and that displacement map is going
to define how the other image is warped
and I'll give you an example and we'll
make a hundred percent sense so just
click on file and then import and you
can use regular graphics you can use
pictures use whatever let's just come in
here and let's find something here real
easy so let's just say I don't know
here's a veggie burger or hamburger what
do you want to call it and let that be
set for embed and hit OK and there it is
and let's just enlarge this a little bit
so we'll be able to see it better and
it's an HD video so if you can't see it
you had full screen and we're going to
be creating a new filter so let's just
come in here and hit new and there's
that filter then we need to create our
displacement map now I'm just going to
draw a little rectangle overtop of this
picture of a hamburger or a veggie
burger and then I'm going to come up
here to and I'm going to show you how to
do this with filters and not with
filters in regards to generating the
displacement map so filters image
effects and then let's just say film
grain you can use pretty much any of
them so there that is
then we're going to take the film grain
and throw it behind our little hamburger
we have right here gonna select this guy
this is the filter we'll be working with
and I'm going to say that I want to link
this image to the displacement map so
I'm going to come in here and I'm going
to find image and I'm going to click on
add effect make sure this is pointed to
the source graphic and then I'm also
going to come in here and I'm going to
find displacement map and add
fact and that is going to link all those
up going to have to have the first
little guy here pointing to the image
and the second one pointing to the
background image and scroll down here
and basically what scale is going to do
is define how much our image is going to
be warped and the X displacement and Y
displacement are going to define the
color channels that are going to be
warped now there is no transparency so
I'm going to get rid of alpha I'm just
going to pick blue and green just for
the heck of it and select filter of
course put a little tick inside of there
and you're going to see that the filter
is coming through or the displacement
map is coming through and distorting
that and if we heighten it it's going to
distort it more and more and more and
more so that is how we would use a
filter displacement map to distort our
hamburger let's come in here and let's
just remove that all together and now
I'm going to show you how to distort it
using not a filter don't know how to say
that and we can just get rid of this
also remove and with that let's get rid
out as well I also received some
questions in regards to changing objects
into patterns so in this situation I'm
going to go the long way here and I'm
going to cover that as well let's just
zoom out of here basically I'm going to
create a displacement map just from
using regular images so let's say that I
want to create a sort of ripple effect
come in here to path and then I'm going
to need stroke and fill so just click on
that guy and that's going to open up
there it is and let's say I want to do a
radial gradient on this and let's also
come in here and I'm going to say edit
want to edit this gradient and let's
just come in there and let's change this
well let's go add stock take a look at
the skin click on that change that to a
full Alpha come in here change this to
full alpha I'm just messing around with
gradients come back inside of there and
let's raise this way way up to black and
I'm just sort of doing this out of my
head or to white and there you can see I
have created sort of a droplet and
that's perfectly fine now what I'm going
to do is make couple copies that stack
them on top of each other and make
something that's going to end up being a
pattern is going to be big enough for
this so let's just do copy and a ctrl
alt or control option paste on top and
let's enlarge this throw it behind there
it is and let's do that again
copy Patrol option paste on top and
let's enlarge it again
and throw it behind and then let's do
another copy ctrl alt option paste and
I'm doing this for his very specific
example the person watching this will
realize what I'm doing and it doesn't
hurt if you don't know okay so this
should be big enough to cover our whole
entire hamburger I'm going to hit ctrl G
to group this yes it does cover the
whole entire thing and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go in here to object
and I'm going to come down to pattern
and I'm going to say objects to pattern
like that and there that's going to be a
pattern now now I can come in here and
draw my rectangle over top of my
hamburger like that there that is I'm
going to convert this into a pattern and
you can see there is our pattern and
going to come over click on the node
tool there's a node tool and I'm going
to move this around and basically how
it's going to be moved around is with
this little X that's sticking way out
here so I'm just going to move it into
position and that looks perfectly fine
now you can see that a pattern or just a
regular old graphic is going to be used
as our displacement map this time and
let's just come in here and enlarge that
and there we go take this throw it
behind just like we did before and we're
going to get our filter editor again and
I'm going to drag this up here so that
it fits there we go come in here hit add
new select this guy over here just like
we did before we're going to come in
here a displacement map and we're going
to go image and add effect and it's
pointing to the source graphic and then
and I'm going to come in again and image
and I'm going to pick displacement map
this time just like we did before and
hit out effect and there that is drag
this guy over once again to the
background image there that is turn on
our filter I'm going to change out the
blue change this to green and I'm going
to start D Storting it as you can see
it's being distorted on top of that
image that is in the background so
whatever I just pulled that right out of
my head as an example you can use all
kinds of other filters and squigglies
and all kinds other things as
displacement maps but there is an
example or actually two examples of
using displacement maps I'm going to do
something kind of cool I'm going to
cover morphology basically what it is
used for is for thinning or swelling an
object let's keep our hamburger here and
let's just show you an effect like let's
say I wanted to create sort of like an
under painting sort of image so I just
select my image that I have here I'm
going to come in to filter hit add new
and then I'm going to find morphology
there's morphology hit add effect very
very easy to work with now what I'm
going to be able to do is either pick a
road or dilate let's try a road and then
change the radius and that's going to
affect our image of course make sure
that you have the filter selected and as
you can see with a road it's sort of
going to darken it and with a dial eight
picked on there there it is
you see that it is adding sort of a
sparkle effect to it
that might seem worthless but I'm going
to show you something really cool
there's sort of like your under painting
sort of thing or your fade or whatever
you want to refer to but what's really
cool about this is I can actually do a
neon type of sign using morphology and
it's very cool
how I'm going to demonstrate this I'm
going to draw myself a rectangle on our
screen and let's make it black and then
I'm going to come in here and get some
text and let's just say neon and let's
say that I want this to be bright red
right like that and then let's increase
the size of it so that you can see it on
the screen there it is
and I'm actually going to make this
stroke by holding down shift and
clicking on red be red and then the
regular fill is not going to be red I'm
in here get this and go to stroke width
stroke style width and let's change this
to something like nine there it is nice
and easy to see on the screen then I'm
going to add a whole bunch of different
filters some that you've seen before and
morphology which you've kind of seen
okay so open up the filter editor I'm
going to come in it and hit new then I'm
going to add a whole bunch of effects so
we're going to have the color matrix in
here so that we can have the pixels sort
of manipulate the images that are around
or the other pixels that are around them
so come up to color matrix and I covered
color matrix in the last tutorial so
we'll just say add effect and I want
this to be pretty even the way the
distortions are going to occur so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to set this
which is the red 2/3 and the blue also
2/3 and this guy also 2/3 and then
change this to negative 2 which is going
to equal out to 1 3 minus 2 is equal to
1 and there we go and there we go right
like that there we go perfect now what
I'm going to do is use the morphology
and what the morphology is going to do
is it is going to use Gaussian blurs to
warp out and create the neon effect so
let's just come in here and say Gaussian
blur add and then Gaussian blur again
and add there we go I actually forgot to
put the morphology after color matrix
which is where I want it no problem just
click on morphology hit add effect come
up here grab it and drag it into
position perfect then what we need to do
is merge both of the Gaussian blurs
which are going to give us sort of a
glowing effect and to do that of course
we're going to use merge and add effect
and this is basically going to merge the
Gaussian blurs as well as or well the
source graphic is going to be linked to
with a second Gaussian blur right like
that
morphology is going to be directly
connected to color matrix and I'll show
you what that's going to do in a second
for this Gaussian blur right here and
come
inside of here and I'm going to set this
to right around 6:00 good enough going
to be pointing to the morphology just
like it is this guy's going to be
pointing to the source graphic so we're
going to not make much of a change here
and just let that be one no problem and
then we need to use the merge to merge
both of the Gaussian blurs I'm up here
linked to that guy linked to this guy
right like that now when you do it you
know let's just click on filter you're
going to see that there is a slight blur
there we're gonna have to go into
morphology and now we're going to be
able to dilate it and create the effect
that we are looking for so just come
down here to dilate click on that and
there you go it's not doing anything yet
but as we increase the radius you can
see that really easily by combining just
a whole bunch of these different filter
editors we're going to bring across the
idea of neon so kind of cool so now
let's go and take a look at convolve
matrix now convolve matrix is going to
be used for blurring embossing
sharpening highlighting of edges and a
whole bunch of other different things
and to demonstrate this I'm actually
going to import a PDF something else I
got asked about so file and let's say
import and let's find myself a PDF so
and there's PDF double click on that
there it is
hit OK and there I just imported myself
a little man now I'm going to be playing
around with this now basically the
convolve matrix is going to take
multiple different I'm not going to get
in the complexities it's basically going
to take multiple different functions and
make changes to other pixels that are
around focused on pixels you're going to
say again don't worry about the
intricacies I'm going to show you a
whole bunch of examples and you'll be
able to play with those examples to
better understand exactly how it works
basically what it's going to do is going
to take pixels around the target pixel
and perform calculations to create new
colors just to keep it nice and simple
so if we come in here
we're going to go create ourselves a new
filter and convolve matrix there it is
and hit add effect and there you go I'm
going to go over these here real quickly
basically the size is going to define
the size of our matrix the target this
guy right here is going to define the
X&amp;amp;Y coordinates for the matrix but
they're not going to have major effects
on anything so you can pretty much
ignore those and then what you're going
to do is change kernel values to define
changes in pixel colors so this is going
to be one of the major parts right here
the most important part and pretty much
what you need to know the most important
part about messing around here is if you
use the same nonzero values for all of
these different guys here you're going
to receive consistent changes or warps
or whatever to your set image or the
graphic in this situation and then after
all the numbers in the kernel matrix
that's what this guy is called right
here are going to be added together
they're going to be divided by our
divisor that we have right here and if
the divisor is the sum of the values
then once again you're going to know
that your color changes are going to be
consistent across your image and then
the bias this guy right here this little
slider right here as it is decreased
it's going to make changes to the
graphic image you're focused on and as
it increases it's going to make changes
to the area that surrounds you're
focused on graphic
once again better to actually look at
this and see it working so let's say
that we wanted to blur consistently our
little businessman here and let's just
enlarge him so you'll be able to see him
really good on the screen there he is
well leaving this set for three three
makes a lot of sense because we want to
do a consistent sort of blur across the
whole entire thing target we can just
pretty much ignore and just let it be
zero zero that's perfectly fine remember
we want consistency and the changes and
remember I said nonzero values so let's
just go in here and change all of this
to one and then you're going to say
already you can see that the little guy
is blurred and make sure
you have this checked up here a lot of
people forget that and then as we move
the divisor you're going to see that our
little man slowly sort of disappears or
is blurred and then like I said with the
bias as we decrease this it's going to
make the changes occur with our graphic
so there you go there's the graphic
slowly disappearing and you can see all
the different effects you can get here
with just a simple slider and as it is
increased it's also going to be changing
the area around your graphic and you can
see there very easily we achieved sort
of a cutout effect that's I'm saying
about this basically my whole idea here
is to show you the basics of what is
going on so that you'll be able to come
in here and properly play with this
stuff because that's really the way
you're going to find new things is
through playing and then the edge mode
forgot to talk about that what this is
going to do is extend the effect across
the image or define how it is going to
be extended across the image Elin also
preserve alpha is going to define
whether transparency is enforced or not
so there you go covered every single one
of those tools now let's say that we
wanted to come in here and emboss this I
want to leave these set four three three
let this set to zero no problem and I'm
going to come in here and I'm going to
change this to eight or something around
that area and then for each one of these
ones I'm going to change them to
negatives so I'll change that to
negative that's a negative negative and
there we go right like that now we can
come in here and you can already see it
looks a little bit funky we come into
the divisor and let's raise this guy up
to something around well there's ten
let's try doing something around the
five area right there and then remember
we want to change such we want to emboss
this we want to affect the graphical
area the white area that surrounds our
businessman so I'm going to go into the
bias area right here and increase that
that's how we affect everything else
here and let's just come in here and go
0.6 and there you can see that we
embossed the guy and we can also change
these values here well that's a little
bit too extreme we can change the
divisor here just by dragging it and get
other really cool effects just by
dragging a little slider so that's
really cool you could also do edge
detection again I'm going to leave this
three three let this be zero
let the kernel be exactly the way it is
and then change our divisor to around
I don't know 4.8 as you can tell I've
done this before and then change our
bias to one and there you can see you're
getting sort of an edge detection on to
that guy and we can move this around
take this down just a little bit and
just all the neat little things you can
do here just by playing with this a
little bit we raise this up a little bit
more take this in a little bit more and
as you can see I'm just kidding really
cool effects just by moving this slider
just a tiny tiny little hair you could
also come in here and create a motion
blur in this situation when everything
consistent from the left to the right so
I'm going to go five and do this with a
one since we're going to do a motion
blur from one direction in the next leaf
the targets be zero and there we go I
was just showing that change all of
these guys to one every one of them
there we go and then change my divisor
inside of here to 4.0 and my bias to
zero point zero so it's not doing
anything with it and you can see that
there's sort of a motion type of blur to
that guy and then finally how about we
sharpen everything this situation we go
back to three three right like that
target zero just like the air before and
then with this guy we're going to do a
change this to zero just a negative one
zero negative 1 5 negative 1 I think
you're getting the gist of what I'm
doing here negative 1 and then 0 again
then I'm going to come in and get the
divisor have that be set to 1 and the
bias to 0 and there you can see that we
have sort of a sharpen or a sharpened
edge type of look for a little man we
got there so there are a whole bunch of
different ways to play around with
displacement maps and image and
morphology and convolve matrix it's a
lot of fun to come in here and sort of
explore with it and check out what can
be done please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
