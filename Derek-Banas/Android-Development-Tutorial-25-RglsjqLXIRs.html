25 of my android development tutorial
today you guys are gonna find out why it
was such a good idea to subscribe to my
youtube channel because over the course
of the next couple tutorials I'm going
to show you how to develop for the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and a ton of other
things so basically what's going to be
covered of the course in the next couple
tutorials is I'm going to show you how
to get the SDK I'm going to show you how
to use it how to move the libraries
around and get everything in working
order I'm also going to show you how to
create a working emulator we're going to
cover a lot of the thought processes
that go through using an outside SDK and
exactly how to use api's to accelerate
your learning experience and to increase
your ability to get an app done quickly
and on top of that we're going to create
a very complex pane application through
which I'm going to show you how to
create toolbars use the samsung s canvas
retrieve images from a gallery use
toasts
use on activity result to receive data
after another activity ends use menus
and use the Samsung animated multimedia
message class and a whole bunch more oh
did I mention I'm also going to be
giving away a samsung galaxy note 3 to
one of you guys out there on top of that
I'm also going to be giving away not one
not two but three Samsung Galaxy gear
watches and this is all being brought to
you because the Samsung smart app
challenge for 2013 specifically for the
Galaxy Note which is going on right now
and will continue through November the
30th and you will get a chance to win
1.1 million dollars in that challenge
but specifically for my challenge what
I'm gonna do to decide who gets to win
the Galaxy Note 3 and who gets to win
one of the galaxy gear watches is I am
going to have you guys out there make an
app and then do a video tutorial about
that app of course there's going to be
bonus points if you make an app using
the S Pen SDK intent and I'm also
guessing if a bunch of you guys make
videos that the nice people at Samsung
will allow me to continue to
give awesome electronics for free to you
so with the Samsung smart app challenge
you're gonna have the opportunity to win
1.1 million dollars and with me you're
gonna have the opportunity to win the
greatest phone in the world or one of
three awesome Galaxy gear watches so I
have a whole lot to do so let's get into
it
okay so I just thought I'd make certain
that you guys know exactly how the
Samsung Smart app challenge is going to
work basically it's what's going to
happen is you submit an app by going to
this website up here and I'll provide a
link and description for the video and
they are going to select twelve winning
apps that best incorporate the pen
package or look package in the Samsung
Mobile SDK and the winning entries of
course like I said before will receive a
total of 1.1 million dollars in prizes
so really cool now on to how to set up
everything and win some of the prizes
that I'm offering okay so basically the
very first thing you don't want to do
and again I'm going to have a link to
all this stuff in the description is
you're going to want to download the SDK
and this is at developer samsung comm la
la la blah just as you see there on your
screen whenever you do that you're going
to go right here where it says download
and click that and download it now I've
gone through all of this ahead of you
guys to cut down on any of the bugs that
might come about one bug that may occur
and this is a bug that occurs with
people that use Mac's only is whenever
you download the S Pen SDK 2.3 you're
going to see something like this
basically if this happens to you you're
going to have to have somebody with a PC
download it and then give it to you like
I said this is something that occurs
sometimes and it's a workaround I'm also
going to provide a link on my website to
the working version of this folder setup
and that is going to look exactly like
this now inside of it we're going to
have some sample little applications
we're going to be able to work with but
what's really important is this libs
folder library folder that we have right
here if we open that up you're going to
see right here everything you're going
to need tool wise to start working with
the S Pen SDK and basically what you're
going to need to do let's just copy
those guys and I'm going to be using
eclipse just like I always do and we're
just going to go over here in our
package Explorer inside of Eclipse we're
going to right-click we're going to go
new and we're going to go Android
application project and open that up and
I'm just going to call this Samsung S
Pen example and I'm going to change this
to my website and I'm also going to
change this right here to 14 Ice Cream
Sandwich just to make sure we don't have
any problems at all I'm gonna hit next
and I'm just going to create this whole
thing by hitting next next next next
next and hitting finish that is going to
open up Samsung S Pen example and those
library files that I told you about are
going to go in this directory right here
libs so just click on that right click
and hit paste and there they are and
that is how easy it is to get everything
inside of there so pretty simple and
like I said before if you have a problem
with that directory being all messed up
I'll provide a link in the description
for this video for where you can get it
in its non messed up form but like I
said that's only if you have that issue
now we get to exactly how we are going
to create an emulator that is going to
allow us to run this code
well basically whenever I'm trying to
create an emulator inside of Eclipse I'm
going to want to have device specs and
I'm just using the galaxy note 2 in this
situation which works perfectly fine now
as I'm looking at the specs I see that
the display is five point five five
inches which is very very important I
don't need to really worry about the
camera and all that and then I also want
to cycle down through here where I see
display and I see here 1280 by 720 and
then I'm also going to come down here
and see that the RAM is two gigabytes
and this is the memory and the microSD
slot and how much memory it holds and
that is basically all I need to be able
to set up a working emulator so just
remember five point five five inches and
remember 1280 by 720 well now I can jump
into eclipse
and click on this little guy up here and
when I do it
going to have a pop up and I want to
first go in here to where it says device
definitions and I already created this
I'm 100% certain that it's going to work
and I'm going to use galaxy note 2 and
if I hit edit on this you're going to
see the exact setup you're going to have
to use for your device your emulator I
called it the galaxy note 2 you can see
right there five point five five inches
720 by 1280 I turned everything on down
here in RAM
I put 2048 megabytes of course the size
is going to be large the screen ratio is
going to be long and the density is
going to be set for X HDP I button is
going to be controlled by software and
everything else here is great now that I
have that set up I'm going to go over
into Android virtual devices and you can
see the guy that I created right here
I'm going to hit edit you'd hit new and
this is exactly what I'm going to do I'm
going to take what I created previously
in device definitions and I'm going to
use that as my device I'm going to use
Android 4.2.2 because that worked good
I'm also going to come in here and
change this to arm hardware keyboard
da-da-da-da-da Ram I had to mess around
with the heap to get that to work right
everything works great now internal
storage 200 megabytes an sdcard 1,024
and of course use host GPU and that is
how I set up the emulator to work so
that we'll be able to test out all of
this software and in case you're
wondering this is going to actually be
the app that we make and yes it does
come as an example program from Samsung
however whenever you see code like that
it's just not really commented and
sometimes you think to yourself well
what exactly does this line of code do
or what does this other code do or
whenever you're using multiple different
classes and multiple different layout
files and multiple different images well
how exactly do they work together over
the course of the next couple tutorials
as many as it takes I'm going to explain
everything that goes into making a
complex application like this from the
ground up so that is basically
everything for now in this part of the
tutorial however if any of you guys are
out there trying to figure out well how
exactly am I going to work with the S
Pen SDK well
what I did or how I learned about how it
works is I went to this website right
here again I'll provide a link to it in
the description and this is the API for
everything and I just dug through
everything you see here on the screen
and all the example code and I learned
how everything worked and if you want to
win that awesome galaxy note phone this
is probably the next place you should go
and start learning about all this stuff
but of course I'm going to cover a lot
of it in the tutorial so I wish all you
guys the best start making those apps
start recording those videos leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
