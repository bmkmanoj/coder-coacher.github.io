25 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to go over the list
component and as you can see here I went
ahead and done a couple things ahead of
time that you know all about so there's
no point in going over it again and to
create a list component you just type in
GA list just like we've done before
and I'm going to show you two of them
because there's technically two ways of
doing lists and I'm going to also create
a default list model and what this is
going to allow you to do is create a
list of items that then will be editable
the default way of using lists does not
allow you to change those different list
items so we're going to also use a
default list model to be able to do that
and you're going to see here in a minute
through example exactly how that works
and then finally I'm also going to add a
scroll pane or scroll borrowers who are
listed and there you go and here's where
I'm going to create our frame or make
call to our constructor inside of our
class here's where I'm defining the size
here's where I'm laying everything in
the middle of the screen here is where
I'm handling all of the closing events
whenever this thing's closed here's the
title for our frame this is the creation
of the panel that is going to go inside
of the frame of the window this is the
creation of the button this is adding
listener for the button and again adding
the listener for the button and this is
how we add the button to the panel so
skipped over a whole bunch things
because you already know about them now
one way that we can add items to a list
component is to again create an array of
different strings and here I'm just
going to throw in a couple different
movies as they come to mind so let's
just say matrix K so now I have my array
of strings now to both create a list box
and also add this array of strings I
just got to refer back to the name for
this little list component and then go
new and then go to a list say goodman
again and again we're doing the same
sort of things with these components and
then i'm also going to define a couple
other different things here i'm going to
say that i want to set the height for
this guy this is going to be every
single part or every cell of my list so
let's just click on that save yourself
some time and then the height i'm going
to put in here I'm going to put 30 and
then we're gonna do pretty much same
sort of thing we're going to define the
cell width set fixed
and then here we're going to click on
with and in this situation I'm going to
put 150 inside of there one of these
lists is going to look really nice the
other one's going to look not so nice
either way it's good to know how to set
up all these different things and then
you have to set up your selection mode
and I'm going to go over all these
different things I'm going to use list
selection model and I'm going to come in
here and type in single interval
selection and what single interval
selection means is you want people to
have the option to select as many of
whatever they want in the list as long
as they select them in order and as we
go through and I show you different
examples here this is the most confusing
one it's basically saying if you have
say item 1 an item to an item 3 they can
select 1 &amp;amp; 2 but they could not select 1
&amp;amp; 3 at the same time and there's
different ways of doing these you could
also have multiple interval selection
inside of there and that would allow
people to select whatever they want in
whatever order and then you have single
selection which means that they can only
select one thing at a time
so play around with that and you'll
figure it out there's a whole bunch of
different methods that go along with
this type of list which I'm not I'm
going to go through here but I'm not
going to cover in totality because I
find using this guy up here the default
list model is a much better way of
playing around with lists and you see
here all the different methods that are
available for lists you have get
selected index and what this does is
return the index for the first selected
item and get selected indexes returns
all of the indexes for every item then
you have get selected value just returns
the first selected item get selected
values it selects and throws everything
in well ray and gives you all the
selected items and then is selected
index returns true if the index is
selected so those are all the different
things but like I said you're probably
more than likely going to use my default
list model and again to create that
we're going to use both but I didn't
want to go into detail something that
you're probably not ever going to use
but it's also very good to understand
that it does exist if somebody decides
to use old broken sort of list tools and
you come across that so here I'm going
to create favorite colors and pink so I
just created another array of string
items and here what I'm going to do is
I'm going to load them into the default
list model and then I'm
going to load it into the list component
in one way that you can load these in is
in here and type in color you've seen
this guy before allows you to easily
manipulate your way through different
arrays if I want to load all these items
in here individually just type in depth
list
model dot add element see there's no way
you can do this with the other type of
list item I'm just going to type in
color in this situation okay so that's
going to load all of those different
items into that little container called
the default list model and I'll go
through all of the methods that are
available with this guy because it's
very useful so let's say that after you
create this you also want to define or
add an additional item into the index
too and let's say that this is purple is
what you want to put in there just that
simply you can then load that inside of
there then after you have all these
different items added in here you want
to call favorite colors which is the
list component itself and then go equals
new J list and load in that little box
that's going to contain all those
different strings that you want shown up
in the list component then we can come
in here and say that we only want to
show some of the items so let's say you
only want to show the first four items
in the list that's exactly how you would
do that and then what we're going to do
is we're going to call our scroller
which is our scroll pain that's going to
allow us to add scrolling functionality
this guy and just go to new a scroll
pane like we did in previous tutorials
and then here we're going to put
favorite colors inside of here and then
we're also going to say that we want to
use scroll bars as needed and then we're
also going to do this for horizontal and
close that off there you got your little
scroll pane and then with favorite
colors we're also going to come in here
and define the sizes for our cells let
me paint all this information again it's
set fixed cell height and then we're
also going to put 30 inside of their
course and put it wherever you want set
fixed and then we'll come in here and
put the width in as well and then to the
panel I'm going to add favorite movies
don't want to forget to do that and then
also we want to add the scroller
remember if you're going to use a scroll
panel you do not add the list in the
same way you instead put the list item
which is this favorite colors in
the scroller and then you add the
scroller to the panel something that's a
little bit confusing and then we're
going to say this and I'm going to add
the panel to the frame and then as you
see here I already got this in here this
is where we're going to add the panel to
the frame or the window and here is
where we're going to say that we want
the window or the frame to be shown as
visible so that's all we're going to
need to do down here and just so you can
see exactly what we've been working on
I'm going to execute this guy you'll be
able to see the different types of Lists
that are available to you in your yard
here's the basic list and if you can't
see this view it full screen it's all HD
you'll be able to see it in the
different ways you can select different
items as you can see here I'm trying to
select both matrix and big and it's not
allowing me to do it that's what I was
referring back to whenever I said single
interval selection it will not allow me
to select items unless they are in a row
like you can see I can do there and then
here is our little scroll bar that
allows us to scroll through all the
different items and it only shows four
at a time now what we're going to do is
come in here and put some stuff out on
the screen based off of if they hit the
button or not and what we're going to do
is we want to be playing around with a
default list model because we can't do
this type of editing using the other
list that we are talking about before
and one thing we can do is we can make a
check to see if an item exists in the
list so let's say that we want to check
if black is in the list or not and if it
is we're going to call info on component
which is our string that's going to hold
a lot of information in regards so what
we want to print out whenever we create
our J option pane and I'm just going to
say a black is here pretty simplistic
and then throw a newline in there just
so everything stays nice and neat I'm
going to copy this guy here paste that
inside of there I could also check if
this list is empty so I'm going to put a
knot symbol inside of there and then I'm
going to change this to is empty course
there's nothing to put inside of there
and then here is actually where I'm
going to check if it is int empty that's
why I put the little not symbol in there
because otherwise nothing would be
printed up and copy this string make my
life a little bit easier and then to
this string I'm also going to do a
couple other different things so let's
say that we want to print out to screen
the elements in the list meaning the
number of elements in the list in this
situation and go death list model size
and then throw my little newline inside
of there
taste us in there I could also find the
last element I just type it in last
element pretty simple and pretty easy to
remember but of course make sure this is
a capital e and not a lowercase e I
could also find the first element just
by Debian first element and as you play
around with Java you're going to find
that a lot of this stuff just starts
getting ingrained in your head you just
simply remember it just by using it a
bunch of times could also find out
whatever element is in a specific index
in index one for example in this
situation here's a type git and then
whatever index you want to look for and
then of course you could also come in
here and go death list model and say
that you want to remove an item based
off of whatever index it's in real
simple to do can't do this with a
regular list component and you of course
you could also come in here and remove
an element based off of its name so in
this situation let's say I want to get
rid of big just that easy and everything
is going to automatically update and
let's say that you wanted to also create
an array that is filled with all those
different list elements you could also
do that so let's go ray of list is the
name I'm going to give it and you just
go death list model and say - alright
it's a very useful method and then if
you want to cycle through all these
different guys we're just going to say
object color array of list just going to
put in the name that you created for
this guy right there
and then we're going to cycle through
all these different guys and put them in
the info string that we have up above
just type in color and then just keep
everything nice and neat throw in a new
line and then if we execute this guy as
long as I coded everything right you can
see all of that information prints out
the screen so go ahead get all the code
play around with this guy and get
yourself acquainted with the list
component it's a really really useful
tool leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
