3 of my android development tutorial for
beginners today we're going to focus in
on understanding App Inventor I'm going
to provide a complete overview of all
the components and what they do I'm
going to explain pretty much all the
jargon you're ever going to need to know
I'm going to show you how to open an app
inventor app from another App Inventor
app and we're going to spend a lot of
time on user interface components and
their events and their methods and yets
the jargon we're going to be talking
about and I have a whole lot to do so
let's get into it okay so this is the
application we're going to be making in
this tutorial I'm sure it's a little bit
blurry because this is the emulator and
the emulator is a little bit blurry
basically we're just going to have this
up here and what this is going to do is
track events so when this button gets
clicked it's going to play a zombie
sound and just going to show button
clicked
whenever the checkbox is clicked it's
going to say hey the checkbox has been
changed to true and now it's false we're
going to also use drop-down sort of
lists and we click on this for favorite
color click on red you're going to see
red was picked in list and we're going
to be able to add different colors and
we're going to be able like let's say
that we wanted to use purple come in
here type in purple and then hit done
and then hit add and then we click on
favorite color and now Purple's in there
and now we can pick purple we're also
going to be able to delete items we're
also going to be able to come in here
and demonstrate how the slider works see
the number appears changing we're going
to be able to open our zombie app from
inside of this app and I'm just doing
this just to demonstrate this and I'm
also going to cover the passwords and
how the password text boxes work as well
as notifications and a whole bunch of
other different things so let's just
jump into it okay so I went ahead and
created all of this on my own and of
course all I did was I went over in
delay I've grabbed a horizontal
arrangement layout tool drug it over
here dropped it inside of there then
went over to user interface and let's
say that I decided I wanted a text box I
dragged that Oh
they're dropped it in and buttons and
all these other different things and of
course we can come in here and delete
all of that stuff now because we don't
need it just there for demonstration
purposes click ok horizontal arrangement
delete and this says the page at da da
da da deleting this component will
delete all the blocks associated with it
okay yes all right so that's all going
so that's all I basically did was I
created this horizontal layouts and then
I dropped all these components inside of
here and I just want to focus in on how
they work now of course each component
is going to have specific properties
that are going to be able to be set
inside of the designer inside of App
Inventor and we're in designer right now
because that's highlighted and these are
the properties that I'm referring to now
we can change the background color
whether the button in this situation is
enabled the fonts the image like we did
in last tutorial this shape all these
different things now the properties can
also be set at runtime and by runtime I
just mean when the app is being run
however you're going to be making all
those changes over here inside of blocks
right here now as we saw last time we
can both get as well as set values for
components and maybe what I should do is
go into the designer and explain all of
the components very briefly and what
they do I'm going to try to cover every
single component here in like a minute
minute and a half okay so of course
buttons are going to be used to detect
clicks and perform certain actions
whenever they are clicked checkboxes are
going to detect clicks and either be in
an on or off position like you saw clock
is going to be used both as a timer and
also to perform different tasks over and
over again whenever you want to perform
something multiple times you use a clock
it's also going to handle time
conversion at dates image is going to
allow you to display images as well as
perform limited forms of animation and
we're going to get into all these over
the course of this tutorial labels of
course are just used for showing text
that you do not want the user to be able
to change list picker we just saw this
picker with the favorite color thing
just going to display multiple options
to pick from notifier is going to be
used to display dialog boxes as well as
log errors password text box is just
like a text box going to allow the user
to enter text except whenever you
password text box it's going to be in
stars each of the letters sliders are
going to allow you to drag for a result
which is going to be really great one of
you have a wide variety of different
possible values and the web viewer is
going to allow you to display webpages
get into the layout the horizontal
arrangement is used whenever you want to
layout components left to right table
arrangement which is actually what
you're going to use most of the time is
going to be used whenever you want to
layout components in a grid of rows and
columns and vertical arrangement which I
don't think I've ever used is going to
be used to arrange components from top
to bottom then you have your different
media options camcorder this is just
going to allow you to call for the video
recording app to open up camera is also
going to open up the camera app and of
course you can set it so that any video
or pictures that are taken here are
going to be returned to your application
to use image picker is going to allow
your users to pick an image that they
want to use inside of your app player is
going to play audio or video sound is
going to play sound as well as provide
for vibration options sound recorders in
allow you to record sound speech
recognizer is going to try to convert
your speech to text text to speech is
going to do the absolute opposite video
player is going to play videos and I'm
going to show you in the next tutorial
I'm going to create a big media
application then we get to drawing an
animation first you're going to have a
ball which is really cool it's going to
basically be you can animate it you can
make it move across the screen you can
change its speed you can detect
collisions it can bounce it can be
thrown it can do a whole bunch of things
that's gonna be a lot of fun to cover
canvas is going to be where you're going
to draw your animations on the screen
it's also it can you can do all kinds of
things with it it's a lot of fun image
sprite is basically like ball it's going
to allow you to animate bounce detect
collisions but it's going to work with
any image so this is basically where
you're going to create games then we get
into sensors the accelerometer is going
to detect shaking as well as measure
acceleration of your device barcode
scanners kind of self-explanatory the
location sensor we saw in the previous
tutorials is going to provide location
information near-field stands for near
field communication which is going to
allow us to transfer data between two
devices that are near each other
orientation sensor is going to detect
the device's space
Shoal orientation so if you're rotating
it like in the real world it's going to
detect that and we have the social
components that are available contact
picker is going to allow the user to
pick a person from their contacts email
picker is going to work in a similar way
it's going to allow you to find the
right email by just entering in a bunch
of characters and it's going to locate
it phone call is going to allow the user
to basically make a telephone call phone
number picker is going to display a list
of contacts that you can call texting
yes it's going to be possible inside of
App Inventor to text and then the
Twitter components going to provide
numerous ways to interact with Twitter
storage first we have Fusion Tables
control now Fusion Tables it's basically
a restful api that's going to provide
access to data and if you don't know
what that means don't worry about it i'm
going to do a whole tutorial on it and
basically it just provides a way to get
that ID using your application tiny DB
we use that in previous tutorial i
believe it's also going to allow you to
store data on your device while tiny web
DB is going to allow you to store and
retrieve data from a web service and
then finally activity starter is going
to provide you the option to launch
another activity or application we're
going to see that in this tutorial as
well and then the Bluetooth client and
bluetooth server are going to provide
ways to communicate between devices
using bluetooth and then we have web
which is basically a non-visible
component that's going to be used to
access data on the internet and then
technically finally we have Lego
Mindstorms which I'm not going to cover
because it's very very expensive to get
into that stuff so there is a basic
rundown of all the component every
single component over here in the
palette asides from Lego Mindstorms now
that we've covered all that stuff let me
get back to what I was previously
talking about now all of these
components of course inside of the
designer are going to provide numerous
different properties that we're going to
be able to change like I was saying
before we're also going to be able to do
that at runtime or while the
applications running by going into
blocks so let's come over here and
here's all the components that I went
and created inside of my layout and
let's just click on button testing for
an example alright so what you're going
to see here on the screen is the Gitter
blocks these guys right here are going
to be light
Green now this color has changed over
the different iterations of App Inventor
but the Gator parts always pin lighter
than the setter part
hence it says set also you're going to
notice that the Gators are going to have
a plug over here on the left side of the
screen while the setters are going to
have a socket over on the right side of
the screen and you're also going to
notice here that there's like a dip and
mainly these guys are going to be used
in accordance with event handlers event
handlers now remember we're using the
button component these are event
handlers and as you can see event
handlers are smooth which means they are
pretty much self-contained they do
everything you need them to do on their
own unlike these guys that have to be
connected to different things basically
what's going on here is it's saying when
my button called button testing is
clicked do stuff one thing I could do is
set the button testing or the button
name button testings background color -
and then put that inside of there so
you're going to see the setters always
have this socket on the side and the
getters always have the plug on the left
side another thing to think about here
and this is pretty much the last sort of
thing that we're at least we're going to
talk about there are things that are
called
methods and let's just cycle through
here until we find sound and you can see
right here these are methods now methods
are purple and what they do is they
provide just very common tasks so if we
have a sound component well chances are
we're going to want to play it and if we
stop it we're going to want to resume it
and we also might want to pause it and
another option that's inside of here is
to a vibrate of the device I know that's
a little bit weird but whatever and
thats in essence what a method is
another way to very quickly notice or
find a method is every single one of
them has the word call at the very
beginning so a method is just a common
operation that is performed another
thing to come in here and talk about is
comments because I haven't talked about
them yet
so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to make the button work
let's go over to the designer again and
let's take a look what I want to do here
is I want to handle an event which is
going to be this button being clicked
and whenever it's clicked I want this
guy up here let's just highlight it come
over here button event label whenever
this button is clicked
I want up here inside of here I want
text to be displayed that says hey this
button was clicked ends on top of that I
want to also play a sound and on top of
that I also want the device to vibrate
so let's come in here make sure inside a
media you have a sound inside of there
and also if we click on sound right here
and and come up here we all could also
can see here that the zombie moan noise
has been attached to that so now we're
going to go back into blocks there we
are
and let's set this up so we're looking
to handle an event that's going to be
occurring whenever our button is clicked
on so we're going to click on this and
we're going to say okay when the button
was clicked on we want to do some stuff
and one of the things that we want to do
is we want to set the label with the
text that says button clicked so we go
to our label that we want to change
click on that and then we're going to
say we want to set something so we know
what we're looking for and there it is
button event label text - let's grab
that come up here drop it in there we go
now of course there's going to be a
socket over here that's going to require
some extra information we're going to
click just anywhere except on a
component and we're going to say button
clicked and all of these block diagrams
are going to be available in a link in
the description under this video so
you'll be able to easily see them there
we go button click to drop that right
there and there we go no other thing I
said that I want to also cover comments
now if you want to comment or describe
what is going on here which is an
extremely good idea by the way we're
just going to highlight this and
right-click on it and go add comment and
then whenever we click on it it's gonna
open up this little guy right here so
let's just go and grab it and let's move
it somewhere now let's shrink
and let's move it up here and let's also
enlarge it now we can do something like
when button is clicked change label and
let's increase the size on this play
sound and vibrate and this provides with
a very very nice way of describing
exactly what's going to happen here and
if we click on that it goes away
click on that comes back so there's
comments comments are awesome use
comments as much as humanly possible
alright so what else did we want to do
well we wanted to play a sound and we
also wanted to vibrate so we have to
come over here find our sound component
there it is just click on it and we want
to use the method that's going to allow
us to play a sound and we can just drag
it there and then let's go and get sound
again click on it we also want to
vibrate grab this guy drop it right
there we want to add a number in
milliseconds so let's say that we want
it to vibrate for one second that would
be 1000 milliseconds so we're going to
find math there that is get ourselves a
number come over here drop that in
select it and then let's type in 1000 it
there we go and one second alright so
there we go we're going to vibrate for
one second we're going to play a sound
we're also going to change this to
button clicked whenever the button is
clicked now I put the actual app running
at the very very beginning that's
jewelle so you could refer to it so that
I didn't have to constantly run the app
over and over and over again now another
thing that we want to do here is we want
certain things to occur whenever the app
is initialized one of those things is we
want our label at the top of the screen
to say screen initialize another thing
we want to do is set up our list now I
have always found it's better to set up
our list what I mean is the little box
we clicked I want to have favorite
colors I want to set that up in side of
here and how I always do it is to
initialize a variable I'm going to come
in here initialize global and I'm going
to give
it a name and that name is going to be
list of colors there we go
then what I want to do is go over to
lists and I want to make my list so come
in here drop that there and if you can
remember I had red green and blue well
of course that means I'm going to have
to add an extra option on here so click
on this and go item drop that in there
then click anywhere and go red and there
that is drag that up there and we're
going to duplicate it and we're gonna
duplicate it again drag that over there
drag that over there and red blue and
green and in a second here I'm going to
show you how to add items to our lists
and subtract items from our list there's
all kinds of neat things you can do with
lists
alright so now that I have the this guy
set up what I want to do is I want to
connect my list picker let's go back
over here to designer so here it is
favorite color if we highlight that it's
going to say list picker one right there
what I want to do is I want to connect
this component outside there in the
designer to this list that's going to
have red green and blue on it how do I
do that well one way to do it is to
initialize this whenever the application
starts and to do that we go into the
screen one and whenever screen one or
the application start up basically what
we want it to do is remember we want to
tell the button event label that it has
been initialized so let's just come in
here and duplicate that duck the duck
tada and then change this to screen
initialized and then we got it and now
we want to also connect this list that
we created inside of the blocks part of
App Inventor to the list component that
is over in the designer area how to do
that well we got to get to the designer
area list here and there it is so click
on list picker and then what we need to
do is look for list picker elements and
we want to set them we want to attach
the one in the blocks to the list picker
that's in the designer so we're going to
get set right like that and then
elements and then we want to get this
guy right here we can just put our mouse
up here and go get global list colors
and drop that there and there we go now
we have those two connected any changes
made to the list inside of here
is going to automatically be updated to
the list item that is on the designer
part or in the app itself all that
stuff's set up another thing that I
might want to do is to come in here and
change the orientation or at least send
an event saying that the orientation is
changed on the screen click on screen
and we can come in here and look for
this screen orientation changes and
here's other different events that it'll
handle I'm just going to get this one
drop that inside of there and let's say
that if this screen orientation of the
device has been rotated let's duplicate
that drag that drop it inside of there
and we want to say something like screen
orientation changed and there we go now
we'll also be able to monitor that this
is just here for so we can look at it
click on things and watch different
events being triggered it's not there
for any other reason other than to
update that label and there's other
things of course with the button let's
come in here and go button testing it
can also sense if it has focus it's lost
focus in this situation it's not going
really going to work also if there is a
long click we could also do that just to
test it and a long click I think is like
if you hold it for more than a second
considered a long click so duplicate
this and we'll also be able to track
that event and button let's just type in
long clicked I don't know if we want to
check with the checkbox let's just come
out of here again jump over into the
designer here's the checkbox that I'm
referring to right here if I want to
check or at least tell the label up here
that the checkbox has been checked or
unchecked what I'm going to do jump over
into blocks all of the events that can
occur with the item are going to be tied
to the item in the designer view so
we'll just go to checkbox and we're
going to say changed we don't want it to
basically test if it is positive or if
there's a check in it or anything what
we're doing is we're looking for an
event see that's the difference if this
was something that just tracked whether
there was a check inside of it or not
that's not an event
an event is the checkbox has been
changed so that's the reason why it
doesn't have is checked or whatever and
of course you're going to be able to
check if there's a checkbox inside of it
and of course I'm going to show you how
to do that basically we're going to come
in here it's going to change the label
again duplicate this drop this inside of
here and of course I'm going to want to
have multiple different lines of text
inside of here because I got to go and
find out if the checkbox is checked and
I also have to put some text inside of
it that's going to require me to have
the option to have multiple different
lines of text anytime I need that I go
into text and then I go in to join and
drag that down here now I can do two
lines instead of just one so basically
what I want to test this is a string
right here I want to basically put out a
note in my label that says if it is
checked or not I'm going to do that is
I'm going to say check box changed so it
has been changed that's the name of this
to put a space make sure you do that and
then if I want to find out if it's
either true or false well I'm going to
go into the check box again so let's
click on that and let's look for checked
right here and what I want to do I want
to get if it's checked or not so that
means I'm going to grab the gaiter drop
that in there and that's going to
automatically display that say also we
can do the same thing with a list picker
click on this let's say we want to track
or we want to send a message to our
label after it's picked before it's
picked Dada Dada okay after it's picked
of course drop that right inside of
there now what do we want to do after
it's picked well we would just want to
put something in the label so let's
duplicate this drop this down inside of
there there we go and I can also see I'm
running out of space of course there's
little bowlers over here give us some
extra space drag that inside of there
now whenever an item has been picked
from our list we are also going to need
a join when we already got one there of
course but in this situation we want to
put whatever was picked was picked in
list so let's sort of throw this away
just grab this throw it into trash it's
gone grab this one drop it right there
if we want to find out what was packed
well let's pick er since we're getting
in from
we're going to be looking for Gators
which are light green and specifically
what we're looking for is selection what
was selected there it is light green
gator our drop it right there and there
we go
and then we're going to come down here
and we're going to say first we're going
to put a space and we're going to say
was picked enlist all right and we could
continue to put other different little
events inside here like for example the
add to list textbox where's that at add
to list textbox we could click on this
guy right here and we could say or we
would say that we want to track if it
gets focused which just means that they
clicked with their finger or with their
stylus or whatever inside of the textbox
and it's in there that's all got focus
and lost focus means lost focus of
course just means they left all right so
no big deal now if we want to be able to
come in here and use the add list item
and I'm gonna also have a couple things
on my website so that I don't have to
repeat myself over and over again in
regards to different blocks we can use
okay so another option we had let's go
over to the designer again click on up
another option we had here was they
could type in a color and then hit add
and it would go into our list let's set
that up go into blocks of course again
and we're going to specifically look for
add list item button so they're going to
be entering their new color into add
list text box and then we're going to be
clicking on add list item button to add
it to the list so click on that
specifically looking for a click so I'm
out of here
come on down here drop that right there
and then zoom in okay so what are we
going to do here basically let's let's
send a message to our label at the top
the screen to show that an event has
occurred and then on top of that we're
going to have to go and actually add the
item to our list so we can just grab
this guy right here be careful
duplicate
a bit down here and we're going to
change this a little bit let's say that
we want to add an extra line and also of
course we want to get rid of this one so
let's get rid of that and another thing
that we're going to want it to do is go
to the add to list text box and get the
actual text so click on that and let's
look for text which is going to be the
color that they entered grab that drop
it on there and let's say yeah actually
let's click on this we want to put an
extra string on here just drag it over
there there we go
and we'll say put a string down here
grab this right there
duplicate grab this up there then we're
going to say here in our little message
at the top of our app adding space and
this is going to give us the color that
they want to add then I'm going to put
another space and put it to list and
there we go so that's going to change
the little label at the top of the
screen then if I want to actually add
this new color to our list that means
I'm going to have to click on lists this
is where all the list methods are add
items to list this is what I want to add
and then there's the item itself drag
that out drop it right there and then I
want to go and get our list which I can
refer to with the global which is this
guy up here put mouse right there get
global list of colors drag it drop it
down there roll down and then I'm going
to add the list itself right there
remember whenever this guy updates the
component in the app is also going to
update and then I just want to put
whatever the new item is and that's this
guy right here click on that duplicate
there we go drag this drop it over here
and there it is there you can say we're
going to also provide an option to
delete items out of the list and guess
what it's going to be almost identical
to this so let's just click on this and
there we are
we just duplicated that drag it put it
over here and we just need to change
couple things so we're going to have to
look for the delete list item button
there it is we're going to get the text
but we're going to get it from the
delete list item text box and we're
going to say deleting and whatever they
said whatever color they said they want
to delete out of the list and then this
guy here is going to have to go why so
let's go dry
get and kill that and we're going to be
making changes to a list items that
means we need to go into lists and what
specifically are we going to do here we
want to remove an item so let's come
down through here until we see remove
and there it is
drag it up put it right here because
that's where it goes and there you can
see right there they're basically going
to be doing exactly the same thing we're
going to be getting this guy so let's
just duplicate it drag it put it over
here there's the list however whenever
we want to delete it it's asking for an
index so that means we need to get the
index now everything in a list is
labeled basically item number one item
number two item number three item number
four item number five okay so that's
what the index is it's just like
referring to them as the second item in
our bag of stuff now to get the index
number for each of the items in our list
we are going to come up here again any
time we're using list we're just going
to go into our list tools if we want to
index we're going to look inside here
until we see index in list and it's
saying if you give me the thing
and the list I'm going to tell you what
the index is that's what that's science
so let's drag it out of here drop it
right there and the thing that I want is
going to be whatever they typed into
that they want to lead it so duplicate
it and I should probably test that it's
in there but whatever just to be simple
I'm not going to do it this time and
then the list itself which is going to
be this guy right here
so duplicate that drag it down here and
there we go and that is how we'll remove
items also well I just looked at how
long this video is going it's going a
little bit long and I think I covered a
lot so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to hold off on covering how to open
other App Inventor applications inside
of another Android App Inventor
application until the next tutorial as
well as a really cool app that's free
that I use all the time and also cover
notifications and a couple other things
in the next part of the tutorial once

description for this video please leave
