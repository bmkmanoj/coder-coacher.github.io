go through a review of some of the nice
new features that are available with
photoshop cs5 it seems that the magic
lasso which you can see up here has
become vastly improved of the previous
version of Photoshop as you can see I'm
able to easily select the shark even
though that the color of the water that
surrounds it is very similar as you can
see there also you can see this crack in
the glass I want to improve upon that
and fix that up so I'm going to click on
this healing brush which is over here
looks like a band-aid and I can by
clicking option alt make a selection
that I want to be able to fill in here
and then come in and it will
automatically heal this crack as you can
see they're completely deletes it as if
it never even existed
and then smooths itself out very very
nice I can also make the correction here
on the Sharks face again smooth it out
so that you can't even see that it was
there in the first place so the Healing
Brush is a very nice addition and it
works very very nice as you can see
another addition is the ability to
delete objects from photographs I
selected the elephant here and whenever
I do a fill and choose the option
content-aware it's automatically gonna
take a sample of the background and make
the elephant disappear and fill in a
sampling from the background and now as
you can see where the elephant used to
be and now it's not there automatically
filled in information from the
background to make the elephant
completely disappear now there is some
discrepancies in color but with
different editing and feathering and so
forth within the underneath of select
and modify you can easily make those
color discrepancies go away and also you
could use the Healing Brush we have over
here to further refine
this image now I'm gonna show you
another nice tool available within
Photoshop from what you're looking at
you might not be able to tell that a lot
of this work back here is actually done
using the Photoshop brush tool as you
zoom in now you can see that this is
brushwork and it looks like a photograph
but is it extremely easy to be able to
edit this as is this polar bear just
click on the brush tool I specifically
like the mixer brush tool and that's
what I used here and I can go in here
and choose wet heavy mix which is a very
nice I can use a whole bunch of
different brush options I'm gonna use
the fan brush here and increase the size
of my brush and if I go in here and
paint it automatically will make this
look like brushstrokes in it and it also
figures it all out for you so that you
don't have to spend an immense amount of
time going in detail but that detail is
definitely available to you sadly enough
I do not have a Wacom tablet so I am NOT
able to take advantage of some of the
features that would be provided there
but you can see it really is a very nice
feature that's available and it allows a
person with basically no artistic
ability to easily go in and edit a
photograph and make it look pretty nice
now you can see here I actually this is
a photo of my baby Faye zoom in you can
see looks very much like painting this
is the original kind of blurry
photograph and in about three or four
minutes I was able to go in here and
customize and clean up and make this
picture look really original a nice
another nice feature is how easy it is
to be able to implement and mess around
with 3d in Photoshop have some text here
I'm gonna click on this 3d tool it's
available over here and I'm gonna click
on create it's gonna tell me that it
needs to rasterize the text I click yes
and now there's all kinds of different
ways for me to manipulate 3d text or
pretty much 3d anything within Photoshop
and I could also mess around with these
little guys
up here I can add different babbling
effects to the tax you can mess around
with death I can twist the text around
as you can see I could bend it and do
all kinds of wild and crazy 3d things as
well as applying different textures in
this case let's say I want to apply a
texture just to the front of the text I
can do that or I can apply textures to
just the side another neat feature is
here I have a cutout picture of a
giraffe and if I go under edit and click
on puppet warp I can place pins on my
drown and easily be able to manipulate
that draft like head Bend downwards bend
backwards so forth and so on quite
easily you can see here apply it
automatically just figures out exactly
how to bend whatever animal or person or
what-have-you that you have inside of
Photoshop so those are some of the neat
neatest little features that are
available within Photoshop hope you
enjoyed the tutorial review what have
