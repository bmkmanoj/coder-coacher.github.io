of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm going to explain how
to use functions inside of PHP first off
you have to understand exactly what
functions exist you create functions to
encapsulate tasks that you must perform
on a repetitive basis and it also
provides organizational benefits as well
and here's a function that's built into
PHP which will allow you to generate a
random number and for example this is
going to generate a random number
between the numbers 1 and 100 throw some
breaks in here and if you didn't see the
other tutorials you should definitely
check those up for proceeding so I'm
going to save this jump over here reload
you can see the number 58 was generated
for me and I can continue to reload this
page and it's going to continue to
generate random numbers for me and this
is a function and these are the
attributes that were passed to said
function for it to operate on ok so now
I'm going to show you how to make your
own custom functions first start off by
typing in function followed by a name
for your function and you do not need a
dollar sign in front of this actually
you definitely do not want to use a
dollar sign and let's say that this
accepts two numbers then you want to
have an opening curly brace tab if you
like and this is how you return the
result of whatever goes inside of the
function you call or another function
called
return and here I'm sure you can figure
out I am just going to add the numbers
that are passed to it then you call the
sum of the function in the same way you
have called other functions previously
in here I'm going to pass it two
attributes and I'm an echo to screen the
results of this so if I save it jump
over here you can see that three pops up
on the screen and that's because I
passed it this so save it jump over here
and you can see that it is adding those
numbers so what it does just start off
with function then a name for your
function remember new dollar sign then
defining the attributes or variables
that you're going to accept into your
function return some type of information
and then of course you're going to have
to pass those attributes over to that
function so now I'm going to now explain
to you what is meant by scope what you
have to understand is you cannot change
any global variables inside of functions
and I'm
going to explain exactly what that means
so I'm going to create a new function
that's going to try to edit a global
variable and this is just the name I'm
giving it this isn't anything that you
always need to use when you're passing
global variables see here I'm going to
assign the value of 200 to global
variable then going to come down here
and create the global variable same name
and everything except I'm going to give
it the value of 120 and then going to
echo to the screen global variable
frozen break statements in there and
then I'm going to call for edit global
which is the function that we just
created and I'm going to pass it the
value for the global variable if you
know anything about PHP you might be
saying he's wrong you can't edit global
variables well you can but not in the
normal way so I'm trying to explain and
then I'm going to echo out to screen the
supposed new global variable so what i'm
doing here is any variable you defined
outside of any functions or considered
global variables here i'm creating one
called global variable and signing the
value of 120 to it then i'm going to
output to screen the value which is
going to be 120 then i'm going to call
and pass over the value of global
variable to this function it's going to
change it to 200 and then what is your
guess of what is going to be printed to
screen right here is 120 or 200 let's
save it find out uh-oh 120 printed twice
again this goes back to the fact you
cannot define or edit global variables
just simply by passing a value and then
creating it here this is what would be
called a local variable anything any
variable that is created inside of a
function even if there is a global
variable with the same name is a totally
new variable and it is called a local
variable however there are ways to
actually change these global variables
and I'm going to show you how to do that
right now actually what you're going to
do is pass a reference to the global
variable just by putting this and sign
in right here so just put the + sign in
there and then that is all you changed
save it jump over here and you can see
now 200 printed out this is an actual
reference a pointer what have you if you
don't know what
means don't worry about it but this is
actually a reference in memory that is
being passed and that is the reason why
you are now able to edit that global
variable so that's how you edit global
variables you're not really supposed to
do it technically but if you wanted to
do it that is how you do it now I'm
going to create another function called
get tip and here I'm going to show you
the whole reason I'm doing this is to
show you how to create default values so
costs and tips and and to create a
default value meaning a value that will
be used if no value is passed this
function so we are requiring cost to be
sent but we are not requiring the tip
percentage to be set this is very useful
especially for error handling this guy's
going to do output screen a dollar sign
Cross cent times tip sent there remember
to close off the function with a curly
brace and here we're going to define
cost equal to 100 new variable we're
going to call get tip and this function
is going to output to screen the tip of
the total cost of the bill of $100
however I'm not going to pass a
percentage that I want save this and you
can see because this is simple math that
it automatically printed out 15 to
screen however if you would in fact send
a value like let's say this person felt
like being really generous since is
going to pay 20% file say reload you can
see the 20 popped up here so that is how
you create to fault values inside of PHP
functions if you wanted to be able to
return multiple values from a function
and from this I think you're going to be
able to figure out how to send multiple
values what you do is just send an array
full of values info user info open curly
brace user array I'm using a function
that I showed you in a previous tutorial
called explode what it's going to do is
break all of the data that is separated
by commas into individual pieces that
are going to be stored in an array but
didn't make sense watch the array
tutorial again the two array of
tutorials and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to return an array meaning
multiple values stored in the array so
that's how you pass back multiple to
values and let's say I go and create a
string called user string my name and
air my fake address reason I use fake
addresses items one time sent a bunch of
rotten food by the way and all this
information is freely available and you
think tank column you can download it do
whatever you want with it do not care
you don't require you to sign anything
or do anything to use it so what I did
was I created this strings with all the
information separated by commas and then
I'm going to send that string to break
it up which is the function that I just
created here assign the results that are
passed back in this return to this array
variable called user array and then I'm
going to call the for each function and
cycle through all of the values that are
stored in said alright put this in
quotes closing curly brace and actually
throw another echo down here okay got
that all in there file save jump over
here and you can see it took all that
information as a string threw it up here
exploded it I know it's not a work and
then returned the array and then I use
the for each iterator to iterate through
all the different values that are stored
in the array that was passed back and
then shot them back out here on the
screen you know pretty much now pretty
much everything there is to know about
functions except for one thing and that
is called recursion recursion is
something that gets everybody confused
all recursion is is calling a function
from inside of itself I'm going to show
you here what I mean by that okay so we
have a function it's called factorial
and a factorial is just multiplying 1
times 2 times 3 times 4 so if the
factorial of 4 would be 4 times 3 times
2 times 1 okay that's a factorial that's
what a factorial means well what you
have to understand with recursion is you
must have what I call Killswitch you
must have some way under certain
circumstances you will not be making
another call back to a function being
the function itself that is calling it
here
I'll explain I knows me might be
confusing that's why people think
recursion is so horribly hard to
understand I'm going to spend time here
and make sure you get it else here's the
part that confuses people
times factorial is equal to number minus
one okay so it sounds really really
really confusing and here I'm actually
going to actually run it just so you see
what goes on with this guy three okay so
if I file save it jump over here you can
see it prints out to the screen six what
is that 3 times 2 times 1
okay that's the factorial so what
exactly is going on here well whenever
this function is called for the very
first time it is going to receive the
number 3 this is the first iteration
through ok because you're passing it
factorial 3 right here factorial 3 right
here then it's asking is the number
being 3 equal to 1 of course not
okay else then what I want you to do is
take 3 which is right here
jump down tab over so let's say this is
3 this time through the function this
value is 3 hence it is going to call
factorial again but this time it's going
to be 3 minus 1 which is going to be
equal to 2 all right then that
information is going to get passed back
up into here now this is 2 so this value
right here is equal to 6 because this is
a very simple factorial this is actually
your answer right here 3 &amp;amp; 2 but either
way let's go through again the value
here is 2 we're going to jump down now
it's not equal to 1 else then we're
going to jump down to here this number
is now going to be 2 and this number is
now going to be 1 now one is going to
get passed into the next factorial you
can think of these as three totally
separate functions because in essence
they kind of are because the attribute
is different for all of them now
whenever one being down here is passed
into this if the number is equal to 1
return 1 ok great and then none the
number 1 comes right here it's
multiplied times the 2 and that is how
you get the final piece of information
if you need to see this again let's just
go back to it again
so the first iteration through this
function you're going to have here B 3
and here B 2 remember 3 minus 1 ok and
then let's just look at this as
it is multiple different functions
because it is it's not the same function
it is different ones so the second time
through you're going to have a value to
here you can have a value if you two
here and a value of one here and then
you're going to have a value of one here
and hence yes indeed the number is equal
to one so we chop this off it's like
this doesn't even exist it's as if this
whole entire functions only function is
to return the value of one okay so you
can even look at it like this so this
makes more sense to you this value that
is returned goes into here and then that
information this line right here returns
the value of two so in essence you can
get rid of this line if it's confusing
you and just say simply the whole reason
for the existence of this function is to
return to if numbers not equal to one
which it isn't okay so this function is
done with it doesn't exist anymore then
that to that it returns goes in here you
multiply three times two you get the
answer of six and that answer is going
to be passed down here and hence six is
printed to the screen so there's a
complete explanation of how to use
functions inside of PHP and I think a
really understandable explanation of
exactly what it means by recursion
if you don't understand leave a question
or comment below and I will continue to
explain it otherwise in the next
tutorial I'm going to move on to how to
use regular expressions inside of PHP
