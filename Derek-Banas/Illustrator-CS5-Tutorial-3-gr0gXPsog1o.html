all of the things I didn't cover in my
other previous tutorials on illustrator
first time I talked about the line
segment tool which is found right over
here underneath the pen tool and you
just click and drag wherever you want
your line to go and if you hold down the
tilde button at the same time you can
draw on multiple different lines at the
same time then it's undo and just draw
one line you also if you hold down shift
key it'll automatically make the line
straight or at a 45-degree angle if you
want to put dashes in just open up the
stroke panel on the right side of your
screen and click on dashed line and you
can come in here and make changes to how
big you want those dashes to be and you
can define even the gap and then change
the different dashes and so forth and so
on if you create a square or a rectangle
with these dashed lines you can also
define whether you want this to be
irregular or you want all of your dashes
to be aligned so we'll click that and
you can see everything aligns itself up
other things you can do you can add
arrowheads this will be your left
Arrowhead and this would be your right
and of course there's multiple different
types of arrowheads that you can use
also under the line tool you'll see the
arc tool it just creates an arc and if
you press up or down on your arrow keys
you can change the angle of said arc and
if you want the arc to flip just press
the F key while holding down on the
mouse then you have your spiral tool
again you can create multiple different
types of spirals by pressing up and down
you can increase the number of spirals
on the screen and if you hold down the
shift key just like with any of these
other line tools you can drag it around
and position it however you would like
then we have the rectangular grid tool
this you can create multiple different
grids you can increase the number of
columns and rows again with the arrow
keys and change your strokes or change
or fill colors if you'd like to have a
different type of fill color in here you
can do that with this rectangular grid
tool and you have the polar grid tool
with this you could create things such
as targets and again as you're creating
it you can increase
or decrease the number of spirals inside
of this grid tool and always an
illustrator if you hold down the command
or control key automatically jump into
the arrow head and select anything with
it then you have all of your different
shape tools you have your rectangles
if you left-click on screen it will
allow you to define based off of width
or height or if you hold down the shift
key it'll make sure that all the sides
are of equal size and let's get rid of
that dashed line by clicking on stroke
and clicking on unchecking the dashed
line box here and filling in this square
with a failed color now let's create a
couple other different squares the
reason why I'm doing this is I'm going
to demonstrate over here the alignment
tool it's available to you and if you
don't have all these little guys over
here if you just click on window it's
gonna show all of them here on the
screen so you'll be able to bring them
up under your screen now let's say I
want to align all of these guys left
while I do is select them all and then
click align objects click on this button
or line right click here and Center them
and there's multiple other different
things available to you under the align
options you could also select this
square for example overlap this other
Square and then go to the Pathfinder and
combine these two shapes now if this had
a different color like let's give this
the color of a different color of blue
since it's on top whenever I merge these
two with the Pathfinder tool what its
gonna do is it's gonna take the
attributes of whatever object is on top
and merge them that way so just come
down here in Pathfinder click that you
can see they merged let's undo that with
control Z we could also cut out whatever
is on top by clicking down here cut that
out
we could also eliminate everything
except where these two squares touch by
clicking right here or we could divide
these objects based off of where they
intersect and where they do not
intersect by clicking down here whenever
you do this this is gonna group these
two objects so you want to come up here
to object and click on ungroup now
you'll be able to grab these guys and
pull them apart those are some different
ways to use the align tool and the
Pathfinder tool other objects that are
available to you or such as the rounded
rectangles tool again up and down arrows
will change the radiuses on this guy
long as you hold the mouse down and you
have the ellipse tool and you have the
polygon tool again
as you're drawing this polygon you can
increase the number of sides on it quite
easily you also have the star tool again
you can increase the number of points on
your star just by pressing up and down
on the arrow keys and finally you have
the flare tool I've personally never
used this but this is pretty much what
it does on the screen again I switch
over to the pencil I just clicked on
command and if you would want to move
your artboard around on your screen if
you hold down on the space key it's
automatically going to shift to this
hand that's gonna allow you to do that
there's all kinds of other shortcuts
available to you inside of Illustrator
I've previously gone over the brush
tools here's the pencil tool let's say I
draw this squiggly line now I can also
jump over air into my smooth tool and
basically just run over this squiggly
over line that's really rough and what
its gonna do for me these kind of smooth
things out just like it's called let's
bring up another rectangle just here by
default you can click on this button
over here this is the free transform
tool it honors you to rotate a field
down shift it will rotate it in
45-degree angles as well and you could
also obviously resize it do anything you
want or grab it and resize it this way
also you could come over here and click
on a scale tool but I just use free
transform you click on the shear tool
what this allows you to do is to change
the angles on this rectangle for example
and sure it then there are all kinds of
other multiple things available to you
under this width tool what I which I
went over in the previous tutorial like
the warp tool allows you to warp
different shapes and things like that
and the twirl tool which if you actually
hold it down click and hold it it'll
continue to twirl and here's the
crystallize tool just to show you what
that looks like there's all kinds of
little neat things like that and it was
drug talk for a second about the symbol
if you click on this symbol sprayer tool
over here and then come over here to
symbols and let's click on this little
splat down here you just click once it's
gonna put one splat if you click
multiple times it's gonna put multiple
splats on the screen and you can turn in
pretty much anything into a symbol which
I described in the first tutorial also
of course what's available to you here
is the ability to use the eyedropper
tool so let's say we got this guy over
here
we want to give him a different fill
color say it's blue and then I go in
here and hold down on the command key to
select this boom by clicking in there I
just changed the fill color on this
object here
there's also graphing tools which I
never ever use inside of Illustrator of
course they're very easy to use if you
just click on a basic bar graph and then
you type in your information it
automatically will create different
types of graphs for you but like I said
I haven't never had any reason to want
to do that inside of Illustrator you can
change the size of your artboard just by
clicking over here as you can see and
then click on escape and everything
resizes itself of course you can zoom in
and zoom out by clicking on the Alt key
or option key if you have a Mac and then
the only thing that's really left over
is you can create multiple different
layers like for example let's say for
some reason I want this to be on a
different layer that's above this layer
I'll just cut it by hitting ctrl X and
come over to layers and click on new
layer and then paste it on top of there
then you'll be able to easily select
different objects because they'll be on
totally separate layers from each other
whenever you click with the text tool
it's gonna provide you with a whole
bunch of different fonts that are
available another neat thing with
illustrator is if you go and type and
then go to font it's actually going to
show you an example of what that font
will look like and then of course you
can change your different typefaces over
here in the character section you can
change the font you can change to
regular bold depending upon what type
font you can increase the font size you
can increase the distance between lines
within your text you can increase
distance between your letters under
paragraph there's multiple different
alignment defaults with text and pretty
much the only other thing within
illustrator that I haven't described
already in past let's say you wanted to
paste something into this square right
here let's say for example you'd want to
paste a polar grid inside of this square
right here well we're gonna create one
for you right like this we're gonna
create a target again I just double
clicked on that fill give it a white
color click OK now it's gonna be white
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut
this I'm gonna select this square right
here
I'm gonna come over here on the left
sidebar if you don't if your toolbar
doesn't look like this click on the
arrow up here and you can change the
different types of toolbars and then you
come over here to where it says draw
inside we already have this square
selected if you hit control V or command
V inside of a Mac it'll paste right
within the window that's pretty much
everything there is no about illustrator
if you have any questions leave them in
the comment section below
if you have any other thing you would
like me to do a tutorial on leave it
there as well until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
