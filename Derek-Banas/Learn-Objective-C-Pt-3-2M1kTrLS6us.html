3 of my objective c tutorial this
tutorial came about because a viewer of
one of my other tutorials requested it
so here it is in this presentation i'm
going to go through mostly every data
type available to you an objective c
except for just a couple of them that
are a little bit more complicated that
i'll cover a later date first off you
have ins these are positive or negative
numbers that do not include a decimal
point and you have floats they are also
positive or negative numbers with a
decimal point doubles which are just
simply large floats CH a RS workers
which are just simply single characters
ID these are generic data types used to
store a reference to an object and I'll
cover this in much more detail later
arrays you can think of anarres as a big
box with many boxes inside of it each of
those boxes inside of the big box would
also contain its own value and strings
are just strings of characters you've
seen the following in other previous
tutorials but basically an integer
stores a positive or negative number
without a decimal you can trust that you
will be able to store numbers up to this
joy gundo number right here that I'm not
going to read off of there are of course
different versions of the int data type
and here below i'm going to list how to
define those data types i'm going to
list the maximum number they can hold
and then on top of that i'm going to
show you what code you would use inside
of the NS log function if you wanted to
print those integers out to the screen
you can see them down here in the third
fourth and fifth bulleted item just want
to make a special note if you define a
long long int the maximum number you can
hold in a long long int is completely
machine dependent but you can trust that
you can it by the very least be able to
put a number of the link that you can
see here in the fifth bulleted item
floats are used to store numbers that
might require a decimal objective-c by
default stores all decimal numbers in
the data type name double which I'm
going to go over next but if you want a
for
set the store in type float you would do
that by a pending letter F to the end of
the number like I do here in the
following example you can store numbers
expressed in scientific notation also in
a float and you would do that as you can
see here in the example and if you want
to use a float in NS log you would use
the notation % followed by the letter
app if you want to use scientific
notation ever you would instead use the
code % followed by the letter e
variables of type double or guaranteed
to be accurate up to the value you can
see here on the screen and they can
contain decimals and are the default
data type for storing these types of
numbers being numbers with decimal point
the code for using a double NS log would
be the same as floats which is the
percent sign followed by the letter F or
the percent sign followed by the letter
e if you want to store a single
character in a variable you would
declare that variable to be of type CH
AR you define what character is stored
in the variable by surrounding that
character with single quotes like I
showed you in in this example to use a
character variable to print to the
screen with NS log you would use the
code % followed by the lowercase letter
C you can also store special characters
in a character data type x instead
storing a backslash code and i'll list
the backslash codes here on the next
slide or you can see all of the
backslash codes available to you and if
you wanted to store them in a variable
of type character you would just include
the backslash followed by the letter you
can see here on the screen and of course
you would use single quotation remember
from the previous tutorial when we ask
the computer to set memory aside for us
to store our new object data well the
data type ID is used to store a
reference to that object and this data
type is used normally to pass objects to
methods in objective-c I'll cover it in
much more detail later in the tutorial
you can store multiple values in just
one array variable think of an array as
a big box like I said before with a
whole bunch of little boxes in it for
example you could give an array the name
ages and then place inside of it all the
ages for everybody that you know you
would create that specific array below
if you only knew ten people and then in
the next exam
well you can see here that I'm creating
an array named ages that holds the
maximum number of five integers and then
assigns those five values to this right
here I'm doing the exact same thing
except i am using a series of characters
instead of a series of integers and if
you wanted to use NS log with his last
array you would just follow my example
as you can see here in the third
bulleted item even though i am using an
array i am still going to use the
percent followed by the letter C because
this does contain character data and in
this specific example your output would
be the first letter which is B you may
ask yourself why didn't it out put the
letter A the reason is that the first
value stored in an array is stored in
the index 0 you could also output the
letters array as just one string of
characters if you followed the example
as you see here in the last bullet an
item here you can see specifically that
i use the percent sign followed by the
letter s and then i use the variable
name letters without brackets following
it this would output ABCDE to the user
screen if you specifically call this NS
log function you can also create
multi-dimensional arrays let's say you
wanted to store the table you can see
here which is just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1
so forth and so on you would do that
like you can see here in the sixth
bulleted item here I'm creating a
multi-dimensional array that's going to
contain integers and I'm naming it
number table and you can see through the
use of these brackets and commas I'm
going to assign these numbers to said
array if I would then call for the value
of said multi-dimensional array named
number table it would return a value of
7 and remember the first index is 0 like
I explained in the previous example and
if you want to store a variable number
of objects in an array you can most
definitely do that with the array inside
of a method or function such as I showed
you here in this example if you want to
store a series of characters to a
variable you need to create a string
variable
if you want to be able to use strings
you will have to include a new framework
like you do with foundation dot H you
need to include the line of code i have
here in the second bulleted item if you
do so you can now create and assign
values to a string variable like I do
here in this example and you define a
string with this specific code NS string
followed by a star and then whatever you
want the name of your string to be
followed by the Nats symbol and then the
name of the string you want to assign it
held between two quotes now pay special
attention to this string because I'm
going to refer to it in a couple
following examples you would output this
string using NS log like I show here in
this example the code percent sound at
is used to output a string array or
object to the screen one problem with
these types of strings is that after you
create them they cannot be changed to
create a string that can be changed you
need to declare it instead as an NS
mutable string like I show you here in
the fifth of bulleted item this would
actually create a string storage
variable and in final example here on on
the screen I'm actually storing the
string that is assigned to the variable
str to the new string which is a mutable
string called i can change in the next
tutorial part 4 i'm going to go through
everything that has to do with looping
decision making and arithmetic
operations in objective-c and i promise
you will really understand it it's much
more simpler than understanding how to
create mutable strings till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
