three of my learn to program tutorial in
this tutorial just like the previous
ones we're going to get progressively
better at programming by solving
problems and learning how to solve
problems and in this tutorial
specifically I'm going to talk about
exception handling do-while math
functions float strings and a whole
bunch more if you haven't watched any
the previous tutorials you pretty much
have to because these problems get more
and more complicated as the tutorials go
on so there's a link in the description
to those as well as a link to a cheat
sheet and a transcript of this Tyre
tutorial so I have a lot to do so let's
get into it alright so here we are in
PyCharm again and maybe you remember
from the last tutorial whenever I talked
about receiving input I'm also going to
now go and automatically convert
everything in the input wise remember
whenever we type in input and ask for
information it comes back as a string
and now we're going to automatically
convert it into an int instead of doing
that on one line and here I'm going to
say please enter a number and then I'm
going to hope that they actually enter
the number just like that and then I'm
going to show you in a second how to
force them to enter a number and then
down here I am just going to print out
the number that they entered so let's
just say number and then we can go and
we can run it and it'll say please enter
a number but what happens if they put an
A in there oh all kinds of errors are
issued on the screen so how can we
protect our code so that they are forced
to enter a number well one thing we can
do is we can use something called
exception handling and what exception
handling is going to do for us is we are
going to basically state that we know
this problem could happen and we want to
handle if that does happen so we want to
go and we want to cycle through and
continue asking them for numbers until
they enter one so one thing you can do
with a while loop is put a true
statement inside of there put our colon
of course and this is going to force it
to continue asking for a number over and
over and over again until we guess think
about how we going to get out of the
while loop if this is going to loop
forever we can use a break statement Oh
so there's one question we got now what
I can do is I can say I want to try to
do this knowing that there's a potential
for an error and then what I'm going to
do is break out of that so that's how
we're going to be able to leave our
while loop well then what we do is we
come down here and say except if there
is a value error which means that we
wanted them to enter an integer and they
went and entered a string instead and
inside of here we can handle that and
how we're going to be able to handle
that exception is we can say something
like you didn't enter a number and then
it's going to jump up here and ask them
to please enter a number again now that
is an exception that has a specific
error that we're looking for what if we
don't know what the error could
potentially be but we don't want this
gigantic mess to spill out all over the
screen we can just type except with
nothing inside of there and it's going
to catch every single error not a good
thing to rely on however you want to
pretty much know what the error is going
to be so that you can give a logical
response because in this situation I'm
going to say an unknown error occurred
and then after that we know that they
entered a number and we could say
something like thank you for entering a
number now if we go in here and run this
and they type in a letter a it's just
going to say you didn't enter a number
and now we can put in one and it's going
to say thank you for entering the number
we're going to get more into exception
handling later on as the tutorial
continues just one to briefly get you
caught up so that you are well versed in
exception handling and simple things
that we can do to correct potential
errors but as the tutorial continues
we'll get more and more complicated and
now it's time for our first problem what
I want you to do is implement what is
called a do-while loop now python on its
own doesn't come with a do-while loop
but it's pretty easy to set one up and
the basic format of a do-while loop if
you don't know is they always execute
the code at least once and then at the
end they check if a condition is true
that would warrant running the code
again and the basic format of a do
Loup is you're going to have do and then
you're going to have a bunch of code
followed by a while condition and then
whatever the condition is so it's going
to hit the do part it's going to execute
this code right here and then it's going
to check to see if that code should be
executed again now I want you to create
a do-while loop and hint hint hint
you're going to go and you're going to
use a while statement in much the same
way as you did previously and on top of
that what I want you to do is create a
guessing game in which the user must
choose a number between 1 and 10 and
it's going to have the following format
it's going to say something like guess a
number between 1 and 10 and then they're
going to enter a number and you can say
something like 1 and if that isn't
correct it's going to ask again and then
you could enter a number something like
7 and in that situation if 7 was the
number it's going to put a message on
the string that says you guessed it now
once again if you don't get it right
don't worry about it what we're doing
here is we're building up a base of how
to solve similar problems and that is
the whole reason for this tutorial to
exist and the hope is after you see
these common ways to solve common
programming problems after a while
they'll stick in your head and in the
future you will know how to do them but
give it a good little test here and see
how it works out if you'd like another
little hint before you jump in you're
going to need both a while loop as well
as a break statement and hopefully you
can get it that way otherwise now I'm
going to show you exactly how to solve
it ok so we're going to create a storage
cell in a variable for the secret number
they have to guess and then I'm going to
type in while true just like I did in
the previous part and then I'm going to
say guess is equal to int now you could
use your exception handling here but I
want to focus in on getting this as
brief as possible of course in the real
world you would use exception handling
to make sure this is done right one
and ten and then we're just simply going
to come in and say if gas is equal to
the secret number then in that situation
we'll say print and you guessed it and
then here's the break statement that I
told you about and that is all you're
going to have to do if we come down here
and run it we can come in and go one
it's not ask again two three and then if
we type in seven you guessed it pops out
on the screen so hopefully got that
right if you didn't don't worry about it
we'll get more into it and you'll get
much better at solving problems like
this in the future
now I want to jump over and go through a
whole bunch of different math functions
that are available to you with Python
all right so every time I go and talk
about math functions in a programming
language everybody says I dwell on it
too much and I want to make this
tutorial full of a bunch of problems we
could solve so I'm going to go through
this very quickly and of course if you
have any questions leave them in the
comment section I answer all my comments
now one thing to know here is that
Python is going to provide many
functions with its math module right
here and you can see a whole bunch of
them right here
and because we used the import statement
right here you're going to access
methods by referencing the module so
this is the module and there is the
module right there and I'll go through
exactly how all of these are going to
work for us so basically ceiling is
going to round up this value and if we
go and we run this we can walk through
exactly what's going on so we have
ceiling here which is going to round up
to five floor is going to round down
this is how we get the absolute value
which just knocks off the negative sign
we can also calculate the factorial
which is just multiplying all the
different numbers up to the number that
you provide this is another way that we
can do like modulus division where we do
a division and then get our remainder
with F mod truncate is going to
basically just receive a float and
return an integer as you can see we can
calculate the power of two numbers we
can get the square root there are
special values that are built into
Python like E and PI and you can see
those right there also do e to the power
of whatever you provide
there and this should be exponent a
little bit of an error no big deal we
can also return the natural logarithm
and I just provided a little bit of
information in regards to how natural
logarithms work in mathematics if you
don't want to worry about the math part
of that don't worry about it we're also
going to be able to define the base of
this number and exactly how those
calculations take place they're also
going to have a whole bunch of different
trig functions as well as hyperbolic
functions that are available and of
course these are going to just receive a
value just like that and then finally
you're also going to be able to convert
radians to degrees and also degrees into
radians so there's a rundown of some
math functions feel free to get the code
in the description of course it's free
and play around with those if you'd like
to what I'm going to do instead is show
you more accurate ways that we can
perform floating-point calculations
because I received a whole bunch of
questions about that topic now I'm going
to talk about the decimal module and I'm
going to import it in a different way
instead of import I'm going to say from
decimal import decimal as and I'm just
going to make this D now with from
you're going to be able to reference the
methods or functions that are inside of
the decimal module without the need to
reference the module like we had to with
math meaning previously we had to type
math dot floor or math dot ceiling or
whatever also I demonstrate here that we
can create what is called an alias being
D in this situation and this is going to
allow us to avoid conflicts with methods
with the same name so now what we're
going to be able to do is do a little
bit better calculations so we're going
to say sum is equal to D and then inside
of here I'm going to put a 0 now I want
to perform a calculation that you saw
previously that went wrong and I'm going
to show you how we can do it the right
way so that we get more accurate results
0 points 1 and then we're going to add
this up again throw that in there a
couple more times
throw it in there one more time and now
we're going to change this to negative
and make this three and then what we're
going to do is print out the results so
we can say sum this is equal to and then
the value of sum and then to show you
what it works like without the decimal
module what I'm going to do is I'm going
to say and then we'll see the results of
that calculation as well like that and
we could save it and run it and you're
going to see right here whenever we use
the decimal module everything comes out
perfectly fine otherwise we get this
stinky result that you see right here
which is not very good so there's a way
to perform calculations using floats
that is more accurate and you can play
around with that on your own but now I'm
going to jump over and talk about
strings now text is going to be stored
using the string datatype and by the way
there's a way that we can figure out the
type of any different type of variable
or basic value we can just type in type
and that's going to provide that to us
and we can also go type and throw a
float inside of here
and another thing that is good to know
is whenever you are creating strings it
doesn't matter if you use double
quotation marks or if you come in and
you use single quotation marks as you're
going to see here in a seconds let's
change that to this and that to that and
if we run it you're going to see right
here that this is an int this guy right
here this is a float and both of these
guys are represented as strings so very
important to know and now let's go and
create a string and I'm just going to
call this sample string and I'm going to
give this value of this is a very
important string and don't worry you're
going to get some problems here in a
second now each character is going to be
stored in a series of boxes that are
going to be labeled with index numbers
and you can get a character by
referencing that index so we can come in
and we could say sample string
everything in programming or a lot of
programming is based around the concept
of storing things and boxes because
that's the way computer stores
if we run that you can see that T comes
in right there and T starts this out so
it starts off at the zero index one two
three four five six and so forth and so
on you're also going to be able to very
quickly get the last character in our
string by just typing in negative one
like that and you can see the G pops up
right there another thing that is
interesting is we would also be able to
add indexes inside of here so we could
go three plus five and you can see that
a comes up inside of there and you could
also have a variable and B inside of
here and then add 5 to it and so forth
and so on and you're going to see more
examples of that as the tutorial
continues we're also going to be able to
come in and get the string length which
is going to be very useful if you're
going to want to cycle through a string
how you do that is type in le n for
length and sample string let's do a
couple more of these we're also going to
be able to get a slice by saying where
to start and where to end so we can come
in and we can go sample string and then
this is a slice and we'll go whoops
let's get rid of these quotes inside
here and just print this stuff out on
the screen just to keep it nice and
simple so if we want to start at the
zero index and we want to slice up to
the 4th index but not include it that's
how that's done and if we run it you can
see the length is there and we were also
able to get this and print that out with
the slice we can also come in and get a
slice that's going to start at this
index the 8th index and then get
everything thereafter and you can see
exactly how that works for us we can
also come in and join or concatenate
strings with the et plus sign so we
could say green and then eggs and run
that and that's going to work for us
we're also going to be able to come in
and multiply to be able to repeat
strings numerous different times so
let's say we have something like hello
put a space inside of there and let's
say we would like to see hello five
times well that's how easy that is to do
and also we will be able to convert
integer into a string just by going numb
string is equal to and then we can put
STR 4 so just like we were able to
convert a string into an INT with the
int function that you saw previously
we're also going to be able to convert
integers into strings using the STR
function we can also come through and
cycle through each character that is
inside of a string so we can say
character and character is just going to
be a variable that's going to
temporarily hold each character of the
string to print out onto the screen
temporarily and we can go for character
in sample string and then let's say we
want to print out all those individual
characters and you can say that all
those individual characters printed out
on the screen right there right here if
you can't see that and that's going to
be very important for our little problem
that's going to be coming up here we're
also another things kind of neat is we
can cycle through characters in pairs so
we can say something like for I in and
this is another range function that's
available to us so we're going to say
here is we want to start at index 0 and
we want to cycle through the total
number of string characters that are
available to us however because this is
going to be a zero index
this is index 0 we're going to subtract
1 from that because if we would come in
here and say what's the length it's
going to say 31 but there actually isn't
going to be a 31st index so that's the
reason why we were changing this to 30
instead of 31 this range is going to
temporarily hold all of the different
indexes for the string didn't make sense
leave a question below I'm like I said
I'm going to want to cycle through in
pairs so I want to get two characters
each time instead of just one character
and then if I want to come in here and
print out those different characters I
could go I and let's go and just add
these together sample string and then
inside of it like I said we can go and
put some addition inside of there we can
get that guy right
and if I run this you're going to say
that it's going to print everything out
in pairs okay pretty cool and other
thing that's going to be a very
important if you want to be able to
solve the problem that's coming up is
that you're going to have to know that
computers are going to assign characters
with a number that is known as a Unicode
in a capital A through capital Z are
going to have unicode's of 65 through 90
and a lowercase a through Z are going to
have unicode's from 97 through 122 and
we can go and convert back and forth
between these different guys let's go
and comment these out so we don't get
any errors and it's pretty easy we can
just say something like print and then
we say a is equal to and there you go o
or D and pass in the a and this is going
to give us the Unicode for a and
likewise we're going to be able to come
in and say 65 and then call another
function that is called CHR and we can
change this to 65 and if we run it
you're going to see that the Unicode for
the capital letter a is 65 just like I
told you up here as well as if we
convert 65 from Unicode to a character
you're going to get a and that is going
to bring us to a pretty complicated
problem and that problem is going to be
that I want you to be able to receive a
uppercase string and then hide its
meaning by turning it into a string of
unicode's
then translate it from unicode back to
its original meaning so if you want
sample input or output for this guy it's
going to say something like enter a
string to hide in uppercase the second
part of the problem is going to be able
to receive uppercase and lowercase
letters but we're going to start here
just keep it simple so it's going to say
something like enter a string to hide in
uppercase it is then going to convert
that into just the you
code numbers it's going to print
something out like secret message and
let's say that they type in something
like hide it's then going to print out
Unicode so I don't know what to all the
different things are let's just say it's
34 56 78 and 90 those are going to
represent the four different characters
that are inside a hide so it's going to
convert it into that and then actually
after it converts into that secret
message it's going to print out on the
screen a risen original message and it's
going to print hide back out but
whenever we're doing it the first time
it's just going to receive all uppercase
letters to keep it rather simple and
that's going to perform all of those
conversions so that's what I want you
guys to make go ahead and try and do it
now or if you'd like a couple more hints
I will provide those to you alright so
if you want a couple hints here
basically of course we are going to have
an input that is going to say enter a
string to high number case okay so we're
going to go and print that out there and
we're going to store that variable next
thing we're going to do is we are going
to cycle through each character in the
string while we are doing that we're
going to store each character code in a
new string and that's going to look like
this after it gets all those character
codes after we do that we're going to
print out our secret message like this
print and secret message and then it's
going to print out whatever the numbers
are so it's just so 34 56 78 90 blah
blah blah it's going to be something too
different that obviously then after we
do that we're going to cycle through
each character code two at a time look
at previous examples here by
incrementing by two each time I showed
you how to do this previously next thing
we're going to do is I'm going to get
the first and second for the to do
number because we're going to be
converting these back into hide in this
situation so this is going to represent
the age this is going to represent the I
this is going to represent the D and
this is going to represent the e I'm
moving those around sorry about that
after that we want to convert the codes
into characters and add them to a new
string and then finally we're going to
print original message blink and then
hide in that situation okay so there's
even more hints so jump in there and try
and make this all on your own by pausing
the video and writing some code okay so
I'm going to write the code now and then
you can check to see if you are right
I'm going to call this normal string is
equal to input and of course you can go
in there and put the exception handling
inside of there which would be great so
I'm going to say enter a string to hide
in uppercase then I'm going to cycle
through each character inside of our
string another thing I'm going to do is
as I'm going through this I'm going to
be storing our secret message so secret
string is going to be equal to and I'm
just going to put nothing inside of
there then I'm going to cycle through
each character so for character in norm
string I'm going to store each character
in a new string it's going to put that
down there so that's going to be our
secret string is going to be equal to
I'm going to go plus equal to so I can
continue adding those I'm going to
convert into a string and I go call Ord
with the character so what this guy is
going to do is it's going to get the
character code whenever it receives the
character and then it's going to turn
that character code or number into a
string just so it can save that as a
string after it's done with that it is
going to print out our secret message so
we'll say secret message and then secret
string then we're going to do a similar
thing whenever we're cycling through
each character code
and we're going to put normal string is
equal to and I'll just put nothing
inside of there and then we're going to
have to cycle through each character two
at a time just like I showed you
previously so I'll say for I in range
I'm going to start out at the zero index
I'm then going to get the length of my
secret string and I'm going to subtract
one from that once again
because the string length is going to
come back as whatever the total length
is and it's going to disregard the zero
index so I have to subtract one to make
up for that fact and then I want to get
two characters at a time I then need to
get the first and second for our
two-digit numbers so I'm going to go
angle character code is going to be
equal to secret string and I'm going to
get the first index right there and I'm
going to add that with I plus one just
like I showed you in previous tutorials
and then I want to convert the code into
characters and store them in the normal
string so normal string plus equal to
character integer and character code is
going to go inside of there and then
finally we're going to after we have all
this set up we're going to print out our
original message
so print equal to the original message
and that's going to be normal string so
we can save that guy and then come down
here and run it enter a string to what
is this hide I spelled that wrong to
hide there we are let's run it again
ctrl R enter a string to hide in
uppercase we're just going to type in
hide and it's going to come in here it's
going to convert it all into the
individual Unicode characters and then
it's going to convert it back from it so
hopefully you got that right if you
didn't that's not a problem like I said
you want to learn these common ways to
solve common programming problems and
that's how you get better and better at
programming now finally this is going to
be the super awesome mind scrambling
problem what I want you to do is I want
you to make this work for uppercase and
lowercase letters now well you may ask
yourself well why doesn't it work that
way
originally well remember the unicode
care
Cheers capital A through Z are going to
be 65 through 90 meanwhile lowercase
characters a through Z are going to be
97 through 122 now why would this cause
a problem think about that for a moment
well if we go down here here and we look
at our code you're going to see right
here that we're saying that we want to
cycle through each character code two at
a time by incrementing by two each time
that worked with uppercase characters
because there were only ever two digits
however with lowercase characters there
can sometimes be three characters or
three numbers and that would cause a lot
of problems let's go through let's run
it and see exactly what type of problems
that causes just so you can see that so
we'll go and run it again and here we're
going to say hide like this hit enter
and you're going to say that it doesn't
print out the stuff and you're also
going to see the 100 and 101 what I want
you to do is to figure out how to make
this work for uppercase and lowercase
letters by just simply somewhere inside
of here adding one addition as well as
one subtraction and I'll pause and give
you a chance to look through your code
and figure out how to do that and then
after the break I'll show you how to
solve it okay so basically the way we
can solve this quite easily is I'm going
to come up here and undo this what I
would need to do is convert this into
two-digit values and convert this into
two-digit values well it's actually
quite easy to do that I'm going to have
to do is subtract 23 from that and then
I will know that the highest value of
this will ever be is 99 that's going to
cover my upper case and lower case
values and then all I need to do is come
in here and get rid or add in that 23
whenever I search through to print out
the regular values so I'm gonna have to
do it's come down through here and where
we have secret string right like this
I'm just going to come in right before
that and I'm going to subtract out 23
then once again
down here to the normal string and
whenever I go to convert it back I'm
going to increase that value right like
that so hopefully you got that and let's
come in here and we can type in HOD and
you're going to see that how it works
just like that so that's just a way of
thinking your way through a problem so
that you have the least number of
changes you wouldn't go through and dude
like checks like am i working with three
numbers right now or am i working with
two numbers right now the problems or
the way to solve things are sometimes
very very easy and we don't really get
to them sometimes because we look at the
problem as okay how am I going to work
with two-digit numbers as well as three
digit numbers meanwhile we can just come
in and convert them easily down into the
two digit values and then add that value
back in so that everything works
perfectly okay so hopefully you guys
