tutorial on how to record your iPad on
either a Mac or a PC and as you can
probably guess I'm going to use a tool
called reflection yes you could buy a
video card or you can jailbreak your
iPhone or your iPad but I found this is
the easiest way and it offers a trial
account you could try it out at least
five to ten times from what I've seen
and it works on Macs and PCs I know this
isn't a sponsor that said to reflection
app comm this is just my opinion of
what's the best based off of your
questions so let's take a look at
reflection now here is reflection and
it's very very easy to set up I have an
iPad you do need an iPad - or later to
have this work and what I'm gonna do on
my iPad is I'm just gonna hit my home
button twice and then you're gonna see
here in a second exactly what I am going
to do and I'm gonna click on enter full
screen inside of reflection and you can
see that everything pops up here right
on the screen here is my iPad now
there's positives and negatives to using
two different recording devices I'm
going to show you them both and you're
going to be able to swipe through
everything on your iPad with your hands
the mouse isn't gonna do anything and
you're gonna be able to go through all
these different games or record whatever
you want to record inside of it now on
your iPad you hit the home button two
times that's the only button the
square-looking thing come over here
and then you're gonna come down here to
this airplay icon you're gonna click on
it and then on your iPad again you're
gonna click on whatever the name of your
computer is and turn mirroring on that's
it that's all you need to do when you're
ready to rock and roll
now all the controls done on your iPad
of course and there's a couple different
ways to use reflection you're gonna be
able to record right here by clicking
start recording now why this is good is
it's gonna record all the sounds from
your iPad I'm gonna show you another way
to record so you can zoom in like I'm
doing right here but it is not going to
record the audio from your iPad so
basically if you want to do this you're
gonna use this guy whenever you want a
record off of your iPad and you're going
to use a screen capturing device
whenever you want to record your voice
but either way you're gonna be able to
do voiceovers and so forth you want to
do that and there's a whole bunch of
different things you can do you can
force landscape for its portrait but I
don't know why you'd want to do that you
could show the skin
for the iPad but nobody seems to do that
so I don't know why you'd want to do
that but if you would there you are you
can see their different skins that are
available and that's basically what you
can do with this guy now I like to do
screen recordings with Camtasia too and
that's also available both on a Mac and
a PC so that's what I use if you want to
use it again not a sponsor is just what
I do and then I'm gonna give you a
little sample so let's say I go into
reflection and I do a start recording
and then you're gonna click stop
recording and that's it it's not rocket
science I could then go into and I'm
gonna show you what this looks like here
whenever I'm done with it
but I'm inside of iMovie which I know is
a Mac only thing but you know use
whatever you want to use if you're on a
PC then you're going to just file and
then come in here to import and you're
going to import your different videos
you want or you could create a new event
like I did here recording iPad screen
and import the video that way just by
clicking on this and going import movies
then you're gonna import which is a dot
MOV file in this situation directly into
iMovie and if you would want to do a
voice over remember if you're recording
in reflection it records the sound from
your app if you record using a screen
capturing device like Camtasia 2 it
doesn't however positives using Camtasia
is you can zoom on the reflection app
you can not zoom unless the iPad app
lets you zoom okay so hopefully that
makes sense then if I would like to get
this where I do have sound inside of
here and I would right like to record a
voiceover or something like that inside
iMovie I just click on this guy right
here record a voiceover just click on it
and then I go to where I want to start
recording I click on it it counts the 3
and then I just start talking and that's
exactly how I did that so that's
basically it I'm gonna show you a couple
different examples of different ways you
can record these videos remember I don't
record games I don't do that sort of
thing but if you want to see exactly
what it would look like whenever this is
all done you're gonna see that right now
to leave any questions or comments below
otherwise till next time well hello
internet and welcome to my video review
of Angry Birds Star Wars of course in
cooperation with Rovio and LucasArts and
it all occurred and
galaxy far far away and here comes the
intro screen it's very fancy and Star
Wars Birds Lake and I'm gonna go through
all the different characters all the
different worlds and all the different
things available on the iPad edition of
Angry Birds Star Wars there's the bonus
level path of the Jedi the Hawk world is
coming soon there's the Death Star and
I'm gonna focus in on Tatooine here
first and here are there's 40 levels as
you can see here and I'm just gonna jump
into one of these worlds and there's a
little bit of a story but not much and
there you can see some pigs dressed up
like Tusken Raiders and here is han Solo
and each of the birds has a special
ability Han Solo is gonna shoot lasers
as you see and there he goes and then a
box falls on his head and here is Luke
Skywalker bird and he has a lightsaber
and he blows some stuff up and yes he
has a lightsaber even though he didn't
in the movie at that point
here's obi-wan Kenobi and he uses a
force ray thing and he also knocks
things down on top of pigs heads then
you have to baka as we continue on and
he's just a big giant ball of fur that
smashes things like that and then this
guy breaks into three different pieces
and there's a whole bunch of levers
there's a Darth Vader pig and here comes
Luke Skywalker he's gonna do some
lightsaber stuff deflect some laser
beams and then crash into a wall on the
bonus level you're going to have r2d2
and he is going to just be shot and then
he's gonna shoot electricity out all
over the place like you're gonna see
right he off and then there's c-3po bird
egg ish thing and he's just going to
break in pieces and below that sangre
