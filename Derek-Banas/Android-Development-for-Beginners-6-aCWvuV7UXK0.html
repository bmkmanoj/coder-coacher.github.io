of my android development for beginners
tutorial today we're going to do
something a little bit different a lot
of fun I'm going to create an
application that is going to be geared
towards making you guys want to add to
it and we're going to cover the sound
record of the player we're going to do
more with lists and we're going to talk
about incremental programming which is
just incrementally adding different
features to our program making sure they
work and then adding additional features
thereafter this helps cut down on errors
and also helps us understand what's
going on and in essence what we're going
to be creating is a beat box but it
could be converted into a note-taker or
a whole bunch of other different things
so let's take a look at exactly what
we're gonna be making ok so in this
tutorial what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make an application that is very very
simplistic but it's going to be able to
be ramped up to do all sorts of really
cool things now for example all I did
here each one of these little buttons
has my daughter saying just random weird
sort of funny cute things however this
could very easily be turned into a
note-taking thing a beatbox type of
thing anything like that if I hit the
reset button here I'll be able to record
again so let's say I want to do a
beatbox type of thing I could go
hhhh hhhh stop recording and you can see
that it's playing it back so I hope this
is a really fun tutorial and the way
that it's structured it's structured to
make you want to add more to it and
explore all this stuff so let's get into
it ok so there is the application that
we will be making and I'm going to call
this beatbox as you can see right here
and then real quickly now I'm just going
to assemble this and like I said I'm
going to incrementally build this
application so the very first thing that
I'm going to want to do is to verify
that I can record I can stop recording
and I can play and I can get the
location for the sound on my device so
the very first thing I'm going to do is
go to layout I'm going to get myself all
horizontal arrangements and drop it in
here and then I'm going to go and get
himself some buttons so user interface
there's a button draw
but in there go get another button drop
it in there there it is
and get me another button and drop it in
here and then come over and get myself a
label and that is just going to put it
on the screen temporarily the location
for my sounds that I record now I'm
going to come in here and select these
individually and give them a name so I'm
going to call this record and then I'm
gonna click on rename after that and
this is just going to be the record
button and there we go and you can see
it says record then I'm going to get
this one and it is going to be called
the stop button and rename that come
over here and I'm going to call this
stop record button and then get this one
right here and this is going to be play
and rename and call this the play button
just to keep it very simple and there we
go and then I can get my label this guy
right here and let's call this let's
rename this to sound location label and
there that is that's gone so there's our
whole user interface and if I want to
have this fill my screen I can go over
here to horizontal arrangements like
that come down here to width go fill
parents say okay and then I can grab
each one of these and say fill parent
and you're gonna see what happens so
okay these are all the buttons filled
parents and you might be asking yourself
well how can all three fill the parent
well you're going to see that they
equally divided up all the space
together and they work quite nicely then
I'm also going to need a sound recorder
so come over here to media and sound
recorder is this guy so drag that over
here and drop it in did I drop it yep
there it is also going to need a player
drag that over drop that in and I'm also
going to use a notifier and the notifier
is in the user interface and that's just
going to be a little dialog box and drop
that in alright now I'm prepared so
let's go ahead and take a look at
exactly what we are going to try to
create in the block section okay so like
I said before what we're going to be
doing here is incrementally building
this application so the very first thing
we're going to do here is start off
simple and just implement the ability to
record to stop recording to display the
location for our sound
and then to play it back so we're going
to incremental e build this thing and
verify that everything works along the
way all right so now that you know what
we're going to create in the block
section let's go in and let's start
creating all the blocks that we need
here first what I'm going to do is I'm
going to have to store without recording
because I'm going to do a couple things
with it I'm going to display it in the
label that you just previously saw and
also I'm going to reference it whenever
I say I want to play a certain recording
so that means that I'm going to have to
create a new variable so I'm going to
have to go initialize global drag and
drop that right there and I'm going to
call this recording 1 and I'm going to
come in here and give it a value of
nothing but by putting double quotes and
hitting Enter and there we go have that
all set up then what I'm going to need
to do is have the record button work so
I'm gonna have to say when the record
button is clicked there it is
I want it to start recording so how do I
start it recording well I'm gonna have
to go to the sound recorder which is
right here and I'm just simply going to
call for the sound recording to start
what you may ask yourself well how are
we going to stop this well of course
we're gonna click on the stop record
button and there it is drag drop that
right there and then what are we gonna
do with it specifically we are going to
come down here to sound recorder click
on that and all these blocks and
everything here in the description I
have a link to all of them might help to
have them in front of you drag that
we're going to stop it but then we're
also after we stop it we are going to
set the sound location label with the
global recording this guy right here all
this is is it is the location for the
recording but to get that what I'm going
to have to do is go into the sound
recorder again this guy right here and
you can see here the after sound
recorded it's going to store the
location for our sound so we're going to
want to get this guy drop him right
there
drag this down here give ourselves a
little bit more room and then inside of
this guy we're going to set the value
for this one so we're going to go set
drag that
right there and then we're going to say
get the new sound that you have that you
just record it and let's set it up with
this guy now I can come down here and
set my label just by going to sound
location label right there and set sound
location label text drag that whoops
drop it right here and then since I have
this as a global that means everybody
can see it
so to get it so I just get this guy
right here and drop it on there and
that's what it looks like the only thing
to do now is to make the play button
work so I'm going to go into the play
button and I'm going to say when it's
clicked drop this right here and for
your homework you might want to look
into how to take a long press and then
have that tell the player to continue
looping so there's homework if you want
it because people ask me for homework
all the time now I can go in here I have
to tell the player that I want it to
play but first I have to assign exactly
what I want to play and you do that by
setting the source drop that right on
there and the source is going to be this
guy right here
so let's duplicate that drag it drop it
right there and then I have to call and
tell the player to start and there it is
call player 1 to start and there we go
everything is all set up and everything
will work exactly as I demonstrate it on
my device itself now let's go and take a
look at exactly what we're going to be
adding next which are going to be a list
and we're going to be adding lists just
to verify or be able to store multiple
sounds and also we're going to be able
to add items to our list and we're going
to be doing a whole bunch of other
things with lists so let's take a look
at what we're going to be moving towards
next ok so we're going to incrementally
build now towards this now of course
we're still going to be able to record
and talk and talk and talk and we're
still going to display the information
in regards to where the sound file is
being stored
and we'll also be able to play it of
course however in the background we're
going to be now storing this information
in a list and that's going to be
important because our final application
is going to store a whole bunch of
sounds in a list all right so as you saw
we are basically going to be working
with a list and we're going to be using
those lists in multiple different places
anytime I say I want to use this in
multiple different places that normally
means I need to create a global variable
for it so I'm going to click on
variables and we're going to create a
list here so initialize global drag
let's drop it right here and what are we
going to be creating a list well first
let's give it a name because you may
know I have a tendency when I'm doing
these tutorials to forget to do that now
it's called sound list and then to
create a list let's click on the lists
over here you could see create an empty
list well I don't have any sounds
whenever the app first starts up so
that's what I want to do it also do make
a list if you want to put other sounds
inside of there there's other homework
if you'd like more homework go and
figure out how to store drum beats and
other different things and play those as
well as recorded sounds so more homework
ok so now we're going to think about
well what do we need to change here well
the record button is still going to act
like a record button so whenever it's
clicked on it is going to record a sound
after the sound is recorded however is
going to change and how it is going to
change is whenever a new sound is added
we want to add it to our sound list well
let's go into the list section see what
is inside of here
well you can see right here add items to
list and item well the item we want to
add in this situation would be a sound
so let's grab this and drop it right
there and go and give ourselves a little
bit more space so we can work here and
inside of here we have to tell it what
list we're going to be adding it to well
we are going to be adding it to our
sound list this guy so let's go get
sound list this guy there it is dropped
it right there and what are we going to
be adding we're going to be adding our
new sound so get sound and put it right
there now we are adding the sounds to a
list that we're then going to be able to
work with later on and if we come down
inside of here whenever we click on the
stop record button there's no reason to
change anything
going to let everything be exactly the
same and whenever we go to click the
play button well guess what something is
going to change here because we're now
going to be working with sounds that are
stored inside of a list and what happens
if we try to play a sound that doesn't
exist the program is going to crash so
what are we going to do here well we're
no longer going to be using this guy
actually let's just get rid of all this
together and start over so we're going
to be playing sounds from a list because
we're incrementally adding things what
we did first was we verified that the
record the record stopped the play and
the location all worked after we
verified that now we want to add list
functionality to be able to store
multiple sounds now we could just jump
in here and start creating or thinking
everything's going to work but sometimes
that's bad so what we're doing here is
we're just verifying that the list
application works are we going to be
able to store multiple sounds in a list
it's all we're doing here and so we're
going to add that functionality now if
we get back to the play button we may
have remembered whenever we go to play
we want to verify that a sound actually
exists to play in the list before we try
to play it well any time we get into the
situation where we have a condition that
means we are going to have to go into
control and use an if-then-else block or
whatever you want to call these things
so let's show up that inside of there
and then let's think about our
conditions well what do we want to
verify we want to verify that the list
is not empty before we try to play
something all right and otherwise we're
probably going to put a notification out
there hey your list is empty I can't
play anything so we're going to say if
list is empty let's go and look here and
see if there's a way to find out if our
list is empty is list empty
yep we can do that so let's go and drag
that down here and we're going to want
to see if this returns a value of true
or false so that means logic and we're
going to say true here and then we're
going to have to compare the two of them
together so that means we're going to
have to go into whoops logic and we're
going to get this guy right here then
we're going to say if is list empty
drag drop that right there and then we
have to get our list that's what's going
to go right here just come up here go
like this get there's our sound list
drop it right there
not equal to true if it is not equal to
true that means that there's an item in
our list in that situation we're going
to be able to play but specifically we
want to play the first index in our list
we're not thinking about there being
multiple items yet incremental
programming we're just making sure the
first one works and then we're going to
assume everything works after that so if
we want to play something we have to
first say where is the location of what
you want to play so get the player and
get the source and drop it right there
then we need to get the first item in
the list so that means we need to go
into the list tools here we're going to
say that we want to select an item from
our list so select list item drag that
over here we're going to have to define
what list we want so just grab this and
duplicate it drag that right there and
specifically we want to index one the
very first location in our list so we're
going to go into math and grab our
number and drag it down here and drag it
over here and then inside of here we're
going to type 1 and then after we set
what we want to play we can go into the
player again and we can say that we want
it to play right there call player start
now if we're good programmers we want to
handle if the list is empty so if it
isn't empty that means it is sound in
there to play then we want to play it if
it is empty well we want to pop up a
little notification so we're going to
say else right like that and we're going
to pop up a notifier that says hey
there's no sounds for you to play so get
the notifier right there and I'm just
going to do a simple show alert notice
and drag and drop it right there and
there you go and then I'm going to come
in here and put a little note um let's
know sounds
in list enter that is and there that is
and there you go
and after we run this program and you
should run this incrementally as well on
your own devices to verify that
everything works after we run this then
and we know that the list items work we
can add ons we can select items we can
do all kinds of things with them then
what we want to be able to do is go in
there and add numerous play buttons so
that means we're going to have to go
back to the designer and what we're
going to be creating here now is the
application you saw at the very very
beginning of the video so feel free to
review that but otherwise let's just go
and start doing it okay so now we no
longer need this play button technically
we're going to use it but we're going to
change the way that it looks we
definitely do not need this label
because all of the items there are going
to be stored inside of our list so we
can just come over here and say delete
and delete and it's gone then what we're
going to do is we're going to get
ourselves another layout and a
horizontal arrangement and I will no
doubt be adding a gazillion sounds to my
own personal app I just want to keep it
simple for this one I'm going to get to
play drag it in there and then I'm going
to change this up so that it's a
different color so let's just say that
this is sound 1 and then let's have our
background color hmm I don't know let's
set it for black and let's set our text
color down here to white now you can see
it's a little black dot with a 1 inside
of it all right so let's add a couple
more sounds to this guy so click on that
drag this over here drop it inside of
there and let's go into a couple more
and let's go and do one more ok so we
can come in here well first let's go and
look at this it says play button right
well let's click on this and let's
rename this to play button to play
button - there we go and let's rename
this to play button 3 and there that is
and let's rename this one to play button
4 so that
goes alright and then we can select each
one of these individually click on this
one come up here change its color to
blue come down here change this text
inside of it to to change the text color
on this to white and you can see that
now that's what that looks like come
over here let's go and change this to
three come up here at the background
color change it to cyan and then come
down here and change the text color to
white even though white might not
necessarily show up great and cyan not
really but whatever and background and
let's go darker change this to four and
then change my text color to white again
and there you can say it's back to
exactly the way that it was the only
thing we're going to have to do here and
this is really really silly because I
was actually going to use a procedure
and an extremely streamline everything
here but I dug through documentation
like a madman and the one thing that I
would need to do to be able to do that
is to be able to put a bunch of players
inside of a list because you see I
wanted to have this set up so that it
was like a beat box so if you had a drum
you could click on that and you could
hit like a hi-hat and it wouldn't stop
the drum when you hit the hi-hat but
there's no way to create a list of
players so I wish they would fix that
but either way we're going to have to
actually have a player for every sound
so in this situation we're going to I
mean we technically don't if you don't
mind the fact that you can't play more
than one sound at a time
you don't need multiple players but if
you want to play multiple sounds at a
time you need multiple players so let's
just go and drag these over here so
since we have four buttons we're going
to need to need four of these but we
still only need one recorder so that's
not something we have to do and now we
can go into the block section and finish
everything up alright so here we are
inside of the block section so let's
think here we have our recording right
here we have our sound list right here
what are we going to have to add to this
well let's look at the record button
does anything need to change there
no not really whenever the cord button
is clicked on it is going to record this
guy right here where we're going to
handle the new recording after the sound
has been recorded are we going to have
to change anything here well set the
recording to the sound add the items to
the list what this guy is going to do is
each time there's a new sound it's going
to create a new box in our list and it's
going to stick it in there so we don't
have to do anything with that either
come down here
whenever the stop record button is
clicked on we're going to stop recording
do we need to do anything else nope not
really then we get into this guy in
essence what we're going to have to do
is create a way of handling this for
each one of the play buttons yes like I
said before I wish I could have
streamlined this and put this inside of
a procedure but I have no way of
creating a bunch of players so once
again that's the reason why I didn't do
it that way so does anything need to
change here da da da da da da da we need
to verify that the list isn't empty so
that's good we also need to verify that
we do have a sound that we're going to
play an index one we're going to start
it and if it doesn't work we're going to
say no sounds in list so that means
basically that we are going to have to
come in here and duplicate this so I'll
just grab this whole entire thing and
let's duplicate it we're going to have
one of these for every single one of our
buttons we're going to go in here and a
play button change it to bleh button -
now we got to think about it this guy
right here doesn't work for us anymore
because we need at least two sounds for
play button two to work so that means
this one has to go away so let's go
let's just throw it away and let's go
and get this guy and drag it out of here
throw that away what am I going to
verify this time actually it's get the
whole thing throw it away okay so there
it goes and it's in the garbage can what
we're trying to verify here what we need
to verify is there's there is a least
two sounds so this plays the second
sound well we need to verify that there
is a second sound or there's more than
two sounds so that means we need to
check for greater than or equal to two
so we're gonna get this guy and we're
gonna duplicate this and drag it right
here then we're gonna have to come into
math this guy right here grab this guy
right there and
drag them over here and wrap them in
their check for if it's greater than or
equal to to come in here to math again
grab this guy number drop it in there
and change that to two and then take
this and I'm going to have to also go in
and check the length of our list so go
into lists we're going to go to length
of list this guy right here
drop it right there and list itself is
this guy right there
so we're going to go in and before we
try to play it we're going to make sure
that we have at least two sounds so that
we know we have a sound to play this is
of course going to have to be player two
this right here is going to be changed
to two when will play the second sound
player to start there that is and then
we could say sound to not in list as our
notification so there is everything we
did to create this whole entire
application incrementally I hope you
enjoyed it please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
