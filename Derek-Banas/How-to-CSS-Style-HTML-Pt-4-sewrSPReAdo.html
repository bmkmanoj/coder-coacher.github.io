covered basically how to style just
about everything in cascading style
sheet sounds a three-part video kind of
loan that it was a lot of information to
get through today I'm going to cover the
box element CSF streets everything as if
it was Fox and every box has the
following properties you have of course
your content area which holds all of
your content including text images and
anything else you put in there then you
have your padding area the padding area
is it lies between the content area in
your actual border so if I had padding
here and this is my content area as we
have right here this would be a content
and then you have padding then you have
your border which is an optional line
that lies between your padding and your
margin and your margin would be whatever
you would define right here outside of
your mother you're all going to give you
a whole bunch of examples of different
types of boxes and how to edit them this
is just a simple box design you can see
here inside the style tag i defined this
and gave it the name box on with one
give it a border color from black which
you can see their border style being
solid border width being one point five
pixels background color gray background
image URL and then the location of the
image I want the use of my background I
chose to not repeat it that's why you
only see it once I chose to put it in
the top left hand corner which is where
it is i define a line height i define
the font i wanted to use the font style
metallic so you can see that i define
the margin of 25 pixels that's why we
have a margin here and then i define
padding of 20 pixels that's why we have
more space here than we have actual
content and that's a nice easy box
design you can also define your border
color of course you can find border
style border width background color
background images background repeat'
background
ition line-height fam a fun family font
style margins padding also you can use
any of the additional text properties
for editing the information in the box
and you can also edit to the sides of
the box individually with properties
that would include padding margin border
width border style border color so forth
and so on you would do that by defining
if you wanted your border for example
the top border to be a specific style
you would define it as border top style
if you wanted to find the right side of
your box you would define that as border
dash right dash style left and bottom
for all options completely crazy pox I
basically just so everybody thing I can
find into this you can see i defined the
border fellers yellow border top color
is fuchsia border style as double and
just to draw emphasis to this you can
see I'm defining the border color as a
whole with one color and then I'm
defining individual pieces with another
color so you always wanted to set up
things that way I have my border left
width set as thick that's why it's
thicker than the rest of them back home
covered sign in and again this is really
God and I know that stunt on purpose is
to Syria a whole bunch of different
features you can see I defined my margin
right is 250 pixels that's why the box
here is closer then this box which goes
all the way to the edge because I didn't
find a marginal enough so you can see
that and then you can also see that I
define my padding to be 300 pixels and
here's an maybe a cleaner sort of layout
and design you can see here there's a
lot more space so that people conceded
this wonderful image up here and why is
that it's because I define my padding
bottom and hundred pixels so that's why
everything lays in there that way and
here i define my background color using
a hexadecimal code you can find
hexadecimal codes for all sorts of
colors by just simply typing in wiki web
colors into a Google browser and it'll
give you these hex code
well that's pretty much it that is box
designs and cascading style sheets in
the next presentation I'm going to
completely cover everything in regards
to lay out in cascading style sheets and
then you will know every single property
and every single way to style things
with cascading style sheets do you have
any questions leave comments below till
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
