6 of my C++ video tutorial on this part
of the tutorial we're gonna focus in on
solving problems getting better at that
because that's the most important thing
so we're going to specifically target
and solve for C++ problems along the way
we're going to work out how to convert
strings to vectors vectors of strings
how to trim whitespace off of strings
how to find substring matches how to
replace multiple sub strings and how to
create a Caesar cipher like always all
the code is available in the description
underneath the video and I have a lot to
do so let's get into it alright so here
we are and the very first thing I want
to do I'm going to demonstrate how to do
something and that is going to be how to
convert a string into a vector and then
we're gonna have a problem where I'm
going to let you work out how to convert
a vector into a string okay so well I'm
gonna use functions here for most of the
tutorials that continue from this point
alright so we are converting a string to
a vector so that means we are going to
need to have a vector and right what I'm
doing here is creating our function
prototype and I'm just gonna call it
string to vector does that make sense
and it's going to receive a string and
I'll just call this the string and then
it will also receive a ace character
separator which is going to tell our
program what is going to separate each
one of the strings and whenever I create
this I always like to just copy this
right here and then come down here and
after this go and actually create our
function itself not like always we're
just gonna have to figure out what we
need to create here well very first
thing we're going to return is a vector
so I want to go in here and I want to
create that so there we go we got this
all created and I'm going to call this
vector
words and there we go that's simple and
after that what are we gonna have to do
well I am going to use a string stream
object and I've used these previously
it's basically it just receives a string
and then it will spit out all the
individual words based off of what
separates those words in the string that
we're working with so I'm gonna go
standard string stream SS and I am going
to put inside here the string that was
passed in of course and now what I can
do is I'm gonna also going to have to
have a place where I can store these
individual strings so individual string
and then I'm going to cycle continue to
cycle through and get strings out of our
main string as long as they exist so I
go get line and then I put this the
string stream inside of there and then
I'm going to go and get the individual
string that I'm going to temporarily
hold them in and then I pass in the
separator that is going to separate each
of the strings that I want to work with
and then what I can do is I can just
come in and push on each of these
individual strings into our vector so
push back and s individual string and
there we go and then we got our function
all created and then after the while
loop is done executing of course we're
going to return or our vector that we
created so there we go so we went and
created all of that so now let's call it
up here and test it
so I'm gonna very first off I'm going to
create a vector and of course it's gonna
be the same format as this so I'm just
gonna copy this and paste it inside of
there and I'm going to call this one
just back short for vector and then I'm
gonna call string to vector and pass
inside of it a string so I could either
put a string inside of there or I could
do something like this is a
and string like that that works
perfectly fine as well so there's that
and then you could also just go and put
this down on the next line it's not
gonna cause any errors or anything like
that okay so we got all that set up and
then what I want to do is just cycle
through each index in the R vector and
print those out and you know there's
numerous different ways to do this I'm
gonna use an index in this situation I
is equal to zero because I like to mix
it up and show every different way of
doing things so go and get our vector
size and we're gonna continue cycling as
long as I it and there are can
additional vectors inside of there or
additional strings inside of our vector
and then when we go standard and put
these all out onto our screen and just
go and reference with our index and then
throw a newline in after each one of
those and if we run it you can see we
got an error what was our error string
two vector oh I see what I forgot to do
I forgot to throw in our new line
separator okay
so save that and run it again and you
could see it went and it grabbed that
long string converted them into a vector
and then printed out each of those
individual strings in the vectors on
separate lines
alright so simple stuff there now what I
want you to do is to pause the video and
what you're going to do is create a
program well you know what inside of
here I am actually going to do the main
program code and then you have to make
the main program code work so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna say a vector and
again I could have just left that inside
of there okay so it's gonna be a string
vector and it's going to be a list of
customers and I'm gonna say that there
are three of them and we're gonna have
customers there's that this is going to
be Bob and then we're gonna get a couple
more customers when I put the side of
here okay so we haven't gotten to the
part yet where you're going to actually
create the code I'm just you're gonna
make this work for what I have inside of
the main function alright so there we go
we got all those set up now what we're
gonna do is we're going to have a
a function that is going to return a
string and that functions name is going
to be vector to string pounds you of
course are going to pass in our vector
and then a separator once again that's
gonna be a character and then what this
is gonna do is actually print out our
string which is going to be all of our
different characters so customers and of
course this is gonna be a space in
between each of the characters it's
returned with a string right there
and there we are so it's going to create
this vector and what's your program
called vector the string is gonna do is
it's gonna receive that vector converted
into a string in which there is a space
between each of the items and then we're
gonna be able to print that out so you
can now pause your video and go ahead
and create that otherwise I'm gonna show
you how I'm gonna solve it alright so
very first thing we're gonna have to
define what our function is going to
look like it's going to return a string
of course and we already said that it's
gonna be vector two string is gonna be
the name of the function and I also said
that we're going to be receiving a
vector but how do we do that well we're
going to receive a vector and it's gonna
be a standard string type and then we're
gonna put our reference operator inside
of here to pass a vector inside of there
and then we're gonna have our separator
like we did before okay so there we go
that is how we're going to be able to
receive a vector and a character
separator and then return a string so
then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
come down here and actually create the
function alright so what we're gonna do
is this is actually pretty
straightforward I'm just gonna go and
create a string and I'm going to call it
the string equal to and just make that
empty and then I'm gonna cycle through
every single item in the vector that was
passed inside of it so vector and
there's each of those individual
customers and then I can just go the
string is equal to and I can do plus
lips plus an equal to and then whatever
the individual customer is and then I'm
also just going on the same line go
you'll be able to go in and reference
the separator to separate them also so I
need stuff and then I can just go return
and the string and everything works out
pretty good so we can save that and run
it and you can see Bob Sue and Tom I'll
print out there so hopefully you got
something similar to that if you didn't
don't worry about it the goal here like
always is just to understand the code
and get our brains to think in new and
different ways
and now I'm gonna show you a way to trim
the whitespace off of our strings now
most programming languages have a way of
trimming whitespace off of strings and
by that I just mean getting rid of
whitespace at the beginning or end of a
string and but C++ does not so what
we're gonna do is it's a useful tool to
have so we're gonna create it so I'm
gonna call this trim white space and
it's just gonna receive a string and
then of course it's gonna return the
string without the whitespace
so pretty simple and we could save that
and sorry about my voice I have a cold
that I cannot get rid of and I promised
you guys I was gonna make these
tutorials as quickly as possible so
that's the reason why I have some issues
all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to define the whitespace
characters that I am going to want to
erase from our string so I'm actually
gonna create a string I'm gonna call it
white spaces and then inside of here I'm
gonna put like just a regular space I
can throw a tab inside of there form
feed new lines and so forth alright so
there's the different whitespace that I
want to delete from the front and the
end of my string then what I can do is
go the string and call for a race and
then go a string and find last knot of
and what this is going to do is it's
going to find the last instance of
something in the string that isn't one
of these things so it's gonna find the
very last one that isn't one of those
and I can just go white spaces like this
and then we're going to
two plus one and there we go so we're
gonna erase everything up until we get
to that point right there and I'm gonna
come in and go string like that and of
the string like that
all right so we got that all set up and
what we're gonna do well then we're
gonna use fine first not of in a very
very similar way so we can just copy
this guy right here and paste that in
there and then this is gonna erase
everything from 0 up to the string and
this is gonna be find first not of so
there's whoops fine first knot of white
spaces and in this situation we don't
need the plus one on there and then what
we can do is go return and the new
string okay so pretty simple stuff and
of course you could just use one of
these if you wanted to get rid of even
went to trim on the right or this one to
trim on the left so there's two more
functions you can go and create for
homework if you'd like otherwise I'm
gonna come up here and create my string
so I'm gonna go string and just call it
a string is equal to and I'm gonna put
some space here and then I'm gonna say
just some random words and then put some
more spaces there and what I want to do
is get rid of that white space so I'll
go a string is gonna be equal to and I
can call trim white spaces and our white
space I called it and then throw in
whoops trim which bozos there we go and
throw a string into it and then go
standard and print that out so I don't
like this and then I could throw like a
star inside of here or something just to
show that these are all the white spaces
are gone so let's get rid of a string
and throw what it doesn't matter if
there's an
either way all right so I got that and
we can run it and you could say that it
got rid of the white space on the left
as well as the white space on the right
okay so pretty useful stuff and for the
next one we're gonna do a problem once
again and what I want you to do is to
figure out how to find all index matches
and I want you to take a basically a
string and I want you to find all of the
matches for individual words and then I
want you to store those indexes that
matched into a vector and then return
that vector so you could pause your
video and go and do that otherwise I'm
going to do it right now you know what I
think I'm gonna do exactly what it did
before where I'm going to do the main
part for you and then you have to make
the code work so what we're gonna do in
the main part here is I'm gonna have a
phrase is equal to and it's gonna be to
be or not to be all right and we're
gonna put that inside of there and then
we're gonna go and create a vector of
intz which are going to be all the
matches that we are searching for so I
might as well just call it matches and
that's gonna be equal to and then this
is gonna be the actual function you're
gonna be creating it's gonna be called
fine substring matches and you're gonna
pass inside of it the phrase and then
you're also going to pass inside of it
the string that you are going to be
searching for so you're going to be
searching for the phrase B in this
string you pass inside and then this is
gonna return a vector that is going to
be full of all the indexes where it
matched for that for the word B and then
you're gonna just come in here and print
these out so I'm going to go eyes equal
to zero and you're gonna do that while I
matches size and plus plus and and
tremendous guy is gonna print out all
the matches that it had which are going
to be index numbers so matches there we
go and there we are
okay so I think you have enough
information now so your goal is to go
and make fine substring match
all right saying you can pause your
video right now and go and give that a
go well this parts gonna be pretty easy
I know or you know the prototype part
okay it's gonna return a vector we know
that which is an integer
you basically have all this information
here and it's gonna be called fine
substring matches it's going to receive
a string that I'm gonna call the string
and then it's also going to have another
string which is going to be our
substring that we're gonna be searching
for all right so we got that all set up
but now we have to come down here and
actually create our function all right
so let's just paste that in there and
what are we gonna need to do here well
we're going to have to create a vector
of course which is going to be full of
integers that we are going to which are
gonna be the matching addresses I'm just
gonna call it matching indexes and then
after I create that I need to check for
matching a specific substring some just
call this index is equal to and I can
just go the string and find if you watch
the previous parts of this tutorial
you're gonna know all about that and
there we are and then after that what
we're going to do is just keep adding
indexes until there are none left and to
do that I can do while and go index not
equal to standard and string and there
is and pose again like we had covered
previously and then what we can do is
just go matching indexes and of course
push back which actually use it in this
tutorial so there are throw that index
on there and then I can go index is
equal to and call the string and find
the next match that we might have index
and increment that and then after we
have all those done we can return our
vector which is going to contain all of
our matching indexes
all right so there we go and we can save
this and and if we run it so you could
see that at index 3 and index 16 we were
able to locate the word B all right so
pretty useful stuff and now you should
be able to go and use that to solve our
next problem which is going to be that I
want you to create a function that is
going to replace all sub strings or all
matching substrings in a string so you
can pause your video and go and give
that a try or if you want a tip we can
go and put some information here inside
of main and this is basically gonna be
nice and short I'm gonna call a function
called replace all sub strings it's
going to receive a string and that
string is going to be to know or not to
know and it is going to replace the word
know with a via word B and then it is
gonna print that on screen of course and
with a new line at the end alright so
there you go that is the guy you need to
work with and of course with your
solution you're going to use the
function also find some strict strict
substring matches all right so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna
you can either pause your video and do
it or I'm gonna solve it right now okay
so like always it's pretty simple we're
going to return a string and the name of
the function is replace all sub strings
and it is of course going to receive a
string that I'm going to call the string
and then it is going to get our
substring
so again substring and then the new
string that is going to be inside of it
and I might as well just call that new
string all right so there we are
and we got our prototype all set up and
then we can just go and copy this and
make this work down below I'm gonna come
down here and I'm going to paste that
inside of there and create the function
so what am I going to need here well I'm
going to be I'm gonna need a
Durer that's gonna contain all my
matching indexes first so I just go and
steal this guy right here
oh oh you know what I deleted it yeah
whatever I guess I've typed out again no
big deal
alright so I'm going to create a vector
that's good contain all of my matches
just like I did previously so much we'll
just call this matches once again is
equal to and then it's gonna be find and
we'll just copy this guy right here and
I have code completion turned off for
your help so this stuff doesn't pop up
all over the screen but it makes my life
a little bit harder that's the reason
why I had to do that alright so got
string and substring is all that needs
to go and get me all of the matches for
other words that we're searching for and
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to say if
matches dot size and is not equal to 0
so I'm checking to see if I got a match
or not and then we can do is get our
size difference between our substring
and the new string because we're gonna
be replacing all those but what what's
going to happen is as we change the
first string the index is going to move
so if we put a bigger word inside of
there the indexes are gonna move so
that's gonna cause some problems so I
need to pay attention to how much
they're going to move I'm gonna call
this length difference
I'm gonna go new string size I am - sub
string type size and this is probably
the hardest part of solving this problem
is to figure out you know this then I'm
gonna go I'm gonna keep monitoring how
many time we're going to cycle through
our loop I'm gonna call this times loop
because it's going to change by the
index it is are going to move twice as
much each time when we go through our
loop ok hopefully that makes sense I'm
gonna go for Auto index and matches so
for each of those matches that we have
inside of there I'm going to go the
string and replace index +
and then we're gonna have times looped
whoops times looped times the length
difference okay and then I can put our
substring size and then we can also put
in our new string which is gonna replace
that guy I'm then gonna be able to
increment times looped and got that set
and then after we go through all of
those what we'll be able to do is return
our final string with everything updated
so and if you're solving these problems
along with me you know and you think of
shorter ways of doing things that I'm
doing please leave them in the comments
I appreciate it and other it'll help
other people as well so we're gonna go
in here and we're gonna replace all
locations of know with word B and let's
run it and you could say that it worked
to be or not to be all right so
hopefully you guys got that and if you
didn't no big deal what I want to do now
is show you some interesting character
functions and then give you your
homework all right so rather than you
having to watch me come in here and type
all these out I thought I would just do
ahead and do them ahead of time so we're
out here right here is if we run this
you're gonna see that we I created three
different types of characters I have
here a Z letter Z here's a three and
here is a space you can see that there
are some great functions built into C++
for checking whether something is a
letter or a number and that function is
called is all numb and that's gonna
return you can see right here it
returned a one back here saying that
indeed to C was a letter or a number is
alpha is a function that's going to
allow us to check to see if something is
a letter or not also useful is upper is
gonna tell us if something is uppercase
is lower is gonna tell us if something
is lowercase is it a digit or not is
gonna tell if it's it's a number or not
and is space is gonna return either true
or false based off of if something is
indeed a space so just wanted to show
you a couple other interesting character
functions and now I'm gonna give you
actual homework what I want you to do
between now and then X
video is figure out how to create a
Caesar cipher and here I'm going to do
exactly as before I'm gonna create the
main program part and then it will be up
to you to come in here and create
everything else so we're going to have a
string that is going to be created and
it is going to be make me secret and you
are also going to go and pass that into
a function called Caesar cipher and it's
going to store the encrypted version of
our string and here's Caesar cipher it's
going to receive our string and then
it's going to receive via number of
characters we want to shift and then
you're gonna also pass in true if it's
going to be encrypting the string versus
decrypting the string all right so this
is gonna say that we want to shift every
single character over by 5 I'm gonna
give you an example here and what I mean
by 5 is let's say that you have an A and
you want it to be shifted that would be
b c d e f so every time you have an
uppercase a we're gonna convert that
into an uppercase f alright and we're
gonna continue doing that for every
single one of our difference whatever we
you know we want to encrypt and then
you're also going to be able to go and
decrypted string you're gonna be able to
call the same exact function it's gonna
be called caesar cipher again except in
this situation you're gonna pass in the
encrypted string and let's just throw it
like that you're gonna also pass in the
key for how much it needs to be shifted
except in this situation you're going to
pass in false because we're going to be
decrypting and not encrypting all right
and then after we have that all set up
what we're gonna do is well don't forget
to put the equal signs out of here and
then finally we're just gonna print
these both out
and this is gonna be in cryptid and
encrypted string and throw in our new
line and then we're gonna print out the
decrypted version also on the screen all
right so there you go D cryptid so there
you go hopefully you were able to solve
some of those problems today and
hopefully between this video and the
next you will be able to solve our
Caesar cipher alright so thank you for
joining me here today and like always
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
