10 of my java video tutorial series in
this part of the video tutorial series
I'm going to continue making my monster
game now just understand I'm doing this
totally out of my head for the most part
don't know how this is going to turn out
this is all basically trying to teach
you about logic whenever I don't say I'm
thanking a video game tutorial you can
understand that it's going to be very
easy to understand whenever I bring that
up understand it's going to be logic
based and you might not quite get it but
that doesn't necessarily mean you
shouldn't watch it because over time
you're going to completely get it you're
going to have a rule verbose
understanding of how to program so here
I am I just went and copy the code from
lesson 8 over into a little program
called lesson 10 Java and what I'm going
to do in this tutorial is I'm going to
try to make these monsters move around
without either landing on to each other
and at the same time not falling off the
board sounds really simple but there's a
lot of things you have to think about
and if you didn't watch the previous
array tutorial you should definitely
check that out and I have a link to it
above alright so what I'm going to need
to do I have a bunch of monsters on the
board this is from the previous tutorial
as you see right here these are the
monsters with the letters that you have
here and what I need to do is make them
move around without falling off the
board or landing on top of each other so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create an enhanced for statement what
you talked about before and it's going
to cycle through all of my monsters
still using the old monster to Java file
so I'm going to just put in the object
name just like before so monster 2 is
when we use them and then M which is
going to be like a container for the
monsters as they get spit out of the
array and then monsters is the array
name itself so I'm just going to come in
here and do all this and you myself
space I don't know if anybody's ever
really tried to make a video game out of
their head in a video tutorial but
that's what I'm doing ok so I'm gonna go
if and one of the things I need to do is
check the two monsters alive and I
created this little method before called
get alive it's going to tell me if the
monster is alive or not and then inside
here what I need to do I'm going to use
that array utilities index of file and
you can see up here this is this guy
right here I imported this library and I
talked about how I did that before
and basically I'm going to use that to
get the index of the current monster so
I'm going to create a new integer and
I'm going to call it
arrey item index is equal to and if I
want to use one of those cool things and
to use the array utilities you need to
actually embed that library and there's
a link that explains how to embed Java
libraries underneath this video and what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to say
monsters which is the name of the array
and then M which is going to be the
current monster that I'm playing with
here and then what I'm going to do is
take that current monster and I'm going
to call the move monster method for it
and what I'm going to pass to this
method that doesn't even exist yet is
monsters which is the whole entire array
and I'm also going to pass array item
index which is going to be the current
monster that I'm planning on moving so
that I'll be able to find it inside of
there and then basically what I'm going
to do after that is call redraw board
and let's just hope that the monster
survived all that and we're going to be
able to do it so and that's all the
changes I'm making are the only changes
that I plan on making to this part of
the code all the rest of the code is
going to be in my monster class and
that's why I'm going to go next we're
going to continue creating the function
here move monster so this is a new guy
that I introduced so I have to actually
create move monster now so what I'm
going to do here I'm going to go public
move monster I'm not going to return
anything so public is going to be public
for anything to use however it's going
to be void meaning it's not going to
return anything and then what did we say
we're gonna pass to move monster well
we're gonna pass over the monsters array
and the array index inside of this guy I
have to go monster to array and I'm
going to just call it monster because it
is a monster an individual monster and
then int and I'm just gonna make this
called array item index just like you
did before and then this is the whole
big guy that I'm going to be a creighton
here and I'm going to walk you through
the process of what I'm thinkin okay so
I have this monster well one of the
things I'm going to need to know is is
the space open that this monster plans
to move into so one of the things that
tells me is I need a boolean and it's
going to be called is space open and in
currently I'm just gonna guess that that
answer is true in the beginning and
later on I'm going to either prove or
disprove that another thing I'm in want
to do is I want to define the maximum
of Y and X for our battle board so that
I have that on hand and after I create
all this code logic or whatever you want
to call it I'm going to probably go back
in here and fix some of the knot logic
errors but just errors in regards to
it's not been optimized so just
understand that this is logic that's out
of my head that might not be lofty my's
but it gives you sort of a window into
the way that I saw of logic problems
which i think is very very hard to
understand why remember because we're
dealing with an array we have to put the
array part in there length minus one so
I figured out what my maximum size is
and remember the minus ones here because
we start counting at the index of zero
and go up to one less than whatever the
maximum size is so for example if I have
an array that's ten items wide it's
going to start at zero and end at nine
so that's the reason why the negative
ones are well then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a big giant while
loop it's going to continue to run while
the space is open that's what it's going
to do and it's just going to be used to
make sure I don't move a monster into an
occupied space so else am I going to
date well I'm going to need to know
which direction it's going to move and
which distance the monster is going to
move so let's just start off with
direction and I'm going to go random
move direction and this is a two by two
sort of like playing board so let's just
guess and say that this monster is going
to move in one of four different
directions which it well north south
east west so I need math on random and
I'm gonna go there's four different
spaces right like that and then I'm
gonna go in and I'm going to go R and
move distance remember we defined the
distance that the monster could
potentially move we gave everybody a
maximum number so we're just going to go
math again random I'm gonna say multiply
this times this which is a reference to
the monster that I'm working with so
it's going to get the Pacific get
movement method that we had before which
is just going to return the maximum move
distance that's all get movement
actually does so now I know I'm creating
a random direction the monster is going
to move and and I'm creating a random
move distance based off of the maximum
move distance that the monster has maybe
something else I want to do because I am
developed
this is to say system out and into a
print line because I know I want to see
this so I'm going to say R and move to
instance I'm going to print out to
screen this information so that I can
check my work to make sure that I'm
going in the right direction so it's all
doing there I'm just printing out that
information just to make sure that I can
see what's going on as it's being
programmed and anytime you ever have a
situation where you're creating a
program it's always good to have things
like this so you can track variable
values changing as they change if you
ever have an error you don't understand
of course you should also do the same
thing because it can help you track down
your errors and then what I want to do
is erase the monsters character on the
board by replacing it with a star so I'm
going to go battle board and then I'm
going to say this Y position and then
this x position and I'm just going to
set it to star so that's what that's
going to do it's going to figure out
what the current position for this
monster is and just set it to a star
because we know we're going to continue
searching for a space for the new
monster until we find one so we might as
well just get that out of the way right
away okay so now what we're going to do
is going to create a bunch of if
statements and what they're going to do
is they're going to find the new x
position in y position based off of the
current position on the board as well as
what the random move distance and the
random move direction so that's what
that's going to do for me so I'm going
to say if R and move Direction is equal
to zero that means north in this
situation what I want to do is make sure
that my monster doesn't accidentally
fall off the game board so I'm going to
go if this dot Y position because it's
moving north remember so it's going to
potentially hit a negative number which
I don't want it to do so I'm going to
take the random move distance right like
that and I'll make sure that that random
move distance does never go below zero
because I do not want it to fall off the
game board so something else I might
want to do then is go if that is true if
it is a negative number I want to set
the position to equal zero so that well
that does there is it make sure the
monster doesn't fall off the game board
then I'm going to go else if that
doesn't happen well I know that my
position is valid so I'm just going to
say that it's this valid move so I might
as well just allow that valid move
to occur that's what that's going to do
it's going to make sure it doesn't go
too far north and fall off the game
board with a negative number however if
it doesn't come back negative we're
going to make sure that if we keep that
move distance keep everything as it is
all right so then what do we got to do
well what if the move direction is not
north I got a check for that so I'm
going to go R and move direction if it's
equal to one that means it's an eastward
moving monster sure keep that where it's
supposed to be then I'm going to copy
this so I don't have to do a whole bunch
of type in here paste that inside of
there it's eastward moving so that means
I have to worry about it going beyond
the maximum board space well thankfully
up here see I track down the maximum x
space and the maximum y space so I know
that it can't go below zero and I know
it can't go above those numbers so in
this situation I'm going to go if this
in this situation it's going east so
this is going to be X instead plus
random move distance is greater than and
I'm going to say max X board space then
I'm actually going to copy this guy then
we're going to set the value of this guy
to the maximum board space so just like
I wouldn't let it go to a negative
number also not going to let it go
beyond a positive number and then I'm
going to go make sure that this is set
to X because we're moving eastward
remember otherwise everything should be
okay so what I'm going to do is go
exposition and I'm going to set that to
this guy right here so that everything's
all peachy and wonderful and then I can
come on down here copy that then I can
come down to this part and again to an
else--if if the move direction is two
which is going to be the same as south
well here I'm going to go and do Y
position again and then this guy is
going to be maximum Y board space
because I don't want it to go beyond
that maximum point and then this is
going to be changed into a Y this is
going to be changed into a Y and then
this is going to be changed into a wine
I think you get the logic of what's
going on here so I'm not going to keep
repeating myself and then come down here
and I'm going to close off this guy
again and then paste in an else but in
this situation we know that it's going
to mean it's moving to the last so I'm
going to go else this x position
- random move distance is less than
zero again we're protecting it from
falling off the left side of the screen
now I'm going to set this exposition to
zero this exposition and I'm going to
change this the negative since we're
moving to the west and I should actually
come up here make sure that I did all
this right and yeah anytime you have big
giant long area like this you want to do
something like end of while loop that's
going to help you keep everything in
check a little bit better and then this
is going to be end of move monster
should it did that before so now we know
when on all those things and how to keep
those all straight okay so now we know
the move direction and we also know the
move distance and we know that it's not
going to fall off the board so we're
happy about that
so now what we want to do is make sure
we don't move monsters on top of other
monsters so in the what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to create a for
statement I'm gonna go in I'm just gonna
but I as a value I I'm gonna get the
length of my monster array then what are
we going to do one thing I don't want it
to do is check that it might potentially
fall on top of itself see what I'm doing
here is I'm saying that I want to check
to see if we're I'm planning on moving
my monster there already is a monster in
there well the current x and y values
for the monster i'll be searching for
will obviously be equal to this said
monster so i don't want to go in here
and actually check it against itself
because this will create a infinite loop
which is just silly so that's why ray
index item that's why we passed the
actual value for the monster that we are
checking that's up here see here i
passed
not only the array filled with all the
monsters but the actual index location
for the current monster that I'm moving
so let's say I'm planning on moving on
stir Frank and his current X position is
equal to 1 and his current Y position is
equal to 3 well that's what this guy is
he's going to have an x and y value of 1
and 3 so what I need to do is make sure
that I do not try to check the monster
against itself because it's always going
to come back negative so that's what I'm
doing here hopefully that makes sense if
it doesn't leave a comment below so if I
am trying to check the monster against
itself I'm just going to create a if
statement and I'm going to throw
continue inside of that and what can
he was going to do is it's going to jump
me back to this for loop it's going to
iterate I and it's going to skip over
the monster so that the monster isn't
checked against itself something else I
want to do is I want to check to make
sure that you know obviously there's no
monster in the current space and I'm
thinking I want to do this in a separate
method because this one's getting a
little bit busy so in this next method
I'm going to pass it not only monster
I'm also going to pass it the value of I
which is going to be this right here all
right monster that I'm looking for and
then I'm also going to pass it array
index item so what I'm doing is eyes
going to be checking for the current
space that I want to see if it's open
Andray index is going to represent the
monster that I plan to move to that
space if the space is open wherever I'm
not exactly sure how I want on my space
to work so I'm actually going to just
leave this the way that it is right now
we'll put a little thing in here so I
can easily figure out where I was and
then I'm gonna scroll down here and I'm
gonna start creating this method called
on my space and then I'm gonna come back
here in a minute and see what's going on
so now what am I gonna do now I'm gonna
make this guy public I'm gonna have him
return a boolean value because that's
the easiest thing I can think of to do
and then this guy's going to be getting
what he's going to be getting a monster
to array and I'm just going to call it
monster he's also going to be getting an
int that is going to be the index to
check to see if there is an opener right
now and it's also going to get an other
index that's going to be Monster itself
and I'm just going to call that index to
check to and then I'm going to go end of
on my space so that I know where that
method ends so now what I'm going to do
is check to see if the two monsters have
the same XY position and sort of drawn a
blank I know this is going to work so
I'm just going to do this I'm sure
there's an easier way to do this I'm
just going to create a big giant if
statement index to check one x position
and then I'm going to go equal to and
then I'm just going to copy this paste
that in there and just change this to
monster - check - and then here I'm
going to go put two and statements
inside of there and then I'm going to
copy this whole thing again and then I'm
going to be checking the Y position
and then this why position and then all
this is going to return if those two
things are equal to each other I'm going
to return true as a value that means
that I'm trying to move a monster into a
space that already contains a monster
else well if the above isn't true the x
position of Y position is already equal
I know that there is no monster there
it's making me feel good that I decided
to move this out of the other method
because it sort of really cleaned
everything up there so that's the end of
on myspace I'm going to jump back up
here didn't think it would be that easy
but it was thankfully now what I'm going
to be able to do is since on myspace in
this situation is going to say that the
space is open I'm going to go is space
open is equal to true and what you might
be wondering is why am i doing that well
this goes back to the while loop that I
created here a little bit ago see Wow
his space is open
see Wow that is open meaning true I'm
going to continue checking to see if
there's a monster in the space where I
want to move the new monster to so I
jumped over the method called on my
space and I said hey is there a monster
there currently and the answer came back
true that's why we are in this first
part here so that means I want to set is
space open to true so that the while
loop will re go through the whole
process of creating a new space to look
forward for my new monster row me out of
this for loop but not out of the while
loop and it's going to take me back to
the beginning of a while loop so that's
why I'm using break there else if there
is nothing there I can just come in here
real simply Ango is space open and set
this to false and understand that
whenever I leave this for loop that it's
automatically going to jump me out of
that guy so that's like totally cool
so now what do I got to do well I want
to set the value inside of my battle
board array to whatever the first
character is for my new monster in its
current position so I'm going to this Y
position this X position so I'm going to
get the current X&amp;amp;Y position and I'm
going to give it a value of this name
see har1
whatever the first letter is for my
monster and that's the end of move
monster I I think I did everything right
let's save it find out
and let's execute this guy and after I
execute this I see that I get an error
here that I can't convert an in to a
boolean which is this line 53 right here
get alive needs to be changed to a
boolean value so let's file save that
see if that fixes it my problems and
there it did it executed put the
monsters on the board got ourselves
another little goofy error on line 189
of my monster too I just have to close
off with another curly brace and after
fixing those couple errors you can see
that everything is working this is the
beginning game board and then this is
the new you can see here that the
letters did indeed move around or the
monsters did indeed move there's Frank
there's Drac Drac looks like he stayed
in the same place but Frank move and you
can see here earlier I said that I
wanted to print out the move distance as
well as the move direction 3 represents
West to represent South and they're both
the same and Frank was the very first
thing to move so we can check here did
Frank move to the West and did he move
one space well there's Frank there and
you can see that he did indeed move and
if we keep executing this over and over
and over again you can see that all
these different pieces continue to move
so hopefully I'll learn something from
that I know these tutorials are a little
bit crazy if you didn't quite get
anything leave a comment below and of
course the code is all underneath of the
video and it's heavily commented and the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
get a little bit more simplistic go
through arraylists till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
