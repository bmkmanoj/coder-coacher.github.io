2 of my CoffeeScript video tutorial in
just two video tutorials I'm going to
teach you all the basic syntax you need
to start writing CoffeeScript code right
now if you didn't watch part 1 you
should definitely watch that and I
provide a link here on the screen as
well as in the description because
otherwise you might be quite confused
and like always all the codes available
for free in the description under the
video so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it ok so here we are once again
over here we have sublime text over here
we have google chrome and over here we
have the terminal or command line if
you're using Windows and if I want to
shut that off and reload it I can come
in here and this code right here inside
of my terminal is going to automatically
compile all my CoffeeScript code for me
so I'm gonna run that and of course it's
gonna compile in a regular JavaScript
now the very first thing I want to talk
about our arrays now arrays inside of
CoffeeScript just like JavaScript can
contain multiple data types or just one
data type so we'll just create a random
array here and I can throw a string
inside of it I can throw a boolean
inside of it I could throw an int or
inside of it and I could throw a
floating-point number and that's gonna
be perfectly fine now I'm gonna be able
to come in here and let's say that I
want the second index inside of this
array string interpolation is going to
be used again and I'm going to say
random array and 2 and save that you can
see it compiled down here and reload and
you can see that index two one two three
four pops up of course this is 0 1 2 3
that's how everything is set up
I could also come in and use a range so
let's say that I wanted the second and
third indexes I could get those as well
so let's just change this to a last two
and reload it you can see that they
display there with a comma in between
both of them we're also going to be able
to define arrays that are made up of
ranges so let's say I wanted to go 1 to
10 how I would do that is just create a
range from 1 to 10 also I can do the
same thing I could create another array
that's backwards so I could say 2 to 1
is equal to and then put 10 dot dot 1
and that would create that for me I
could then come in and combine these
arrays so let's say combined array is
equal to and I could go one to ten
Khun Kats followed by ten to one and
that's going to combine those guys for
me I could then push ten to one onto the
end of one to ten and how I would do
that is I would go one to ten and then
push and then ten to one and then I'm
going to put one two three and what this
is called is a splat and you're going to
be able to use it to indicate that you
want to soak up a list of arguments or
all the values that are currently inside
of our array I'm gonna come through here
with a for loop and cycle through that
array so you can see what that looks
like so for X in one to ten obviously
it's not gonna be one to ten any more
you can see the whitespace was handled
there for me and I can output this and
then we'll just keep this very simple
and I'm just gonna throw X inside of
there like that and reload it and you
can see all of the changes we made to
our array so one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten and ten nine at the
dot and that all came about because I
pushed ten to one onto the end of one to
ten I'm also going to be able to come in
here and convert our array into a string
and how I would do that is again I'm
going to use string interpolation and
I'm gonna say a 1 to 10 and then I'm
gonna say two string and put my
parentheses on the end there and reload
and you can see that it went and
automatically converted that into a
string all on one line now let's get
into some cool stuff so let's say that I
want to filter out all the odds by
saving elements that return true for a
condition so let's say that I want evens
only how do we do that is I would say
one to ten and then I'm gonna say filter
and what I want to filter here is X and
the condition in which a number is going
to end up in the even only array is
going to be based off of X modulus two
whenever that's equal to zero that means
if out of this array if in any situation
one of those items comes back as equal
to zero whenever you take them
so two of it it's going to be stored
inside of that array and to see that
that indeed is true let's come over here
and I'll put this evens only and let's
just go and use two string again
and you can see only the even numbers
print out in that situation so it's very
easy to filter out and get certain types
of information with CoffeeScript which
is really cool we're also going to be
able to come in here and easily get the
maximum number inside of there so let's
just say max and you can use all of your
JavaScript functions that you're very
well aware of so we'll say math max one
to ten and then we'll use a splat again
which just means that I want all the
items inside of the array reload it and
you can see the maximum number comes out
as ten and of course if we're able to
get the maximum number we're also going
to be able to come in and get the
minimum number by just changing this to
men change that to min so it all makes
sense
reload and you can see one comes back so
now let's do something a little bit
cooler let's sum all of the items inside
of our array so to do that we'll just
say one to ten once again and we'll
reduce that down and what we're gonna do
is as we cycle through we're gonna get
the x and y and what we're gonna do from
that point is sum x and y as we cycle
through alright come down here type in
some and then sum of array reload and
you can see that that worked you could
do numerous different types of
mathematical operations in that
situation we could also come through and
reverse our array change that to reverse
and let's say that we just want to
reverse ten to one reverse reload and
you can say that we went and reversed it
and the reason why it looks like it's in
the proper order is this is ten to one
not one to ten so you can see how that
works out so why don't we come in here
and create an array of objects so we can
create a people array I'm gonna get more
into objects here in a second and of
course with CoffeeScript we're going to
be able to come in here and we don't
need to use commas if we don't want to
so we could say name and Paul and age
and 43 throat comma right there and then
we'll do the same thing with another one
of these guys will say name is Sue and
age is 39 now we're we're going to be a
come in here and access our items by the
key inside of the array so let's say I
want to get first name I could then come
in here and go people array and let's
say that I want the very first objects
inside of it and I want to get the key
for a name that matches up with that you
can see first name Paul pops up just as
we would expect and that is a basic
overview of how we're going to use
arrays inside of CoffeeScript I'm gonna
get it a little bit more into them as
this tutorial continues but now I want
to jump over and talk more about looping
I'm gonna keep one two ten here the
array so that we'll be able to play
around with that and I'm first going to
of course come in here and recover how
to cycle through an array so to do so we
just go one two ten like this and then
we're going to output that information
and let's just keep it simple
and just put X inside of here and you
can see that that indeed works we're
also gonna be able to use guard
statements if we wanted to maybe only
print out odd numbers and to do that we
just go for X in one to ten when and
we'll say X modulus two and you could
also use isn't instead of equals or not
equal to there's just so many there's
just a ton of different things built
into CoffeeScript that we're gonna be
able to use here and then we'll just
keep this simple and print out X and if
we reload that you can see it's cycled
through there and only print it out the
odd numbers so that's how guards work as
well as isn't we're also going to be
able to cycle through ranges of numbers
so let's say for X in and let's say that
we wanted to cycle through 50 to 100
when x modulus two is equal to zero you
can do that and then we'll throw X
inside of there and get rid of this so
it doesn't confuse anybody and you could
say that it went through and because we
used is instead of isn't it's going to
show all of our even numbers in that
situation we're also going to be able to
output information as we skip certain
informations and we'll use 2240 in this
situation and we'll say that we want to
skip every two items throw X inside of
there and reload it and you can see
there we print it out just the even
numbers there's a whole bunch of
different ways we can cycle through a
race now let's create
employees are right once again we do not
need to use commas if we don't want to
so we can say dog sue Paul and then
we're going to be able to print out the
indexes as well as the information
that's stored inside of it so let's say
we wanted to say something like employee
and employee index in the employees
array and we wanted to output some
information regards to that so we could
say that we wanted to get the index
number plus and we could get employee
index plus the employee plus and then we
could get the individual employee name
plus and have a break statement reload
it and you can see that we were able to
get the index as well as the individual
piece of information that was stored
inside of it just that way we're also
gonna be able to come in here and search
for values that are inside of our array
so we could say if dug-in employees and
then perform an operation based off of
that and I could just keep it simple and
just say I found Doug you can see I
found Doug shows up there and another
thing we can do is not only can we use
for loops we also have the option of
using a while loop even though they're
not used very often so let's say I want
to count from 100 110 with a while loop
this is how I would do it I could say
while and then here what I'm gonna do is
define the changing value of I as it
cycles through the array and then here
I'm going to say when I want to stop
cycling through the array so as long as
I is less than or equal to 110 we're
gonna continue outputting information on
the screen and I could just say is equal
to and then throw the value of I inside
of here reload it and you can see that
it went and cycled through that and
stopped whenever it got to 110 we could
also create another while loop that's
gonna cycle until zero is reached so
let's say we wanted to do something like
monkeys is equal to ten do the little
Nursery Rhyme thing we could say wow
monkeys - equal to one since we wanted
to stop whenever monkeys gets to the
value of zero we don't need to come in
here and put any conditions inside of it
like we did before and we could output
some information and there's a little
Nursery Rhyme where the monkeys jump on
the bed until they fall off and
supposedly die I guess I don't have
there we go
so we'll just go 9 little monkeys
jumping on the bed one fell off and
bumped his head 8 little monkeys jumping
on the bed one fell off and bumped his
head and we continued doing that until
there are no monkeys it's very sad story
but kids like it for some reason so
there's another example of how we can
use a while loop and also we could
pretty much fabricate a do-while loop
even though there's nothing inside of
here that allows us specifically to
create a do-while loop and how you would
do that is go X is equal to 0 and then
say loop and then outputs I'm some type
of information so let's come in here get
rid of that and then let's say that I
want to increment the value of X inside
of here and then thereafter break unless
X is not equal to 5 so it's going to
cycle through this as long as this
condition is not true and you can see it
printed out 1 2 3 4 5 so there's an idea
of how you could create a do-while loop
if you definitely felt like you needed
one there's an overview of looping
inside of CoffeeScript now we're gonna
take a look at functions ok so now let's
talk about something cool which are
functions inside of CoffeeScript one
role you need to know is that you're
gonna have to define your functions in
CoffeeScript before you use them so
you're either gonna have to put them at
the top of your file or you're going to
have to include them from a separate
file and to define your functions you're
going to have a function name first so
we'll go hello function like this
followed by an equal sign and then
you're going to have inside of that any
attribute your functions are going to
receive followed by an arrow sign like
this then you're gonna either put in a
return like this I'm going to show you
an alternative way you can do this and
then followed by whatever information
you want to output now we can come in
and call this function just with string
interpolation and hello function and
pass in my name for example and reload
it and you're gonna see that hello derek
pops up there now of course you're also
going to be able to use functions that
do not receive any attributes so you
could say something like get random
number equal to don't forget
your equal sign and arrow like this and
return math.floor say we want to
generate a random number here from one
hundred to one we're gonna be able to do
that and then we could come in and just
create random number and then call get
random num parentheses like this and
reload and you're gonna see it generated
a random number
another thing you didn't be able to do
that I didn't mention before is whatever
the last value is inside of your
function you're not gonna necessarily
have to use return to have it returned
as you can see right there hello Derrick
pops back up and that can become very
useful you're also gonna be able to
receive an undefined number of values so
let's say I wanted to sum no matter how
many numbers come in here some numbers
I'm gonna say VARs and I'm gonna throw a
splat in there which means everything or
soak up everything that is in the VARs
attribute and then I could say something
like sum is equal to 0 and then cycle
through this in bars and in sum plus
equals 2x and in this situation we will
have to return the sum but we will be
able to come in here and some this
number so we'll say sum and then pass in
as many things as we'd like so some
numbers 2 3 4 5 doesn't matter as many
as you want
reload it and it's gonna automatically
sum those no matter how many different
attributes you pass in now like I said
previously the last expression in a
function is gonna be returned by default
so let's say we had something like movie
rank equal to here's an attribute you
could also define a default value for an
attribute just like this and then we
could say if stars is less than or equal
to 2 then we want to return bad else we
want to return good it's going output
that information so you can say a movie
rank and then we'll call our movie rank
function and not pass anything into it
just to show you that the default value
of 1 is gonna work for us and movie rank
comes back as bad if instead we changed
it for movie rank is equal to good also
going to be able to use recursive
functions which are just functions that
call themselves so factorial for example
we can
go in here and calculate so you can go X
and then what we're going to number two
here is return zero if X is less than 0
return 1 if X is equal to 0 or X is
equal to 1 and otherwise we're gonna
return X times factorial see we are
calling the function from inside of
itself X minus 1 and then we can come
down here and get our results so let's
say we wanted the factorial of 4 I'll
explain exactly what's going on here in
a second and we can come in and go
factorial and pass in 4 as our default
value and reload it and you can see that
it comes back with 24 so what exactly is
happening here
well basically whenever we're very first
starts off we're gonna pass in a value
of 4 which is ultimately going to be
multiplied times factorial of 3
factorial 3 is then going to call the
factorial function again here we're
gonna get 3 and then we're gonna call
factorial 2 then we're going to pass the
2 down here x factorial 1 factorial 1 is
going to return the value of 1 and
that's what you can see right there then
you have the 2 right here this final
value of 2 is gonna go up the loop then
you're gonna have 3 which is gonna give
you a value of 6 which is then going to
transfer it up here which is going to be
multiplied towards the original 4 which
is gonna give us a final value of 24 so
that's how factorials work inside of
CoffeeScript so there is a basic rundown
of functions along with all the other
little things that I showed you
previously in the tutorial now we're
gonna take a look at objects alright so
let's start off with a basic object
we'll just call this Derrick and you can
also come in here I know I've defined
objects in different ways using not
using commas you can also come in and
use commas if they you would prefer that
save 41 and then I could say streets and
1 2 3 main straight like this so you saw
all the different ways to create basic
objects we're then going to be able to
come in here and get some information so
let's say we wanted the name for this
object we would be able to
and just go Derick dot name I'll put
that and you can see that it shows up
just like we would expect it to we could
also go in and add object properties
quite easily so we can just go so let's
say that we decide we want to put a
state inside of here we can do so and
there that is and then we could cycle
through our object we could say for X Y
of the Darracq object and output
information and then what we'll just
keep this simple we'll say X is y and
then keep our break statement here at
the end and name is Derek age is 41
Street is 1 2 3 Main Street and state is
Pennsylvania as you can see there is the
Pennsylvania port there's basic overview
of just rough objects now I'm gonna jump
over and show you how to define your own
using classes ok so let's say that we
want to create a class inside here in a
class is just a blueprint for creating
objects you're going to have your
attributes which are the things that
define your object and then you're gonna
have your capabilities or functions
which are going to define what your
object can do now to define your
properties which are the things that
describe your object you're just going
to just start listing them right in the
very beginning no semicolons no nothing
so we'll just have height and I'm gonna
give all these things default values so
those are all of my properties for my
animal class objects you can also define
a static property that's going to be
shared by all of your objects and that
means that the value changes for one
object it's gonna change for all of them
and let's say that we want to have
number of animals and we want to give it
a value of 0 now the reason why this is
static is because we have animal objects
we are creating number of animals is
just going to continue to increment each
time we create a new animal now would it
make sense for our animal objects since
they were modeling real-world objects to
be able to count no that is the reason
why they are static and you can see that
we specifically show that they are
static by putting in little app sign
there we can also have static methods
once again if it doesn't make sense for
our object that we are modeling to be
able to do something we will make it
static and we are going to find our
static methods by putting an out sign in
front of them this guy isn't going to
receive any attributes
and if we want to specifically call a
static value of the animal class we have
to start with animal and then num of
animals dried like this so this is gonna
return the value for num of animals
anytime this method is called we're also
gonna be able to define constructors
which are going to be called when an
object is created and it's used for
initialization purposes and to define a
constructor we're gonna need to say
constructor and then we're gonna need to
define some different attributes now you
can do this in a couple different ways
we could set a default value for example
if nothing was defined inside of here we
could also come in and type in well
let's just keep it like this here for a
second just so I can show you how cool
this is now under this situation we
would receive a name and we would assign
the name to our new animal object we
just created now we would use at like
most programming languages used this to
specifically target this object that we
are creating and we're going to assign
the name like that now you would think
well I'm gonna have to do the same thing
for height and weight and sound and all
these other different things know if
there's a shortcut if you come in here
and you would put at height is equal to
zero for example that is saying right
here that you want this to occur on its
own automatically there's a shortcut for
us and then we could also come in and do
the same thing for weight is equal to
zero given a default value and then
you're gonna put your little arrow
inside of there like that just like you
always have put that on a separate line
make a little bit more sense now let's
say since we created a new animal we
want to increment the value for a number
of animals to do that we're gonna have
to define the class name and then say a
number of animals and increment it so
that's how we would increment a static
value inside of a class going to be able
to create regular old class functions so
we could have make sound for example but
our arrow symbol inside of there and we
could just say says and then if we want
to get this specific objects sound we
put the @ symbol inside of there and
let's go and create another one let's
call this one get info throw an arrow
inside of there then we could do
something a little bit
more complex we want to get the specific
name for our object we do it that way is
and then we could get the weight for
object centimeters and ways and get the
animal objects weight and then if we
want to call a function we just go at
make sound like this all right so we
defined our classes on our static
attributes and our methods and all those
other different things now let's create
an object to do so you would just say
grover is equal to and new animal and
there you passed all that in we could
then come in and define specific values
for Grover so Grover name is obviously
equal to Grover Grover height is equal
to 60
Grover weight is equal to 35 and Grover
sound is equal to well let's put this
make this a string wolf we're then going
to be able to call the get info function
right there so that we can output all
the information that we know about
Grover and to do that we just go Grover
thought get info save it reload it and
we got a little bit of an error good
thing we got it though because I made a
mistake here white space very very
important inside of CoffeeScript we want
to make sure that everything is indented
properly there we are save it
reload it and now you can see Grover 35
centimeters weighs 35 kilograms and says
wolf and you can see that all of our
methods we have defined here are all
lined up properly so just reinforce the
fact that CoffeeScript is very dependent
upon whitespace and using it properly
now we're also going to be able to come
in and attach new object methods outside
of our class if we'd like to so to do so
you just go animal colon : so say
something like is it big to see if our
object is actually big or not and then
we can just say if at height is greater
than or equal to 45 we're going to
return the value of yes else we will
return the value for no and then we
could come in find out if Grover is
considered bigger or not
it's grover big and then call grover is
it big and you can see that yes Grover
is considered to be a big animal and
then also if you wanted to get the total
number of animals that have been created
which is going to call that static
function of ours a number of animals and
to do so once again we're gonna use the
class name because it is a class method
that we're going to be calling and then
get number of animals that reload it and
number of animals comes back as once
there's an overview of classes now let's
take a look at inheritance now we're
going to leave our animal class here
because we're going to be inheriting
from it and of course with inheritance
each class that extends another is going
to receive all of its properties as well
as all of its methods so to inherit
let's say we create a new object called
dog and it's going to inherit or extends
the animal class that's how that's done
we could then come in and define new
properties say this has a default value
of no sound we're going to come in and
create a constructor once again name is
equal to no name here we're going to not
use the @ symbol because I'm going to
show you something different again I'm
just like we used previously with our
constructor we're then going to be able
to call our superclass constructor and
to do that we just go super followed by
the information we want to pass into the
constructor let's put this in a proper
order so there's height and there's
weight and this coffeescript smart
enough to know that since the super is
inside of the constructor that it wants
it to pass this information up here and
process all that information up there
that's how you call the super part or
the super class if we would like to come
in and override a function we just
define a function with exactly the same
name and CoffeeScript some intelligent
enough to know that we want to call that
however we can call the super version of
make sound this guy up here quite easy
just by typing in super it's
automatically gonna work and then we
could say something like and and throw
our new sound inside of here that only
the dogs have and now we can come down
and find a new dog object
Sparky new dog and let's just pass in
Sparky as our name for our new dog
object and we could say Sparky sound is
equal to let's give him a very big wolf
and then we could find his second sound
as grrrrrr and now if we want to go and
call this to see the changes that have
been made
we can just say Sparky and call the
original get info and reload it you can
say there's no height or weight
information because we didn't pass that
in but it automatically win it and print
out the two different types of sound
that Sparky makes okay guys so there's
pretty much everything you need to know
basic syntax wise and regards to
CoffeeScript start writing programs in
it and before I left I just wanted to
send out a special thank you to the 18
people that are supporting me on patreon
I thank you very very much you guys are
the reason why I'm gonna be able to
continue making educational videos on
YouTube and if anybody's wondering why I
went on patreon I earned about three
dollars and 49 cents off of eight videos
so I knew that based off the changes
going on with YouTube if I wanted to
continue making these videos I'd need to
look for other funding sources and these
18 guys helped out a lot and I just once
again wanted to say thank you so just
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
