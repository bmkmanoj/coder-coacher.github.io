simply a process of asking questions
that are guaranteed to get the other
person to respond with a yes research is
actually shown if you get a person to
answer affirmative lead to topics that
relate to what you ultimately want them
to respond to seven to eight times you
are almost guaranteed to get them to
answer yes that they will do that which
you want them to do this is actually the
consistency principle at work again
remember people strive to remain
consistent with past decisions well how
would you use the yes set in a dating
situation for example well you see most
men get so obsessed with getting a kiss
they don't move slowly toward it you can
however slowly build physical
interactions to get to that ultimate
kiss or maybe more just slowly build
with slight physical interactions for
example when you meet your date shake
hands and touch the elbow briefly when
you agree with them lately touch the
forearm or shoulder when you are
crossing the straight reach out and hold
their hand when you agree with them
again lightly touch the leg and maybe
then when you admire an earring or
something else lightly touch the cheek
by building slow comfortable physical
interactions you'll be able to get more
powerful physical interactions in the
future so this is how you would apply
the set in dating as you guys probably
know I'm very interested in what other
videos you'd like to see I can do videos
on negotiation interactive does this
attraction how to improve sales or
numerous other topics in technology or
whatever you'd like so leave your
comments below and I will get on to
those videos time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
