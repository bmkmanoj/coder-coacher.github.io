definitive ways to tell if someone is
lying to you these techniques are all
based off of national psychology based
studies techno therapy techniques and
publicly available law enforcement
trained panels the golden objective here
is to show you how to detect deception
in both body language as well as verbal
analysis and I'll also go over a couple
stealth techniques to find out if
somebody's lying to you without them
knowing that you just found out this is
a great tip you want to find out how
somebody abused you or seized you
whenever you reach them to shake hands
with them if they shake your hand and
you straight up and down motion with
thumbs pointed up you know they consider
you an equal if they instead grab your
hand and force your palm to be facing
the ceiling or if they crush your hand
you know that they see you as an
inferior and likewise if you would do
this as somebody that would if they knew
this technique they would be able to
tell that you saw them as inferior what
do the hands tell you gestures towards
the face tell that person is lying
causing chemical reactions in the body
Bill Clinton famously touched his nose
eighty eight times during the Lewinsky
testimony that you gave hands clenched
as a sign of dishonesty hands on hips is
a sign of anger and often is a sign of
honesty picking imaginary lint also
dishonest or just as comfortable arms
crossed equals to stress may be
dishonest in what your eyes tell you
we're sort of hide hardwired to look in
certain directions depending upon if
we're remembering something that did
happen or if we remember more
constructing a story that they don't
happen if you are talking to a person
facing them like you would this young
lady that's in this picture here and you
see how she's looking to her or to your
right if you were talking to someone and
they make that gesture with their eyes
you know that more than likely they are
remembering something that did happen if
however she would looked at her left she
would be constructing a story so just
remember that right is more than likely
true left is one of the likely false
liars also maintain eye contact on
average about 70% so it will feel as if
whatever you're talking to them if
they're a good liar that they are
maintaining too much eye contact because
a normal amount of eye contact is
actually 50% and asking many people
already know people's boy great
increases dramatically during the line
and displays are often looked upon as
honest unless they are excessive that
never looked upon is dishonest if
someone would place a purse or what we
call an imaginary coffee wall in front
of them that means they are feeling
distress an imaginary coffee wall is you
could basically think of it this way if
a person's right-handed and they place
their drink or coffee to their left
meaning they have to continually move
their arm in front of themselves that's
what we call an imaginary coffee wall
rubbing up the neck again chemical
reactions I'm so honesty fake yawning
overthinking each question trouble
swallowing and acting mechanical all
signs of dishonesty here is a gesture
that actually shows interest in honesty
now we all know that we can fake certain
things about saying that that's what
Hillary Clinton is doing this photograph
but this is the most natural sign of
interest and honesty that she's
demonstrating here jiggling off the feet
is a sign of distress leaning forward as
sign of honesty flushing in the face
dishonesty
if yes and no head shakes don't jive
with what a person saying so if they're
saying yes with the mouth and no with
their head you should follow and believe
the physical gestures and not the verbal
verbal analysis we're going to review
here why I started for somebody to live
review seven herbal clues deception give
some real-world examples why Liars win
you almost never catch a person lie they
will tell you what they saw or what they
did but nothing incriminating I wouldn't
do that
as an example is not the same as I
didn't do that
what you need to do when you want to
detect verbal line is just listen
believe what they're saying and then
analyze it it's hard to lie to a direct
question as you can see here with
Timothy McVeigh in an interview Newsweek
reporter asked him this is the question
everybody wants to know that you do it
his answer the only way we can really
answer that is that we are going to
plead not guilty did not answer the
question then they say but you've got a
chance right now to say hell no he
answered again we can't do that people
in general unless they're extremely good
Liars have a very hard time lying to a
direct question if they are a good liar
you there's a way to spot that they're
lying to you if you ask them a question
a direct question they will sort of
unfocus their eyes and seem to not be
looking at you directly or they'll start
acting mechanically and the reason why
is they are actually remembering a
script answer to your direct question so
look for that unfocused of the guys and
mechanical acts you can see here was
with a Smith that very often Liars will
change their pronouns when she was
describing to police officers the trip
you know that finally ended with her car
submerging with her children inside of
it
whenever she was referring to the trip
itself she continually referred to my
car showing ownership
however the things that she wanted to
distance herself such as leaving the
vehicle and then letting the car
submerge during that period of time she
referred to her car continually as the
car every person changes pronouns to
distancing themselves from any part of
the story you know more than likely that
there's miss truth to be found there
another thing you can do is examine verb
tenses if an interviewer asks have you
ever used illegal drugs and the
interviewee responds I don't use illegal
drugs you can see there that they did
not answer the question the question was
ever and the person asked or answered
the question in the present tense
meaning that they do not currently use
drugs
internal dictionaries we all have them
and what you often see a liar do is if
they're asked a question that is a
direct question that they want to lie
about what they will do is they'll take
pieces of the language of the
interviewee or the questioner and put
them into that response this is very not
it's unnatural in any way and you can
see an example of it here when Jim
Lehrer interviewed Bill Clinton and he
asked you had no sexual relationship
with this young woman he responded there
is no sexual relationship that is
accurate what did he do here he didn't
answer the question first off he changed
the verb tense he borrowed from Larry's
internal dictionary in regards to the
term sexual relationship the order of a
list is also important parents naturally
when asks a name off their children will
name them in the order of birth if they
don't there's a reason why when oj said
that his him and his wife had their
downs and ups believe me there was a
reason why answering a question with the
questions another sign if you would ask
did you take the cookies and they
respond do I take the cookies no or
could you repeat that order what did you
say you can be well prepared for a life
comes soon after also the use of
unnecessary words in general are very
good signs that a lie or miss truth has
been spoken I've specifically really
liked the term really you can often spot
the end politicians who are very gifted
Liars the use of really during their
answering phases and so forth the rings
public hall meetings and so forth and so
on so if somebody uses one of these
terms or any term like that chances are
they are hiding some level of the truth
you let's say you think somebody is
lying to you in regards to spreading
rumors you would just simply say to them
it's come to my attention that someone
who's spreading rumors can you learn me
if you hear anything you did not say the
person was spreading rumors you just
simply pointed out a fact if they become
defensive or change the subject
chances are they are the one spreading
rumors
if however they are not they will more
than likely agree to help you if you
want to find out if somebody was where
they said they were this is kind of
common sense but ask them if they hit a
lot of traffic because the water line
breaker of the bad accident if they
answer the question in the affirmative
you go you know again that somebody is
blind and finally this is a great way if
you want to pause this video these are
some great questions to ask somebody to
find out if they're more than likely to
take advantage of their spouse or they
would be involved in thievery in the
workplace or what have you and that's
the basic presentation on how to find
out somebody's lying thank you very much
for your time hope you have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
