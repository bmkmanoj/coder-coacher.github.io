changed a couple things in the Android
development tools that sort of break my
tutorial so I wanted to very quickly
show you how to fix every single program
I create in this tutorial it's actually
very very easy and I'm going to show you
step by step right now okay so here we
are in the Android development tools and
this is the same this is Eclipse
everything here is exactly the same and
these are the steps you're going to have
to take it's no big deal but I didn't
want to get involved in something called
fragments right at the very beginning of
this tutorial so I decided to do a very
quick easy fix now let's say you're
inside of Eclipse and you want to create
a new Android application project you
just click on that
and then this is going to open up and
I'm going to do a basic hello world here
so I'm just going to call this let's
call this hello new world everything
else is exactly the same and we're going
to click on next and then we're going to
click on next again and then we're going
to click on next again make sure blank
activity is clicked on right there hit
next again and here is something that
previously was not in the Android
development tools or Eclipse or anything
it's called fragment main this is
causing some havoc so all we need to do
is get rid of it and I'm going to show
you how to do that here get hit finish
okay and mainactivity.java and fragment
main dot xml open up on your screen
another thing you want to do is go into
the layout folder right here and also
open up activity main.xml then what
you're going to do is you're just going
to click on fragment main.xml this guy
right here and you're going to select
all and copy that
then jump over into activity main.xml
select all and paste you're going to
save activity main right like that
you're going to close fragment main dot
xml right like that come down here to
the layout you're going to click on
fragment main XML and you are going to
delete it this is going to cause some
errors no big deal it's going to say are
you sure you want to delete this say yes
I'm going to create a new Android
tutorial as soon as possible that it's
going to cover exactly what's going on
here but I didn't want to break my
current tutorial because it's a good
tutor or at least I think so then you're
going to want to go
into source mainactivity.java I'm just
showing you where that is it's already
open actually mainactivity.java I'm
gonna click on that you're going to see
a couple errors here basically to fix
all of these errors all you're going to
need to do is come in here and select
this this is inside of on create and
delete it and then you're going to want
to come down further down in your code
you could also comment all this out and
just to do that I'll do it let's just
cut that right there and let's paste
this right there see there I commented
it out with a star and a forward slash
you're going to go file save and you're
going to see that the error goes away
now you have a couple warnings here and
to get rid of those all you're going to
need to do is forward star comment out
these imports right here if you want to
and there you go and if you file save
that you're going to see that all the
warning messages go away and like I said
this is the basic hello world thing I'm
going to come up here now and I'm going
to execute this just to prove that it
works I'm going to go new configuration
on this or I could come down here and go
to run configurations I'm going over a
lot of basic stuff here just because I'm
going to put this at the very beginning
of my android tutorial make sure new
configuration is selected make sure that
hello new world is selected here if it
isn't come over here and click on browse
and find hello new world and click on
that then you're going to click on this
guy right here select it and then we're
going to click on target and the
emulator I'm using is the same emulator
that I talked about in part 26 of this
tutorial but if you're at the very
beginning of this tutorial feel free to
use that and I'm going to hit run and
here we can see our emulator opened up
on our screen we're just going to click
on this guy drag it down and you can see
right there hello new world shows up
hello world and everything is fixed so
that's how to fix the fragment issue in
all across my entire tutorial please
feel free to leave any questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
