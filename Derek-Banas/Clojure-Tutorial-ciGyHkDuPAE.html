closure video tutorial in this one
tutorial I'm going to cover the course
syntax of the entire language in the
description underneath the video you'll
find timestamps to all the individual
parts so you don't have to watch
everything all at once or you could just
use this to look for specific things
you're interested in also in the
description underneath the video I have
a link in which I show how to install
and both Emacs as well as how to set up
the whole entire closure system I have
right here of course you don't need to
use Emacs with closure everything I
cover here is gonna work with any editor
but I just thought I'd use that because
it's used everywhere else and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it
alright so here is Emacs and what i'm
gonna do is i'm gonna start off by
creating a project and I'm gonna use
line and Jen to create said project and
how you do that this is just in a
regular terminal and this would work the
same on a command line if you install
everything that I you know have setup
here on Windows or Linux of course or
anything else so what we're gonna do is
I'm gonna get line new app and what do I
want to call this let's just call it
tutorial that's quite simple and all
that's going to load up and there we go
and I can then come in and change
directory to tutorial and then we can
see all the different things we have
here and I'm going to change my
directory to the source directory and
then to tutorial and there we are and
there is the cour closure file that we
are going to be putting all of our code
into and how we go and open that in
Emacs anyway is down here you're gonna
see I'm gonna go ctrl + X + ctrl + F and
I'm going to type in court dot C LJ
hopefully you can see that if he
couldn't view it fuel screen and you can
see here I'm gonna go control X + ctrl +
+ + and crease the size of my code here
on the left side then I need to decide
what I'm going to do I'm gonna go see X
+ o to jump over to the terminal side
and I'm gonna be running all the codes
some code on the left some code on the
right and so forth and so on now to get
the code here to start executing
I'm gonna go MX and then I'm going to
type insider
Jack - in and you can see that
everything came up here on the bottom of
the screen CX and C++ and I can go see X
and o jump over here and go see X and 0
to close that so I don't I just have the
code on the top and then run everything
in the bottom so we can just go and
increase out a little bit more and there
you go you'll be able to see all that
alright so up here at the very top I
declare a namespace and just like all
namespaces it's just going to provide a
unique name for my functions and on the
next line we have our basically our
closure files are gonna run on the Java
Virtual Machine so we're going to need
to define a class so we do that and
executions gonna start in the main file
that we have right here and I could jump
down to the bottom of the screen well
I'm actually there already so I can just
do this and to run main I can just go
and put parentheses and a dash and main
and parenthesis and you can see that
HelloWorld execute down there so first
thing I want to talk about is variables
so variables are gonna be immutable
inside of closure which means the value
cannot be changed once it's set of
course are situations in which you can
change but I'll get into that as a
tutorial continues and they're going to
be defined by going d EF and then you're
gonna have the name that's gonna start
either with a letter or an underscore
and then you're also going to be allowed
to have numbers and so forth and to
create one you could just go random
variable and 10 and there you go and
what that actually creates is what is
called a long and a long is going to be
a very large number it's gonna be in
between those two areas right there and
basically the way that datatypes work in
closure is that types are going to be
assigned based on the value that you
assign to it so if you go and just
define any type of whole number you're
going to get along and if you would
instead come in and define let's say a
double
and like that that's going to be a
double and if you want to see the range
for doubles they're going to fall within
that category so very very very large
numbers as you can see another data type
that you're going to have are going to
be bully ins and boolean czar either
going to have true or false as a value
and you're going to be able to get the
data type by just going type and let's
say we have false inside of there and if
you want to execute directly inside of
your code you just go see X and see e
you can see right there came back as a
boolean some other neat things that you
can do well basically down inside of
main if you're wondering if this is this
is just describing what the function
does and this right here is going to be
the arguments received by the function
this is going to create a function
that's command for creating function and
all commands inside of closure are going
to be surrounded with parentheses this
is the function name of course
and this is going to be how we are going
to print out our code all right so let's
go and just get rid of hello world
directly out of there now let's go and
write some code inside of this all right
so let's go define and we can say a long
and 15 I can then come inside of here
and go nil nil is what is used to check
for no value so I can go nil question
mark and a long write like that and I
can jump down into the bottom and we can
run this guy whoops forgot to do
something's C X and the letter O jump
back up inside and what I can do to
recompile this is to just go CC and seek
a that's gonna compile the code and then
I can jump back down inside of this guy
and hit the medic key and P and execute
it and you can see that it comes back as
false because there is a value assigned
I'm gonna stop doing as much of the eMac
stuff here but I just wanted to cover it
in the beginning just because you might
be confused all right so let's jump back
up inside of here
some other different commands that we
have I can check if a value is positive
or not and what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna come up inside of here and check
that and how you check for positive
values is you just go pause and whatever
and I'm gonna say 15 and you can see
that that comes back as true I can also
check if something is negative by just
going negative and question mark and you
can see that that comes back is false I
could check t if something is even see
once again that comes back is false I
can also come in and check if something
is odd and that comes back is true we
could check if something is a number
with number and the question mark we can
check if something is an integer with
and you see that comes back is true we
can also check if it's a float of course
and of course it's probably better if
you have a cheat sheet in front of you
that I providing a description of course
it's free and there's float you can see
everything's pretty simple and it's self
explanatory and I'll get into more
advanced stuff here as we continue on
and there you can see that that's also
not 0 all right so there's just a
rundown of using variables and different
data types and now I'd like to talk
about how we can format our output okay
so I am going to be able to use format
I'm going to be able to use print print
line and string concatenated so many
different commands that are available I
just want to cover a couple things here
so this is format so let's say I want to
put a string directly inside of a string
I can do something like this is a string
and a % and s close that off and then
we'll put a string like that of course
I'm going to have to create a string and
that's easy enough to do let's go define
a string and let's just give it the
value of hello because that works and
I'm gonna do a couple of these different
guys we can also come in and use the
format again to add spaces so I can do
something like 5 spaces and then I'm
gonna go and put the % again and 5 and D
and let's say I want to do that with a
long we can do that and we can come in
and we can define our long so long and
let's just give it a value 15 because
that works pretty good we can also come
in and do format and we could do let's
say we want to have leading zeros do
that I'm going to execute this in a
second of course and how we do that is %
and then a 0 &amp;amp; 4 and
and basically any space that's not taken
up by the number that we pass in is
gonna give us leading zeros we can also
do left justified so let's go format and
then we're going to put a % and negative
4 and D and left justified just so you
can see what that is and let's use our
long once again and we can also do
similar things with our doubles let's
bounce back up inside of this guy and
I'm going to say a double and one point
two three four should've left those in
there before huh and jump back down here
and then I'm going to say three decimals
and to do that you go percent and you
can do the leading zeros and all the
other stuff if you'd like and an F
whenever you're working with doubles
which stands for float and there we are
and we can go and compile this once
again control C control K that is going
to compile that guy it's gonna ask me if
I want to save the file I'm gonna say
yes and now I can go through here and
execute all these just by going to the
end of the line and ctrl X and ctrl e
and there you can see and we went and
put that string inside of there you can
see there we have our spaces see there
we have leading zeroes right there left
justified and then finally you can see
how it is putting in only three decimal
places for a double I guess our double
only had three spaces but either way it
would work if you had five all right so
there is a whole bunch of ways of
formatting output and now what I'd like
to do is show you how we can do a whole
ton of things with strings all right so
let's define a string them and I just
call this STR one and I'm gonna say this
is my second string so we defined that
and now we can do a whole bunch of
manipulations with it I can check if it
is blank or not by just put going string
and then we're going to go blank and
question mark STR one however if I do
that it is not going to have that
available for me so what I need to do is
I need to go up
inside of here right after I have the
name spaceport and I'm gonna say require
and closure string and they're gonna go
ass and I'm gonna say that it needs to
be a string okay all right it's going to
have the shortened name of string I
could put the whole closure string thing
in there but that's too long and you
know don't want to do that so here we go
we got that inside of it now we can test
some more things I could come in and
check if my string contains or includes
and pass in the string you want to check
and the word you're looking for so I'm
specifically looking for my in this
situation you can see that this comes
back as false and then likewise you're
gonna be able to see that this is going
to come back as true because my is in
there remember you might have to cut you
might have to compile if you're using
Emacs with ctrl C and then ctrl K
alright and let's try some more you can
also come in and we can check for an
index or get the index of a match so we
could go index of and then the string
that we're gonna be searching for and
then the specific thing that we're gonna
be looking for which is my we're going
to be able to split a string into a
vector once again gonna use the STR
command and this time we're gonna use
split and STR one and then what I'm
gonna use to split I'm gonna use the
hash symbol and I'm gonna say spaces is
what I want to use for the split you
could use a regular expression or
something else like that if you'd like
you could also go and split based off of
Lior let me give you an example of how
we could use that so string 1 and then
we can do a hash symbol and say we want
to split based off of the location of a
number we could do so we'll also be able
to come in here and join a collection
which I'm going to do more about here
later
just right now fear you can just think
of a collection as like an array if you
don't know what a collection yeah
collections is a general grouping of
data so let's say I have a collection it
has the and big
cheese inside of it that join will join
those and put a space between each one
of them I can also do a replace so let's
do a regular expression replace so
replace and I can have I am 42 and then
I can do a hash symbol of course I could
put string 1 in there or whatever if I
would want and then I'm going to do
regular I want to replace 42 with 43 and
that's perfectly legal as well I'm also
going to be able to remove white space
at the beginning and the end with string
and trim new line and likewise I'll also
be able to trim any white space on the
left like that and in any white space on
the right like that we're also going to
be able to make a string all uppercase
if you would like to do that sometimes
we do that whenever we're checking for
specific things we could do that and
let's jump back to the beginning of that
and put that parenthesis inside of there
and you know if you're gonna be able to
do that you're also going to be able to
do lowercase lowercase I normally find
is a little bit more useful so let's go
lower and dash and case and string 1
once again and I think that's a good
rundown of a whole bunch of different
things so I'm gonna go and compile this
with ctrl C and ctrl K and I'm gonna
jump bound them to the bottom with CX
and oh oh it's once to make sure I want
to save it yes CX and o and then down
inside of this guy I am going to bring
main up we can execute it got a bug
what's a bug and it's saying that I got
an error with the split oh I see what I
did I forgot to do let's jump back over
inside of here and let's change this
string 1 and that error will go away so
let's go and compile that once again and
jump back down to the bottom after we
save it and we can execute that and this
is my string pops up then I can jump
back over to the top again and jump
through all these different guys and
execute all of them up here and you can
see that that comes back as a string
that's what's being returned and then I
can jump down here and see if that is a
blank string comes back as false of
course and we can come in and execute
this does
include the word My yes it does we can
come in there and get the index for my
we could also come in and we can split
and put a where the spaces are located
inside of our string and you're gonna
see there's that collection we can also
split at the number and you can see
there that is likewise we're gonna be
able to join a collection into a string
and there's that answer we can replace
our values using regular expressions
we're gonna be able to change to
uppercase and we're gonna be able to
change to lowercase all right so there
is a rundown of the core functions
you're gonna use to work with strings
and now I'd like to talk about our first
collection which is Liss okay so
everything i'm doing here of course is
still inside of main now basically a
list is just going to store a list of
values and it can store multiple
different data types
so let's come in and we'll go print line
and to create a list you just start it
with list and then you can throw
whatever you'd like inside of there I'm
just gonna show you that you can do
anything you'd like and we could throw a
boolean inside of there as well and
there we go and if I execute that down
on the bottom you're going to see all of
the list items that I have inside of
there we could also come in here and you
can also see I'm using print line that
is going to go and get whatever I give
to it and then put a new line at the end
of it I can also use first which is
actually very useful as you're gonna see
later and I can do something like list
and two and three and I executed that
and you can see that one comes back down
at the bottom of the screen I can also
come in here and get everything except
that and you can see down the bottom two
and three come back I can also get a
specifically defined index and how you
do that is by going in and right inside
of here let's say I want to go and get
index one I can do so and you see the
deck comes back as two and also be able
to come in here and add values to my
list and how I specifically do that is
go list and star and then let's say I
have one and two and then I want to add
in three as well as four of course I can
do that oops a little bit of an error
probably because I had too many
parentheses inside of there
yes that was what it was actually I need
to get rid of that parenthesis right
there
and there that should be fun and you can
see at the bottom I got one two three
and four and then I would also be able
to add one value to the left of a list
by going cons and let's say I want to
throw three inside of there just do that
put that there and then throw one more
of parentheses at the end and you see at
the bottom I have three one two all
right so there's a whole bunch of
different ways of working with lists and
now what I want to talk about our sets
okay so sets are going to be lists of
unique values and how you create one of
those as you go set and then what I'm
gonna do after that is I'm going to put
a single quote inside of there and let's
go and throw a 1 and 1 &amp;amp; 2 inside of
there and if I execute that you can see
that it only shows the one value so like
I said it's going to be unique values
I'm going to be able to get specific
indexes inside of a set just by using
get and let's say that this is 3 &amp;amp; 2
then what I'm gonna do outside of here
is let's say I want to get the second
index I can put that right there
and if I execute it you can see that the
two shows up here at the bottom of the
screen I'm gonna be able to do conjoin
if I want to append value as you can see
right there we have 3 &amp;amp; 2 but that you
can also say let's go and do 1 instead
so that it shows up a little bit better
so there's that and now you can see 1 3
&amp;amp; 2 ok makes sense we're also going to
be able to check if a set contains a
specific value by going contains and
let's say I want to check for two and
you can see that that comes back it's
true and I'm also gonna be able to come
in here and do disjoin and let's say I
want to remove the two from inside of
our set so I can do so and you can see
that we are left with only 3 once again
a rundown of the core functions you're
going to be using whenever you deal with
sets and now I want to talk about
vectors all right so let's go and to
create a vector you go vector
and I'm gonna say 1 and dog is what I'm
gonna throw inside of my vector now to
create a vector all you would do is you
would go vector and then whatever data
you want to put inside of it more
specifically if I would like to get a
specific index from a vector I would
just go get and let's go and get the
first value out of there and you can see
the two comes up here at the very bottom
of the screen
I'm also going to be able to use conjoin
once again if I would like to append an
element to a vector and let's say that I
want that to be 1 that's perfectly fine
and you can see it's 3 to 1 shows up
there if I'd like to remove the first
item outside of a vector I can do that
and you can see I'm left with just the 3
inside of my vector at the bottom of the
screen and let's go and add a couple
more values inside of here 1 2 3 and 4
and let's say that I would like to
return a vector from one point to
another I could do so so let's say I
want to go from 1 to 3 I would then have
to change this to sub back sub back and
we can execute that and you can see I'm
left with just or you can see that I
retrieved 2 &amp;amp; 3 out of our vector
alright so quick rundown of the core
things you're gonna need to know to use
vectors and now I want to talk about
maps now a map is just a collection of
key-value pairs and to create a map
we're just gonna go hash and map and we
can just define our key which is going
to be named and then we can put in our
actual value and then you just keep on
going next one it just knows that the
next one's gonna be your key and then
you can just put whatever you'd like
inside of there and if you go and
execute that you can see that they show
up down there at the bottom of the
screen you can also create what are
called sorted maps so let's go and
create a couple different things inside
of here I'm gonna have my key be 3 and
put 42 inside of there and then I'll
have to
and Vanis and 1 and Zurich and you can
see when I execute that it's gonna put
all in order based off of whatever the
numerical index is we're also going to
be able to get a value based off of a
mapped key by going hashmat or creating
a hash map and using get and then I'll
define what my key is just to keep this
simple I'm just gonna use 1 and then
here at the very end I'm gonna put what
I'm specifically searching for and you
can see that it brought back Derrick
just like that let's go throw a couple
more in here and another thing I'm gonna
be able to do is get a value for a key
and to do that I'm gonna use find and
might as well use name again and you can
see it came back and gave me the key as
well as the proper value that I was
specifically looking for let's say I
want to also check if a map contains a
specific key for doing this in other
places we use contains and of course it
makes sense to use contains once again
and we execute that you can see it comes
back is true let's go and get rid of
this guy specifically and then let's say
that we wanted to come in and get a list
of keys well we could just type in keys
and it's gonna give us that and there is
age and name what I'm gonna jump down
here make this slightly bigger yeah it
looks a little bit better and as you may
have guessed if you want to get all the
values in the map you just type in
vowels inside of there and once again
execute and you can see that only the
values came back and also you're going
to be able to finally merge Maps let's
go and have these be separated so it's
with this like that and then let's
create another hash map just so you can
see that they are indeed merged and then
we will just call this merge with and
then put a plus sign inside of there
think I have everything set up right
let's just make sure yep everything's
fun and execute it and you can see that
they have been merged alright so there
is a whole bunch of things you can do
with maps and now I want to talk about
atoms and to cover atoms I'm gonna go
into a vertical format so you can see a
little bit better basically I'm gonna
create a function here it's going to
demonstrate all the different things you
do with atoms basically with atoms you
are going to
should we be able to change a variables
value so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
define a function this is how we I'm
gonna do get more specifically into
functions here in a bit but this is the
function how we define it it's called
Adam e^x for Adam example it's going to
receive a one attribute pass to it and
if you want to define an atom's value
you do define just like before and I'm
going to call this Adam e^x and then I'm
going to call it go and create Adam and
X using X as our value that we're going
to assign to our Adam now Watchers can
be attached to Adams as well as agents
what you're gonna see here in a minute
and they can then be used to run
functions whenever a value changes and
to create a watcher you just go add and
watch and then you're going to say Adam
II X and for specifically what I want to
watch and watch her and then we can
define our function and then you'll say
key and Adam Old State and you're gonna
be able to get the old version or the
old value stored inside of our Adam as
well as the new value stored inside of
our Adam and then we can print those out
to the screen just to see how they have
been changed so we can go Adam e^x
changed from and then old state and then
to new state and then close off that
watcher now what we'll do is we'll go
print line and we'll go first X which is
going to be the first value for our Adam
and we can get that by putting the @
sign followed by Adam e^x
we can then change the value and how you
change the value for our Adam is you go
reset exclamation point and the Adam you
want to change and the value you want it
set to and then once again I can go
print line and second X which is gonna
be the new version for our Adam once
again at Adam e^x you get that value and
you could also go and change the value
using function and to do that you go to
swap exclamation point Adam E X and
let's say I want to increment the value
that is inside of there I can do so
you can put any function in there not
just increment and then I'll say
increment X and once again get the value
of our atom with the @ sign e X and then
finally let's close off our function all
together and there that did that okay so
now what I can do is I can come down
here into our main function and we can
call that and how we call it as we go
whoops
parentheses atom e^x and let's pass five
inside of there and then we can compile
that with control C and control K and
save it and I had a bug there it's ad -
watch okay control C control K save it
and and that time I spelled atom wrong
Internet you should tell me that okay
control C control X and save it and I
got rid of all of our bugs and now we
can jump over here and execute it by
just calling main and you can see all of
the different changes that we have so
the first value of x was 5 which as we
set it you saw that before so there it
is we started off by passing the value
of 5 into here and the value is set you
can see here Adam e^x change from 5 to
10 and you can see right there that we
printed the change and then we can see
once again Adam he exchanged from 10 to
11 you can see the watcher is called
before the actual change takes place and
then you can see incremented it to 11
all right so it is possible to change
values using Adams if you should so want
to do that and since I'm talking about
that I'm gonna talk about another way to
change values and that is through the
use of what are called agents now an
agents gonna allow us to change values
using functions I'm gonna define another
function here and I'm gonna call it
agent e^x
and this isn't gonna get past anything
so I'm just gonna leave that empty if
you want to create an agent you let's
say we wanted to check the number of
tickets that we're selling for a show or
something I'll call this ticket ticket
sold and I'm gonna give it a starting
value of zero because we didn't sell any
tickets yet we're then gonna be able to
add a value to an agent so it starts off
at zero and we'll go ticket sold and we
will say that we want to change the
value to 15 well
that goes then we can print out or
changed or our new value for tickets and
I'm going to show you here something
that's a little bit of a glitch and then
I'll also show you how to fix it so I'm
gonna put that there if you want to get
the ticket sold again you're going to
use the @ symbol and ticket sold and
let's just close that off so that I can
show you a little bug and then also show
you how to fix it let's jump down into
Maine and let's call agent e^x and don't
forget to compile it and only have one
parenthesis of course and don't forget
to compile it and save it well a little
bit of a bog you need to save that
alright put that space inside of there
alright save it got rid of all our bugs
and we can come in and execute Maine and
you're gonna see that tickets actually
shows as zero so that's a bad thing
one way with it we could get rid of that
is we could go and call print line ahead
of time so just throw a brand new print
line inside of there and we can execute
it now you see the tickets 15 shows up
but another way that we can do is we can
call for us to wait for a value to
update and how you do that is with a
function called a wait 4 so here what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go sins and
tickets sold once again plus 10 and then
I'm gonna call a wait for so I'll say a
wait for 100 for tickets sold and it's
gonna give it a chance to update and now
whenever I call print line it is going
to be perfectly fun so I can go tickets
and at and tickets sold and another
thing that you need to do is shut down
your agents whenever you're done and so
I'm gonna go shutdown and agents and
then we're going to compile this guy I
can't save it don't have any errors cool
and to demonstrate this I'm actually
going to show you how to use the line in
Jen repo so opened up a new shell and
I'm gonna tell you been line and repo
and there we go have that all set up and
now I can come in here and use main and
you can see if I execute that with main
that we have tickets for 15 and then
tickets are changed to 25 so there is a
rundown of a lot of the things you can
do with agents and now
to talk about our math functions okay as
per math functions there are many of
them of course and you're going to do
this a little bit different enclosure
than you might be used to in other
languages so let's say we wanted to add
a couple numbers we would first put in
the operator we wanted to use and then
followed with the things we wanted to
add and likewise it's gonna be like that
for everything else and so if you want
to just just continuously subtract
values that's how you would do that and
also we could do multiplication of
course in the same way let's multiply
two times five that's how that would be
done and division as well and if you'd
like to get the remainder of a division
you would use modulus just like you can
see right there
alright and just to save time there are
numerous other different functions
available for you and there you can see
them all you could pause your screen or
just get the cheat sheet or whatever if
you want to increment you just use i NC
decrement Dec this is the absolute value
you're gonna have to put math in front
of it there though to have it work and
the cube root square root if you want to
round up browndown e to the power of one
the hypotenuse so that is the natural
logarithm the base 10 logarithm if you
give it a whole bunch of numbers it'll
give you the max value the minimum value
and you can also calculate power and
also so I don't forget you're also going
to be able to generate random values so
we can go print line and how you do that
is you would go random int and it's
gonna go up to but not include the 20 in
this situation and you're also gonna
have cosine and sine and tangent arc
cosine arc sine arc tangent and so forth
um so on another thing that's useful is
you can perform a operation on a
collection so I could do something like
one two and three and I'll I'll
calculate all this out for you so you
can see exactly what that does and
likewise you'll be able to do the
negative for that also
and also there's built-in values so you
also have things like math pie to get
the value of pie
if you'd like to use that as well and we
could save that and jump over to the
other screen and here we're using line
and Jen and if you want to go and reload
that this is the command you used it's
just gonna be used and whatever your
file is followed with reload and then if
you run main you're gonna see all of the
calculations for everything we have
there alright so and there's a random
value and there's pie and so forth and
so on so that's a quick rundown of a lot
of the math functions available to us
and now I'm going to focus in on all the
things we can do with functions so as I
have covered already you're going to
define your function by typing in d EF
followed with an N and I'm a create one
called say hello and right here is where
you'd have attributes if you have any
and in this situation well actually you
can provide a description for you know
your function inside of here so you
could say something like receives a name
with one parameter and responds okay so
there's a description then you're gonna
have your attribute and in this
situation it's gonna be named as what's
gonna be passed inside of there and then
you can output something onto the screen
so you could say something like hello
again and then follow that up with name
and close that off of course it's gonna
create a couple more let's say you want
to receive more than one value let's go
and call this get some and it's gonna
get x and y and the output from the last
operation inside of your function is
what's gonna be returned by default so
you can see right there it's just going
to return whatever that sum is you're
also gonna be able to receive an unknown
number of parameters or attributes
whatever you want to call them so let's
go call this get some more and I'm gonna
define first off what I'm gonna do if I
receive three parameters inside of here
I'm gonna get the sum of them of course
so that's just gonna be x y and z and
then do you notice there's parentheses
surrounding that whole entire thing and
then I'm also going to have a situation
on which I receive two
attributes passed inside of here and I'm
gonna sum those as well and that closes
off that function let's go and create
another one you can also receive a
variable number of parameters in a list
so here we can go define and I'll call
this hello you and I will put name
inside of there and here I will use the
string function to concatenate all of
the values here you can see what that
looks like here in a moment I'm gonna
put a space inside of there so that that
works and then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna call well make sure I close off
this function first there we are
and now I'm gonna call hello you over
and over and over again with a function
called hello all so define and hello all
and in this situation we're gonna
receive multiple different we're gonna
receive a list so this is gonna be names
and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to pass those values to hello you and
how I can do that is by typing in map
below you and names and then close that
off alright so I got a whole bunch of
these different functions inside of here
and now we can run them all so I'm gonna
go down inside of main and I'm gonna go
say hello and then I'll pass in Derrick
and then I will call the next one which
is gonna be get some and to that I'm
gonna pass in four and five and then get
some more and one two and three and then
we can do whoops make sure you put
parentheses around both of them there
like that and then we can also come in
and I can pass in multiple of different
values for hello all so you can see what
that looks like when we pass in a list
so I can just say Doug and Mary and Paul
okay and everything else there looks
pretty good so I'm gonna save that and
jump over into the other pot side of the
screen
I'm going to reload all that and then we
can run main and you can see right here
hello again Derrick comes back and you
can also see here where we are going and
creating a list for all those different
values that were passed inside oh and
I'll come up here and print out all of
these guys so we'll go print line all
right we got all that saved and bounced
over the other screen that says I got an
error at 16 that's fun bounce over to
the other screen and then I'm gonna go
MX and line um - mode right like that if
you can see it and now we can see all
those and I don't have enough closing
parenthesis is that what that is yeah
that's what that was
and this one has 4 so everything should
be fine there will verify it yeah okay
and that closes off the entire function
so that's good rolex ctrl s and jump
over to the other side of the screen now
everything should be fine and it was and
if i run those you can see that they
print out hello Derek hello again Derek
and both of the calculations we put
inside of there as well as our list all
right so good stuff and that's a rundown
of simple functions we're gonna do
advanced functions here very very soon
but now I want to talk about decision
making
now in regards to decision making we
need to understand relational operators
now there's if you want to check for
equality you're gonna use equals not
double equals if you want to check for
not equal that's actually gonna be not
equal like that everything else is gonna
be the same so less than greater than
greater than or equal to less than or
equal to here I'll just give you a
couple quick examples again you're going
to first put your operator and then
you're gonna follow that up with the two
things that you want to check for you're
gonna see down there that comes back is
false and let's just go and show you not
equals and four and five also and how
that works you see that that comes back
is true alright and everything else
works exactly the same we also have
logical operators which is going to be
and or and not and so let's do and and
I'll just do true and false and you see
that comes back is false you could do or
don't forget the C's or and you're gonna
have true-and-false also and let's just
do not true of course that's gonna
basically anything that you pass to it
it's gonna give you the opposite so not
true of course it's gonna give you false
all right so now I want to show you how
that would work with if-then-else so
again we're gonna come in here and we're
gonna create a function and it's gonna
be called can folds and I'm gonna be
passed in an age and then we will return
certain things depending upon if the
person can vote or not so I'm gonna use
an if statement here and I'm gonna
follow that up I want to check if
greater than or equal to and then what
this translates into is age greater than
or equal to 18 and then what we're gonna
do is the first thing that we see inside
of here is what's going to be executed
if it is true and what is going to be
executed otherwise is good is if that
comes back as false so you can't votes
alright and that is how that operates
and of course don't forget to close off
your function alright let's do another
one you're also going to be able to come
in and calculate error but have more
than one statement executed if something
is true or false and use do to do that
so I'm gonna call this can do more and
this is gonna receive an age and then
what it's gonna check for it's gonna say
if age is greater than or equal to 18
and then underneath of this I'm gonna
put do and parentheses and then I'll go
print line and you can drive and then
underneath of that you can say you can
vote and then you can close that do part
out as you saw it did right there and
then you could put you could either have
another do statement inside there and do
multiple different things or you can
just have one thing show up and you can
go in there and practice with that if
you'd like and I didn't close off that
quote and see you can see and there we
go our function is closed
and let's do one more let's do a
demonstration of how when is working and
basically you're gonna use when when you
want to do many things if something is
true so I'm going to say define when
example and tof and then I'm gonna say
when true or false is what that means
when true then I'm going to say that I
want to do the first thing and print
line the second thing and then let's
close that off all together I and what
the heck I'm also gonna cover condition
and basically what this is going to do
is check for multiple different
conditions so let's create another
function so I'm gonna say that what
grade is what this is gonna be and it's
going to receive a age and it is going
to do different things depending upon
the value of that you'll use condition a
lot all right so we're gonna say if the
age that was passed in there is greater
than five or less than five I mean in
that situation we are going to return
preschool and we'll use a print line in
that situation otherwise we can check
something else we can say if it is equal
to five well in that situation we are
going to put kindergarten inside of
there and then we can say and if n is
greater than five you can see how we're
able to use the logical operator there
and then we just put in the other thing
we want to compare and is less than or
equal to 18 well in that situation we
want to close that off like that what
I'm going to do here is use format and
I'll say go to grade and and we will
calculate what grade that should be and
in this situation it's gonna be n minus
five so there we are otherwise else if
no matter what else we can say go to
college alright so it handles everything
you could ever want it to do now let's
come down here and let's run these guys
so you can see exactly what the output
looks like for them so first off I'm
gonna say can vote so first off I'm
gonna say can vote and
we'll pass into that 17 and then we are
going to have can do more
remember that's gonna do more than one
thing and here I'll put 24 inside of
there and then we're going to have or
demonstrate our win example that we had
and I'm just gonna pass true into that
and then finally we can do what grade
and pass nineteen into that and we could
save that with control X and s and then
we can jump over to the other screen and
if I do everything right this will
execute I'm holding meta key and P to
get all these to come up looks like it's
okay and main and there you can see so
we went and passed in a value you can't
vote what did we pass in we passed in 17
so 17 into there and it came back as you
can't vote and then over here I passed
in 24 and both you can drive and you can
vote popped in you can see here or
whenever this is true it's gonna execute
multiple different statements and then
here we passed in the value of 19 and it
says go to college all right so there is
a rundown of numerous different things
you can do
conditionally and now what I want to
talk about is looping alright the very
first looping option on a cover here our
while loops and it's going to loop while
condition is true let's go and create a
function once again and I call this one
2x and it's going to receive whatever
the value of x is got one more
parenthesis in there than I need so X is
that guy right there and then what I'm
going to do is I need a way to increment
a value and I'm going to use an atom to
do that because atoms allow us to change
the value so I'm gonna go atom 1 then
after that I can loop while a condition
is true so I'm gonna say awhile the atom
value is less than or equal to and to
get the value of an atom I go at symbol
and I and then I'm going to put X inside
of there because X is the number of
times we're gonna loop and after that
we're gonna go do and we're gonna list
all the things that we want to print on
the screen in that area right there
which is just going to be the value of
that alright whoops I keep putting the
1i is what I'm looking for and then
after that we're going to have to
increment the
you and once again as a review to
increment you go swap and the
exclamation mark and you call the
increment value so we can close all of
those guys right there and I'm gonna
show you another one let's do do x loop
basically this is gonna execute a
statement a set number of times so let's
go create another function I'm gonna
call this double to X and it's gonna
receive X of course and basically I is
gonna be incremented each time through
so I'm gonna say do x and I and X and
then after that I'm gonna go print line
and I'm gonna multiply everything here
so I'm gonna multiply I times 2 and we
can close off that function let's do
another loop let's could use loop okay
so loop is going to go through values
using a statement called recur to change
the value until a condition is no longer
true so this guy is going to triple to X
so I'm going to call them it's gonna
triple all those values to the value of
x and we're gonna pass in X and y in
this situation I'm gonna set my starting
value of I in this situation so we're
gonna go loop and I whoops I and X so I
is going to be assigned whatever the
value for X is and then I'm going to
cycle as long as we have a true
statement so we're gonna go from I or go
from the value of X to Y so here I'm
gonna say while I is less than Y we are
going to continue to loop and I will put
inside of here all of the things that I
want to happen I want to multiply
whatever the value for I is times 3 and
that's going to triple everything and
then of course we're gonna have to come
in here also and increment the value and
like I said you're going to use recur to
increment that value so plus I and 1 so
there's numerous different ways we can
do everything inside of closure all
right so we have all those setup and
let's go and run them inside of main I'm
going to call 1 2 X and pass in the
value of 5 to that
then after that I am going to call
double 2x and pass in five for that and
then I'm gonna call triple 2x and it's
going to triple everything and we're
gonna go from one to five for that guy
and we'll save it and as long as I do
everything right this guy should run
perfect looks like I did I'll find out
and there you can see it went and
printed the values one through five and
here it went and doubled those values
and here we see that we tripled those
values all right and there is one other
looping construct that's available for
us let's go in and show you that that is
do sequence and it's used for iterating
through a sequence and we just go like
this and here what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna say that I want to print a
list and this is how we receive a list
of items if you missed that whenever I
covered it whenever I was talking about
functions before you put the + symbol in
there like that
right before nums and do sequence and X
is going to be the temporary holding
cell for each value of num so that is
pulled out and then inside of here I can
just print out what I want to show up on
our screen and then we can come down
here and we can call print list so I'm
gonna go print and list and I'm just
gonna go to seven eight and nine
and save that jump over here and got
that like the in main and you can see it
just printed seven eight and nine all
right so there are a whole host of ways
we can loop and now what I want to talk
about is file i/o all right so what are
we gonna do well the very first thing
that I want to do is I need to get a
library that's going to allow me to do
file i/o so this is going to be closure
dot Java dot IO and then I'm going to
define a function that I'm going to find
a couple functions that read and write
files so define a function and I'm gonna
call this write to file and there's very
creative words used inside of closure
it's kind of
all right so what I'm gonna receive here
is the file name and the text that I
want to write to the file then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use a
function called width and open and with
opens gonna open and close the file and
then write the string to the file that I
provide and to write to it use the
writer statement and I'm gonna say
writer and the file that is provided
that it wants me to use and then to
write to it
I'm gonna go dot and write and use the
writer to write the text that was
provided okay so pretty simple now if I
want to read from a file I'm gonna
create a function called read from file
and here I'm just gonna receive whatever
the file name is and I might as well
cover exception handling also so for
this is going to handle a situation in
which I try to read from a file that
doesn't exist
so for exception handling you're gonna
surround everything with try and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say print
line whoops forgot my parentheses print
line and slurp is his the command E is
to read from a file I told you it was
kind of interesting there and that's
gonna close off my try block and then if
I want to catch a potential error I'm
gonna say catch exception E and then I
can just print an error message here
that I want to show if I was unable to
read from a file so and that is going to
be retrieved by calling get and message
and E specifically and then we can close
out all of those different guys and also
with let's I'm gonna show you also how
to append text to a file so let's define
another function and call this append to
file my names aren't as creative as the
creators of closure and here I'm gonna
go file and text and I'm gonna use with
open again like I said it's gonna open
the file and then close it for me
whenever it's done so that's good here I
am going to well I don't want to
that I want to use my writer so with
open and writer and then I'm gonna say
writer and provide whatever the file is
and then to show that you want to append
you're gonna mark append as true and
then after that you can call write and
refer to the writer and the text that
you want to append okay so there's that
and let's say I also want to read one
line at a time these are all the
different ways to working with files so
I'm gonna say read line from file give
this a bit of a longer name and here I
just provide whatever the file name is
in that situation and then I'm once
again I'm gonna use with open just like
I did before and here I will use my
reader and reader and whatever the file
is that I want to be working with and
then I am going to use do sequence to
read out that line put line inside of
here and line once again sequence and
refer to our reader and then in this
situation I'm gonna call print line to
print that line alright and if I did
everything right let's go control X and
control s whoops I forgot I'm gonna have
to also come down and call our functions
inside of main no big deal so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna call right to file
and I have to give it whatever the file
is gonna be called so let's call this
test file instead of text so test and
we're just writing text files here and
whatever I want to write into it so I'm
gonna say this is a sentence and if I
want to put a new line inside of there I
just go like that and there's a new line
alright what else can we do well we can
call read from file and remember I just
pass in whatever file I want to read
from and that's it and it automatically
is gonna work for me and I'll also
demonstrate append to file and I'm going
to say the file that I want to append to
and the text I want to put in it so I'll
say this is a
sentence and throw in another new line
and close that off and then if I just
want to read one line from a file I go
read line from file and test and text
right like that all right let's do
control X control us control X and oh
and meta key P and did I get it all
right
no I didn't I have a little bug here
what did we do wrong I forgot to put
this R right there no big deal all right
got that saved jump back over here again
whoops forgot to put a parenthesis there
and then of course I'm gonna have to put
another parenthesis down there and there
it looks like I got it and let's execute
it and you can see that it properly
wrote to our file so whenever we wrote
to our file then we were calling back
from it so we have this is a sentence so
this is a sentence was printed back to
us we wrote to it first and we read from
it so that's this is a sentence or this
one right here and what I use a print
line inside of there yeah read that
print line there and also the print line
from actually writing it to the file
which is this line right here and then I
read both of them the whole entire file
and then I said that I want just one of
the lines from the file alright so there
we go a whole bunch of different ways to
interact with files using closure and
now I'd like to talk about destructuring
all right so these structuring means
basically the binding of values in a
data structure to symbols so I'm gonna
come in here and I'm just gonna call
this T struct and it's not going to
receive anything just to keep this very
simple then I'm going to define vector
values and I'll put one and two and
three and four inside of here and now
what I want to do is assign values to
symbols and I'm gonna use let here and
I'm gonna have one two and the rest and
the rest is gonna store any remaining
values that I don't you know it wasn't
prepared to use and then I'm gonna put
vector Val's after that and then I can
print out all of this information and I
can just refer to the symbols so one
- and then the rest and then down here I
can just come in and call d-struct and
you'll see how this works or see that it
works actually whoops forgot to put the
da rest sorry about that
all right run it everything's fine and
if we run main you're gonna see that it
printed all those out okay so that's how
d-struct works trying to cover just
about everything now let's talk about
struct maps now struct maps are gonna be
used to define more complex custom types
so what I want to do is create another
function I'm gonna call a struct map
example and it's not gonna receive
anything and to define a struct you're
gonna go define and struct and I'm gonna
call this customer and then you're gonna
define all of the things that your
customers are going to have so my
customers are going to have a phone
number and a name then what I want to do
is define a struct object to do that
just go define customer one and then
struct followed by your struct name
followed by the name you want to use and
our telephone number okay and you can
also assign two specific keys if you'd
like to so we can go define customer two
and struct map and define your struct
map you want to use and then name and
then list a specific name so we could do
Sally after that and then we could have
refer to our phone number and then just
do whatever and close that off and then
to print information we can just go just
like we always do
call print line or format or whatever
you want to call customer one and you're
also going to be able to access
individual fields so you can say print
line and just to prove that we able to
get customer two to work I'm gonna go
name and customer two and there we go
and then we can just come down here and
struct map map example and if I didn't
get anything wrong that should work
perfectly and look at that it did it
right and there you can see that those
work
all right so another very quick example
of how to use struct maps and now I'd
like to talk about the advanced
functions available with closure all
right so we're gonna be able to use
anonymous functions inside of closure
and those are just gonna be functions
that don't have a name so let's say that
I would want to create a list by
multiplying all values by themselves
just to keep that simple I'm going to do
this over here so we would use our map
function and what this is saying here's
our anonymous function we have right
here see function but there's no name
assigned to it so what it's gonna do is
we're using the range function here to
generate values from 1 through 9 up to
10 not including 10 it's gonna take each
of those values it's gonna throw them
inside here multiplying times themselves
and then map is gonna take all those
different values and create a brand new
list so you can see exactly how that
works and here I want to just go in here
and show you another example I'm gonna
write this out by hand so I'm gonna say
map let's say that we would want to come
in here and multiply everything times 3
and I'm gonna use what is called a
compact anonymous function that's done
so instead of putting F and inside of
there we can also go in put a hash
symbol inside of there and then multiply
which is the operation and then a % is
going to represent the value that is
going to be pulled from our list and
then 3 is gonna represent the value we
want to multiply at times so then this
is a compact anonymous function once
again when I close that off and you're
gonna see once again that we were able
to go through and multiply all those
times 3 ok so we see an anonymous
function as well as a compact anonymous
function and you can also have compact
anonymous functions that receive two
arguments so for example let's come in
here and let's do hash symbol and
multiply and % 1 is gonna represent the
first argument and % 2 is gonna
represent the second one and then we can
follow that up with our two arguments
that we have and you can run that and
you'll see that it multiplied two times
three alright so there you go
there are compact as well as regular old
and no
as functions inside of closure now let's
jump back over here and I'll show you an
example of a closure and basically
closures are going to be used to return
custom functions so I'm gonna come in
and I'm gonna define a custom multiplier
is what I'm gonna call this you know
what I'm gonna run this inside of our
repple again just so you can see exactly
but you see that you can do this inside
of here so I'm gonna go define and
custom multiplier and and go down to the
next line nothing is wrong with that
I'm gonna call malt buy and then I'm
going to use our compact anonymous
function here so hash symbol and
multiplication and % and malt buy is
gonna be passed inside of there so there
you go that is how we can create that
function inside of there and now we're
going to be able to call it so I'm gonna
go and create another function and malt
by 3 and I can call my custom multiplier
closure and pass 3 inside of it and now
I can come in and call malt by 3 so malt
by 3 and let's multiply 3 times 3 and
you can see that we got 9 back so there
you go there is a demonstration of
macros and we're getting very close to
the end of just about everything and now
I want to cover some different ways we
can filter lists so we just stick with
working in the repple over here because
this is working pretty good let's say
one way we can filter list or well we
have a couple different functions we
have take drop take Wow drop while and
filter I'm gonna demonstrate every
single one of them so no I don't even
need print line in this situation I can
say take and - and what this is going to
do is take two of those values and reeva
leave the rest of them there whoops
forgot to put that in there now let's go
get rid of that all that mess alright so
I'm gonna go take and two and get two
values are there so let's put one two
and three inside of there make sure you
close it off with the square brackets
and you're gonna see that it took the
first two values out of there you're
also going to have
drop and let's say that we want to drop
everything after our first so I'm gonna
stay drop one and then one two and three
and you can see that it got eliminated
the first element then just gave me back
the second and third we're also going to
be able to take what matches a condition
using something called take while so
let's say we only want negative values
from this list and we'll throw a
negative one in there and you can use
conditions or whatever you'd like and
let's run that and you can see only
negative one came we could also drop
what matches a condition and that is
drop while and let's just stick with our
negative idea we have here so I'm gonna
go negative one and zero and one once
again and you can see it gave me the 0
and the 1 and we could also return what
matches with filter so we can say filter
and I'll use the compact anonymous
function here so I'm gonna go greater
than and I'm gonna go percent two so
this is going to say I want everything
that is greater than two return to me
and I can say one and two and three and
four and there we go
and it returned three and four and
that's just about it
so to finish off the whole entire
tutorial I'd like to cover my last topic
which is going to be macros now
basically a macro is going to generate
code in line whenever you need to define
when or if argument should be evaluated
so it's a code generating tool that is
extremely powerful
so let's I'm gonna give you a bunch of
examples here so let's say that we
wanted to have a macro that will print
different discounts based on if the
person is of the age of 65 or not how
you define a macros you go to fine macro
and we'll call this discounts and Here I
am going to put the conditions going to
be passed in and then we're gonna have
what happens with discount one or the
first discount or the second discount or
lack thereof in this situation
well we're then going to do to generate
our code but at the same time designate
when we show
I refer to while at the same time
deciding what we want to evaluate and
what we don't want to evaluate we're
going to use something called syntax
quoting so here we are going to generate
a list of commands and I'm then going to
actually put inside of here what
commands we're gonna use so I am going
to put a back quote right here and then
I'm gonna follow that up with if what
that's saying is it's telling closure
not to evaluate the if but just return
it so that we return a line of code and
don't do anything with the F okay so
what this is saying is if a condition is
true we want to print out discount one
message otherwise we want to print out
the discount to message okay so pretty
simple so let's jump down into main and
we'll execute this so I'm gonna define
discount so I can call it just like any
other function and here I'm going to be
able to pass in a condition so I'm gonna
say greater then I'm gonna say the age
of the person is 25 and I'm comparing
that to 65 and the first message if true
that's gonna print is going to be 10%
off 10% off and otherwise the next
command that I'm going to print inside
of here is going to be print line and
here I'll say full price so if you're
not over the age of 65 you have to pay
full price and we can save that and jump
over here and reload that and then call
main and you can say that the person has
to pay full price okay so that's a first
example of how we can use macros let's
do another one and this is gonna take
some playing around with before you get
it but that's okay so what I want to do
this time is let's say that going and
adding values like this is just driving
you completely and crazy what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to show you a way to be
able to add in your normal way so I'm
gonna define a macro for that so I'm
gonna say define macro and what I'm
gonna call this is regular math so
you're gonna be able to pass this guy
the regular way that you would do
mathematics
so here it's gonna be calculation as
what I'm gonna refer to that as and here
I'm once again I'm going to generate a
list
I'm gonna create second calc so what's
gonna be passed inside of this is gonna
be two plus five what I'm saying is I
want to get the plus sign that's the
second thing that's gonna be passed
inside they don't want to get the first
thing that is passed inside and then I
want to get the last thing and how we
get the last thing is we were referred
to the enth and calc and it would be two
in this situation and that should close
off my macro so now I'll demonstrate how
that's gonna work here we'll just go
regular and math and then I can pass in
my two plus five okay so that is how we
are able to go and do that so pretty
cool stuff and we come in here and
reload that and you're gonna see that
seven comes back all right so there's
another demonstration of a macro let's
do another one so let's say that we want
to do or execute multiple different
statements we can do that with do so I'm
gonna say that I want to define another
macro and we call this do-more and it is
going to receive a condition and then
it's gonna have a body of statements a
bunch of statements that we're gonna
want to execute here I'm gonna once
again generate a list and I do not want
it to evaluate the if and I'm gonna put
in condition and then I'm going to
construct all these it once again I
don't want it to refer to the do and
then I'm just gonna throw a body in just
like that now what I can do is jump down
into Maine and I can call this so this
is do more and do more I'm gonna pass in
the condition I want so is one less than
two you know I think you know the answer
to that and then I can print all of the
different things or I can list all the
different commands that I want to
execute inside of here so this is going
to be multiple different commands and
you can have of course something other
than print lines but whatever okay so
hello again and there that is and here
we can jump over here and we can reload
and run Maine and you can say that it
executed both of those commands alright
and to demonstrate one more thing let's
come up here and do another one of these
whoops okay and here we go
and now to demonstrate one more thing
I'm gonna go define macro here and I'm
gonna call this do-more - and we are
going to have our condition that's gonna
be passed inside and and and body once
again and what you're gonna be able to
do here is actually surround everything
with syntax quoting and this is some
some people prefer to do that and in
that situation if you surround
everything with syntax quoting which
means don't evaluate anything then we're
going to use what's called an unquote
that is going to allow us to define what
we do want to evaluate okay
so let's just show you a demonstration
so instead I could go and put the quote
outside so we're gonna go quote like
this there we are and then we'll put F
and we'll say we don't want to evaluate
that but we do want to evaluate our
condition and then we can go in and say
do and if we want to evaluate multiple
different things we unquote it put the @
symbol and follow that up with body and
then follow that up with that and then
we can come down and do more to and do
similar sort of thing we'll say let's
just do exactly the same thing actually
just to demonstrate that that will work
and there we go
and if we reload it and execute it
you're gonna see that it works that way
also alright so there you go guys that
is a heck of a lot of information about
the closure language and I think that'll
set you straight on just about anything
you're ready to learn and just like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
