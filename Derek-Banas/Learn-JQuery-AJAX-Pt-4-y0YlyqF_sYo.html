jQuery and Ajax tutorial if you didn't
see part 2 of my tutorial definitely run
back and see it and you should probably
watch part 1 as well because at the end
of part 2 I actually show you the
working web page that we are going to
create in this tutorial I'm going to
walk you through all the code that went
into creating that web page so if you
didn't see it go back and look at it now
and if you did see it onwards we move
here's how I begin that web page I open
up my HTML page and then I link to the
jQuery library you're on create a whole
bunch of CSS style definitions that I'll
use below if you don't understand any of
this you should definitely check out my
CSS style tutorial here I assign
on-click event handlers as soon as the
web page loads - all of the buttons
below and state which function should be
called when an event is triggered as you
can see here all the events I'm
assigning Arland click event handlers
for example if someone clicks the button
with the ID name one button below it's
on click event handler will be triggered
and the function add email icon will be
called the HTML code for that button you
can see here in the third bulleted item
in your lower left hand side of your
screen here I'm looking for any links
that exist that have a value that begins
with mail - and when I find one I change
its class to the email class that will
place an email icon in the background
the email class looks like this if you
can't remember from before this bit of
code will search all tables that exist
and change those rows to the class table
alt if I however wanted to change the
odd number grows I would just simply
replace even with the word on as I show
here here I'm choosing to change the
class of every first row in every table
on the web page there are numerous ways
to change children elements inside of it
any parent element as you can see here I
tell the browser to find the third
paragraph on the web page and change its
class this code changes the class for
every paragraph element that lies in a
div element on the web page if you
haven't figured it out of course you can
hit pause or go to new think-tank com
where you can find all this code
percent free here we look for the text
forth inside of every paragraph element
if we find that word I change the
attribute of that element so that the
text color equals yellow here I'm
searching for elements that have the
attribute aligned signs some value if I
find one I then assign the change listed
I could also search for elements that
have an attribute assigned with a
specific value if I was looking for a
paragraph element with the attribute a
line assigned to the value of left I
would do exactly what you see here in
the third bullet item I'm looking here
for an element that has the ID name of
third and if I find it I then check if
that element is a paragraph element if
both check out I pop up another box that
states that fact the rest of the code
straight HTML so you understand it and
if you don't you should definitely check
out my HTML tutorial
in the next tutorial I'm going to cover
pretty much everything there is to know
about event handling in jQuery and Ajax
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
