9 of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm gonna finish up
explaining how to use regular
expressions and strings inside of PHP
okay what I did here was I created a
string with just some random information
into it and let's say I want to find
different versions of the name Jennifer
inside here what is one way I can do
that well I'm gonna show you how to
search for all of those strings that
match a regular expression inside of a
string using preg match underscore all
and what you do is just define your
regular expression and I'm going to use
the percent sign again as my delimiter
and then what I'm gonna say here this is
like short a shorthand way of doing it
what I'm saying here is that I want to
find any string of characters that
begins with je and then it's followed
either by 1 or up to 6 of any of the
letters can contained inside of this
bracket so that's what that means right
there is sort of a shorthand regular
expression way of searching and then I'm
just gonna simply tell it this name of
the string that I want it to search and
then I'm going to tell it what array I
want the results stored in and then if I
want to go through everything that was
found I search the array match name as
result and then I'm actually gonna have
to call for each again and search the
result found and this will allow me to
echo out to screen everything to fit the
requirements of the regular expression
that I put down here and I'm just gonna
copy this one down here okay close off
both of those for each text blocks file
say come over here and you can see it
found Jennifer Jenny and Jen and printed
them out to screen for me so that is how
you would search a string instead of
searching an array like we were doing in
the previous tutorial so you use preg
match all now I'm gonna come in here and
I'm gonna create another string on
random string is equal to Dick and Jane
fetched a bucket water okay now if I
want to replace anything that fits the
requirements to the regular expression I
use preg ripple
and here I'm just going real shortly
just use an echo command so that you can
see the results without having to go
through everything so otherwise you
would just save this to a string what I
do is I define that which I want to
replace using a regular expression so
I'm just gonna replace dick but you
could use obviously more complicated
ones and I'm going to denote what I want
to put in its place and of course I have
to define the string that I want to
perform this action on and if I goof I
say come over here you can see that it
jumped in here and replaced the word
dick with Paul and Jane pathetic so turn
it all that out to screen so that is
another way you can manipulate
information I could also use the string
replace method in this instance to
replace any reference to Jane with the
word Erica and this is actually a method
that is not going to be using regular
expressions I'm just going to say I want
to replace Jane with Erica and then just
type in the string that you want to
perform this operation on I'll save you
can see now it replaced the word Jane
with the word Erica so these are all the
different methods are available to you
to manipulate strings inside of PHP
let's say I want to return part of a
string how do I do that I use sub STR
substring and then I tell it what string
to search I say to start at the 9th
index and remember strings are 0 1 2 3
blah blah blah and let's say I want to
return for characters that fall after
that I've got the Oh file save and you
can see that it printed Jane out to the
screen had actually printed water here
and the reason why it did that
is an input anything in there so if I'll
save it and now you can see Jane is on
its own separate line so it jumped in 9
spaces and this is the ninth index and
it printed out the screen one two three
four characters in length as I defined
right there let's say you want to return
the position of a specific substring
easy enough STR POS string position the
string you want to search for and let's
say I want to find out the index of
fetched I'll say and it's in the 14th
indexed position is where F actually
shows up in this
during all this codes at new think tank
calm by the way if you'd like to have
access to it for free obviously okay so
now I'm gonna show you something a
little bit more complicated let's say I
want to divide up information like
previously I showed you how to divide
strings of data based off of commas for
instance so basically break everything
into an array and separate everything
based off of a comma well here I'm going
to show you how to split a string based
off of a regular expression using
another method called preg split so this
is a little bit more complicated way of
doing things this is kind of shows you
the power of regular expressions again
so let's say we got a bunch of corporate
people here and they're all separated by
whatever their title is I'm just making
these names up these aren't real people
by the way okay so you got this string
here now let's say we want to separate
everything based off of getting rid of
this title and then separating all these
different guys all into their own little
compartments how would we do that
piece of cake I'm just gonna call this
another title and this is going to end
up being an array and I call Prague
underscore split and then we're gonna
define the regular expression that is
going to match what I want to split
apart so this may be in the past would
have been a comma this is a lot more
complicated than a column of those so I
have to create a regular expression that
meets this so we know there's a space
there then we know there's parentheses
remember I got a backslash those out and
then in all instances there are three
characters so I'm gonna put this period
in here it's gonna represent anything
but a newline for a character it's
around that and then I'm going to define
this there's gonna be three of them and
then the ending for the parentheses and
then there's gonna be another space I'm
gonna put in my delimiter and I'm gonna
define a string that I want to perform
this operation on and everything is
going to be stored in the array called
no title so cycle through no title just
like this and print the screen close the
for each block you can see the CTO shows
up here which we do not want that what
is a nice easy way to get rid of that
put the question mark in here for the
space so then it'll match if there is a
space and it will also match if there
isn't file say happy accident that it
taught you something else so you could
see I got exactly what I was looking for
here I split up all the names and got
rid of all the titles and everything
nice and neat in a new array now if
you'd like to find the length of a
string I know I'm sort of jumping from
things that are really kind of
complicated anyway the things that
aren't complicated at all you call the
STR le N or string length function I'm
gonna call that a jump over here yeah
you can see that there's 53 characters
in length and if I want to compare
different strings let's say I create a
string one and it's equal to dr. J and I
create another string two and it's also
equal to dr. J but it's lowercase J and
I'm also going to create another string
three is equal to he went there I'm just
typing at random stuff now now if we
compare string 1 to string two sure you
can see here exactly what is different
the lowercase J I'm gonna call strcmp
echo the results out to the screen and
I'm also going to echo here but I'm
going to compare an ignore case so I'm
gonna type STR case
compare and I'll save it and you can see
right here whenever 0 is returned with
this method right here that means they
are equal and you will see that a
negative number is returned if string 1
is considered less than string 2 also 0
if they're equal otherwise you're going
to get a positive number which means
that string 1 technically is greater
than string 2 these comparisons are
being made on character codes by the way
and while these are often taught methods
I find that I almost never use them I
rely more on regular expressions just
because I like them more you can also
change the case on strings let's say
uppercase the first letter of the string
I'll say now you can see it printed with
uppercase H say he went there and
another thing you can do upper case all
the words it's nice to know these things
exist so like I was saying before
there's no real reason to memorize all
these guys it's kind of like just it's a
good thing to know that they are out
there and to roughly have an
understanding of what is out there so
that you save yourself some code
and you could see here what this is
gonna do is it's gonna uppercase every
single word you see words string the
lower it's gonna make everything a
lowercase and here it's going to make
everything uppercase and if I file save
it jump over here you see it did exactly
that see all the first letters are
uppercase here everything is lowercase
and here everything is uppercase also
I'm not going to give examples of it I
there are also ways different ways to
trim whitespace off of a string and if
you wanted to trim whitespace off the
left and the right you would use the
trim function if you want a trim
whitespace just off the left you use L
trim and if you want to trim whitespace
off the right you use our trim and here
for our final example and pretty much
everything you need to know about
strings let's create HTML text with tags
and I'll show you how to very easily
strip tags from a string you know so
let's say the title is my webpage and
we're gonna close the title off just
like that
and if you'd like to strip off all the
tags that surround it pass HTML text all
right like that I'll save it
jump up here boom and it printed my web
page out to the screen and got rid of
all of the tags that surround that
information so right there is pretty
much everything you can do to make you
like string search through strings and
so forth and so on
up next object-oriented programming with
PHP if you have any questions or
