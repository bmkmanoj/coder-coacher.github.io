5 of my C++ video tutorials series in
this part of the tutorial series I'm
going to cover a lot of math functions
available to us as well as a whole bunch
of interesting things we can do with
strings and like always the problems
you're gonna have to solve for this
tutorial are going to be much more
complicated than the last tutorial like
always all of the code and a transcript
of the entire video is available in the
description underneath the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
and pardon me I just got over a horrible
sickness just power and through here and
trying to make your videos hopefully
enjoy it alright so first off let's talk
about strings now a C character string
which you may be aware of is basically
just an array of characters with a null
character at the end and this is what I
mean by a null character okay and we'll
just create one so inside of man I'm
gonna go character and this is going to
be a C string and it is called C string
it's a it's a character array C the name
C string don'ts just don't want to cause
confusion with that then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna put in all of
the characters separated by commas and
that is also going to include any spaces
that we have so we can call this guy a
string right like this alright and there
you got a string which is just a
character array and then finally we're
gonna have also inside of single quotes
a normal character which is a backslash
n a zero alright so there you go there
is your C type of string that we have
and we're gonna improve on that
dramatically now you're gonna be able to
get the array size just like we did
previously that's just by going array
and size and
we can go in reference by passing size
of the C string array that we want and
of course that's gonna give us our total
number of items and within there is also
going to be the null character so you
see there are array 9 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 okay so that's what that is and we can
do some more and we're gonna improve on
that of course but basically C strings
are going to be troublesome because if
you forget the null character or if you
add too much information what it's going
to do is it's going to lead to your
program to either your program to crash
or the entire system to crash now C++
standard strings like we have seen
previously on the other hand are going
to be able to grow in size we're not
gonna have to worry about null
characters and there are just a plane
off much simpler okay so what I want to
do here is before I demonstrate how
these are gonna work I'm going to
actually create a vector of C++ strings
so let's go and create a vector and
we'll be getting into problems here very
quickly there that is and I'm just gonna
call this string vac and then let's say
that I want to have 10 spaces set aside
whenever the vector is first created and
let's just go get rid of that now I'm
gonna go in and create a string and give
it a default value and we're gonna use
double quotes with this so I'm gonna say
something like I'm a string and then I'm
just gonna throw this string into my
vector just so that I will be able to
easily output information here as we
continue now you're going to be able to
access characters just like previously
using an index so let's say I guess what
a reference the first item in my string
that I'd created here I can do so of
course and you can see I comes back
you're also going to be able to do this
using at so you can go string and then
dot at and then throw your index inside
of there and you can see the output say
exactly the same on the right side of
the screen there's numerous other
different functions so I'm of course
gonna give you a whole bunch of
demonstrations off we're going to be
able to
and golf fronts which is going to give
us our first character so I'll just call
string front and then we're also going
to have well it's gonna throw a space
inside of here
we also have string back and you can see
there's the first letter as well as the
last one we're of course going to be
able to get our length for our string so
let's go get our length just by
referencing the string and then
following that up with the length method
and you can see the Winx comes back is
12 and you can see that is exactly the
same length as the string that we have
input into STR the variable STR you're
gonna be able to also come in here and
copy strings just by creating an
additional string like this and then
passing in whatever the original string
was let's go and throw that into our
vector as well actually I'm going to
come down here and I'm gonna output all
of the information I throw in that
string back just so it's easier to cycle
through I'm gonna use the abbreviated
four here with auto auto of course it's
just going to define whatever the data
type is for me and I can cycle through
every single item that is inside of my
string vector and then outputs all of
the things that I place inside of it
just ease things up here make it a
little bit easier to see what's going on
alright so we got that set up and let's
just change this the string back like
that and now we can run it you can see
I'm a string shows up there and I'm a
string once again and the reason why it
shows up there two times is because
string two has exactly the same data as
string one because that's I copied
string the string inch to the first
string into the second string okay
you're also going to be able to come in
and just copy up to a certain point so
let's go and create another string and
let's call this string three and we can
go and say we want string the very first
one and we want to copy everything after
the first four characters well that's
how you do that and then of course I can
go copy this right here into my vector
so let's change this to and change this
to three and you could say it just
copied everything after the fourth
character just like you said we wanted
to do can also do all kinds of weird
things like let's say we wanted to
create a string let's call it string
four and we wanted to repeat the same
value over and over again in the string
a certain number of times so let's say
we want to create a string and we want
five X's inside of that string well
that's how we do that and then we can
come down here and throw our new string
4 into there and you could say it's
exactly what it produced for us we're
also going to be able to combine strings
with either a pen or just a plus sign so
let's go and get string
Veck 4 and let's say equal to whatever
the original string was and then we'll
call append and then we'll put a you can
either put a variable inside of here or
we can throw an actual string inside of
it so we'll say and you're not and just
to demonstrate another one we can also
go STR plus equal to and we'll go and
whoops let's go throw a space in there
again and you're not okay if we run it
you're gonna see a string and all these
guys different guys pop up here it says
AMA string and you're not and if we come
down here and actually output that
string that we have right there with the
new change to it so your string like
this ends with a new line after it say
that they actually see I'm a string and
you're not see it says I'm a string and
you're not and you're not say twice over
and over and over again okay so kind of
neat so there's two different ways to
append strings together or add strings
together however you want to refer to it
you're also going to be able to append
part of a string so you just go append
once again and you go and get your
string and let's go 34 to 37 and then
we'll go string back and five is going
to be equal to STR once again and you
could say it just keeps on going and
you're not and you're not you're not
you're not we're also going to be able
to come in and erase characters from a
string from an index to another index or
the last index like I'm gonna do here so
I'm gonna say that I want to go and get
our string that we've been
adding all sorts of stuff too and I
wanted to delete some stuff off of it so
I'm gonna say I want to start at the
13th index when I delete everything from
there until the very very end of it so
we'll go like this and then we see how
our string changed by throwing this
inside of our new vector and you can see
that after we added in the and you're
not and then we just kept adding and
you're not and you're not in you're not
over and over again now we finally got
to the point where we changed it back to
its original string so a whole bunch of
different ways that you can manipulate
and change strings another thing that's
interesting about strings is we're going
to be able to come in here and search
for a different piece of information so
for example we'll be able to use a
function called find which is going to
return in index where a specific pattern
is found so we can come in and we can do
if STR dot find and we can say that we
are specifically looking for string or
the word string inside of the string
with the name STR and then what we're
going to do is we're going to check to
see if we were able to find any and how
you do that is you'll say not equal to
and we'll go standard string and end
pause is going to be returned if there
is no match so we're saying if this does
not return this value right here well
then we know that we do have a match so
in that situation we're gonna output
some information so we'll say something
like the first hit that we had here is
gonna and then we'll just call string
find and string let's change that to
first index and you can see it hits
right there first index is 6 for the
matching word string actually I think
I'm gonna get rid of this guy here cuz
it's coming a little bit distracting so
paste that inside of there you don't
just run it and there you can say first
index is 6 a little bit easier to say
all right let's run through a couple
other different things we can do here
you're also going to be able to return a
substring and you can define the index
where you want to start and then the
length so let's go in here
and grab a substring so I'm just gonna
call this sub STR okay it works good I'm
gonna go get my original string that I'm
working with and I said I want to start
at the sixth index and I'm gonna go up
to a length of six and that's gonna
return that to me I could of course
store that into a variable or do
whatever I'd like with it and you could
say it returns the word string another
thing we can do is we could reverse a
string so we do that by calling a
function called reverse and then we pass
in both the beginning of our string as
well as the end of our string which we
want to have the values returned
reversed and it automatically does that
for us so it's kind of cool
so this inside here changes the reverse
and then let's just output our new
changed string and see how that works
out for us and there you can see it went
and reversed our string that we threw
inside of there so kinds of crazy stuff
built into C++ we could also do case
conversion and do that we're gonna use a
function called transform once again
let's go and I'm gonna get string two in
this situation and I'm gonna reference
the beginning of string two and then I'm
going to go and get the end o string two
and I'm gonna convert the whole entire
thing to uppercase so string two dot
again and then we're gonna go to whoops
to upper and that's gonna get us
uppercase aversions and let's go and
it's also copy this well let's go and
throw this down the bottom first off and
throw this down here and then we'll call
this just upper and then of course get
string two and then if you want to
convert and this is gonna affect every
character in the string and then here
we'll to go and you know all the same
things and we'll just change this to
lower that's all you need to do and then
this is gonna be lower also and you
could say that I went and converted this
to uppercase and that to lowercase of
course another thing
that is interesting is that each
character is going to get an ASCII code
assigned for it so you can actually get
the ASCII code for a character by saving
the character as an integer or you can
do a cast or what have you and this is
going to be important information
because this is gonna come up in your
very first problem today so basically
the character codes for lower case a
through a lowercase a Z are gonna be 97
through 122 and uppercase Z through
uppercase Z is gonna be 65 through 90
all right let me do a demonstration here
and then what you're gonna be able to do
is get your first problem of the day to
solve so I'm gonna go and create a
character and I'll just call it hey
character and then I will assign to it
the egg let's do a capital letter Z just
to be weird alright so there's a capital
letter Z now I can go int and a integer
is equal to a character and what this is
gonna do is if I go standard C out and
I'll put this a I'm just called a code
was this is actually Zico let's change
it they just who doesn't cause any just
so you're not confused okay so that here
is a and it's character form here it is
in its integer form okay so then what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna output this
and I can just go int like that and a
and that's gonna give me the character
code either way you want to do it it's
up to you and then we can run that you
can see the character code for a is 97
exactly like I told you it was right
there alright so that's how you can get
character codes I need stuff something
else you might want to find handy is
let's say we want to convert an integer
to a string well we would just go
integer string string number is gonna be
and you would go standard and then you
would call to string like this and I
could go 1 plus 2 just to make this a
little bit more interesting and then
let's just go string like this and then
get the output for this
pounds if I do that you're gonna see
that comes back and went and added those
values together then converted it into a
string stated it into the variable
called string num and then we output
that on the screen okay some pretty cool
stuff and now we have come to the part
where are you are going to get to solve
your very first problem okay so your for
your very first problem what I want you
to do is your program is going to
receive an uppercase string all
uppercase letters okay and then it's
going to hide the meaning I but by
basically turning each of those letters
into whatever their corresponding ASCII
code is okay so I've provided you with
everything you need and we're just going
to be working with uppercase in this
situation so 65 through 90 and that
should provide you with a hint and why
I'm doing uppercase and basically you
just need to take each individual letter
and convert it into its individual ASCII
code alright so you can pause the video
and try to do that and also what you can
do is translate it back to its original
letters as bonus homework and otherwise
I will show you how to do it right now
alright so what are we gonna need to do
when I'm creating a program I like to
think about what are the key pieces of
data that I am going to need to store so
I'm gonna get my normal string that the
user is going to pass in and then I'm
gonna get my secret string which is
going to be what I am going to convert
you know those letters into whatever
their ASCII codes are alright so those
are the two things I need and I can't
really think anything else I need right
now so maybe I need something else maybe
I don't I don't know all right so what
did I say I said that I'm going to ask
the user to enter a string in uppercase
letter so I'm gonna say enter your
string in upper case and like that I'm
then going to store whatever they send
to me into my normal string and we got
to think about the different things that
we're gonna need to do I am going to
need to cycle through each of the
characters of course and I'm going to
need to convert them into their ASCII
codes so how are we going to do
that well I'm just gonna say a four and
I'm going to be working with characters
so and don't worry if you didn't get
this just like always the goal here is
really to just be able to understand
what my final output is and if you get
any other type of output and that you'd
like to share and feel free to share it
so I'm going to go and get the
individual character out of that string
and I'm going to convert it into a
character code by calling int on the
character casting to an int and you can
see that it saves that write like that
it's going to save it into my secret
string so kind of neat stuff now what I
can do is I can output the secret
message on the screen so I can say
secret and uh that is and secret string
and we can output this on the screen
just to see if we are getting the right
type of output here so enter your string
in uppercase and I can say something
like hello and you could see it gave me
this crazy-looking series of numbers
instead which makes it impossible to
understand okay so let's go and continue
here now what I want to do is I want to
convert it back so I'm gonna go normal
string and I'm going to zero out the
normal string I'm going to convert it
from its secret code back to its regular
way so how am I gonna do that well you
have to understand now each of those
characters is represented by two digits
okay so that's the reason why I made
this problem a little bit easy and
beginning I said everything can be
uppercase so you didn't have sometimes
single day or double digits sometimes
triple digits don't worry that problems
gonna be presented to you here in a
minute so basically what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to have to cycle through those
two at a time so I'm going to say I want
to create a for loop and I is equal to
and we're gonna start at the zero index
I'm gonna say that I'm gonna continue
well I is less than the secrets string
length and I'm going to increment two at
a time through here yeah this might have
caught you
that's okay how we can increment through
two at a time is right like that and I'm
gonna put a space in there because I
mean it just thought it looked a little
bit neater okay
so that's gonna allow me to increment
through the secret string two at a time
and then convert them back into letters
all right so to get them I'm gonna go
I am create a string and I'm gonna call
this a string but it's going to be the
character code in string format and I'm
just gonna give it no value here in the
beginning then I'm gonna go and get or
add to this string it's gonna hold the
character code and I'm gonna get the
very first index out of here so I like
that and then I'm gonna add the second
one just by going I close one so there
and then I can go plus one all right and
that's how I'm gonna be able to grab
those out of there individually now what
I want to do is I want to convert the
string into an integer and I can move
this up I'm sure I'm gonna convert the
string that I grabbed out of there into
an integer so I'm going to create an
integer and I'm gonna put an N in front
of here just so that I know that is an
integer so this is the integer version
of character code and to convert it I go
sto I and s whatever the character code
was in the string format and that's how
we convert from strings to integers now
I can revert from the int back into a
character by going character and this
time I'm gonna go CH saying this is the
character version of our character good
and I can go character good that's how
you can can easily convert from a
character or an integer into a character
you just save it as a character and it
does it automatically and then I can go
normal string normal string and add in
our character character code all right
and there is our normal string so now
after doing all that I should be able to
output our original input and we will
have our secret so we will just call
this I'm going to call this original and
then
go and call normal string as long as I
program right it should work so I'm
going to say enter your string in
uppercase okay well I'm gonna say hello
and it's going to go and convert it into
our secret message and then it's gonna
re-evaluate it and turn it back to its
original okay so cool stuff so now what
I'd like you to do for the second part
of the problem is try to figure out how
you will be able to allow the user to
enter both upper and lowercase letters
by by only changing two things which is
the subtracting and adding of one value
in the code you see right here and that
is gonna allow you just one addition and
one subtraction is going to allow you to
receive both uppercase and lowercase
letters so you can go and pause your
video and try to figure that out
otherwise I will do it for you okay so I
don't know if you got it or not but
basically what we're gonna do here is
we're looking okay so what's the problem
we're trying to solve what we're trying
to solve the problem as easily as
possible is how are we going to be able
to convert these letters into numbers
and avoid having sometimes having three
digits and having to worry about
converting from two and figuring out
should it be a 2 or should it be 3
digits and so forth and so on what is
the easiest way to solve that problem
well the easiest way to do it is to
eliminate the possibility of ever having
three digits and how can we do that well
all we need to do is come down here
where we are first converting from our
letters to our numbers which is gonna be
right here and let's just subtract out
23 and no matter what it is it is always
going to be a two-digit number
alright so pretty simple solution for
that then all we're gonna need to do is
whenever we convert it back we are going
to of course have to change it or
increase the value by 23 so that just
means right down here we'll come in and
add in the 23 right back again and now
you can see that if I come in here and
it doesn't matter what I do I can just
go there I'll just do it real simple you
see that we were able to convert from
dog back into dog
do something even bigger I'll find just
to change a little bit different let's
go to elephants like that and you could
say that we are able to basically
receive a word converted into a bunch of
secret messages with a number and then
convert it back to the original okay so
hopefully you guys got that if you did
congratulations if you didn't know worry
about it the goal once again is just to
understand the final output and now to
finish out the video I just like to give
you a rundown of some of the main math
functions available to us with C++
alright so to get access to these other
additional functions we're going to go
include and see math and there's just
never-ending series of libraries we're
gonna be able to use let's just do
something really simple here I'm gonna
I'm not gonna type all these out I'm
just gonna show you a couple of them and
then I'll go through and explain you
know like what they do so let's say
we're going to do absolute value of
negative 10 of course there's a function
for that and let's go throw space inside
of there and sue reference our function
we go standard and abs and negative 10
of course and can I put that on the
screen and you can see of course that
the value is indeed 10 all right and
there's numerous functions like that and
what I went and did was I went and
created them for you so you'll be able
to see them all in one place so here we
are and if I run this you're going to
see and basically all you need to do is
just replace the STD with the two colons
right there next to all this and you'll
see all of the different functions we
have that are available to us so we have
absolute value of course you're going to
have the max function the min function
of course they're gonna receive a
decimal an integer and return you the
maximum of the minimum you can also
there is an equivalent for floating
points or doubles or however you want to
refer to them you're gonna be able to
calculate exponent which is just going
to be the value of e to whatever the
value is that you put inside here if you
put one inside of there obviously it's
gonna give you the value of e exponent
two once again it's gonna give you two
to the power of whatever you put inside
here so if it's one of course
it's gonna give you the value of 2 logs
sometimes confuses people so I put a
little bit of information here basically
if you take e times e times e that's
gonna give you on a value that is
approximately equal to 20 so if you take
the log of 20 that is going to give you
a value that is approximately equal to 3
and you can see right here that that is
indeed what it does
and likewise log 10 is gonna give if you
take 10 times 10 times 10 you get a
value of 1000 exactly so if you two log
10 and 1,000 you're going to get a value
of 3 like you can see right there and
again we have 2 times 2 times 2 8 and
that's why you get 3 right there
we're gonna be able to take 2 to the
power of 3 we're gonna be able to get
square roots cube roots calculate
hypotenuse ceiling is basically going to
round up to whatever the next whole
number is floor is gonna round down and
then round is going to round based off
of whatever this value is right here
this guy right here so if this is 5 or
above it's gonna round up and if it's
below 5 it's gonna round down so there's
a rundown of all of the different math
functions you have or the main ones any
way that you're gonna use a lot and of
course there's gonna be a whole bunch of
other trig functions that you all know
and love that are also going to be
available that are gonna be in this same
exact type of format okay so hopefully
you guys enjoyed that tutorial and you
enjoyed trying to solve those problems
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
