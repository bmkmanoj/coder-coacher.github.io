my tutorial on how to make Android apps
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you the
easiest way to use the Android
navigation drawer I've received numerous
requests to cover this and I'm gonna
cover it in the most simplistic fashion
possible so what we're gonna do now is
I'm gonna jump over and show you exactly
what its gonna look like and I'm gonna
write all the code ok so here is the
navigation drawer you can see it's gonna
pop up right there and I kept this
extremely simple and you're gonna see
here what I'm actually doing is loading
a brand new fragment but all it says is
contact information or in that situation
my company but you could put any
fragment or any activity in there you
could possibly ever want so just kept it
really simple so you guys will
definitely know exactly how to do this
okay so here's the Android studio we're
just gonna come in here and we're gonna
create ourselves a new project and I'm
just gonna call this and nav draw just
to be a really bizarre and then I'm
gonna click on next
and then I'm gonna click on next I'm
setting that for 15 doesn't really
matter and then I'm gonna come down here
to navigation drawer activity and click
on that and click on next let everything
else be exactly the same and click on
finish and now it's gonna create
everything ok so as you saw everything
there was very very simple but you're
gonna be able to put in any type of
activities inside of there I just kept
it simple so that it's simple and easy
to use alright you can see that are
automatically generated these different
layout files for us and if we come up
here and click on Java we're also going
to see that it also generated the
navigation drawer fragment for us now
I'm gonna come in here and I might as
well just go in and create my layout
files for all my fragments so I'm just
gonna click on layout and go new and
then XML and then XML layout file I'm
gonna call this first one fragment about
me and that's an XML file I'm going to
leave that as a linear layout and click
on finish and it's going to generate
that for me and we can come in here and
click on the text tab at the very bottom
of the screen and then the only thing
I'm gonna do here is go in and pull
in a textview and I'm gonna have this be
rap content and have this be wrapped
content for the text I'm gonna come in
and just put it about me fragment so
that we'll be able to see this change
and of course you'll be able to come in
here and change this to whatever you
want it to be make sure we get rid of
text size and then I'm gonna come in and
do padding and just have this be five DP
something like that and then text size
this time I want to use and let's just
make this 16 SP all right there we go
now I'm just gonna copy this whole
entire thing come over here to the
layout folder click on that go new XML
layout XML call this fragment contact
info there we go
that's generated come down here click on
the text tab just select all this paste
that in there and then this guy is going
to be contact info fragment and of
course I have a link in the description
with all the code change you can see
here and that's all I'm gonna do for
that so let's just select it copy it and
then let's create our last fragment
layout come over here right new XML
layout XML and let's call this one
fragment my company and then click
finish
text tabs like tall paste and then for
the text part for this let's just make
it my company fragment there we go so we
have our layout files for our fragments
now let's go and create our fragments so
come over here click on this guy new
Java class I'm gonna call this about me
fragment okay let's go extends fragment
and then pick the support version for
there we go can you go a public static
about me fragment new instance about me
fragment so we're gonna be able to
generate these fragments do about me
fragment and then return fragment and
that's how like I said we're going to be
able to generate and return a fragment
we can create a default constructor here
as well come in here and we're gonna
have to go in to generate and on create
view override methods and there is on
create view generated that for me let me
come in here and delete that generate a
view route view is equal to inflator is
going to be used to inflate our fragment
layout
show it on the screen and that is
fragment and this is about me so there
we go
pass in a container that was passed here
so that's a view group that we were
going to inflate into and then false and
then return this route view that we just
created and then of course fell inflate
it right there we go and then we want to
also generate on attach which is gonna
be called whenever the fragments gonna
be associated with our main activity so
all right methods and then come down
here to on attached and that's generated
what we're gonna do here is this is
going to allow us to call over into main
activity and make sure that the action
bar title matches whatever the item was
selected inside of our navigation drawer
so how we're gonna do that is we're
gonna call main activity activity and
then call on section attached and you're
gonna see here in a second and we're
going to have this be the very first one
as this is about me and this is the
first thing in the navigation bar and
like I said and one second I'm going to
show you exactly what on section
attached does we're gonna pass over one
in this situation and then for the other
ones two and three and like I said this
is all just so that we will be able to
go in and whatever then the item is
selected on the navigation drawer it's
gonna change the title at the top of the
screen in the action bar so this is all
done about me fragment Java save that
copy this back over inside here we're
gonna create ourselves another fragment
of course Java class this one's gonna be
called contact info fragment generate
that it's like dal paste there's all the
new stuff changes to two because that's
the second item in our navigation drawer
and then up here or the fragment part
there and this is contact info so I
select that item right there and then
we're also gonna have to come in and go
contact info fragment everywhere we
change this name just like this paste
that in their face that in their face
that there paste that there and
everything else looks good like I said
make sure you change this or the title
won't change the top this green save
that select all copy come over here
create our last fragment new Java class
call this my company fragment select all
paste change this into three changes to
my company fragment
any fragment my company fragment my
company fragment change this also come
down here change after my company and
everything else is the same so there we
go got all our fragments set up we can
go ahead and close all these not kind of
need to do anything with fragment man
close that and right here you can see on
section attached I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna automatically go and change
all these then I'm going to open up my
strings dot XML file in values and right
here is where we're gonna be able to
change what goes in the navigation bar I
have this be about me and also the title
whenever it's selected contact
information and then also change this to
and of course you can put as many of
these in here and you're not stuck with
just three and there you go strings out
XML is all done get rid of that we'll go
over into main activity and this stuff
all looks really convoluted and crazy
thankfully you don't have to pay much
attention to any of it right here is the
method that you were gonna be able to
use to change the fragment automatically
whenever the navigation drawer item is
clicked on this is really where
everything goes on and make it work for
all of the different fragments you have
here what we're gonna do is go if
position which is going to be the item
that was clicked on is equal to zero and
then we're gonna come in here and grab
this guy right here just change a couple
things and it'll be easy to use so paste
that inside of there all of this stuff's
gonna stay the same except right after
this we're gonna get rid of this guy and
change this to about me fragment which
is the fragment you want to open
whenever that first item is clicked on
and then just come in here to this and
get rid of that altogether and
everything else about that's perfect
then we're gonna come in here might as
well just copy this whole entire thing
copy
I'm gonna go else paste in if change
this position right here to one and then
come down here and define the fragment
you want to open up in that situation so
we're gonna say a contact info fragment
it's all we need to do very very simple
and then we'll copy this again come down
here else if change this to two in this
situation is going to open up the
mycompany fragment just that easily
we have everything else exactly the same
all of this is exactly the same just
make sure that you have the title
selection honed in to what you have in
your strings.xml file which I already
covered this guy right here
if you want to know is actually where
we're going to be able to come in and
change the title of the page the current
fragments title so that handles that for
us and if we save that and then we open
up the navigation drawer fragment we
just want to come in here and we don't
really have to do anything but we just
want to verify that we point to these
strings that XML representation for all
the items in our navigation drawer and
we can just cycle right down through
here until we get right here and then
for these guys we can just click on them
that's all no one's clicking with my
mouse and it's automatically throwing
them in there and there you go guys
that is how hard it is or how easy it is
to go and use the navigation drawer to
open up any one of numerous different
fragments the only thing I could think
you would have a question about is how
to use fragments and of course I have
tutorials on fragments and I'll put a
link in the description under the video
if you have any other questions so
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
