my c-sharp video tutorial and this start
of the tutorial what we're going to
focus on our c-sharp collection such as
array lists dictionaries queues and
stacks like always all the code as well
as a transcript and cheat sheet for this
entire video is available in the
description underneath the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so here we are and I'm going to
import a couple libraries here this
first one the collections library is
going to allow us to use a raid list and
then this guy down here is going to
allow us to use dictionaries so let's
come in here and basically I'm also
going to cover something else called
region one of you guys brought it up and
the cool thing about it is it allows us
to collapse our code and you just type
in region and then if you want to have
some type of information inside of here
like ArrayList code you can do that like
this and then you can come in and type
in end region and then what you'll be
able to do whenever I put some code
inside of there as you'll be able to see
that we can collapse it and it's just a
nice neat way for us to be able to keep
our code manageable whenever it is
longer and lists and what we're going to
do now is talk about array lists which
are just resizable arrays that can hold
multiple different data types and how
you create one is you go over a list and
then I'm just going to call this a list
is equal to new array list and close
that off and there we are you just
created an array list and we can see
here how region works now we can just
click on that and see how it shrinks say
pretty useful stuff and if you want to
come in and be able to add information
to an array list you just go add and we
can put Bob inside of here just to put
something and let's go and add in some
more things let's say we want to put the
number 40 perfectly fun you can do that
with an ArrayList and as you can see it
just automatically resizes now if you
want to see the number of items inside
of your ArrayList you come in here and
you could do something like counts and
you can go and put in our call counts on
the ArrayList and it's going to
automatically tell you how many items of
the
inside of there and of course you want
to make sure you put a little dot inside
of there you're also going to be able
whoops don't need those parentheses
there forgot that for a second another
thing we're going to be able to do is
check the capacity now the capacity is
going to automatically increase each
time an item is added so we can come in
here and it increases by two each time
you add a new item so we'll change this
to capacity just and see how that works
and then change this to capacity and
then we're going to create another
ArrayList so ray list and let's call
this a list too and then we're going to
be doing things like joining these array
lists and so forth and so on so another
thing you can do is you can add an
object array which is going to allow us
to come in and add multiple different
values all at one time so we can come in
and go at range and then new objects
array like that and then your curly
brackets and then the items you want to
put inside of there so let's say we want
to have Mike and Sally and egg because
that makes sense a hand here we go and
that is how we can add a whole bunch of
these different values all at one time
and just make sure you close off the
curly bracket and there it is now that
we have two arrays set up let's say we
want to add one array list to another
what we can do is just go pretty much
the same thing we're going to use add
range again and we can go a list two to
this guy and now we added those two
array lists together and you're going to
be able to sort an array if it contains
the same data type there is a way around
it if it's different data types but you
have to do some pretty funky stuff and
I'm not going to get into that right at
this moment you're also going to be able
to come in here and reverse the items
inside of there after you go and sort
them also going to be able to come in
and insert data at a specific position
so let's say that you wanted to add a
new string inside of here at the second
place in your array list which is going
to be the first index of course or the
number one index you just type where you
want it to go
and what you want inside of there and it
will automatically place it in there and
make some different space available for
you of course and come in here and say
call this guy range and what I want to
do with this is create an annuity that
is going to be made up of the first two
items of another range so we can go and
list two and get range and we're going
to start off at the zero index and then
get two items after that probably makes
sense here to also cover how to cycle
through an array list so that we can see
some of the output for what we've been
doing you can go for each and then this
is going to be treated as an object and
I'm just going to call it o and we can
try range here and then to output that
information of course is quite simple
just like this and let's say that we
want o to get printed out on each of the
lines and then we can run this and see
what it looks like with all the
different changes we've made here and
there you can see we have counts and
capacity which is to larger than counts
and then it wouldn't print it out Sally
and Turkey and likewise we could do this
for the other different items
let's also come in here and do a list a
list too and run that just to see how
that changed and you can see here print
it off Sally turkey Mike and egg okay so
good stuff really canned of course do a
whole bunch of other different things
with array list we're also going to be
able to remove an item and we can
specify which specific index we want to
remove so we just go remove apps and say
we want to remove the first item that's
how that's done we're also going to be
able to remove the first two items or
whatever you want to do you're just
going to say where you want to start at
and where you want to end removing items
so we can go remove range and let's say
we want to remove the first two items
that's how we do it I'm going to get rid
of those just so it doesn't cause any
problems because now I'm going to do
some searches let's say I want to search
for a match starting at a provided index
we can do so console.writeline and we
can come in you know and change the
indexes increment them and so forth and
so on until we find all the different
results
or whatever you want to do here to do
that we're just going to jump in and
we'll say a list - and we'll go index
all and then what we're looking for and
I'm looking for Turkey and I'm going to
start searching at the very beginning of
the string just by putting that index
inside of the Heron can do that we're
also going to be able to come in and
convert an array list into a string
array so just like this and my array and
convert this into a string array and
we'll use a list - and you call - array
on it and we'll say type of and you have
to type in string inside of there
because that's what we're working with
and I forgot the equal sign so let's
throw that inside of there so that's how
to convert a ray list into a regular old
array likewise you're going to be able
to convert a string array into an array
list so let's go and create one so let's
throw that inside of there and let's
just call this customers and I'm sure
you remember how to create an array
let's just go Bob and Sally and Sue so
there we are we create an array and we
want to convert it into an array list
first you have to create your array list
I'm going to call this customer array
list is equal to spell that correct is
equal to new array list and then you
close that off and then after that we
can just go customer array list and of
course we're going to use add range and
we'll say what we want to add and there
is our array we want to add to it and of
course we can come in again and say
something like for each and we're going
to be dealing with a string here and
let's just call it s in and we'll use
customer array list and it will all put
that information on the screen the point
in doing this will just copy this and
come in here and paste it inside of
there and change this to
all right and we run it and there you
can see it printed out Bob Sallie and
Sue okay so there's an overview of all
the different things you can do with
ArrayList and the usefulness of this
custom collection and now we're going to
take a look at dictionaries now
dictionaries are going to store key
value pairs and to create them you're
going to define the data type for the
key as well as the value that's going to
be in stored inside of it so I'm going
to create a dictionary and I need to
define what the datatype for the key is
and what the data type is for the value
and I'm going to call this superheroes
and then we go new and then you're going
to say dictionary once again and string
string and then close this off with
parentheses and there you go you just
created a dictionary now if I want to
add items to it of course you're just
going to use add again a using the same
type of format here and we're going to
have the key or just have the key you
can have spaces for your keys and then
you'll have the value afterwards so I'll
say Superman let's go in here and add a
couple more so one and two and then for
the next one we can have Bruce Wayne and
I think you might know who he is and
then we'll go in put Barry West and
don't know if you know who that is
but if you didn't that's the flash okay
so there we are we created our
dictionary now we can remove a key value
pair quite easily just come in here and
go superheroes and guess what you're
going to use remove again and you're
going to type in whatever the key is for
it so I'm going to say very West and
there you go Barry West is gone you're
going to be able to get the number of
keys inside of here and see if I have
nope don't have that saved here by
calling count once again so we can say
counts and then go and get the count for
our superheroes and that's just going to
be superheroes
and count of course we're going to be
able to come in here and also check if a
key is present paste that inside of
there so
do something like Clark Kents and then
check for the presence of that and to do
that we're going to get rid of counts
and replace it with contains key so
pretty easy to remember these names and
then we'll just type in Clark Kent's
when I go in here and do a couple more
of these of course I'm gonna have to put
closing parentheses right there we can
get the value for the key and store it
in a string so we can say something like
superheroes and try get value and what
we're trying to do is try to get Clark
Kent and we want to store it in a string
and to do that you type in out and
string and then whatever you want the
name of the string to be and there it is
if both creates it and stores a value
inside of it all in the same place and
likewise we can come in here and let's
get rid of that type in Clark Kent and
let's get rid of all this stuff and
instead type in tests right there and
close that off of quotes and of course
we're going to be able to cycle through
our key value pairs using for each just
like we did before here what you're
going to do is type in key value pair
and then define what the data types are
for both the key as well as the value
item in superheroes and then we can
output some information for each one of
those guys so let's just go like this
and change that to O or change out the
one and change that or change into zero
change that by one and then to actually
get the item out of there so I named
this item we're just going to come in
and type in item and key and then the
next one is going to be item and value
and we can run that and you could say
that it had two items in it that's after
we got rid of flash you can see we did a
search for Clark Kent as a key and came
back as true and then we printed out the
Clark Kent and Superman and then we
print it out both the key and the values
okay so there's dictionaries up guess I
forgot one more thing you could also
come in here and go superheroes and
clear and that is going to clear out and
delete every item in
to your dictionary alright so there's a
rundown of what we can do with
dictionaries in c-sharp and now we're
going to take a look at Qs now IQ is
what we call a first-in first-out
collection and i'm going to show you
exactly what that looks like so we'll
create a queue here first
and I'm just going to call it Q is equal
to new and Q feel satisfying to type
outcue for some weird reason if you want
to add items into your queue you just
use you would think add but know it's in
queue
don't know why they did that and I'm
going to just put a bunch of numbers
inside of here so that you can see how
they're different and how the
information gets pulled out of here and
then we go for each and objects Oh in
queue and then we're going to print out
each of the queues so you can see how
they are pulled out of the queue
whenever you call for it that is and
let's go and do something like queue
inside of here and let's do a string
interpolation and we will throw outside
of there and we can run that and you're
going to see that they come out in
exactly the order in which they were put
in okay so pretty easy first-in
first-out
that's a queue now let's do a couple
other different things here with our
queues just check out what's going on
here and we can come up here let's say
we want to check if an item is inside of
a queue of course we're going to be able
to do that as well so we can just come
in and say is one in a queue and how we
get the answer to that age-old question
is by calling a function called contains
and then what specifically you're
looking for inside of the queue we're
also going to be able to remove let's
say the first item from a queue just
copy this paste that down there and
we'll call this remove one and it's
actually going to return the value that
was removed from it and you've used DQ
instead of in queue in this situation
but you're going to be able to what it's
doing here is it's actually removing
what spelled DQ the correct way DQ it's
actually removing the first item it's
going to return it to you but
there's no way of return of deleting a
specific index or whatever now let's run
that just to see those two different
things so is one in the queue true and
remove one it returns the value that is
at the very beginning of the queue okay
you're also going to be able to come in
there and look at the first item in the
queue but not remove it and use peak for
that so we'll just call that peak one
it's actually going to be peak too but
whatever the two is going to be what's
returned and you're just going to type
in peak once again get rid of that and
we'll do a couple more here before we go
and run it you're also going to be able
to copy a queue to an array so this is
going to be an object array just like we
did previously with the other
collections I'm going to call this num
array is equal to and call queue and
then you call to array just like we did
with our ArrayList previously let's go
and also print out our array so feel
like this and let's just get rid of all
this stuff right here and we're going to
use string and join and let's say we
want everything to be separated by a
comma and a space we can do that and
what we want to print out here is our
number of right close out of that
parentheses and we can do that and is
there anything else I want to do well of
course you're going to be able to come
in and clear your queue just by calling
clear on it right like that but we're
not going to do that instead we are
going to come in here and we're going to
run it and see what all those other
functions did and there you can see we
printed those items out you can see here
we remove the one here we just peeked at
the tube didn't remove it as you can see
right there to print it out whenever we
printed out that array and here we cycle
through and print it out all the items
in our queue okay so pretty useful stuff
and now we're going to take a look at
stacks now a stack is kind of similar to
a queue except it what is how it works
is it's a last in first out collection
and you'll see what that looks like so
I'm going to come in and create a stack
like this and I'm just going to call it
stack just so it's nice and easy to
remember and stack
we're going to be using stacks down here
whenever we are cycling through this
information and let's call this stack as
well so we'll be able to use the for
each once again to cycle through just
like you do with all the other
collections and to push or to put items
on to our stack we push them on like
that by calling the push function and
let's go and add in two more of these so
we'll also add in two and we'll also add
in three so there we are we push three
items on there then let's run it and
you're going to see how they come off
see in the opposite order like I said
last in first out that is the way a
stack works completely the opposite of a
queue now you're going to be able to use
peak on our stack just like we did with
our queue so let's say we wanted to peak
one we could do so and let's change that
zero and get rid of this and then we
will call peak on this and of course to
do so you go stack and you go peak and
that will return that item for us we're
also of course going to be able to
remove items except what we're going to
do in this situation is we're going to
call a function called pop so let's just
change this to pop pop one change that
to zero and of course to get that to
work you just go stack and pop like that
and that's going to remove an item not
just peek at it likewise we're going to
be able to check if an item exists or
not
and let's just copy this guy right here
and paste that inside of there so
whether a stack is going to contain an
item or not we can come in and do
something like does it contain one and
we can find out which spot coming in
there and calling contains and
specifically what we're looking for
we're going to be able to copy a stack
tool and object array just like we did
previously so I'm going to call this num
array two is equal to and then what we
want to copy from and then to a rack
just like we did with the other
collections so after you do this for a
little bit you start to remember them
because they use for the most part the
same type functions to be in here
let's say we want to print this array
out we can do so of course so we're just
going to call the string again and the
join function and we want everything to
be separated by a comma as well as a
space and then what we specifically want
to print out is going to be number a
right to make sure that's closed off and
is there anything else that one cover
well of course you're going to be able
to come in and go stack and clear and
that's going to clear the stack but you
know that already and when we're going
to run this now and see what our output
is here you can see it was able to come
in there and peek at the 3 and then pop
the 3 then you can see the 3 doesn't
show up in the output and here you can
see that it comes back as true as one
existed and there you can see that we
were able to print out all of the items
in our stack there you go guys that is a
lot of information about collections and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below the last till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
