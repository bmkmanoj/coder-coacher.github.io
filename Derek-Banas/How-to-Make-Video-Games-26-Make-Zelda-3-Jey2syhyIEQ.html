26 of my how to make video games
tutorial series today we're gonna
continue making a Legend of Zelda clone
and today I'm gonna come in and create
our link animations as well as cover how
to move link how to create a game board
array and a sound manager like always
all the code is available in the
description underneath the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so we are back inside of unity
once again very first thing I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take this link empty right
here make sure it is set for 0 0 in both
of those situations and then I'm gonna
come in here and I'm gonna pick my idol
sprites afford link I probably should
have went and made him blink or whatever
but I'm what I'm gonna do here is I'm
just going to have him sort of like step
like he's anxious like he wants to get
moving and I'm just gonna use that as my
idol sprite cuz that works fine so I'm
just gonna drag that over here and just
drop it pretty much anywhere whenever I
do that this is going to open up I'm
gonna make sure that I am in the
animations folder so open that up and
everything here is gonna work exactly
the same on Windows as well as Macintosh
so and I'm gonna name that Idol and it's
any animations folder of course and then
I'm gonna click on save now what I'm
gonna do with this guy is I'm gonna drag
him up here
inside of the link empty and then I'm
going to rename this link I'm then gonna
come over and I'm gonna make sure that
it is in the link sorting layer so that
it shows up on top and you'll be able to
see it see it's right there and then I
want to position it and where do I want
to position it I think I want to
position him in the 1:1 location so he's
way down here let me just zoom in on
this you can see exactly what's going on
with him and then what I'm gonna do is I
am going since I have that selected I'm
actually going to be able to change how
this the speed of this and then later on
be able to switch between animations so
there is idle and if we go and we play
the scene you're going to see that link
is going to move very very quickly see
he's really really jerky and I don't
like that so I'm gonna stop that and
then I'm gonna come over here to the
animator select idle and I'm gonna drop
it down to something in the area of
point 2 I think that will look a lot
better I don't leave everything else set
exact
as it is then I'm gonna jump back over
into my scene and I'm gonna select my
link character once again and I'm going
to need a rigidbody set on link so that
I'll be able to move them around so I'm
gonna go add component physics 2d and
rigidbody 2d I'm gonna set select
gravity so that he is not in any way
affected by gravity I'm going to have
collision detection it's set to
continuous and I want to also come in
here and constrain rotation on the z
axis I don't want him spinning around
and I also want to take the mass and
lower it to a very small amount so once
again I'm basically moving like he's not
moving on his own and if we jump over
into animations we're going to see all
of these guys and let's just change the
name of this to link now what this is is
the controller and this is an animation
so link is the controller the controller
is what you see here that's what's going
on here
and then this is the specific idle
animation so we're going to of course
want to have other animations so we're
gonna create some more so I'm going to
go into sprites and then I'm gonna come
down here to 53 54 and 55 and these are
going to be the animations for whenever
a link is walking downwards on our game
board so I'm going to drag them over
here drop them in here and I'm gonna
call this once again make sure it goes
into the animations folder and I'm going
to come over and give it a name that's
gonna make sense for it
and that name is going to be walk down
and save it and I really don't need to
do anything else with it you're gonna
see that it's in here we can get rid of
this controller so let's delete that yes
delete it and there's the walk down
animation so let's go and delete this
all together and then once again if I
want to add that capability to walk down
for my link I'm going to go and get
walked down and drag it over inside of
here and put it right inside of there
now what I need to do is I want to
define situations in which we go from
idle to walk down to do that I'm gonna
have to define that in the parameter
section I have to create a new parameter
oops before I do that though so I don't
forget I'm also going to click on walk
down and change the speed to point
don't want to forget that anytime
something comes into your mind you might
as well just do it immediately otherwise
you may forget and everything else there
I do not need to mess around with
alright so we were in back inside of the
animator once again and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to define an integer
and it is going to be move direction and
what I'm going to have it set up for is
that zero is going to be for idle down
is going to be for left is going to be 1
3 is going to be for movement to the
right and 2 is going to be a movement
upwards but I'm also going to be able to
make these changes inside of the code as
you're gonna see here in a moment so we
have moved direction and I'm just gonna
leave that set for 0 right now that's
the default value and then I'm gonna
come in and I'm going to define what
happens I'm gonna make transitions or
we're gonna define when we go from the
idle States to the walk down state and
what I'm gonna say here is we're gonna
move from idle to walk down whenever and
we'll have to come in here and select
this arrow right here and then come down
to list the conditions so we're gonna
switch from idle to walk down whatever
the move Direction inside of my script
is going to equal to 4 and then I'm
gonna come in here and create a
transition where we move from walk down
back to idle select that right there and
we're gonna say that we are going to
switch back whenever move direction
changes to 0 and that's how easy it is
to define how we're gonna switch back
and forth between those two different
completely different animations I'm also
going to come in here and make a couple
more of these
so let's switch back over into our scene
and I want to define how we're going to
animate link if he is walking to the
right and that is gonna be 51 and 52 so
select both of them you can see his
foots coming out there so let's just
drag it drop it inside of there and
we're gonna call this walk right and
rather than having a walk right walk
left I'm actually going to in the code
change these so that I can use the same
animation for both so walk right it's
gonna be saved once again in animations
don't forget to do that so I'm gonna
click on save and then we can delete
this once again go in
to the animation section delete this
once again yes I want it deleted
animator come over here and get the wok
right and drag it inside of there so
there that is
now we're gonna define how we are going
to switch between idle and walk rights
and walk right remember I said is going
to be whenever we go from this is three
move directions gonna be equal to three
so equal two and three and then I'm
gonna create another make the transition
from walk right to idle and we're gonna
select that arrow make sure you select
that era and then we're gonna come in
here and say whenever this is gonna be
equal to zero so pretty simple stuff now
we're also gonna need to do an animation
for walk upwards and where is that
that's gonna be 56 57 58 so 56 57 58 56
57 58 grab those whoops I should have
switched over seen now I'm in seen drag
it over here drop it inside of there and
then this is going to be walk upwards so
or walk up simply so walk up is the name
of that and let's change it to any
animations and all that's fun and click
on save
once again delete this and come into the
animation section delete this and then
we're going to go and just get the walk
up drag it into the animator and let's
move this over a little bit and we can
drag that down here and then get walk up
and drag it right inside of there and
we're going to say that we're going to
transition from walk up to idle whenever
the move Direction value is set to zero
and then we're gonna switch back from
idle to walk up is it this one right
here yes whenever it is equal to two so
just like this and equals and change
this to two alright and like I said I'm
also gonna show you how to do this
switching inside of the code which is
actually a little bit what I prefer to
do anyway so that's all good and now
that I have all of links animation setup
what I'm going to do is go in here and
create our game board and our game board
array that is going to represent
and our entire game to do that what
we're gonna do I don't have game board
on here yet man so what you can go
create empty and I'm gonna call this
game board
Sophia Arg there it is
and game board is basically just going
to be a script that's what its gonna be
used for and it's gonna have a bunch of
utility functions inside of it but I'm
gonna switch these to 0 nonetheless so
we have that selected then I'm gonna
create a script for my game board so she
sharp scripts and call it game board and
now I'm gonna open that okay and if
you're on Windows you're probably using
Visual Studio and if you're on Mac OS
you're going to be using monodevelop but
everything's the same all right so I
know that I'm going to need to round
some values here so I'm gonna have to go
and get my system library imported into
this and that's what that's for now I
got to think about what I'm gonna do now
the main purpose of the game board is
going to be to hold an array that is
going to have all of my game objects
inside of it so I know where I can move
and I know how I can interact with
things on the screen as those things
change but I'm also gonna have some
other utility functions as well now
another thing I want to do here is I
just thought of something that I wanted
to do eventually but I don't want to
cover right now so basically I am going
to have bushes let's switch over into
unity okay so here's my game board now
basically I am going to have my Hills
which of course links not gonna be able
to walk on I'm gonna have these bushes
whenever the bush is knocked down
there's gonna be a stump underneath of
it there's a house there's rocks
boomerangs bow and arrows there are
bombs all sorts of things to interact
with on the screen so I basically want
to go and put those things inside of an
array so that I can't interact with them
and also know where link is at all times
inside of my game okay so here I am back
inside of the game board script so what
I want to do is something that I want to
remember to do I'm gonna put to do
inside here and say remember to change
under rock to stairs after a rock is
moved and another thing that I want to
remember is that I want to change to Jim
and
and stump after the bush is moved and
also to do do the same for boomerang
bombs and bow and the vase and also just
think about the types of objects that I
am going to need here so I'm gonna have
Hills and I'm gonna have trees bushes
the house and the boomerang and bombs
good to list everything out here so I
don't forget anything the stone the bow
the vase and gems and stairs and doors
and chests I think that's everything
that I need
alright and where am I gonna store all
these things well I'm gonna store them
inside of an array and I want to make
this public so everybody else can access
it to the other scripts can access it so
let's go there and I'm gonna call this
game objects and this is a new string
and it's going to be 26 by 19 to
accommodate all of the space required on
my screen since I started in the lower
left-hand corner I don't think at this
time I need to do anything else now we
get into the start function what I'm
gonna do here is whenever the game
starts I'm going to load all of these
assets into this array that I created
but I'm gonna have to create a function
to sort of streamline that process so
I've used this function previously and
this is just the way that I like to load
arrays so what I'm going to do here is
this function is going to add game
object names to our array using rows so
that I can sort of fill in from left to
right a gigantic row all at once which
is gonna save a lot of time so I'm gonna
call this add Y row X range and what its
gonna do is it's going to receive an
integer that is going to be the Y row
that I'm going to be filling in and then
it's also going to reduce
leave the starting exposition I want to
start filling in at and the ending
exposition and then also I'm going to
have a string and I'm just gonna have
the game object name in that string okay
this is very very simple
all this is going to do it's a for loop
and it's gonna cycle through all of the
assets so it's gonna start here at the
starting position and then it's gonna go
through the whole way here and then I
have to increment I of course and then
I'm just gonna go get my game objects
array so game objects and then go I and
the changing value of our row and then
assign it with the string that was
passed inside of it so very very very
simple now what I'm gonna do is do the
same thing for everything's on the with
the same X and changing values of Y so
I'm gonna go add X and X in this
situation it's gonna be columns not rows
and then this is gonna be changed to Y
range and then I could change this to X
column so X column and this will be Y
start and y ends and then we just need
to change these so this is going to be Y
start and y end and then this guy is
going to be changed to X column and this
is going to be changed to the changing
values of I all right so good stuff
another thing I want to do before I
start doing anything else is I want to
verify that a space is a valid space for
link to be able to move into so I'm
gonna go this is gonna return true or
false so I'm going to say is valid space
and it's going to receive a float
for the exposition and the Y position
and then we're also going to get our
horizontal move and our our vertical
move which are going to be values that
we create whenever we create our link
script and I may or not may not need
this I don't know
so what I'm gonna do this is basically
just gonna make sure that link is not
gonna be able to go through a zero zero
position I'm doing this just just to
test out whenever I first I'm starting
with a basic sort of moving link around
but I'm then gonna get rid of it so
that's what it's gonna do so horizontal
move and Y move so this is just going to
be the position of link in our game
board
okay that's what I'm testing here and
I'm saying if either these are less than
zero
I want to increment the value by one all
right so this is something I'm putting
in here that I plan on getting rid of
then I'm going to go X is equal to and
we have to use floats because that is
what vectors work with and this is the
floor function I'm going to convert this
I have to convert it to it from a double
and from a float into a double and then
back into a float again that's what's
going on with that like I said this is
something that's gonna be in here
temporarily and I will then delete it
it's just basically a protects my link
from falling off the screen whenever I'm
just testing the very beginnings of my
animations and then this is actually
going to be my check to see if I can
actually move into a position in our
array with link so I'm going to say if
game objects and I'm going to convert
the float into an int that's gonna be X
and then I'm gonna go once again int and
Y and if I don't put something inside of
our array that means it's gonna have a
value of null so I'm gonna if there's
nothing there then that means yes I can
move in there and otherwise it's not
equal to null that means there's
something there and in that situation
I'm gonna say that I cannot move in that
direction okay
so I got all that set now what I need to
do is use these two functions here to
fill in all my game objects
inside of my right okay so what am I
doing here well let's go this is inside
of unity of course I'm gonna come in
here and I'm gonna start here and you
can see if I select this first one the
position is X 0 y 0 and let's say I want
to add all these hills across the entire
bottom all at one time
well the value of x changed but why did
not change so what I'm gonna be able to
do is I'm gonna say 4 on anything that
has a y-value of 0 inside of our array I
want to I want to go and mark it as hill
4 0 through 25 of X okay that's what
that function is gonna do for me and
what that looks like I'm gonna do this
once again Sue's the game starts is I'm
gonna go add Y row and X range and then
what I'm going to put inside of it is
I'm going I'm gonna start with values of
y equal to 0 and then I'm gonna start
with a minimum value of X maximum value
of x and then what I want to put inside
of it is the hill whoops
put that outside of there all right so
it's just gonna be a string right and
I'm gonna do this for all of the other
different guys inside of here likewise
let's go back to unity let's say I want
to come in here and I want to fill in
all of the this side this whole entire
side right here well if I select this
you can see zero zeros once again come
up here and select this guy up here
you're gonna see that it's 0 through 18
so what I want to do is I want to go
through and use a constant value of 0
for x and y from 0 to 18 back inside
here and what that's gonna look like is
it's gonna be add X column Y range like
that and then it's gonna be 0 0 18 and
once again these are hills okay so you
don't have to watch every single one of
these I am going to go and copy and
paste all of the men now and there you
can see I placed all of them inside of
there so not only did I do it for the
trees but I also went and did it for the
bushes as well as the house and then
right here at the very bottom since I
only had one boomerang one bomb one
stone one bow one door I went and just
placed those individually inside of
there without the function and that is
all that I need to do
for our game board and now I'm gonna
jump back in a unity and then we will
create our script for link all right so
let's go inside of here and let's close
this down and here is a link inside of
here so we're gonna select link I'm
gonna create a script c-sharp and let's
call this link because that makes sense
make sure link has attached the script
which he does not subscribe this guy
right here and let's grab it and drop it
inside of there I'm gonna have to move
this up grab link wrap him inside of
here there he goes
now he has a script attached to him and
now let's open that script alright so
here is my link script once again I'm
probably gonna want to use rounds so I'm
gonna go using system and then I have to
think about all of the things that I
want to be able to track with the link
so let's open this up so one thing that
I know that I want to change or be able
to change or work with here is link
speed so I'm gonna get that inside of
there I am then going to also need
access to the rigidbody so that I can
move link around but I don't want any
other scripts to be able to move him
around at least I don't think so so I'm
gonna have that I am then going to need
access to the is valid space and game
board in our game board script so to get
that I go game board and game board
so our got that awesome and what else
are we gonna need well I want to get a
reference to our sound manager so sound
manager and sound manager err so there
that is and sound manager doesn't exist
right now let's go create it there we
are and create empty and let's just call
this sound manager sound manager and
let's select the sound manager and what
we're gonna do to it is we're gonna go
add components and audio and audio
source and then later on we will go in
here and change some other different
things so that's all we need for the
sound manager at this time we're gonna
save that now let's go in scripts also
and create a sound manager script just
for the heck of it so sound man
juror and their that is also and we can
open that up and there's the sound
manager we'll get back to that a second
okay so now we don't have an error there
we don't like having errors or at least
I don't
well then I'm gonna be changing the
animation for link so I'm gonna need
access to an animator that is tied to
link and we already have that set up and
I think that is everything so now what I
want to do is I'm going to load a whole
bunch of things as soon as the script
starts up and make sure that they are
loaded otherwise I will get errors and
you do that in a function called awake
so something that I want to do is I want
to get access to the rigidbody so that I
can work with link and to do that you go
get components and then rigidbody two
and then just put the parentheses and
there we are
whoops get rid of that parentheses and
there that is another thing I'm gonna in
one access to of course is our game
board and to get that I can just say
find object of type and type of and it's
going to be game board and then go as
game board and there we go now I can get
the game board and that's how we can get
objects that are inside of our hierarchy
we're also going to want to come in and
get access to the sound manager so we'll
just go and go game object and so this
is a bunch of different ways to find
things so we're gonna find a game object
that is named sound manager and then if
we do we want to get the component sound
manager okay some pretty cool stuff to
be able to access and grab all these
different things and use them inside of
our scripts something else I'm gonna
need
well the animator so we'll get our
animator and to get it we just go get
components and animator and these are
really easy to get the animator and the
rigidbody because they're already
attached to link which the script is
also attached to link okay so that's all
we're gonna need to do there what else
are we gonna need well I just thought of
something we're also going to need let's
put it up here we're also going to be
changing the animation
whenever link is facing right and as
well as left so I'm gonna have a bull
called facing right and let's make that
false and I might be able to do this
with just one of these but I'm just
writing this out of my head so right now
I'm gonna use two of them and then I'll
probably change that later on another
thing I want to do is I want to create
fixed update and in fixed update that is
where we are going to do all of our
animations of link so fixed update
create that and what I want to do is I
want to get the keyboard input
horizontal move is gonna be equal to and
input and this is going to get me
anything any time the user clicks on a
or D this is going to tell me that which
one they clicked on and then I will be
able to take that information and then
move link accordingly on our screen and
where you can find that at if you come
into unity you can go into edit and
project settings and input and open that
up and axes and here's a horizontal and
you can see right here it's gonna get
the left and right arrow keys as well as
an D and then if you look in vertical
it's going to get the down and up arrow
keys as well as S&amp;amp;W okay so that's where
that information is coming from back
inside of our script we're also going to
come in here and this is going to be
vertical move and this is gonna be a
vertical vertical alright so there we
got our information about what keys
they're pressing and how we should move
I'm gonna say if game board is valid
space and
and I have to convert this to a float
and transform any kind I call transform
position that is links position and
Forex and then I'm gonna add horizontal
move to it which is going to represent
we're on in the X area link is trying to
move to and then I'm gonna do the same
thing for y so let's just copy that come
down here paste that in so there that is
and let's change this to Y and change
this to vertical move okay so that's
just verifying that we will be able to
move the way that we say we want to
another thing that we are doing here is
I'm going to also pass inside horizontal
move as well as vertical move and this
is that function that is over inside of
our game board okay if you want to see
what I'm talking about
it is this guy down here where is it see
is valid space so I'm getting all of
that information and like I said I'm
probably gonna get rid of this the
horizontal move and vertical move but
whatever I'm not gonna get I'm gonna
keep it for now let's save that by the
way open this up let's save that also
alright so if it is a valid place for us
to move I'm gonna call the rigidbody
and I'm gonna say a velocity is gonna be
equal to new and then I pass inside of
it a vector two and that's gonna be
horizontal move x speed and vertical
move x speed and that is going to move
my link around on the screen based off
of X's and Y's and speed of course is
gonna tell me how fast to change those
things and otherwise if it isn't a valid
space I'm gonna say else and I'm going
to just change my velocity to zero
someone say new vector2
which is basically gonna stop link from
moving
pause him from moving anyway okay so we
got that set now what I want to do is
I'm gonna change my animations based off
of what keys on the keyboard are being
pressed so I'm gonna say if input dot
get key is equal to ass well in that
situation what I want to do is I want to
play the walk down animation walk down
then I'm likewise gonna do the same sort
of thing for all of the other directions
paste that in there here I'm gonna say W
and that's going to be the walk up
animation and it'll do the same thing
here this is going to be D now this is
gonna be a little bit tricky because I'm
using the same animation for moving left
as well as right so I'm gonna change
this to walk right but then I have to
figure out it that's the walk right
animation but then I have to decide if
I'm moving right which I am with D or
I'm moving left so just to keep this
nice and something I'm gonna say if I am
facing left flipped over there then I'm
gonna say facing right is gonna be equal
to true and facing left is now gonna be
equal to false and another thing I want
to do if I want to switch the animation
so that it's flipped in a different
direction
I'm gonna go animator transform rotate
and this is gonna be 0 180 and 0 so
another thing I might change but for now
I'm just trying to make everything work
and then I will optimize everything
later on so then if I'm not facing left
in that situation I am just going to
change facing right is gonna be equal to
true ok so I think that looks pretty
good now I'm gonna do pretty much the
opposite for when we want to move to the
left
someone pasted this inside of here I'm
gonna change this to a that is moving to
the left I'm still gonna play the walk
right animation except down here I'm
gonna say if facing right I'm going to
say facing right is going to be equal to
false and I'm gonna say that facing left
now is gonna be equal to true animate or
transform rotates still gonna be exactly
the same and then I'm gonna say elsif
facing right and then I'm gonna say
facing left is now going to be true ok
so we save all that and what else do we
need
I'm going to also let's just copy this
guy right here I want to set up just a
quick fix for switching back to the idle
position if keys are released so I'm
gonna say if I want to find out if a key
has been released upwards I go get key
up and I'm just gonna use s it doesn't
really matter in that situation I'm
gonna play my idle animation again so we
got that set and another thing that I'm
again I am going to do inside of here
just to make sure that we don't have any
issues I'm gonna say float Center X is
equal to what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
say any time that links x position is
basically anything except a fixed
integer I want to round up to an integer
and what that's going to do is just make
sure that link doesn't catch on the edge
of any of the other game objects and
gets stuck once again this is just a
quick fix that I'm gonna put in here
it's something that almost always
happens and I just want to stop it ahead
of time so I'm going to say convert to
double and whenever I play the animation
you're gonna see what I'm talking about
so position X and I'm gonna do the same
thing for the Y position because you
know everything inside of the game is
going to be based off of an array with
fixed values so if I get a float for a
value in an hour array that doesn't make
any sense so what I'm saying is I want
to round these okay but everything still
has to be a float because that's the way
vector twos work but whatever okay so I
think you understand that if you don't
leave a question in the comment section
and I'll answer it so transform.position
and any time you are setting the
transform or the position on the game
board for link or any game object you
have to create a vector for it so vector
two and then I'm gonna put Center X as
well as Center Y alright
and I think that's all I need to do for
link so I'm gonna save that and we'll
jump back into unity and test it out
okay so here we are and we're
run it and there's link and I'm pressing
the keys and they're not working why is
that
did I not connect this link and there is
up his speed is set to zero for some
reason let's change that to 30 maybe
okay save it and let's run it again
what's that maybe the problem no that
wasn't the problem okay so what is the
problem I know what I forgot to do the
game board I have to come in here and I
have to get the game board script and
attach that to that and another thing is
I want to change my speed to five and
now let's try and link is animating the
right way but he is not moving for some
reason let's see if we can figure out
why that is okay so I figured out what
the error was first off up here whenever
I want to walk up this has to be W okay
and you never Tinley left that as s and
the other thing I want to do is this guy
kept centering the link and the reason
why is it wasn't supposed to be there I
wanted it to be right here and this also
is gonna have to be up there okay and if
we save that now it should work let's
run it and now you can see the link is
moving around on a screen and animating
perfectly and looking really good and
like always any time that you are having
any problems make sure you check the
link in the description underneath of
the code or underneath of the video and
you will be able to fix any errors that
you might have had while copying in the
code and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
