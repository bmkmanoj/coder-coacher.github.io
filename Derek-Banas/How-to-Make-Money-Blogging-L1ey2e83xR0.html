and asked me how to create a completely
automated web site what Mel B was really
asking for is a website that makes her
money in today's presentation I am going
to show you exactly the advice given by
internet gurus who make statements such
as they can teach you how to become rich
on the internet or how to make money on
the internet to be more simple first off
you're going to have to have WordPress
installed if you don't check out the
link right here in the center of your
screen this is basically how it works
though the website i am going to show
you today is going to make you
approximately eighteen dollars a month
or at least that's what it made me in
advertising well it cost seven dollars a
month for hosting fees so that means for
every website that you set up like this
you're going to make on average eleven
dollars a month so basically take that
eleven dollars and multiply it times the
number of sites and that's how much
money you make per month that is all
that is to the internet gurus and this
is the exact process they use to make
money online I hope you enjoyed the
presentation okay so I'm expecting you
to have WordPress installed already then
what you need to do is just click on
plugins and your left sidebar click on
add new then type in here and don't
worry about why simple hi core and hit
search plugins first one on the screens
one you want click on install now it's
going to ask if you want to say yes and
then click on activate plugin now you're
going to install program called WP o
matic so click on add new again in the
plugins and type in WP dash 0 dash Matic
what this guy does is it will pull
information and articles from RSS feeds
and post them right onto your website so
you don't have to post content it's
going to pop up click on install now
it's going to ask you if you want to say
yes and again you want to going to
install it hit activate plugin now that
you have WP o matic installed you want
to click on settings in your left
sidebar and then you want to click on WP
o matic in your settings area in
wordpress and it's going to open up
setup window now we already installed
simplepie so there's no reason to
perform the test that it talks about
here so what we want to do instead is
hit next here you want to make sure that
you have your time properly set up
inside of wordpress i'm just going to
trust that you do and even if you don't
it doesn't really matter so just click
on next on your screen you're gonna see
a code that you're going to have to copy
and then paste over into godaddy so
select the code that's here I have part
of it great out select all of that and
hit copy then what you want to do is go
over to GoDaddy or whoever host your
plan login to godaddy and then click on
hosting over here under my products
remember you copied that coat then you
want to find where you want to install
said code click on launch then you want
to come over here to content and then
click on Kron manager again you don't
need to know what all these things do on
if you have any questions leave them in
a comment section below and I'll explain
what all these different guys do now
probably don't have an email address set
up here so click on edit and put in any
email address its box is gonna pop up so
your i'll just show you boom hits a now
what you want to do is click on create
cron jaw whenever you do this window is
going to open up you want to give it a
title what you copied from the WP o
matic field you want to paste in the
command area and then you want to select
frequency and just leave this at hourly
and then click on save that's all set up
but since we're here we might as well
set up something else inside of godaddy
that we're going to need a little bit
later so i want to click on home because
i need to create a directory i want to
click on your files and then what you're
going to want to do is click on WP
content which is right here this is all
inside of wordpress you want to click on
plugins then you want to find WP o matic
click on that whatever you want to
create this directory right here called
cash then you want to click on create
new directory and you're going to type c
AC AG in here and then hit ok i'm going
to hit cancel since already created it
then you want to click on the little
tick bar here next to the director you
created and change your permissions
under advanced permissions so that owner
permissions allow you to read write and
execute and hit ok now that's all set up
so now you're going to want to jump back
over into wpm
make sure this box is checked right here
and then click on next since you have
that all set up all of this information
is going to pop up on the screen so it
says right here it's not writable
because this is a previous installation
this error message should not be here so
we want to click in here click in here
and click in here click in here and then
hit save so now you're going to be
pulling information from a bunch of RSS
feeds this is basically what an RSS feed
looks like so typed in bloglines calm
and I'm going to click on blog lines top
1000 and it's going to list all the top
feeds that are available to you now if
for example you wanted to pull the feed
for the BBC and have all the new
articles that are posted there
automatically post on your website you
just go to this little guy here this or
an orange button right click on it and
you want to copy link location then jump
back over into WP o matic and click on
ad campaign and in this circumstance
what I'm doing is I'm going to copy the
RSS feed for the BBC so I'm gonna give
it a name like BBC and then I'm click on
feeds and then I'm going to paste in the
RSS feed for the BBC click on categories
let's just say news I never use this you
can use it if you want click on options
i'm going to say i don't want the custom
post template because i find it to be
kind of worthless i'm going to change my
frequency of course days being 0 hours
being 0 and n minutes i'm going to
change this to 15 what this is going to
do is it's going to check the BBC every
15 minutes to see if they added a new
article if they did it's going to
automatically post it on your website
I'm going to click on catch images going
into ignore use feed date when i click
on perform pingbacks because it's
something that's nice to do don't worry
about why i'm not going to touch
anything else and i would definitely
want to make sure this is unchecked
where it says post title links to source
make sure that's uncheck and and I'm
just simply going to hit submit now what
that's going to do now is it's going to
automatically throw all the information
from the BBC if I wanted to force it to
do it right now I'm just going to click
on fetch it now jumps over to the BBC it
found 10 additional new post and
automatically sent them to my website
let's jump over there to see you that it
did that
oh and you can see all those articles
were automatically thrown on my website
now to make sure there are descriptions
attached which are good for search
engine results you're going to want to
have another plug-in installed all in
one SEO again settings all in one SEO
just repeat for how we found the WP o
matic plugin and install it and if you
have all in one SEO installed and you
click on enabled and you click put
information in home title and home
description and keywords and all that
and then scroll down here and hit update
options what it's going to do is it's
automatically going to put subpar but at
least it's going to put descriptions on
every single article that you pull from
other RSS feeds like I said before this
website generated last month eighteen
dollars in total revenues and that is in
the first month that it actually existed
and I did that using the exact tools
that I just showed you in the exact way
that I just did it told you at all but
if you want to get even better results
meaning better articles because as you
can see here on this website and you
click on read more you're only getting
an abbreviated article now of course
some some RSS feeds are better than
other ones for example the huffington
post will send nicer RSS feeds your way
there longer nicer articles with
pictures and so forth and so forth so
that's the huffington post has a nice
serve set of RSS feeds in regards to
articles but let's say you wanted to
have nicer articles such as i'm going to
show you right here here you can see
much nicer articles so let's click on
read more i was able to pull images and
the articles are much longer and also
some of these articles also have video
and set up in them and so forth and so
on and also they are completely stripped
of advertising you can still make on
average 11 bucks a month per website
even cutting out the cost of hosting by
using exactly what i showed you before
if you want to make nicer articles and
half a neater website autoblog.com
offers a package that allows you to do
exactly that and it costs 60 bucks and
that's basically it that is the basis of
all of the programs that all the
internet gurus sell for
thousands of dollars now you know how to
do it free if you didn't quite get it by
watching the video if you go to new
think tank calm and type in make money
online right here and hit search the
whole entire article is available there
one hundred percent for free and also
all the links to all the websites that i
mentioned are available below if you
have any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section below until
