8 of my jQuery video tutorial if you
didn't see the previous tutorials to
this definitely check those out before
we proceed otherwise you may be confused
because today I'm going to show you how
to do some things that are on face value
kind of complicated but actually
extremely easy to do if you know how to
use jQuery ok gotten lots of requests
people to tell them exactly how to
create a lightbox going to do that they
click on an image it comes up it
actually works with my mouse movements
of course I can click and look around at
all kinds of different things and this
is a really neat effect when I close it
it snaps right to the picture kind of
cool I'm also going to show you how to
create a tab system with different types
of information inside of it of course
that's not enough let's also make these
tabs sortable yeah that's still not
enough how about we make the tab system
resizable we can do that with jQuery and
then on top of that let's make it
draggable so that you can put it
anywhere you want or the people who go
to your website can move it anywhere
they like and then to finish off
everything I'm going to show you on top
of that how to create a nice date picker
using jQuery UI library that's going to
allow your users to be able to very
quickly and easily enter custom dates on
your website so let's get into the code
first thing we're going to want to do is
go to fancy box.net /home or you can
just go to fancy bugs dotnet and then
what you want to do and this is going to
get you your lightbox and somebody
extremely easy to use what you're going
to do is jump up here and click on
download fancy box you don't want to
download that guy right there I already
did it so need to do it then you want to
save it wherever you're going to have
your website code so I created a folder
inside of here and called it fancy box
as you can see right there if you open
that up here is exactly what you
download so that's all that you need to
do just save all the information right
inside of a folder called fancy box or
whatever you want to name it doesn't
matter to me then to make it really easy
you want to go to fancy box dotnet and
click on how to use and then what we're
going to do is over on the left side of
the screen I already have my jQuery
libraries my jQuery UI libraries here's
the jQuery UI library CSS files and then
this is the jQuery library itself you
can get all this code at new think-tank
com there's a link in the underbar and
it's all free of course ok now we're
going to save ourselves some time what
we're going to do
is we're going to jump over here on the
fancy box.net website and we're going to
copy all of the code that we need from
this so we don't have to worry about
messing something up or at least I don't
need to worry about messing something up
we need to jump in here to the script
area we're just going to copy this and
paste that in there so that's the easing
text that you need to use this tool
we're also going to want this whole
little library that's going to allow you
to move around in the lightbox with your
mouse just copy that and paste that
inside of there and you're also going to
want this code right here
jQuery dot fancy box - one point three
point four so copy that and paste that
on your screen and then the final thing
you're going to want to copy from here
is the CSS code that you need so copy
that of course even easier yet is just
to download this code alright so now you
have every single thing that we're going
to need and everything is going to be
set up there now I can shrink this guy
down and get into the code alright to
fix this up hoping that you saved
everything exactly where I told you to
save it what we're just going to have to
do is come in here just make a couple
little changes meaning we're gonna have
to type in fancy box if you name the
folder fancy box like I told you -
beginning of the tutorial and you're
gonna have to do that for all these guys
so type in fancy box fancy box and then
fancy box alright so that was easy now
what we got to do is come down here into
the jQuery part of our webpage this will
be called whenever the document is ready
for your jQuery code of course like I've
talked about in the past and I'm going
to link everything up to use the fancy
box tool what we're going to do is we're
going to make reference here to a link
that's what the a is it's going to have
relatives set to example underscore
group and close that off and then we're
going to call the fancy box method and
then let's actually go in here and close
that part off and I'll show you
step-by-step how to put these images on
your screens you see right there I'm
going to jump down inside of here right
after jQuery UI and more I'm going to
put a space in here and I'm going to
create a span and a re L is equal to
example group se so that's what we're
going to be targeting right there and
then what you need to do is I'm going to
make an H reference or create a link
here to a folder called images and the
big version of my photos
is going to be what I put inside here
meaning the highest resolution images
and if we click over here you can see
images and the ones that start off with
PC are the big versions and the ones
that start off with thumb are the small
versions so that's what I'm paying
reference to right there okay so you
want the big version of your image to go
first and then you want to go image
source and here we're going to actually
target the thumbnail underscore o85 - of
course these names can be anything you
want this is just what I have and I'm
going to put a title on it because
that's a good idea and then close off
the link and then close off the span all
right so now what we got to do is
actually just copy this span and change
a couple of things inside of it it's
always a good idea to keep your names
relatively simple because it keeps you
from having to type a whole lot and
basically what I got to do is change
this to a seven and give us a uppercase
F not that that really matters change
this to a seven change this guy here to
a nine change this to a nine changes the
75 would have made my life even easier
if I would have had these BAE sequin
style but I didn't so what you gonna do
alright and I'm gonna change my title to
gargle it one pasted no I'm doing is
changing the title this doesn't even
really matter I'm just doing this just
to keep your things neat okay and that's
all you got to do there create a spand
surrounded an image with a link to the
larger version of said image if that's
easier to see
just put some spaces in there because
I've gotten hurt nothing all right so
now what we're going to do remember
we're going to be targeting all images
that have this attribute set to example
group so let's scroll back up here to
our code and start messing around with
some things tab in here and inside of
the fancy box function going to set
transition in two I'm going to put
elastic but you could also put none or
you could put fade so try either one of
those standard zoom out and I'm going to
put all that's put fade just to be
different title position when this is
just wherever the title is going to show
up that's why set title put that over
you could also set that to inside or
outside title format and here I'm going
to call function title current array and
if you're using fancy box you have
set everything exactly as I am setting
it right now no need to really worry
about what all these settings are just
follow the directions it'll be real
simple come down here return span ID
it's equal to fancy - box - title - over
again you don't need to worry about
exactly what this means but you do need
to put quotes around it and they have to
be double quotes not single quotes if
you go on the website they will explain
every single feature a lot of these
things I just personally don't find any
real use for memorizing they're just the
things you got to fill in took in title
length own space plus I don't close off
that span close off that function and
that is all you have to type in there
and like I said it's better just to copy
this and paste it in there and then fill
an elastic fade over and play around
with these guys up here otherwise it
might just confuse you and if you file
save that and reload this page you're
going to see that everything pops up and
works just like that don't need to worry
about anything else if we close it it
just fades away now again I actually
kind of like elastic better and just
simply what that does is it will make
the image that you click on everything
jump from there and then whatever you
close it it'll go right back to that
image so that's kind of neat so that's
pretty much how to set up a lightbox now
I'll show you how to create the tab
system and this is just going to make
you want to scream with how easy this is
so I'm going to come down here and I'm
going to call this tabs this area right
here and then basically what I got to do
is create an unordered list right like
that and then a list item and here I
just use exactly the example that is
given on the jQuery website except I
come in here and change a couple things
I'm not a guy that's big on recreating
the wheel and I'm just going to type in
dining I'm going to close off my span
and I'm going to close off the link area
and then I'm going to close off my list
again save myself some time copy and
paste those I'm going to call this guy -
I'm gonna call this guy three and here
I'm going to type in sales in here I'm
going to type in an LP which is
something that I like to talk about on
the website and here on YouTube and then
close off that ordered list
what you got to do is create a div I'm
going to scroll this up and it's going
to have an ID equal to this is the part
that's important you're going to want to
make this equal to fragment 1 or
whatever you name it it just has to be
the same as whatever you have labeled at
the top and then you're going to close
that div off right like that and then
again because I'm a guy that's all about
saving time we create another div create
another div and then I'm going to call
this fragment 2 and I'm going to call
this fragment 3 and then everything that
you put inside of these divs it's what's
going to show up inside of your tab
system so I already have some pre-made
HTML code I'm just going to copy and
paste that in here jump over here just
so you see it so here is this isn't even
HTML this is just basic text file with a
little tiny bit HTML I'm going to copy
that
inside of here and we'll paste it that's
it come back over here and here just to
show you that you can use lists inside
of here one jump inside of here tab
paste that in there then I'm going to
grab this last little piece of text copy
paste that inside of there and that's
pretty much all you got to do for this
little tab system except of course you
got to put some jQuery code in it up
here which is real simple and now we
gave this box down here the IDF tabs so
we got to go and locate that and how you
locate things that have an ID is with a
hash type in tabs and then to use this
tab system this comes with the jQuery UI
library you're just going to call tabs
that's it and that will create the tab
layout so if we file save that that's
all we did and reload it you can see
there is the tab system right there real
nice and neat and of course just so you
know you can of course come in here and
CSS style this just like anything else
so let's go to tabs and we'll go CSS and
let's say we want to constrain our width
to 500 pixels that is that's how you
would do it that's it I'll save over
here reload it and you can't really see
it but it's going off the screen and
that's 500 pixels in total width now
let's create the draggable system
because this guy ain't moving for
nothing this is going to make you really
lose it this is so simple okay so we got
our tab
ABB's you want to make it draggable all
you do is type in draggable blank now
it's draggable that's it we added one
line of code reload it and now we can
drag it and move it on the screen just
like that okay so you say alright well
you made it drag but what about
resizable piece-of-cake resizable just
type in resizable next to it and it will
automatically work reload it except
we're gonna have to squeeze this out
here a little bit and there's what that
looks like whenever you make an element
resizable using jquery it puts this
little nubbin in here right there down
there and you can do this on any type of
element in HTML which is totally cool
let's just keep it there and then if you
would want to make this sortable because
it currently doesn't it isn't sortable
remember I was dragging these tabs
around well what we got to do is jump
down inside of this area right inside of
here and then what we're gonna do in the
UL section is I'm gonna type in sort me
you could type in anything you want I
just gave that an ID and then I'm gonna
scroll up here and right here put it in
this guy right here except I'm going to
type in sort me and then right after
that I'm going to type in sortable and
now it is sortable you can do this with
any list that you'd like it doesn't have
to just be tabs by the way and now you
can see that everything is sortable and
then for the last thing if we'd want to
create a date picker like I showed you
at the beginning of this tutorial when I
do is I'm going to jump down here into
the HTML code and I'm going to create a
div and I'm going to create an input box
type is equal to of course I want to
make a text and I'm going to give it the
name I'm going to just type in data ID
is equal to data picker right like that
and then close off that div and if I
want to allow people to come in there
and be able to get that little calendar
to pop up gonna jump up here into my
code again and type in date picker
because that's the name that I gave to
that guy except since it's an ID I want
to make sure I put the hash inside of
there and I'm going to go dot date
picker and close that off with a
semicolon we'll set this to data picker
file save that jump over here reload it
and now if they click in this box a nice
little calendar pops
so there's a ton of things you can do
with fancy box and with jQuery UI and
with jQuery in general if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
