how to code PHP tutorial it's going to
toriel on how to write PHP programs
currently up to part seven and can
become as big as you want based off of
your comments PHP is a programming
language that allows you to process and
react to user actions on your website
while JavaScript allows you to process
actions directly on a visitors computer
PHP requires that actions are processed
on the server in which your website
resides PHP is most commonly used to
access databases on the server that
hosts your website please watch my SQL
tutorial before viewing this video or
you may get lost this tutorial will
cover most all you can accomplish with
PHP but will very specifically cover how
to interact with a database with PHP you
can embed PHP code directly in your web
pages by surrounding the code with an
opening less than sign followed by a
question mark and PHP and a closing tag
that looks like this you also want to
give your webpage the PHP extension dot
PHP when you embed PHP code in a web
page you define variables storage areas
with a defined name by starting the name
with a dollar sign and then a name the
first character following the dollar
sign must be a letter or an underscore
there after you can use a series of
letters numbers or underscores it is
also considered good for you to separate
multiple words in a variable name with
underscores here are some examples of
different variable names first off you
have the text for output definitely a
viable variable name then you have some
stuff first off there's no dollar signs
beginning of this and there's also a
space spaces are not allowed you have
another valid variable name here we have
a variable name because you cannot start
a variable with a number and also this
is bad just on its own because it's not
descriptive you can assign values to the
newly created variable with the equals
operator as I have here and if you
wanted to find a variable with a value
that will never change being a constant
variable you would do that with
define function as I show here where we
are defining the value of pi you can
easily output text to a web page by
using the echo or print functions and
here are some examples you can see here
I'm using the echo function to output to
the screen this text brought to you by
the echo function and I'm doing
something similar here with the print so
what's the difference between single
versus double quotes well you can use
single or double quotes with both of the
functions echo and print but the data
contained between them is handled
completely differently with single
quotes are used when you want exactly
what is typed to be displayed if you
place a variable within single quotes
the name and not the value of the
variable will be displayed for example
if I would put show variable value and
then I show this variable which is
dollar sign some number inside of single
quotes what would be printed out to the
screen would be the dollar sign followed
by some number not the actual value of
the variable also single quotes ignore
escape characters which I'll describe in
a moment double quotes don't blindly
print what is within them echo show
variable value some number in this
instance would print 3.14 when double
quotes are used variables are spotted
and their values automatically replace
them before they are printed to the
screen double quotes also pay attention
to escape characters sometimes you're
going to want to echo text a screen that
is protected if you want to echo a quote
to the screen you may confuse the
browser if you place that quote between
two other quotes the browser won't know
when your text block ends so how do you
use those protective characters you
follow them with a backslash here is a
list of some protected or escaped
characters now you can place these
protected characters in your double
quoted strings for use with the echo and
print functions just remember these only
work when you use a double quote it is a
very good idea to start your code with a
full description of what the program
does
you should then follow up by writing
comments that describe each function and
any statements you might find confusing
a year from now this is so that you and
others will be able to easily jump in
years
to make any changes that are needed
believe me there will be changes and you
will forget you can comment out notes on
your code for a full line break
preceding comment with two forward
slashes if you need to make a multi-line
comment start off with a forward slash
and then a star and in the comment with
a star or forward slash you can also
comment out a single line with the pound
symbol but this isn't often used just so
you are aware you create comments in
HTML with a starting less than sign
followed by an exclamation point two
dashes and end it with two dashes and a
greater than sign for a full tutorial on
HTML see my other HTML tutorial strings
are just a quoted chunk of letters
numbers punctuation and whitespace the
information you were outputting to the
screen with the echo and print functions
were strengths you create and assign
strings to variables with the equals
operator you can join two strings with
the dot operator like this as you can
see here I am combining the string
Windows followed by bricks and assigning
it to the string variable house house is
now going to be equal to that and here
location is equal to Chicago Illinois if
that was the value of the variable city
and state if you want to find the number
of characters in stream you can use the
string length function characters in a
string in this example here would return
17 the number of characters in Chicago
Illinois including whitespace and
punctuation I'll show you some other
useful string functions late there are
numerous functions you can use to work
with numbers in PHP you define them in
the same way as other variables for this
instance with I am defining PI you can
also perform these basic operations on
them of course we have addition
subtraction multiplication division we
have modulus which returns a remainder
of a division we have increment which is
a shorthand way to add one to a value
and we have decrement a shorthand way to
subtract one from about you this
statement would add the value of stuff
to the value of dog and assign it to the
variable stuff and in the second example
this statement would subtract the value
of dog from the value of stuff and
assign it to the variable stuff that's
all I'm able to cover in part 1 of my
how to code PHP
hope you enjoyed it come back next time
for math functions arrays if statements
conditional and logical operators till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
