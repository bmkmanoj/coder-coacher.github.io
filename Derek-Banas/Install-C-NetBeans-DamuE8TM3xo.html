tutorial on how to install both C as
well as C++ along with NetBeans on both
windows as well as Mac OS all in one
video first I'm going to show you how to
install everything on Windows and if
you're a Mac user in the description
underneath the video you'll see a
timestamp you can click on jump directly
at that point I'm gonna move really
quickly through this so get ready to hit
the pause button don't want to waste
your time and like always I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay first
off inside of Windows what you're gonna
want to do is go to sourceforge.net
projects and it's min-ji W minimalist
canoe you're gonna want to download this
guy and then you want to come down here
and click on run after you do that this
is gonna pop up you're gonna click on
install then you can make sure you keep
everything in the default directory
mingw don't change anything on this
screen and then you're gonna click on
continue and that's all going to
download and run for you after
everything is done what you're going to
want to do is you're gonna come to this
page you're going to click right here in
mingw developer tools and then a whole
bunch of these other things are also
going to be checked you're also going to
want to make sure that you have mingw 32
base selected down here if that's not
selected already for you of course we
are going to be installing a C++ so
you're gonna want to make a check inside
of here and it's G plus plus but it's
C++ C Canoe C++ compiler that's what you
want to get and then you're also gonna
want to come in here and put a selection
inside of em sis - base and all of this
other stuff should come in here and
install for you as well after you do
that you're gonna come over here to
installation and click on apply changes
this little window is gonna pop up for
you you're gonna come in here and click
on apply and all that stuff's gonna
download for you and then after
everything has been downloaded and
installed you're gonna click on close
alright next thing you're gonna want to
do is you're going to want to put all
that information into your environment
variable so just come over here if
you're on Windows 10 which is what I'm
guessing you are just do a search for
environment and then
click on edit the system environment
variables this guy's gonna pop up inside
of here come down and click on
environment variables whenever you do
that come over to your path and select
path and then you're gonna click on edit
and then you're gonna type in C colon
backslash min capital G W exactly like I
have right there with a backslash and
bin click on OK then you're gonna also
come in and once again edit and you're
gonna want to add this in here once
again exactly like we have here you can
go and verify that these files actually
exist it's probably a really good idea
and then click on OK then after you do
that you're gonna want to open up your
cam man prompt and you can just type in
G + + - - + version and whenever you do
you're going to see that you have the
current version of C the C++ compiler
installed now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna get NetBeans the reason I
picked NetBeans is based off of all the
available IDs on every operating system
I consider NetBeans to be the best based
off of what works best on every single
operating system and because I'm doing a
C++ tutorial like you guys asked I chose
NetBeans so I just went in here and I
just selected C C++ download x64
whenever you click on that it's going to
download and then you're gonna come down
here and click on run this is gonna open
up you're gonna come in here and click
on next and then you're gonna accept the
terms of the license and agreement click
on next leave everything into the false
click on next everything here don't do
nothing install and then once again you
can either contribute to the information
or not click on finish then you're gonna
open up NetBeans you're gonna come up
here to new project to verify everything
is working you're going to come down to
samples and C++ click on welcome and
then click on next and you're gonna see
where it's gonna save all your different
files and you're gonna see go new cygwin
see this is what we just installed click
on finish whatever you do this is gonna
open up you're gonna come over to your
source file directory area here just
click on this guy to see the welcome dot
CC file double click on that this is
gonna open you're gonna come up here
where there's a little arrow or triangle
on its side and click on that guy and
everything's gonna run and if it says
run successful you know you have
everything installed properly
on Windows okay so hopefully that helped
you out and up next I'm going to show
you how to install everything on Mac OS
alright very first thing you don't want
to do is you're gonna hit command or the
little flower thing and space type in
terminal because very well might have G+
bus already installed just type in G+
plus if you get fatal error no input
files guess what G plus plus is already
installed and more than likely
everything's gonna be set for you then
what you want to do is come in here and
type in G + + - - version and you should
see something like 4.8 somewhere in that
area if you do not what you're gonna
want to do is open up the app store and
you're gonna want to go and get Xcode
and it says update here but you're gonna
want to install so just install Xcode
after that you're gonna type in Xcode -
select with a space - - install and then
hit enter and that's gonna install
everything you're gonna need then what
you're gonna do is you're gonna go to
NetBeans dot-org downloads index dot
HTML and more than likely you're just
gonna get the C and C++ compiler so
let's just come in here or IDE I mean
and just click on download whenever you
do this is gonna open up you're gonna
double click on the NetBeans 8.2 package
it might be a different number this is
gonna open up you're gonna click on
continue this is ok gonna click on
continue this is gonna open up you're
gonna click on continue you're gonna
click on agree and you can just store it
exactly where it's gonna go and click on
install after you do that everything's
installed you're going to see in your
Applications folder net means you're
gonna open that up and this isn't that
means itself you're gonna double click
on that and then you're gonna come in
here and you're gonna click on new
project after that the verify
everything's been installed properly
you're gonna click on samples and c c++
welcome and then next you're gonna make
sure you have good new mac selected down
here and you can store this project file
wherever you want click on finish
after that you're gonna come over here
and click on the sources files and
double click on welcome CC and then
you're gonna come over here and click on
this little triangle that's on inside
this is the run command that's how you
run your applications and whenever you
do that you're gonna see this all come
down here if it says run finished exit
values there
you know that you have C C++ as well as
NetBeans properly installed on your Mac
so hopefully that helps people out out
there and very soon I'm gonna start my
C++ tutorial that you guys have all
requested and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
