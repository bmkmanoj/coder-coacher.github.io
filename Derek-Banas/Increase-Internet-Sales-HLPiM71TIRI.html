my wordpress shopping cart tutorial
today I'm going to show you how to drive
an immense amount of traffic to your
shopping cart and as you can see right
here here's the shopping cart
application that we built in the
previous parts of the tutorial it's all
well and good let's just type in a
product right here do a search on it and
if somebody finds your website that's
all great and they can come in here and
they can buy this product and everything
is wonderful but if you want to
dramatically increase your traffic you
need to get into the Google Merchant
program and it's free which is totally
awesome that way whenever somebody goes
into Google and types in this product
name and clicks on shopping and
sometimes not even needing to click on
shopping you can see that a website that
has only really existed for about a week
is showing right here on the first page
with almost the lowest price and of
course he could go in there and change
that and increase his ranking and so
forth and so on so the first thing we're
going to need to do is type in Google
Merchant inside of Google then you're
going to need to sign up for the program
you just type in your email and your
password select wherever you live at I'm
in the United States I'm gonna hit
continue and I'm just going to scroll
through all this mumbo jumbo come way
down here and I'm going to click yes
that I want to continue and then you
would need to type in your store name a
description of your store the website
URL in my case this is business plumbing
calm your address your city your state
postal code phone number you know all
the stuff that you would normally type
into things like this and then you want
to hit save updates and that's going to
get you into the Google Merchant program
once you are in the Google Merchant
program and as you can see here this is
all brand-new but we're still getting
some traffic these right here is
basically showing all the different
products that Google is tracking
currently there's different clicks on
those products couple sales have come
through even though this is a horrible
time of the year to be sewing and over
here you're going to see the data feed
which i'm going to show you in a second
how to set that up and it's going to
show all the different errors that you
may have made but i'm going to show you
how to fix those no problem and then
there's all kinds of other different
information here in regards to the data
quality and of course the better quality
your data is the better results you're
going to get the more searches you're
going to get and all these other
wonderful
well if you set up your system like I
told you to using WP e-commerce which is
also free you can come in here inside of
wordpress and go down to settings and
click on store and you're going to see
this on your screen then you can just
simply come over to marketing click on
that and if you scroll down here you're
going to see Google Merchant Center
Google Product Search and this right
here is a product or SS feet I'm going
to zoom in here and there you can see it
right there you're going to want to copy
that and then go into your Google system
right like this and then you're going to
click on data feeds and there's links to
the merchant dashboard and all these
different things on how to set this up
underneath the video i'm gonna click on
data feeds and then what you want to do
is come in here and go new data feed and
then you're going to select your country
you're gonna select the format which is
going to be google base and then you are
going to just type in a random name for
this let's just say that a feed to dot
whatever and then hit Save Changes and
you could see everything set up right
here then you want to come over here
after you have all that set up and go to
create schedule and click on that and
right here where it says feed URL you're
going to paste your feed directly inside
of there and then if you have password
protection on this feed which WP
e-commerce doesn't you'd enter that but
either way you just hit that and then
you hit schedule and you decide if you
want them to come back monthly or
whenever you want it I would normally
pick weekly and that's all you need to
do now your feed is all ready to work
with Google but of course you need to
add yourself some products which is very
important I'm going to show you how to
do that let's say I want to add this new
product which is garbage can liners I
know it's not terribly sexy but whatever
so I'm gonna just type in this basic
information in regards to the garbage
can liners and then if you come down
inside of here you're gonna see
everybody's using the same descriptions
why is that that is because these are
the descriptions that Google has picked
so basically what you want to do is just
come in here and copy them so we're
looking at these guys right here and I'm
saying pretty much the same exact names
over and over and over again so I'm
going to select this this is going to be
my title then I'm going to jump back
into my store and I'm going to come down
to products and again this is back in
your ecommerce store and I'm going to
come on and click add new and paste that
title directly and
side of add new product because this is
the one that's Google is recognizing
currently and then over in product tags
and don't paste that same thing inside
of there and then this is sort of like a
guess but I'm gonna come in here and
just put a comma in between 2-4 3106
which is an item number in high density
and I'm going to hit add all right so I
got all that information in there now
I'm going to jump back over here and
let's go and let's actually copy this
guy we're just everybody's using the
same image not normally supposed to do
this but I'm guessing since everybody's
using the same image of everybody's
copying off of each other then you want
to jump into a editing photo editing
tools sort of like Photoshop or GIMP and
you're going to paste this new product
inside of there and you're going to
increase the size of it to make it look
nice this is 200 x 200 and i'm going to
show you how to change everything else
and then i'm gonna save this on my
computer and eventually i'm going to
upload it to my shopping cart and i'm
gonna give it the item number name it's
best to be as descriptive as possible
but just for this tutorial that's what
I'm gonna do come in here i'm going to
save it as a ping file and I'm going to
save it in a folder that I can easily
locate so that i can upload it of course
then gonna jump back into my honors tool
actually i'm gonna jump over here and
i'm gonna copy and paste this
description that everybody is using very
very important there's some free
advertising betty mills and i'm going to
jump back over into my show up and
carter and i'm going to paste that
description inside of there okay so
everybody's using it you want to stay as
much as possible towards what everyone
else is doing and we're going to come
over here into the product category area
and decide what we want to do i'm
deciding that this is a janitorial
product and it's sanitary maintenance so
i'm going to do that which is nice and I
have a little cheat sheet here that has
some information so 2193 is the price
and the weight is 9.7 so I'm just going
to type in price 2193 come over here to
wait nine point seven and it's going to
automatically count my shipping and
everything else sku code which is going
to be this guy right here so we're just
going to copy that Jim back down here
it's very important to keep all this
organized if you're counting taxes and
put that in there if not well then don't
you come to mont managed product images
that's going to be the skew code so 243
106 click on that from computer select
files and i have everything saved in a
product's folder here so i'm just going
to go look for 243 and there
is I'm going to hit open or whatever i'm
going to upload it and i'm just going to
keep 243 106 is my name for my product
paste that in there and then I make my
thumbnail a little bit smaller so I'm
going to make it 125 x 125 remember it
was 200 x 200 originally and then i'm
just going to hit Save Changes there you
go now you have a thumbnail or a product
image associated with it now we get into
our google specific information and this
is very important if you want this to
show up inside of Google inside the
merchant services program I'm just going
to hit this four times one two three
four and then this is very important you
want to type in G colon and type in
brand well the brand for this is G and
so that's good and then we're going to
type in MPN which is my skew code or my
ID number so i'm going to copy that and
throw that inside of there then we got
to type in description tab again and i
always put this description in right
here this is actually the title for this
so i'm going to copy that I'm down to G
call in description paste that inside of
there and then we have two additional
things it will be G colon you're going
to type in Google product category and
then G colon you know type in products
tight just like that well then what you
need to do and again this link also is
underneath of this video it's going to
be Google Merchant Center help you're
going to want to go to this web page
right here scroll down and then inside
of here this is a garbage can liner so
you might type in can liner ok nothing
comes up well if you keep typing things
in against Lee you're going to see
garbage bags is what ends up coming up
so all you need to do is click on it
once the most relevant thing comes on
the screen over here to where it says
XML you want to copy that then you want
to jump back over here to where we were
inside of your shopping cart and paste 2
times and there you go and then after
all that's been set up you just hit
publish now Google knows about your
products and their existence which is
awesome if I jump out to my website I
know this looks kind of weird because
I'm zoomed in so far you can see the way
this looks if you go to business
plumbing column by the way not saying
that's for you to buy anything I doubt
anybody watching this wants to buy
plumbing products anyway and then if you
go over here click on last this is my
products page again and scroll way down
here you can see this is the product
that I enter
here's the description here's the price
and shipping will be calculated once we
figure out where the person lives on
this earth and the only other thing I
could think of you might want to do if
we jump back into the Google Merchant
system you know where you signed up
freeze click on data feeds and left
sidebar come over here to where it says
week we upload and this is the guy that
i already have created and of course i
can come in here and click on the one
that I created earlier and just hit
delete and delete that out of there but
this is the feed that i'm currently
using so if i don't ever want to force a
feed update I just click on weekly
upload come inside of here don't need to
really do anything else and just come
down here to where it says update and
fetch now and click on that and Google's
going to jump out there and fetch your
brand new feed with all your updated
products so there is an awesome way to
drive a lot of traffic to your brand new
shopping cart right out of the box leave
