joining me I promised I was going to
beat the talus principal the hardest
puzzle game ever in my opinion anyway a
lot of people's and so I'm almost at the
end this is the tower so this is
hopefully as hard as it gets
oh let's do it okay so do some Tetris
EOBs things here this is actually pretty
easy that whoops I don't want to do that
there we are something like this you
could ask I can see your your chat
messages and everything you are all very
very welcome thank you very much for
watching my videos I greatly appreciate
it
all right link and another going yeah
okay in alright so I have no idea what's
gonna happen here so this is I think
there's six levels to this as long as it
wasn't lying to me and I have to solve
these puzzles and then I have no idea
what happened this whole thing is based
around I am a artificial intelligent
being and I'm trying to find out the
secrets of life and things like that so
alright so there's a blue thing there oh
there's a nasty robot there um what's
the name of the game it's called the
Talos principle no oh well I last Friday
I completed the beginning of the game
and this Friday I am completing I've got
a whatever this Friday
today that's right uh feet feet the
whole God get out of the whole the whole
game so okay that's going to hit this
and mess it off no don't
but there was another one on the other
side hmm it's a puzzle game it's an
extremely complicated puzzle game ok so
there's another one over here
I need to get the other one what program
language our platform you used for what
I don't know what that means I don't
understand that question I have no idea
what language I used to make this game
you know what I wonder if I can use the
laser twice to give it enough juice to
keep the door open
let's try that yes all right that was
actually easy all right well here's a
terminal see what this says
hello Exodus I certain people are always
here so and they have enough memorable
YouTube names and Exodus is one of them
okay so what's up found one external
device detected searching for locally
carry the truth some of these I'm gonna
read some of them I'm not gonna read
what is device manager hmm what's it
device manager is loading scanning for
external devices show current operating
parameters floor access control let's
try all these
I looks like a bunch of nonsense doesn't
it yeah let's try floor access control
let's see how many of these floors in
the tower I can access okay so so floor
zero is unlocked that's where I was at
floor 1 is unlocked that's where I'm at
floor 2 is locked so how do i unlock it
hmm it's like Florida reconfigure hmm I
guess floor - because I need to go there
next right miss I'm really yeah access
to that floor is currently locked would
you like to unlock it well yeah ok floor
access control let's see this is weird
okay so it's unlock now all right oh
okay I see floor three four or five six
require codes but none of the other ones
do all right cool so I'm gonna have to
find code somewhere the name of the game
is the Talos principle thank you very
much I'm glad you like the c-sharp video
tutorials exit this Oh
auxiliary stairway access control all
right can I just open up the stairways
and ignore the elevator altogether
let's see please renew your license to
enable auxilary stairway locking I guess
I can't do that was I missing something
all right truth sympathises do not
believe what they are saying this is not
the end of the world created by our Lord
God in six days this is a conspiracy of
the government Illuminati and
international Darwinism feel like Alex
Jones this is global warming 2.0 a lie
told by the children of Israel Beelzebub
of science do not let them take your
liberty defend yourself against all
vaccines experiments artificial
medicines and potpourri all right that
is a funny one
Athena chapters this is normally the
stuff that I sort of skip over yeah I
don't think there's anything in there
anyway Human Reproduction try read these
I will I will unless you tell me not to
shortly if a machine is able to
reproduce another machine systematically
systematically we may say that it it has
a reproductive system and how few of the
machines are there which have not been
produced systematically by other
machines but it is man that makes them
do so yes but is it not insects that
make many of the plants reproduce and
would not hold families of plants died
out if their fertilization was not
affected by a class of agents utterly
foreign to themselves each one of the
each one of our cells has sprung from
minut where it is these little creatures
are part of our own reproductive systems
then why not we part of that machines
okay enough of that next floor should I
steal these um you know not obviously
steal them am I supposed to take them I
can take them can I let me see
yeah the one problem with me reading
things as I can I steal it say if I go
through this gate I lose it yes but I
swear I saw another way out it's just
you know this game if it all of a sudden
allows you to do something different see
over here oh no it's over here maybe I'm
loosening and I thought I saw another
way out and I really didn't yes I did
see it over here so I could take this
prism if I wanted to should I guess not
let's see what we got
I don't know if I'm supposed to take
this or not or maybe I'm supposed to do
something completely different with it I
don't know I'm just gonna stick it in
here there's also the axe which I can
also take if I want I don't know if any
of those things
normally when this game allows you to do
something completely different you know
like a new mechanic a new game mechanic
it's normally for a reason it's not you
know just do something so where's my
donation button I don't know what other
get I don't really have a on my website
I have a donation button but I really
don't care if you guys tell me what oh
yeah uh you know I'm not doing this to
get rich and I'm definitely not getting
rich in all that I ever asked if you
want to help me
whenever you watch my videos turn off ad
blocker there you go
you've contributed that's all I asked
for you don't need to donate but thank
you for asking
it's kind of you to ask but I'm not big
on asking for donations
all right onto floor - I don't even know
if I need that up but we'll try
how many games will I be making I have
no idea I want to make a game basically
for every major game mechanic and I'm
starting off with 2d games and
eventually I'll get two 3d games so
pac-man's next pac-man is currently
being made I'm just gonna leave these in
here just in case they're needed these
are sometimes cool boats as trophy
earned transgression seems evil ahem
lacks the power to stop me from climbing
this thing no doubt he still has some
tricks up his sleeve it's going up yeah
Elohim is the main I don't know if you'd
call him protagonist oh boy this is
gonna be hard hmm he's the the he kind
of represents himself as like a god-like
character in this game and tells me if I
do what he says I'm reading your uh I'm
reading your chats but it's it seems
like you're talking to each other pretty
much all right so what do we got here
sometimes these are harder than anything
else okay
oops
I'm not the best at these things let's
see if I can do it here oops I keep
hitting wrong button sorry about that
oops oh you there's a space here for
that so let's just what else we got here
hmm
feel like I messed up yes all right
hmm definitely messed up sorry this was
not very easy for me mm-hmm
let's try again any other good vo vo a
is a really good Netflix show at least I
liked it
do you watch Ozark I thought it was arc
was awesome those arcs ending was
awesome I don't think I'm giving any
spoilers away by saying that the ending
was good what else I love 13 reasons why
but I I'm kind of of the opinion it
shouldn't have been made but this one
I'm not a big fan of the superhero
things on Netflix but you know to each
their own sorry this there did it Wow
okay so I did it yeah yeah I yeah i
agree with 13 reasons why it was family
it was fabulous but i also agree with
you it shouldn't have been made it there
will it's not good there's been research
studies that have been done that say
that just by talking about a suicide and
making it seem normal will cause
suicides and it's been researched it's a
historical thing so yeah i'm of the
agree with whoever said that it probably
shouldn't have been made that yes it
probably shouldn't have been made but it
was done very well i don't know take it
for what you will I'm gonna hit this
thing and this girl's gonna tell she
tells the interesting stories
and insignificant blip in a sea of
billions but the world is not abstract
reality is always specific
specific human being who existed only
once the infinity of time
was my friend
no matter how much I wanted to
all I can do in the end just keep
working because that specificity
people of real people
is worth preserving
these puzzles are kind of a little bit
easier than what I'm used to so I think
I can just jump on this and that's gonna
allow me to go off to the next level
if I'm right I might be wrong this is
called the Talos principle yes
no I don't know Arabic so I can't really
teach a teach it at work to do what I
thought it was gonna do now I'm knocked
I don't know I just knocked everything
over okay well I thought that would be
easy and it wasn't let's see here
I don't know what else to do I thought
that it might throw me up there
it's a little harder than I what this
jump here
oh it's on top of that
just not easy hmm
I'm not I don't really speak any line I
wouldn't say I speak any language well
fluently or whatever I used to be able
to speak German and I used to be able to
read Mandarin but not anymore
I can still for some reason it's sort of
stumble my way through German I don't
know what to do
this is a hard puzzle and I think I
broke it when that went up there I'm
gonna reset the puzzle restart a
checkpoint
now I hope it doesn't make me do that
okay it didn't all right
I have no idea what to do with this I
thought this was really easy man could
you make it tutorials
no this doesn't have anything to do with
this game does have anything to do with
aliens it's all about an artificial
intelligence that is being taken through
a series of tests to
it's just--see or test the limits of the
AI that's like the whole game I don't
know I I get a feeling that this has
something to do with this I'm totally
guessing now I don't know what to do
yeah I'm missing something maybe there's
something else here okay so that pushes
that off
I like drop it here
Wow this is a complicated one
I like supposed to do something with
this that doesn't seem to make any sense
there do that do anything no hmm I don't
know I might be completely confused
already Internet oh is that what it's
supposed to do Wow I'm really confused I
might be just totally missing this whole
thing am I supposed to jump in there
weird this game so far as the puzzles
have been complicated but they've sort
of made sense this one just doesn't make
any sense
hmm I don't know who the name of the
company that made this site it's sort of
an indie game I believe I think it's
it's a Croatian software company I don't
know protein I don't know
confuse their
yeah Croteam
I don't know anything about
release state of CSS for you
I don't know
okay so that's up there so how do I get
up there is there a trick
it's supposed to blow me over there Oh
jump-jump-jump come John I have an idea
this is the first time well there's been
times in this game where I've been
confused but I feel it's the first time
I'm just like literally it doesn't make
any sense
maybe this is pointless maybe it's like
the other one there's like a back door
yeah I have diet videos I have a video
on just about everything
if you want to lose weight it's real
easy and anybody that tells you this
isn't true is making things up there's
only one way to lose weight burn more
calories than you you consume that's it
now there's things like if you go and
you you know try to starve yourself
basically your body will revolt against
you and that's called this the your body
will go into what's called survival mode
and once that happens your body your
metabolism slows down really really
dramatically so that's one reason why
you don't want to starve yourself that's
why these idiots that I keep seeing the
new current hot diet thing is people
starving themselves
yeah that's not that's not good I mean
anyone with common sense knows that so
yeah that's
whatever lettuce I don't know
so yeah eat less calories than you you
consume and there you go but I think
it's a lot easier to lose weight through
cutting calories than it is by over
exercising but that's just me maybe
other people are different I don't know
I don't know what to do put the boxes
behind the fan
oh yeah if you starve yourself your body
will literally consume itself it will
eat muscle it'll weed it'll eat
everything it'll eat whatever it has
available to eat we'll move very very
carefully because I think I'm gonna
fixed it or did something I don't know
just to be
can I jump up there
is there somewhere else I'm supposed to
jump to
it won't allow me to jump in there
am I allowed to jump in there
somebody's saying I should jump on the
fan and then on the boxes
see if that works
so that looks like the only way this I
can get to
okay I'll stack the boxes
and see if I can jump on top of them I
don't know let's go here I don't think
that's far enough
maybe can I put this down here
and I felt well
sorry Internet but this has got me
confused I've no idea what to do and I
can't skip any of the other puzzles
happens
I think I just threw them all
no idea can I put this here
and then get on top of it
and I'm not low enough to be able to
grab it I am really confused
boxes in the shelves and there's a box
and there's a show up there
somebody says do what anybody else would
do and search online for a solution like
it's funny I played for this entire game
and this is the first I mean it's this
is a hard game but this is the first
time where I'm just like it just doesn't
make any sense
what is going on here I really just
don't get it
I don't know
like this was a way of solving things in
the past maybe I need to approach it
from a different direction like maybe
it'll know that doesn't work either no
idea I really don't have any idea
there's my boxes there down there
like where I need to get to is there
it's straight ahead which means I need
to get up on top of that I can't figure
out see I got inside of there so that's
not the answer
okay so maybe that is it okay so let's
now write spam is just I'm starting to
think this fan is pointless just take
that off of there okay so let's try to
go up here box by box and see if that is
indeed the way to do it
okay soap little box there and put a box
here this is a clever puzzle can I put
it inside of there can I jump no I can't
jump
oops I think I just dropped it yes I did
so I think I'd like that again is there
a shelf anywhere else to put boxes no
just there
see let's try this let's see if it'll
give me a little bit of a lift up that
what's back into it
that do anything to help me no did
nothing
think I accidentally
grab that bottle one maybe I do need
this fan sorry this is this is I think
the worst I've done on a puzzle in the
entire cake I guess that's what I get
for saying that the puzzles are getting
easier is they definitely or not
okay that didn't work
I think I need all three boxes you know
because otherwise I could just do this
and put that on top of there and then go
here get this okay so that's there
that's there
let's put that there and then let's see
if I can reach I swear I tried doing
this with just two boxes and it didn't
work
yeah I this is not my full-time job I
wish it was no I'm not popular enough on
you to do this full-time
this ah got it
and then let's drop this
see it spins out of control
ah I might have figured out okay now can
I grab this yes now I got that up there
wow this is a complicated game or a
complicated puzzle holy cow
okay so now what I'm gonna do jump off
of there
grab this wow this is so complicated
okay grab that put that okay back in
there man
see this one coming and then grab this
one jump up here hopefully I can drop
this here and it will go under me lit
yes
okay then grab the other boxes grab this
one and it'll go over under me
hopefully yes hopefully grab this one
drop it
and then we've burned very carefully and
hopefully be able to jump wow that was
so hard
whoo Wow oh it's ridiculous so I did it
Wow I took me long enough didn't it
genius
yeah this is the final tower so some of
these are a little bit hard whoo Jesus
man
all right so 215 is that the elevator
cut would not be funny
you have no idea of many places well I'm
sure all you get you go to fix people's
computers and they're completely covered
with passwords
okay so floor access control so we're
gonna say - and I want to try to unlock
floor three let's go with the most
obvious thing that it's gonna be - 15
yes so it's 2 1 5 that's right code
accepted
that's so funny where all these
terminals gonna have little things on
them it's funny all right so let's just
say choose an option exit cool um my
favorite book for Python is whatever I
put on my learn to program series in the
description so just type learn to
program in YouTube and look for my name
and you'll see the book there and I'm
not sponsored by anybody to recommend
any books just you know that all right
read me what Souza says if you can see
this I'm not sure how or why I can alter
this text my name is the Shepherd and I
want to help you escape
ela him and samsara tricked me into
trapping myself but I'm not entirely
bound by time I wrote down the code
you're looking for I've attached it to
the screen obviously there it is
all right cool so let's see what else I
got the web okay so that's more story
let's just skip that for now
sincerely hope you don't take it
okay so let's exit that let's stick with
the story that the girl has for us I
don't think I can get those boxes right
I don't know I'm gonna give up that
dream of getting all these things out
here I don't know why I did it with
prisms but just felt that something that
came to my mind at the moment and I
decided ah what the heck I would give it
a go
all right on to floor three of the tower
hey you know what my things are gone we
did it take it away from her when I
reset that one part did it take it
that's weird
all right whatever oops floor three
mmm
somebody said the most important story
in the tower is the girls top is what
the girl is talking about Eva Hamm has
offered me a deal pearly gates and
eternal life on the condition I turned
back from the tower I don't know what to
do cheap
Oh somebody being irritating okay I'll
get rid of them
just tell me if somebody's irritating
and I will get rid of them goodbye
alright alright let's see what you got
here now let's try something like
this I want to try to get rid of these
guys so let's just throw this here and
I'll throw this here
yeah I really liked the the witness it
was a as a fun game it was nowhere near
as hard as this so I don't think and you
could sorta
you could sort of brute force some of
the puzzles in the witness and you can't
do that in this game oh look at that did
I get the first time whoops
like there was a sound level of the
witness and I totally brute forced it I
could and there was another part of it
where I was having trouble and somebody
told me it was because I was colorblind
and I sort of brute force it as well so
this game you can't force it says
there's no brute force and involved
every species is part of the story but I
think my broken oh yeah I was stupid I
have to reset the thing probably a
Bernard what's up
I haven't seen you in a while let's say
restart trick point mm-hmm how old am I
I am 42 or 43 something like that 42
so that should be enough right
yeah let's try doing it again
yes regular expressions are the same in
every language it's just about I mean
anyway
three thousand four one thousand five
one thousand six one thousand seven one
thousand eight one thousand um okay I
should do it I think I made it through I
was easy I think this is the last level
guys what was the third one or something
because I normally play this game for
one hour so and I'm almost done with the
tower so no I never missed your
complaining Bernard I love your
complaints all right let's see what's up
device manager oh you know what I don't
have a password there's nothing hidden
on here that's like a password let's
exit that and let's see oh look at that
I was Cyrus password and 674 you shall
hear the rest of the other way in there
I'm gonna skip that because it was a
minor 674 and device manager' floor
access control to Anne's floor for its
674 right yeah
seven four and two cooks up that all
right good
I think it's better to be really really
good at one thing and be able to do
anything with it rather than be you know
know a little about a bunch of things
okay that's not good
and Athena 14 these are normally those
yeah these are the stories about ancient
Greece and things like that
I'm just because they don't really play
into the story all right let's see
what's going on here can I get out this
way yes all right
and floor four let's go to the floor for
here we go
yes it's much better to start learning
unity with 2d games at least in my
opinion and then it's a kind of amazing
how they you that similarity between 2d
and 3d games like whenever you first
start making 3d games after you get good
at making 3d game or after you get good
at making 2d games you're gonna be
amazed how easy it is oh my lord this is
so hard well I think you know what I
think I'm gonna stop there
because I have three floors left and
then that's the end of the game so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stop for now
and then in the next part of the video
next time I do this I'm going to try to
beat I'm gonna go whole hog and try to
beat the entire game like the rest of it
so that's what I'm gonna do so thank you
guys for joining me it's been fun like
always and I always hang around in the
chat system a little for a little bit
after I finish up but either way like
always please leave your questions and
comments down below otherwise so next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
