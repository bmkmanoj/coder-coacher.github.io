of my Samsung mobile sdk tutorial today
we are going to look at the samsung s
look ere button and all the cool things
you can do with it and I have a lot to
do so let's just jump into it and of
course this is brought to you because
the Samsung smart app challenge in which
up to 12 winners have the opportunity to
win 1.1 million dollars and if it is
still November 2013 in the description
under the video you will find a way to
win from me and the nice people at
Samsung a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or one
of three Samsung Galaxy gear smart
watches ok so let's take a look at what
we're gonna do alright so this is a
demonstration of err button and I'm
gonna walk you through every piece of
code step by step to see exactly what's
gonna happen here
basically what err button allows us to
do is to create customized menus right
on the screen by clicking on the button
on the S Pen so for example if somebody
would click on frequent list a list of
different people's names are going to
pop up in the screen in this situation
but you're gonna see there are numerous
other different things we can do so
basically what is going on here well the
first thing we're gonna need to do is
define a button which is gonna be
frequent lists in this situation and its
name is going to be button recipient
recipient meaning these names then
what's gonna happen is a method called
create recipient list widget from view
is going to be called and it is going to
create an instance of the s look ere
button then what's going to happen is
this method is gonna call this method
get adapter recipient list and it's
going to return an array list which is
going to be displayed inside of this
menu you see right here there's actually
four menus so now let's take a look at
the menu menu button over here whenever
it's clicked this nice menus gonna pop
up with little images inside of it
basically we'll have the button menu
that's what this is called whatever it's
clicked on its gonna call create menu
widget from view which is gonna call get
adapter menu list which is gonna give us
on an array list which is going to
create this menu also if show text is
clicked on which is called button text
button text is a reference to this guy
down here whenever button text is
clicked on create text list widget from
view is going to be called again another
s look ere button is going to be
generated which is going to call get
adapter string list which is going to
return an ArrayList which is gonna
display this menu and then finally also
to demonstrate that we can use just
straight images whenever this button
down here is clicked which is called
button image it's gonna call create
image list widget from view which is
gonna call get adapter image list which
is gonna return an ArrayList which is
going to create this menu so as you can
see we're gonna be doing the same thing
for different times and generating four
totally different customized menus so
there's a lot to do so let's just jump
into the code okay so here we are inside
of activity err buttons simple this is
XML file it's going to handle the layout
for exactly what you just saw and of
course there was a background in that so
I'm gonna show you how to generate a
background just call Android background
is equal to and then we're gonna put a
draw ball inside of this so draw a bull
and then we can look inside it here you
can see background right there and if
you're wondering where background is
it's over here in drawable xxhdpi come
down inside here and there you see
background and if I click on it you're
gonna see the background that you just
previously saw so I'm not gonna do that
then we're gonna be able to go in here
and go Android and give this an ID equal
to at plus ID and I'm gonna call this
route layout and that's all we're gonna
need to do for that then we're gonna go
over into the graphical layout and we're
gonna get our buttons and we're
basically just gonna drag some buttons
over here and drop them into place not
gonna worry about where they are we're
gonna line them up inside of the XML
code so just come up here and form
widgets grab a button throw it wherever
grab another button throw it wherever
grab another button throw it wherever
and grab another button and throw it
wherever so there we go there's all our
buttons then I'm gonna click inside of
the XML file and set these buttons up
properly now remember I already gave the
buttons a name so this first button
we're gonna deal with here is going to
be button recipient we're gonna have its
width be fill parent wrap content is
perfectly fine for our height aligned
parent top in this situation is going to
be true we're gonna get rid of a line
parent left all together and then we're
also going to have this be center Horace
Arnel so I come in here select that
layout and Center horizontal and leave
that set for true and this guy we can
get rid of altogether the margins and
then for the text in this we're going to
put frequent lists and I'm just gonna
hold off until I got all the buttons set
up before we take a look at exactly what
we have and it's given me a little
yellow line there because it wants this
in strings.xml I'm going to create the
next one which is gonna be button text
just like I showed you previously within
this situations gonna be 200 di P height
wrap content perfectly fine aligned
parent I'm gonna change this well I'm
gonna get rid of this all together
change this to a line parent bottom set
that to true and also we're going to get
the layout Center horizontal copy that
paste that in there and get rid of this
margin all together as well and we're
gonna give this a name of show text
scroll down inside of here now we're
gonna create the button menu width is
gonna be set for 100 di P height wrap
content perfectly fine I'm just gonna
get rid of these all together copy this
guy right here paste that in there
change this to Center vertical and
actually I want to use a margin this
time now of course you're going to lay
this out on the screen but because I
want this to be exactly the same as what
I had in the example I want everything
to line up exactly right change this to
50 di P and then give this the name of
menu and then finally we're going to
have button image width is gonna be 60
di P height wrap content perfectly fine
there's not gonna be any margin on this
rid of that let's get in a line parent
bottom back down here paste that in
there and then an align parent right and
set that to true and then finally for
the text we're gonna put a plus sign
because that's what we had before file
save it and there you can see everything
is laid out exactly like we had before
all right except it was horizontal
before but whatever I'm not gonna worry
about that so now I have to jump into
air buttons simple activity dot Java and
I'll explain every single thing we're
gonna do here basically we have our
imports they're all out of the way we
have to define the layout we want to use
with set content view and that's going
to be our die layout dot and then we're
going to use activity err buttons simple
there it is
there the guy we just created semicolon
and then we're going to initialize these
buttons so first off we're going to get
button menu is equal to convert that to
a button find view by ID or dot ID dot
and then we're going to get button menu
right there if you don't remember this
is one we're dealing with button menu is
this guy which means we're going to be
calling create menu widget from view and
then calling get adapter menu list to
get the array list to create this guy so
let's do that
call create menu widget from view pass
it button menu and then we're gonna have
to create this copy that come down here
and of course I'm gonna put a link to
all the code in the description for this
it's going to return an S look err
button just paste that in there of
course we're going to be getting a
button but then we're gonna pass this as
a view because everything's of you
pretty much component wise anyway and
what we're gonna do is create an
instance of the s look err button so
we'll go s look err button call this
error button widget equal to new let's
look err button and then we're gonna
pass the view or the button in this
situation and then we need to call get
adapter menu list which we're gonna
create here in a second and of course
it's going to return the ArrayList that
we're going to use then we have to
define the type of menu we want to use
so call s look err button again and
we're gonna type in UI type menu this
guy right here and you know what the
menu looks like because I just showed
you and make this a lowercase L sorry
about that as well as that one and
basically what this means right here is
what we're saying is we want the menu
display version of all the potential
possible menus that we would want to use
now this menu in this situation isn't
gonna be scrollable it will however have
an image and it's also gonna have text
and on top of that it's going to be
displayed in horizontal manner now when
you're using images to create this menu
just to note this it's best to have them
be 32 DP by 32 DP drawables and i'll get
into exactly where those are going to be
stored here in a second now remember we
have to create get adapter menu list now
what the heck might we'll just create it
now and like i said before this is going
to return an S look err button adapter
paste that in there
then we're going to create our ArrayList
which we're gonna store everything
inside of and everything's going to be
stored as err button items call this
item list and then this is just going to
be a call to array list about to dock
just like always brackets in there and
there we go then we're just gonna call
item list add new where you get err
button item we're gonna have to get a
drawable so we're going to have to make
a call to get resources and then call
get drawable and then in this situation
specifically called drawable dot I see
menu add and this is going to be the
image that shows up inside of there make
sure we put the dot right there and not
right here Calma and then the text that
we want to show up which is gonna be the
word add another comma and then we're
just gonna put in all inside of there if
you want to know where that drawable is
it's over here again in the same
resources folder we scroll up drawable
xxhdpi and there you can see I see menu
add let's open it just to do it and
there you can say it's a plus sign so
that's the image we're gonna be using
and then for every single menu item that
we want to put inside of there we just
do that over and over again for all
those different menu options so I just
went ahead and did that for you let's
line these up so they look nice and
there we go we're gonna do the same
exact thing each time for every menu
item that we want to put inside of there
so pretty easy and then finally we just
call return after we have everything set
up properly no best look err button
adapter and pass our item list there you
are all set up and I think previously I
said an ArrayList was going to be
returned but no indeed an S look err
button adapter is what's returned and
that's what we're going to use sorry
about the confusion so now we just need
to jump back up inside of this guy right
here and we're gonna define the display
direction for these items so I'm gonna
call err button widget and set Direction
call s look err button and then we're
gonna go Direction right there we go
then we're gonna set the item select
listener instance that's gonna receive
an event if one of these buttons should
be clicked on and then we're gonna go
like this
err button widget set item select
listener and callback which is gonna be
used to select and open a toast to
display this specific item that was
clicked we're gonna create M call back
here in a second and then finally return
air button widget it's a pretty cool so
now let's create M call back let's just
create it right here call private return
an item select listener and call back is
equal to new item select listener and
let's just do this in line throw in a
semicolon it's gonna say hey you need to
implement a method okay there you are
click on that there's our method and
this is specifically going to be called
whenever an item is selected inside of
the menu and then just to keep this nice
and simple we're just going to call
toast make text and you all know what
that is because we've covered it a whole
bunch of times now simple activity this
past the context and we're going to go
and put a message inside of this which
is just going to say specifically which
item was clicked on and then at the end
of that that items index is going to be
transferred over here to Arg 1 and then
our duration for the toast to remain on
the screen it's just going to be length
short again there we go and then of
course we have to show the toast by
calling shell and we're done with that
so basically everything works for one of
our menus completely so to basically
understand exactly what's going on there
you just have to understand exactly what
we just did now we're basically going to
do the same thing for for 3 more
different menus in slightly different
ways so what are we gonna do we're gonna
create another button or initialize
another button this is going to be
button recipient course cast it to be a
button 5 you by ID let's just copy it
let's just copy the whole thing here
paste that in this is going to be button
recipient though there we go we're going
to take button recipient passed it to
pretty much the same type of method that
we just passed the previous to except
this one's going to be create recipient
list widget from view which means of
course we have to create this so let's
just create it right here it's going to
be public and of course this is gonna be
called whenever the button recipient is
clicked and just like before it's gonna
return an S look our button
paste in that gigantic name of course is
gonna be passed of you which is the
button and we're gonna do pretty much
the same exact thing we're gonna create
an instance of the s look ere button
let's just copy this paste that in there
save ourselves some time except in this
situation we're in a call get adapter
recipient list so I'll just change this
into recipient there we go and then this
is going to be UI type list and this
basically just means that we want to
display a list and that's this guy right
here okay remember here's the recipients
and we're also going to want to define
the display direction for our items
using set directions like before so a
meds will just paste that inside of
there except in this situation since we
want them to go down we're gonna put
lower inside of there and basically the
different options for a list item are
going to either be upper lower or
direction auto which is just going to
lay them in there the way that the
think's best yeah and we're gonna do
pretty much the same thing here called a
set item select listener to catch and
then put the index clicked on inside of
a toast and then we're also going to
return the air button widget say so it's
very much the same sort of thing there
that is so now we have to create get
adapter recipient list guess what it's
gonna be very very similar to get
adapter menu list call public it's gonna
return an S look pair button adapter
names different of course we're going to
create an ArrayList just like we did
before and we're gonna do pretty much
the same sort of thing with item list
but I'm gonna go through this one time
era button item item list everything
else is gonna be exactly the same here
instead for item list add we're still
gonna have new Air button item but in
this situation it drawable is going to
be the same for everything so this is
going to be recipient every single time
and then here we're going to put in very
specific names so we'll put in Alexander
Hamilton and then null fill in all the
other in different names and then put in
return new s look ere button adapter and
return the item list again okay so
instead of jumping through all that code
and what making you watch me type all of
it out I'm just gonna go through the
rest of these really quick because
they'll work pretty much exactly the
same way this time we're going to create
the button image menu that you see right
here so we're gonna come in here create
the button image find the view by
calling button image then we're going to
call create image list
you then we're gonna call create image
list widget from view which is actually
right here what are we gonna do then of
course when button image is clicked this
guy is going to be called it's going to
return an SLO care button we're then
going to create a new instance of s look
ere button this is going to generate an
array list which is going to have
everything in our menu and that
ArrayList is going to have a whole bunch
of air button items and of course this
is going to return an adapter just like
it did before we're gonna use UI type
list again just like before we're gonna
use this guy to handle whenever an item
is selected and then it is going to
display a toast on the screen we're
going to set our widgets position by
calling gravity left which is making it
show up on the left side of our button
we're going to have the direction be
upper which means it's gonna start from
the bottom where the little button was
and go upwards of course we're gonna be
able to use Direction lower or direction
auto as well just like before and then
we're going to define the position of
the air button specifically using X and
y coordinates to move it exactly where
it needs to be and then finally we're
gonna call air button widget and if you
want to take a look here real briefly it
get adapter image list which is going to
return that adapter here it is right
here what are we gonna do again gonna
create an ArrayList of air button items
we're going to add them by calling it
resources get drawable in this situation
we're going to pull in all those
different pictures we saw before and
those pictures are of course over here
in the same folder as we referred to
previously we're not gonna have any text
inside of these so we're gonna put in
all right there putting all right there
and everything is set up and then the
final one is basically going to simulate
using a really quick way of answering
text messages and this is going to be
the button text button down here which
is gonna call create text a list widget
from view and it's gonna get the adapter
by calling it adapter string list so we
create our button just like before and
then we call create text widget from
view and here is create text list widget
from view it's gonna create an S look
ere button just like before gonna call
get adapter string list which I'm going
to show you here in a second it's also
going to be a type list it's going to
have this guy right here handle what's
going to be displayed on the screen when
one of those I
is clicked on which you already know
what that is it's going to also set the
position for this little menu by
defining the Y position and letting X be
0 and it's going to return an error
button widget and then down inside of
here we're not going to have a picture
in this situation so we're gonna leave
this bean all we're only gonna have text
so we're gonna put all our text inside
of there this is going to be null now
that we have our ArrayList filled up
with air button items we're going to
return it and then a final thing we're
gonna do in this example is a little
toast popped up to tell the person what
to do so we are just going to do the
same thing by calling toast make text
pass the context put our little message
inside of it please hover and press the
s-pen side button on each button and
then finally how long will it show up on
the screen and set that to short and
then of course call show and everybody's
happy and you're an expert on how to use
the air button and all of these other
cool capabilities that we covered here
today please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
