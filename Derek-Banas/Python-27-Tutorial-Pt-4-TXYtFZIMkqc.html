of my python 2.5 through 2.7 tutorial
where I'll explain everything you want
to know about the Python programming
language first I'm going to show you I'm
sorry I didn't show you this in the past
the way to make your code your Python
code and actual executable now if I type
in LS it's going to show me all of the
different code that I have here and oh
by the way if I jump back to eclipse you
can see this is the basic hello world
type of program well I want to make it
into an executable now of course I could
execute it by typing in Python code 3
dot py and it's going to print hello
world of the screen however if I would
type in instead it's not going to allow
me to execute that code without calling
for the Python program to execute it for
me however if I come in here I've been
changed mod a plus X followed by test
code 3wy and execute that I'm now going
to be able to execute this onto the
screen just like it was a regular
application so all you need to do
remember is CHM OD a plus X followed by
your Python code name and of course put
the location of your interpreter here
and everything will work itself out now
I'm going to jump into conditionals what
conditionals allow you to do is run
certain lines of code if certain
conditions are met and run other
versions of code if conditions are not
met and to do this inside a Python we
use the if statement and as well there's
something called the conditional
expression which I'll get into here but
there is no switch statement but I'll
show you how to create a facade Oh
switch statement inside of Python so
let's say you wanted to check on
somebody's age well we're going to
create a variable called your age and
we're going to surround it with the int
function so that we can convert this
string into an integer that we'll be
able to test and we're going to ask them
how old are you and then inside of
Python unlike almost all other
programming languages whitespace is
extremely important there are no
semicolons at the end of statements so
Python knows when you hit a new line and
go to the next line that that is the end
of the statement well with the if
statement what we're going to do here is
we're going to check if the value they
entered is equal to 35
my situation and we're going to note
that this is the beginning of an if
statement by putting a colon in here see
it automatically in dented now
everything that remains indented is
going to be executed if your age is
actually equal to 35 as you're going to
say I'm just going to have one thing
here but you could put many and if their
age is entered as 35 it's going to print
as the screen same as me now I'm leaving
this I don't want any other statements
executed so I have to get rid of that
tab and also all your whitespace has to
be exactly the same distance from the
left in words that's very important and
I'm just gonna simply say if that is not
true then else I want to print different
from me to the screen and that's it
if I hit f5 how old are you let's say
I'll enter 33 and it says different from
me okay real simple now let's say you
wanted to check for multiple get
different conditions because this isn't
very useful on its own so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create what
is often called an else if but in Python
is called an ill if and what I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to check for
a different condition so let's say ennum
by the way you don't have to put these
braces here but I just think it's easier
to read and that's the reason why I do
put the braces in there so I'm going to
say is greater than 35 and then I'm
going to issue a different set of
statements or one different statement so
I'm going to check if the age is 35
printed this to the screen if the age is
greater than 35 my print this is screen
and guess what else this will always be
executed the first statements are not
executed and let's run that I order you
let's say 60 56 older than me so that's
the basics of an if l if-else statement
remember the colon here and remember the
whitespace very very very important you
could also do compound if statements so
let's go if or age is greater than zero
and there's another operator for you I
went over the and operator previously
there so this is the most common way to
use that operator I'm going to check I'm
just going to guess that the person
that's doing this is more than likely
going to be a positive age obviously or
they are going to be younger than 100
funny not trying to age discriminate
here and I tab this in to have this in
remember make sure everything stays the
same distance apart very important and
then what I'm going to do here is all of
these statements are executed if both of
these come back true and if not put my
else statement down here and don't
forget to put the colon here and if we
execute this how old are you let's say I
type in 145 it's going to say don't lie
about your age so it's going to skip
over all of this code and jump down here
to this else statement and print this
out now of course I could have checked
for this condition and an L if and then
in check this condition but this is a
lot easier to understand I think you
would agree and that's the basics of the
if statement now inside of Python there
is no such thing as a switch statement
and if you do not know I'm going to show
you here briefly what a switch statement
normally looks like it's normally the
word switch and this is very common in
most programming languages just Python
doesn't have it variable past let's say
so the switch statement is normally past
a certain variable and in most
programming languages you also have
these curly braces Python does not use
them either and then normally what you
see is something like case u1 all about
: and then form certain actions followed
by break which you're going to hear
about in the next tutorial and then a
whole bunch of these case statements
what it's going to basically do is like
let's say for example this is your age
what it would do is it would check okay
is your age want and then perform a
certain action and then there would be
another case statement underneath of
this for example it's just copy this and
let's say the next ones too and it would
print out a specific message or perform
certain different statements over and
over and over and over again so it's
just checking on an individual basis
what these different values are and
normally your switch statement has
something like default instead of the
else statement that you saw previously
and then it performs default actions
okay this is what switch looks like in
almost every programming language Python
does not have a switch statement but
basically you could implement a switch
statement much like I previously showed
you by just using a basic if statement
so B if
your age is equal to 1 : perform certain
actions LF your age is equal to 2
perform certain actions and this is the
most understandable way to do or to
create a switch statement there are very
complicated ways that would just confuse
you I could I could do very different
complicated things here but this is just
the basic ways that you would implement
a switch statement inside of Python
because it does not exist and then
finally we have what is called a
conditional expression so let's put the
hash symbol here and remember with the
commented outlines they're completely
ignored by the interpreter oh and by the
way this is how you would create a
multi-line comment just put in 3 quotes
followed by all of the comment you want
to make and then followed by 3
additional quotes that's how you would
create a multi-line
commenting statement I got a question
about that in email but this is the
conditional expression we're going to do
here is we're going to define two
variables and this is shortcut way to
divine those two variables so it's going
to store one in X and 0 in Y and then
what we're going to do is change the
value of a based off of the values of x
and y meaning we're going to store a
certain string meaning this string here
if this condition is met meaning that Y
is less than X else we are going to
store a different string in a if this
condition is not true and then we can
print a to screen and we all answer this
one real quick Y is less than X was
stored in the variable a because the
condition was true that Y indeed was
less than X meaning that Y had a value
of 0 and X at a value of 1 and those are
how you use conditional statements
inside of Python if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below
