to create an nearly on limitless number
of wordpress themes with program called
artist stir that only cost fifty dollars
I never ever talked about products that
cost anything but in this case I think
they're absolutely amiss program is
amazing it's worth its weight in gold
fifty bucks 4995 this is the program
artist er i'm going to show you real
quickly how how easy it is to throw up
together i work for us you'll see when
you open up the program that it loads
this is on a mac i actually normally use
the pc version because supposedly the
mac versions buggy but i never had a
prob with either one of them now you can
see here if you actually clicked on
suggest assign it's just going to
randomly create you a bunch of new
designs well I like to just jump right
into it you can see here before clicking
on layout and let's say I want what's
called a header on top here with a menu
underneath I just click here header menu
and it automatically creates it if I
want this to be a set up in regards to
columns with a big one on the left the
one on the right which is the most
common I just click on that if I want to
change my background click on image and
texture gives you a whole bunch of
different options in regards to
backgrounds and so forth and if you want
to apply you just click that going
through this really quick so I can cover
everything in this one eye tutorial get
in under the 10 minute so let's say I
made that as my background I decide I
don't want these bubbles over here click
on glare got rid of them I could put all
kinds of different shapes so forth in
here if you just rest your mouse over
talk to voters see what they would look
like let's say in this situation that's
what i wanted to glare i'm just going
through this room quickly pick our
gradient a whole bunch of different
gradients that are available to you
let's say i want to go from dark the
light click on it and want to change the
background color to something that would
work look at it look a little bit better
for me so it's just how it's simple is
this to do click on sheet that's this
whole entire page here want to add globe
just click on that say glow is add no
border if i wanted to add a border it's
just a simple it automatically generate
everything for you want to throw a
different type of shadow on it just
click on that you say automatically
updated I could change my padding set up
now to currently have no padding let's
say I wanted to add something click on
that you see how everything shrunk in
from the outside of the overall web page
can set it up so that I of transparency
and the website just by doing that and
now you can see the background actually
shows through but that's not really good
form so we're going to get rid of that
there's just tons of things you can mess
with this header is way too big once how
hard it is to change that click on app
if you didn't see all I did it to change
the type the height of the header is to
go in here and change this Co change now
let's say I want my overall width to be
1,000 automatically did it now I want to
go in here I can actually throw in my
own photograph in here if I wanted to do
that don't want to say I wanted to
change the overall effect put something
you can see all these effects that are
available to you I mean it's really
amazing um just throw something in there
it's crazy just to do something or I can
do a texture
let's say in this situation that's what
I want to do come in here maybe texture
such as that automatically applies it in
here is where you would put your load
any type of logo that you want to use I
have one pre-installed there you see it
now if I want to move this logo over
here reach in here grab it throw it in
click ok here's my headline change the
positioning on this all I did was click
on the position right here grab it move
it over I know this isn't the prettiest
thing on earth I'm actually just trying
to do this really quickly now so I
wanted to change the overall styling on
my menu so many different options
available sale like that I want to
change I could put any texture on here
for a fill let's say I wanted to make
this a darker color say I wanted to
change you see here's a drop-down menu
coloring options that are available to
me it's just literally you just click
it's just so simple go into the article
want everything to be left justified
indented out Bennett if I wanted to
change my line my spacing between my
characters if I wanted to change the
distance between these the lines of text
make more legible just click there see
automatically works I mean it's just a
really dynamic nice program just to show
you the different types of bullets that
are available I mean a whole host of
different bullets
different table styles blocks what that
refers to its the space over here let's
say I wanted to do a more simplistic
styling on the left all I did is just
clicked on that boom automatically
change and I want to make the change it
again change the header the text put an
icon next to change the icon a sexay
automatically change want to change my
button styling want to change my footer
at the bottom of the page if I wanted to
put multiple different RSS feeds you
don't know what our senses don't worry
about that so just clicked on that
automatically updates and then to export
all that you do whoops want to do that
if you want to expert this as a
wordpress theme just go down here more
than likely you're going to want to
export it as a zip archive that way you
can easily upload it on your theme
website hit export and you're ready so
that was basic review of Lord astir

substantial version which I have not
played around with and set up more for
customer management sites so hope you
