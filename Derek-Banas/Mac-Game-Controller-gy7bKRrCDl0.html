tutorial on the best Macintosh game
controller and as you can see right here
let's just cut to the chase it is the
sony ps3 DualShock 3 wireless controller
i tested multiple different off brands
and regular brands the xbox360
controller and it either would not work
or it would cause all kinds of problems
with my wireless mouse and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
set up everything it's actually very
very easy now the first thing you're
going to want to do is take this
controller you see on your screen and
you're going to want to plug it in to
your Macintosh so that they are
connected and you may have to sit here
for a little bit and let it charge up
after that is all set up you're going to
come down to your system preferences and
just to understand it might have to sit
there for an hour to make sure
everything is charged up good and double
click on it then you're going to see
this screen right here pop up and then
we're going to click on Bluetooth which
is right here and then we are going to
click on our plus sign right after we
disconnect our controller from the cable
so disconnected from the cable and then
you're going to hold down the PS button
which is in the center of the road it's
a circle just hold it down then you can
see sometimes it directly connects
sometimes it requires the plus button to
be hit those are the only differences
then it's going to ask you for a
passcode you are going to enter 0 0 0 0
and then click on pair now as soon as
that disappears off the screen which is
going to happen here in a second there
you go you're going to click on this and
then you're very quickly going to come
down here to this little cog and click
add to favorites that's very very
important that'll keep everything paired
and working perfectly and then you can
click on the COG again and click on
update services now it's going to go off
and say disconnected for a second and
then it's going to come right back on
your screen and show as connected as you
see right there then you can also come
over here sometimes it says that it's
paired to the device sometimes it says
that it isn't don't worry about it it
works it's wireless right now just the
important part is to configure it and to
mark it as a favorite and connected of
course shows that it's connected now
let's get into how to make this guy
actually work we're going to close this
and then we're going to go down in
System Preferences again and a tool I'm
going to use is actually called
pad companion however unlike the $8.00
version I'm using version 2.4 and
there's a link underneath the video if
you want to get ahold of that and it's
free I actually do not like the 3.1
version which cost eight dollars because
it messes up my mouse well either way
after you click on system preferences
you're going to see game pad companion
you're going to double click on that and
it's going to say it needs to shut and
then reopen okay fine and there it is so
here is game pad companion as you can
see right here on your screen and here
is your playstation controller now what
you're going to have to do for every
single game is map out what codes you're
going to want to use kind of a pain but
after you do it the first time it's
actually pretty easy so you're going to
go through and you're going to click on
each of your buttons I'm going to get
out of minecraft minecraft' I'm going to
tell you its kind of buggy everything
works except for the mouse movements
where you scroll around but really it is
one of the only games that is buggy I'm
going to go into braid which is a quite
simple one and I'm going to press on the
X button in the controller you're going
to see how it changes here I have the
press of the X button on the controller
is set to space and you're just to do
that you just click on single key and
it's going to pop up and say okay what
sync okay and you click on space that's
all you're going to do and then if you
want to set up so that you can move both
with the regular stick you can see here
I just clicked on left on my regular
stick on my controller and you want to
set it up for multiple keys so if I
press it to the left which would be a
negative x position you're going to want
to click on multiple keys in that
situation and then type in da and that's
going to stick for both parts of the
stick now if you press up you're going
to type in s W and also select multiple
keys on that and you're able to come in
here and mess around with sensitivity
and such I found that for works pretty
good and of course you're also going to
be able to set up the regular pad in
this situation for braid that's going to
be up arrow right arrow down arrow
you're just going to have to go through
and set each one of these individual
parts so here is my X key which is space
square is going to be shift then I don't
know if you've ever played braid or not
but shift allows you to either increase
or decrease time I also set shift for my
left trigger button
and then on my right to trigger buttons
this is going to be the up arrow which
is going to increase speed and this is
going to be the down arrow which is on a
decrease speed and then to actually use
this controller inside of a game you
have have to click on start just like
that and then let's look and see what
this looks like inside of an actual game
and here is the start of braid and you
can see I'm using my right joystick on
my gamepad and I'm controlling the mouse
I'm going to click on launch and I
mapped out my left mouse button to the
triangle button on the controller and
platformer games work awesome for this
and as you can see there I am jumping
across the screen pretty easy there I am
and I started this over and there you
can see it's very very easy to get this
all going and working let's go into the
actual game and here we are again just
jumping around being a little crazy this
is actually a fabulous game by the way
if you've never played it
and there you go braid braid braid braid
braid and you go and get your puzzle
pieces and you're just gonna have to go
through and actually figure out how to
map these controls best for each
individual game and then I escaped and
quit let's go into a little bit more
complicated game which is going to be
Bastion and to get this guy set up what
I have to do inside of game companion is
I got it open here and I have to stop my
current controls make sure that I have
PlayStation controller selected over
here and then I have each one of my
games saved inside of here and here's
Bastion and if you want to change any of
the keys that is up here on your screen
and then save that configuration you
just click on save configuration and
this isn't the free version of game
companion so let's go into Bastion and
see what it looks like with a little bit
more complicated game here we're going
to actually control the normal Mouse X&amp;amp;Y
positions with the right joystick and
then we're just going to click on start
and go into Bastion and Here I am I'm
gonna go in and I can control my mouse
just like before it continue and Here I
am in Bastion you can see I'm just
jumping around being a little crazy some
games you're just going to notice this
you're not going to be able to do
everything from the controller you're
just gonna have to do some of it using
the mouse like here I have to click on
this which I could have done with my
controller I could have gone up here and
click on that but then sometimes I have
to go over with the mouse and click on a
couple other things but in general
everything's wired completely could it
to the controller and here's Bastion you
can see I'm able to play it even on the
kind of inferior Macintosh system and
you can say this is one to be one of the
buggy things I'm just telling you all
pauses and negatives you're going to
have to really play around your
sensitivity to make sure that you get it
set properly for the type of game that
you're playing so but one of the
positives is some games are easier
because you can use things like shields
and so forth and so on and just so you
know how this is all set up a hundred
percent let's cook on PlayStation and
let's go over this is going to be the
guy this is going to be your right
joystick on your controller this is
going to be the guy where you need to
play with sensitivity and set it to
whatever works for you so there you go
there is the number one Mac game
controller I tested five of them and
without a doubt this guy works perfect
on all three operating systems pretty
much the first time if you want to get
the game
add companion software there's a link
underneath the video you can get it it's
free and so forth and so on leave any
questions comments or requests below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
