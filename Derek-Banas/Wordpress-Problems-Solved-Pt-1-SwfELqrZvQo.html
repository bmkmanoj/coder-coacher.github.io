wordpress problem solved here i'm going
to cover all the most common issues
people have with wordpress I've made at
this point over 40 WordPress sites and
i've taught over 20 people how to use
wordpress and in this tutorial as well
as the next 2 i'm going to completely
explain all of the issues that people
normally have with wordpress first one
of the number one issues that people
have with wordpress is finding a way to
legally copy content from other websites
easily well wordpress comes with a great
tool it's called press this and if you
go to your left sidebar and click on
tools you'll see right here this link
press this click on bookmark this link
and it'll go into your bookmark area for
me it's right here and this is how it
works let's say I see something over to
Huffington posted i like and i want to
legally copy it what press this does for
you is it limits the amount that you're
able to copy so there that gets by
certain legal constraints it also will
create a link back to the original
article this is all you do so let's say
i want to copy this right here just
select it with the mouse go back up to
my bookmarks find press this click on
press this and it took all the
information from that post and put it in
here for some reason some websites do
not keep the paragraphs in order so i
have to clean that up which really
stinks and also this is a common error
I've known you that it's a great app and
i'm showing you all the things that are
wrong with it this is only true with
some websites that this occurs you can
see here there's an apostrophe error i
have to go in and fix that like i said
this doesn't happen on that many
websites and it doesn't happen on all
the articles okay got that all done now
i'm going to go over here and put in
some keywords that are that would be
associated with this click on add i'm
going to click on news under categories
but you could also add a new category if
none of these made sense then you click
on publish automatically posted now if i
jump over to my website and there you
can see it there's the article right
there it automatically got posted a
hundred percent legal and
other issue that a lot of people have in
regards to using WordPress involves how
to properly add titles descriptions and
keywords to your posts what I did was I
installed a plug-in on WordPress called
all in one SEO it automatically if you
scroll down here will generate titles
descriptions and keywords for you the
only problem is they're normally bad
because what it does is it finds the
most commonly used words and then
generates your descriptions and keywords
and titles based off of that well that
might not be what you want as you can
see right here I'm going after jQuery
people with jquery keywords and these
are all keywords people type in because
I've used the software that tells me
that well what I want to make sure I do
is type in a title that properly uses
keywords I want to use those same
keywords in my description and then of
course I want to list some of those key
words in my keyword area now you should
never put many of these in here
otherwise google just disregard them and
you should never go over 160 characters
well the all in one SEO pack
automatically does that he adds you
should never go over 60 characters in
your title it makes sure that you don't
do that as well so it's a great tool it
just doesn't quite do what it's supposed
to and of course also make sure you come
up to the tag section a wordpress and
put those same good keywords in here and
don't forget to hit add that's another
common problem that people have in
regards to filling out this information
now on to the media library this is the
number one problem that I see people
having in regards to WordPress website
let's jump over here to a pose I'm going
to show you how to add media you can add
images or whatever you want directly
inside of the edit post area or edit
pages and here is where you add images
here is where you can add video but I
don't because it's broken most of the
time here you can add audio and I would
never use this right here which is add
media i'm going to show you an
absolutely awesome way to add different
types of document types directly into
your wordpress posts but the images work
great click on that now what you can do
is you can select a file an image file
directly from your website so i'm going
to
that it will automatically upload that
image to your media library then you
want to add in a touch well the titles
automatically there you want to add in
alternative text just to keep this quick
i'm going to put this in if a
description didn't automatically go in
there you also want to put a description
in then you would make decisions on
alignment in regards to whether you want
the image to go left center or right and
you would choose what size of image you
want to insert into your post let's say
I just decide to do a thumbnail click on
insert into post and that's all you do
to add an image into a post now let's
say that you want to edit this image
just do that click on that little
picture and in under advanced settings
you'll see a way to add a border which I
commonly do add margin space to separate
it from the text and then you could put
in another title related links you could
make CSS styling to the image if you
wanted to so you can do all these little
neat things click update and since I'm
having an issue with it right now I'm
going to show you another tip see how
this box is real tiny I'm going to show
you how to make it bigger now i'm gonna
jump over into settings and left sidebar
writing size of post box which change
this to 20 lines come down here it save
changes now if i go back into pose and
click on edit see how it got bigger so
that's how you would increase the size
of your post box now let's say you want
to add video to this post as well I do
not like this embed tool and also
WordPress has a feature that as of this
writing sometimes works sometimes
doesn't work that feature is if you go
to youtube and you find a video that you
want to post as i'm doing right here i'm
gonna hit play then i'm going to grab
the URL let me jump back into this post
sometimes this works i paste the URL
directly right there and then it worked
but like I said sometimes it does not
work but that's one way to add video and
it's actually a really nice way to add
video another way to add YouTube video
and this is what is called Vipers video
quick tags that's what this whole string
of buttons is right here that's a
plugin you can download again vipers
video quick tags so I'm going to click
on YouTube paste you could change the
dimensions of the movie but I'm going to
choose not to and I'm going to hit okay
now if I hit preview you can see there
that it inserted the video right into
the post as well and I could also change
where the wind be left or right
justified what have you so those are two
ways to add video one works some of the
time the other one always works so let's
go back in here and edit some images
again I'm going to click on media here's
the images i just uploaded and i click
on edit now i can click on edit image a
lot of people don't know this exists you
can see here i can crop this image down
just like that i could also rotate the
image rotate it back flip it and these
are undo buttons i could also scale the
image so let's say I wanted this to be a
maximum width of 150 did that and it
automatically scales over here if I hit
scale click OK and it automatically
saves for me so that's some of the pre
built in ways that you can edit images
in WordPress so how do you embed pretty
much any type of document file directly
into your WordPress pages or any website
page there is a website called
scribd.com and what they allow you to do
is upload documents to be stored for
three on their website and then once you
do that you can embed pretty much any
type of document directly into your
website so what you got to do is go to
scribd com create an account there and
then whenever you want to upload a
document just click on upload upload
then you would find the document that
you would want to copy up there okay and
it automatically uploads everything
directly into your website now if you
want to take that document and embed it
into your WordPress website click on my
documents click on the file that you
want to embed scroll down here on right
see where it says in bed click on coffee
now jump back over into WordPress let's
say we want to put it into this again
edit now you're going to have to jump
into your HTML part of your where
press site scroll down prakhar here
paste hit save draft now if you click on
preview that was a PDF file by the way
that I uploaded you can upload doc files
microsoft occupiers excel files
powerpoint presentations just on the
different thing and as you can see here
is the PDF file available for anybody to
be able to look at you can put multiple
pages in here this is an absolutely
amazingly great tool I allow people to
download it I like people to print it
see it full screen I mean it is really
just an awesome tool and it's amazing
that it's available for free so I hope
that helps you a lot like I said a lot
of people have problems for some reason
with the media library inside of
wordpress obviously copying content
legally is an issue and a lot of people
do not know that scribd exists and this
is going to solve a lot of problems for
people so if you have any other
questions leave them in a comment
section below hope this helps you out
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
