my java video tutorial series today I'm
going to talk about the change listener
more GUI components and I'm going to
show you how to format numbers like add
commas and display different numbers as
currency among other things this is the
guy we're going to be creating this is
actually going to be broken over this
tutorial in the next tutorial as you can
see here I'm creating sliders pulling
information from multiple different text
boxes changing labels adding in
checkboxes and radio buttons and borders
that's what this is if you can't see
this stuff view at full screen
okay so let's just jump right into it
you want to see all of the code all in
one place there's a link right
underneath the video you can see it all
you won't have to wait till the next
video to come out so you've seen all
these other different things we got here
and like I said before I'm going to show
you the change listener event handler in
this tutorial and this is how you get to
it specifically so you have to go change
event and then you're also going to have
to import another library that's going
to be changed listener so that's if you
want to just import those guys that's
exactly where they are located
another thing I'm going to do because
I've received some questions on this I'm
going to show you how to format numbers
and if you want to do that your java
text number format and if you want to be
able to edit borders how you do that is
import Java X swing dot border so there
now you know where all of the different
libraries are that are required to do
all the different things I talked about
all right of course we have to come in
here and extend the jframe class and
you've seen how to do that before but I
thought what the heck I'll cover it and
then so that a whole bunch of different
variables are available throughout this
whole entire thing or fields I'm going
to create a button in this tutorial free
labels two text fields two checkboxes
for radio buttons and a slider and three
doubles so I think you can see this
tutorial is going to be pretty intense
well of course we need to go into our
main function we need to create our
frame I'm making a call to our
constructor file and that's how we do
that and then in our constructor file
we're going to create this guy and start
putting all this stuff together and as I
create everything I'm going to be
describing exactly what's going to
happen here so what I'm going to do I'm
going to create my frame and
to create a size right here I'm going to
say 400 by 400 so there you are I
created my frame or my window or
whatever you want to call it this is the
shortcut way to have the frame show up
in the middle of the screen I just throw
in all inside of here that automatically
makes it go right in the center of the
screen gonna define how the frame is
going to exit you saw this before jframe
takes it on close so that's gonna handle
exiting the frame or exiting the program
altogether
subtitle I'm gonna call it my third
frame because it is based off the other
tutorials and then I'm going to create a
J panel called
panel it's gonna hold all of my
components my thinking is as you see
these things being done a couple times
of course while I'm adding an additional
information eventually a substituent and
just totally sink into your head and
then we're going to create a button new
it's just going to calculate everything
then I'm going to create a listen for
event handler here and it's going to
monitor the button presses and do stuff
whenever the button is pressed and I'm
of course going to have to create this
method down below called listen for
button then we need to come in here and
tell Java that we want to be alerted
whenever the button is pressed and
that's exactly what this guy's going to
do for us then I'm gonna call the panel
and I want to say I want to add my
button that's all prepared through this
panel so all that stuff works now I want
to create a label do J label and then of
course we want to put something in there
for this label the label is just gonna
say number one like you saw it - getting
the tutorial and I'm gonna add the label
to it which is real simple just called
its name right like that and there you
go added the label now I want to be able
to create myself some text fields so
what am i doing doing the same thing
over and over and over again I'm gonna
say that I don't want any default value
to be in the text field I don't want it
to be five characters in length and I
want to call panel and text field one
all prepare to be working inside of
there then let's create another label
actually save ourselves some time I'm
gonna copy this stuff here since I'm
gonna be doing the same thing I might as
well not type it out so I'm just going
to go to there and then this is going to
be number two and of course change the
label right like that and then we come
down here
to do the same thing for the textfield
and the same thing for this text field
now I'm going to create my checkboxes
and what this is going to do is it's
going to define whether something is
going to show up as currency or whether
it's going to be comma separated as you
can see it we're following the same sort
of format for everything we're doing
here then I'll show you two different
ways to add these to the screen you can
just have them added like this or you
can add them to the panel by going comma
separator and true that's how you create
checkboxes and what true is going to do
is it's going to be checked by default
hence checkbox so it's going to be
checked now let's create some radio
buttons this gets a little bit more
complicated but we're still following
the same format a radio button quarters
because that's what you would think it
would be so that's going to create the
new radio button and this is going to
perform different types of
multiplication addition subtraction
bubble wah based off the radio button
and of course there can only one radio
button at a time selected so I'm going
to subtract numb so multiply nomes and
divide numbs and of course subtract it's
going to be the name next to the radio
button multiply and divide okay now what
I'm going to do is I want to create a
group that's going to contain all these
radio buttons what this is going to do
for me is it's going to make sure that
only one radio button at a time is
selectable but I see this is underlined
so that means something's wrong guessing
that I put multiply numbers in there
let's go look Malte nums that is right
there
so let's come down here make sure we get
that right okay now that's fine alright
so like I said I'm going to add all
these radio buttons to a group so that
whenever one of them is selected the
other ones are deselected well that's
equal to new button group okay so now
they're going to be all group now I want
to add all these radio buttons that I
just created to the group and we're
going to do it pretty much the same way
we add things to the panel choose copies
again subtract nomes Multan um I'm
actually going to make this lowercase
because it makes more sense now but I
think about it so make that lowercase
now we're all happy scroll back down and
design nomes so there we are we just
added all our radio buttons to the group
and now if I want to add this group to
the pane
that it lies on top of the frame I need
to create a new jpanel
and I'm gonna call it ope our panel is
equal to new the reason why I'm doing
this is I want to put a border around
all these guys so there you go got a new
panel set up now I'm going to surround
all these with a border like I said
before so I'm going to define my borders
how you do that and then you call border
factory die and I'm going to use create
titled border that means little title is
going to show up they're describing
exactly what you can check and in that
situation I'm going to say operation is
going to provide some information on
what type of border I want to use and
the other types of borders that are
available there's create each border
there's create line border create
lowered bevel border and create raised
bevel border like I said the codes
underneath the video if you want to
check those out so now that I created
both the border and the panel that's
going to surround all these guys I need
to set my border and that's exactly how
you do that so now not only do I have a
panel that is surrounding all of the
different radio buttons I also have a
border that surrounds them it also
describes what is inside of it so now I
need to add all of these different radio
buttons to this new panel that I have
you do not add groups you not add like
one singular group at a time to a panel
you have to add each of these guys
individually I'm add all those in there
that's something that confuses people at
time subtract multivitamin ohms to be
set by default I just go set selected
call that guy and this is a boolean
value so set that to true and now
whenever these radio buttons come up ad
is going to be selected by default if
you did don't put this in there nothing
would be selected by default
so it's a good idea to do that and then
I can add my new panel to the current
panel there I'm at an ope or panel to
the regular main panel now if I want to
create a slider which again you saw at
the beginning I'm going to call this
label free secret I know these names
aren't wonderful but I'm just trying to
cover everything and sometimes using
generic names I think works better so
I'm going to put in a label here so that
you know what the slider exactly is
going to be doing
typing panel so many times let's make
sure that I have this as label there you
got then add this new label to my panel
now name of my panel is how many times
I'm gonna create a new J slider and it's
gonna have a minimum value of 0 a
maximum value of 99 and an initial value
of 1 so that's what that guy does now
I'm going to show you a whole bunch of
different things you can do with these
sliders set minor tick spacing so what
this is going to do is they'll put a
little tiny ticks every one space on my
slider and then it's going to put a
larger tick by putting this set major
it's going to put a large tick on the
slider every 10 spaces easy to see move
that up then if you actually want these
things to show up on the screen you have
to call set paint ticks and that's going
to draw the ticks on the screen you
would think it would do that by default
but it doesn't so there you go and then
if you'd also like to actually have like
labels that explain exactly what you're
looking at set paint labels are going to
put numbers underneath there without
this there would be no numbers displayed
underneath this slider and then like so
for I'm gonna add a new listener from a
slider and we're adding these in exactly
the same way that we've added them for
and of course in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to create this guy
and then under here call how many times
and I'm gonna say that I want to and
change listener that just means that
it's going to alert me every single time
the slider is change and add then I'm
gonna add my slider there it is honor
and then on the main frame or the window
or whatever you want to call it I'm
going to add my panel to it and then set
visible to true that's going to make the
frame or the window up here on the
screen
and the final thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna call text field 1 and I'm gonna
request that the focus be on that
whenever the program is run in the next
part of the tutorial
I'm gonna finish everything else you see
here if you want to see what's going to
be covered though and cheat and jump
ahead you can look for the code
underneath the video leave any questions
or comments
