2 of my tutorial on learning how to
program by solving problems in this
tutorial we're going to continue on
where we left off from part 1 if you
didn't watch part 1 definitely watch
that there's a link in the description
as well as a link to a cheat sheet as
well as a transcript of the entire video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it ok so here I am back inside of
PyCharm and like I said before every
program is going to have the ability or
every programming language is going to
have the ability to perform actions on a
list of values and the example I'm going
to use here is the for loop and how we
create a for loop is we say for I in and
in this situation I'm going to provide a
list of values that I want to cycle
through so just a bunch of even numbers
and we end that with a colon now each
time we go through our loop the variable
I here is going to have a value from
this list assigned to it so the first
time throw is going to get 2 then it's
going to get 4 6 8 10 and so forth and
so on and then what we're going to do is
we're going to print out those values
just so we can see how they are going to
change and that's all we need to do and
whenever we run it you can see right
here that it was assigned those values
each time through the loop and printed
those out you can also use another tool
called range to define the list for us
and if we would come in here and say
range 10 then range will create a list
starting at 0 and go up to but not
include the value that's passed to it so
it's not going to include 10 in this
situation and if we run that you're
going to see that it cycles so starting
at 0 and prints out the whole way
through 9 we're also going to be able to
define the start and the end so if let's
say we want to cycle through here and
print out 2 through 9 we could also do
that as you can see right there 2 the
whole way through 9 and before we get to
our problem here in which we're going to
use a for loop I wanted to also talk
about how we can use modulus to see if a
number is odd or even now if we divide
and even by 2 so let's say we do
something like
I with the modulus of two and then we go
and check if the returned value remember
modulus returns the remainder of a
division if this comes back as zero then
in this situation that we know that this
indeed is odd so what we're going to do
here is I'm going to assign I equal to
two and then I'm going to print this out
just to verify that indeed that modulus
is going to tell us if we have an even
or an odd number so we can go and we can
run it and you can see the true comes
back so that is one way that we can
check to see if a value is indeed either
even or odd and we're going to use that
in our very first problem we're going to
have here in which I'm going to ask you
to print odds from one to twenty and
what you're going to want to do here is
use a for loop as well as range and then
you're also going to use if and modulus
to print out the odds so you can either
pause the video here or I'm going to
give you a couple tips on exactly what
you're going to do each way through and
then see if you get the right answer so
if you want to see some tips what we're
going to do here first is we're going to
use a for loop that is going to cycle
through the list from 1 to 21 that's the
very first thing you're going to want to
do then you're going to use modulus to
check that the result is not equal to
zero and then after that you are going
to just print the odds once again you
could pause the video and see if you can
solve this problem on your own I'm sure
you can and of course you can refer to a
B cheat sheets from previous parts of
this video to solve this you know this
little problem we have here okay so
hopefully you got this right now I'm
going to show you exactly at least my
way of doing so so we're going to use
range again and we want to cycle through
the numbers 1 through 20 so we're going
to use 21 just like I said previously
and good like this and next thing we're
going to want to do is use modulus to
check that the result is not equal to
zero and we need to indent
remember we want to use whitespace and
we want to do or perform these actions
inside of our for loop so what we're
going to do we're going to go if I
modulus two and this time instead of
equals we're going to say not equal to
zero put our colon inside of there and
then whenever we come down here we are
going to indent once again because we're
inside of the if statement and we are
going to print all of the values for I
and if we run that you can see indeed
that that does work cycle through one
three Dada Dada and the whole way
through nineteen and that is how we
would go and cycle through and print out
all the odds so hopefully got that
answer right if not don't worry about it
as you do more and more of these in
practice you will get better now I want
to talk about working with
floating-point numbers now a
floating-point number is just a number
with decimal values and let's come in
here and let's create one so I'm going
to say that I want to receive a value so
input and we'll ask the user to enter a
float then of course we want to convert
this from the string into a float and
just like we used int previously now we
are going to use the float function to
convert from a string into a
floating-point number and now what we
want to do is print out whatever value
they gave to us and what I want to do is
round it to two decimal places so
rounded to two decimals once again we're
going to use our curly brackets and then
inside of here if you want to round a
value to two decimal places you're going
to put : and then a period and then 2
and then since this is a floating point
number we're going to throw an F inside
of there and then once again we're going
to use format to define what value is
going to be placed wherever the curly
brackets are and if we run that it's
going to say and our float then I can
say something like one point two three
four five and you can see right there
rounded to two decimal places it's going
to convert that to 0.23 very important
and that is because now it's time for
you to do another problem and in this
one what we're going to do is
demonstrate compound
interest and what we're going to have to
do in our program here is have the user
enter their investment amount and their
expected interest on each year then what
we're going to do is each year their
investments will increase by their
original investment plus their
investments multiplied times whatever
the interest rate is then after that's
all done print out the earnings after a
ten-year period okay so you can go ahead
there and try to figure out how to solve
that problem or I can give you a couple
tips and then you can decide to go and
do that so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to ask for the money invested
plus the interest rate just like I said
previously then I want to convert the
value to a float and then after I do
that I want to convert value to a float
and round the percentage rate by two
digits that's a little bit of a trick
that was in this problem because if they
enter in a five for five percent well to
perform the multiplication you're going
to have to round that two digits I'll
show you how to do that and then what
you're going to do is cycle through ten
years using a for loop and range from
zero to nine and then the final thing
you're going to do of course is output
the results so you can go ahead and
pause your video now and try to solve
this and otherwise I'm going to show you
exactly how this is going to work so
what we're going to do here is we get to
this point ask for the money invested
and the interest rate so I'm going to
say money is equal to input and I'm
going to say how much to
invest and after we get that I'm going
to say interest rate is equal to input
and we're going to ask for the interest
rate they expect to earn now of course
we're then going to have to convert the
value to a float so money is going to be
equal to float and then we'll just pass
money back inside of there it will come
down here and what we like I said if
they enter a 5 we want to convert that
to 5% so what we're going to do is we'll
say interest rate is going to be equal
to float and then I'm going to get the
interest rate and then I'm going to
multiply that times 0.01 and that is
going to round over two digits then I'm
going to need to use a for loop to cycle
through all these guys I'm going to say
for I in range and if there's any
questions you have leave them in the
comment section below I will answer
every single question that I get and
then we're going to go money Plus and
then we'll go money times whatever the
interest rate is and you can see as that
goes on money's value is going to
continue to increase and then finally
what we'll do is we'll say print
investment after 10 years and we want to
print that out and we want to round it
to two decimal places : point 2f that is
how we define we want to put a
floating-point number inside of there
with only two decimal places and then
the final amount of money they have and
we could save that and we can run it and
we could say something like how much to
invest and we could say $10,000 and at
what interest rate we could say 5 and
you can see right there exactly how much
money the person would have in their
account after a 10-year period based off
of a 5% interest as well as an original
investment of $10,000 so there is
another problem hopefully you did well
with that once again if there's anything
that's catching you or how you know
causing any problems leave a comment
below
and don't worry too much if you didn't
get it right the thing that is very
important is whenever we are working
with floating-point numbers understand
that floating-point numbers in all
programming languages are not
necessarily precise so let's say for
example we define a variable called I
and we want to go and add up 0.1 and
like this and then subtract them so you
would think the value for I would be
equal to zero right well let's go and
see if that's true there's I and if we
run it you can see that it is a very
small number but that number is
definitely not zero and that is just
based off of how floating-point number
calculations are done but don't worry
about exactly why it's that way just
understand that floating-point numbers
are not necessarily precise and just as
another example let's go in here and
we'll throw some gigantic numbers inside
of here these are 32 digits long and
understand that floats will print
nonsense beyond 16 digits of precision
so for the most part
whenever you're performing calculations
on one float to another float you can
trust the first 16 digits but thereafter
you're going to get pure nonsense and
here I'll show you exactly how that
works so let's say answer and then I'll
just go : and here I'll say I 132
decimal places of precision and you're
going to see that that doesn't make any
sense in this situation and we'll go I
plus J and we'll run it and there you
can see if we look at this you can see
that all of these values in this
calculation are correct but after it
gets point past the point of 16 digits
the rest of this is all nonsense so just
be aware that whenever you are
performing floating-point calculations
that anything past 16 digits is going to
be completely bogus and should not be
relied upon at all and another thing
before we go on is I want to talk about
order of operations and basically the
way that works is that whenever we're
making calculations unless you use
parentheses multiplication and division
are going to supersede addition and
subtraction so let's say we have 3 plus
4
five and equal two and throw this inside
of here and go format and then perform
that calculation three plus four times
five understand that whenever we do this
that we're going to get completely
different results if we would go and
throw parentheses around these values
just like this and you can see indeed
that this is the way it works out here
what we're doing without the parentheses
is multiplying four times five first
then adding three in here what we're
doing is because we have parentheses
around this is adding three plus four to
get seven and then multiplying that
times five to get 35 so that is how
order of operations work as well as how
floats work inside of Python and most
programming languages and some things
that you should be aware of now I want
to talk about another looping structure
called the while loop now we can also
continue looping as long as a condition
is true with a while loop and while
loops are used when you don't know how
many times at the beginning you're going
to need to loop so what we're going to
do here is we're going to use a random
what's called a random module to
generate random numbers and to import a
random module that is comes with Python
we just go import random and then we
will be able to use all the different
functions that are associated with this
random module don't worry too much about
import right now we'll get into it later
just understand that if we want to be
able to calculate random numbers that
this library or module is needed to do
so we're then going to be able to
generate a random integer between 1 and
50 just by going R and num doesn't
matter what this variable is called I
just chose R and num and then we will
call random R and range and if we want a
random integer between 1 and 50 we pass
in 1 and 51 and that will return a
random value between 1 and 50 for us now
whenever we want to work with a while
loop the value we are going to be
incrementing in the while loop is going
to be defined before the loop so that's
what we're doing with I right there and
then what we're
going to do is we are going to define
the condition that while true we will
continue looping so we're going to say
while I is not equal to the random
number that was generated for us make
sure you spell this right we are going
to continue looping as long as this guy
right here comes back as true so now we
can go and increment I because you must
increment your iterator while inside of
your while loop and we can use our
little shortcut here that guy right
there which is exactly the same as if we
would type in I is equal to I plus 1
just a shortcut and I'm going to use
that guy so it's going to cycle through
until it actually finds the random value
and then at that point we're going to
say that we found it and we're going to
print on the screen that the random
value is and then print out random num
if we run this you're going to see the
random value is 5 running again random
value is 30 run it again random value is
40 and so forth and so on
now before I ask you to do another
problem I want to talk about break and
continue now continue is going to stop
executing the code that remains in the
loop and jump back to the top of the
loop while break is going to jump
completely out of the loop so let's use
an example here to show you exactly how
those work let's say that I want to
continue cycling through values as long
as I is less than or equal to 20 then
what I want to do is if a number is even
I do not want to print it so one way
that I could do that is I can go back to
our modules example modulus two and say
equal to zero remember we're going to
have to increment our iterator each time
through so I'm going to go I plus equal
to 1 to increment that by 1 and then
call continue so what it's going to do
is if this condition is true then it's
going to come down and increment the
value of the are valuable for I to 1 and
it's going to continue which means it's
going to skip everything that comes down
here in the rest of our while loop and
jump back up here
and continue executing from the
beginning of our loop you're going to
see exactly how that works here in a
second I can also come in and use break
to jump completely out of the loop so
let's say if I is ever equal to 15 I
want to stop looping all together and
click the program well I would just type
in break and that's exactly what that
does I still want to print some value so
ever I want to print our odd values out
on this screen and if both those
conditions come back is false we're
going to get down here and we're going
to know we have an odd value and then
what I can do is just print that value
out on our screen and remember however
we're always are going to have to
increment the value of I and if it
doesn't get here to increment then we're
going to have to come down here and
increment it right there and we could
save that and run it and you can see
indeed right there that we were able to
print out all those odd values all the
even values were skipped because of
continued and the value of 15 was never
reached even though we said we wanted to
continue looping until this was equal to
20 and the reason why is right here when
it says is I equal to 15 break and
whenever break is hit that means we're
going to jump completely out of the loop
and run code under here or if no code
exists of course we're not going to run
anything there's an example break as
well as continue and now comes your
biggest problem of this whole tutorial
what I want you to do is draw a pine
tree on the screen so what you're going
to do this is going to be sample output
for example you're going to say how tall
is the tree and they are going to tell
you how many rows they want in their
tree and then what your program is going
to do is print out a tree exactly like
that it's going to be able to work with
any number of rows and be able to print
any different height of pine tree
humanly possible so just to help you
along in this basically you're going to
have to use one while loop and three for
loops now of course there's multiple
different ways to do this this is just a
guide and the ultimate goal is to just
do this so if you think you can do that
on your own without any tips then go do
it and see if you were right and
otherwise I'm going to give you a couple
different
but what I would like to do here is
first break this down and let's look at
exactly what we're trying to solve so
what we have to do here is look at
exactly what's going on in our first row
let's go 1 2 3 4 so what we know is in
our first row that we are going to have
to put 4 spaces followed by one hash
symbol and let's just analyze that
so we'll say 4 spaces and 1 hash and the
second time through we're going to go 1
2 3 so we're going to have 3 spaces and
3 hashes and we're going to see here
that a pattern is going to develop right
here we can go 1 2 and we're going to
have 2 spaces followed by 5 hashes and
if we continue indefinitely this is
going to be one space followed by and
this is going to be 7 hashes and then
finally we're going to have 0 spaces
followed by 9 hashes also by analyzing
this we're going to know that this
whatever the top of our pine tree is is
going to be equivalent to wherever our
stump is so whenever we come in here to
first print this first row we should
save this information so that we could
also use it at the very end to get all
those done ok so now that we saw that
let's go through and try to figure out
how we can solve this problem so
basically what we are going to need to
do so need to do is one we are going to
have to decrement spaces by 1 each time
through the loop we know that's one
thing that we're going to have to do
with our program we're also going to
have to increment the hashes by 2 each
time through the loop number 3 we're
going to have to save spaces to the
stump by calculating tree height minus 1
what else are we going to have to do and
this is how I break down programs we
want to go through here
and figure out all the different things
we're going to have to do in each step
state we're also going to decrement from
tree height until it equals zero and
five we're going to have to print spaces
and then hashes for each row and the
final thing that jumps out at me here is
print stump spaces and then one hash so
for no matter how many rows they say
they want in their tree this is going to
be the rules that we're going to follow
right here and this is what we're going
to have to implement inside of our
program so now you can stop right there
and try to implement this so there we go
multi-line comment and another
multi-line comment and now I'll go
through exactly step by step what's
going on or what I want to do inside of
my program so the very first thing that
I want to do whenever we start off is to
get the number of rows for the tree that
is the very first thing we have to do
the first line of code then of course
convert into an integer and then the
next row is get the starting spaces for
the top of the tree
we should also track the number of
hashes the first time through and we
always know we're going to start off
with one hash so now let's just say
there is one hash to start that will be
incremented we want to as I said before
save Stumpf spaces till later because
whatever we start off with in regards to
spaces here on this road is going to be
exactly the same as that so at least I
decided that I think we should save that
for later to save ourselves some time we
then also want to make sure the right
number of
ROS are printed and I'll give you a tip
that's where the while loop is going to
come into place
we're then going to print the spaces and
I'll give you a tip here because you
don't know this if you use end is equal
to like that inside of print that means
a newline is not going to show up and
I'll show you an example of what that
looks like it's going to be print and
then we're going to put you know
whatever we have inside of there and
then we'll put end is equal to this guy
right here and whenever we use print
with end like that that is not going to
force a newline and that is going to
provide us with the ability to print out
the spaces without new lines as well as
the hashes without new lines so that's
very important and I'll just come in
here and give you that answer right
there no problem then we're going to
have to print the hashes we're going to
use a very similar format to what we use
to print our spaces then we are going to
need a new line after these trees right
here after each row in our tray so we're
going to want to call for a regular
print that is going to have a new line
after each row is printed we know from
our research that we did before that
spaces is decremented by one each time
through our loop and you can see indeed
if we come up here you can see the space
is decremented by 1 as well as hashes is
going to be incremented by 2 so we want
to increment both of those and I will
just say that hashes is incremented by 2
each time and then also decrement tree
height each time to jump out over the
loop because we need a way to get out of
our loop and then the final thing we're
going to do is print the spaces before
the stump and then
the final hash and exactly how we're
going to do that so that is the goal of
our program and step by step how we are
going to solve it so let's get up here
and let's start writing our code and of
course using all the tools we learned
about you should pause the video and try
to do this on your own otherwise you can
see exactly how I'm going to do it so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get
the tree height that the user wants me
to use in regards to printing out this
pine tree so I'm going to say how tall
is the tree going to get that and then
I'm going to go tree height is equal to
let's convert it into an integer I then
once you calculate spaces based off of
the research that I did and spaces
starts out at whatever the tree height
is minus one so I want to store that
inside of there I also want to calculate
hashes and I know that every single time
I make a tree that hashes is always
going to start out at one
once again I'm referring to this right
here just a little bit of research that
we did I also know that I want to save
the number of spaces before the stump
because that's going to be equivalent to
the very very top of the tree so I'm
going to go some spaces is equal to
three height minus one just like we did
here I could also put spaces inside of
there it doesn't really matter and then
I want to use a while loop here to cycle
through and make sure that we get out of
the loop someday so while tree height is
not equal to zero I want to continue
looping through this then I need to
print the number of spaces that we want
to use so I'm going to come down here
I'm going to use white space of course
I'm going to have to tab in and I'm
going to use a for loop here so I'm
going to say for I in range and I want
to print out the number of spaces that
we're going to need here to do this the
right way and then tab that in and
that's going to print out our spaces
then we're going to print out our hashes
this is going to be exactly the same as
what we did up here for spaces so let's
throw that in there make sure that we
have the whitespace all set up here
right and then this is good
to be hashes instead of spaces and of
course this is going to be a hash symbol
instead of a space then new line after
all of the hashes and spaces are going
to be printed on the screen and that's
going to be right here still inside of
the while loop then we can just call
print on its own that's going to print
out a new line for us and then also
inside of our while loop we are going to
have to decrement each time through the
number of spaces by one and we're going
to have to increment the hashes by two
each time we go through there and then
finally we're going to have to be able
to get out of our for loop all together
by going tree height is equal to well
let's decrement that also by one and
then after we get all of that done after
we've printed all that stuff out down
here inside or outside of our while loop
we want to print the spaces before the
stump and then the hash symbol so we're
going to say for I in range and we're
going to throw Stumpf spaces inside of
there like this and then we're going to
say print and we're going to throw in a
space and then we're going to end this
with end is equal to and nothing and
then to end our program altogether we're
going to print out our stump and be done
with it
so let's save that side of there as long
as I don't have any silly errors
anywhere this should work perfectly
let's run it how tall is the tree and
let's say that it is five rows tall and
you can see that it printed it out there
don't like the fact that I went and
forgot to put that inside of there again
a space for my input how tall is the
tree shave it like that and let's run it
