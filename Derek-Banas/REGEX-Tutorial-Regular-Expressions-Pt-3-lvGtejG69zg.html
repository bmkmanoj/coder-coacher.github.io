of my regular expressions tutorial today
I'm going to show you how to use regular
expressions inside of the programming
language called Python so what I'm going
to do is I have a text file over here
that just has much of random nonsense
and I'm going to grab that random
nonsense
and going to do that by using the open
function followed by the name of the
file then I'm going to pull each line of
text there's only one but if there were
model lines of text I would pull each
one by one and save them to a string
variable that is called
STR to search so what I'm going to do is
define that string right here and then
I'm going to use a for statement to pull
in line for line and save it to this new
string that I saved or that I created
and if this doesn't make any sense this
is the Python programming language I
have a tutorial you should watch it
first and then all this will make sense
I'm going to add each line by line to
this string variable called string to
search now everything is going to be in
there and I can prove it and run it and
it shoots out all the information that's
in that file now let's use some regular
expressions let's say I want to search
this file for anything that matches the
code that I use here and ignore case
meaning it's going to work whether the
pattern is in uppercase or lowercase
letters once really easy I define the
pattern that I'm going to look for I'm
going to call it Pat finder too and I'm
going to use the compile method and I'm
going to define that I want to find this
guy B 3 B 2 C ok now that's not going to
match unless I have you could actually
put re dot I but I'm going to type it
out the full way the way it should be
done ok so I define the pattern I want
to look for now I have to actually
search for it and define the pattern
that I just created and the string that
I want to search and I do it just like
that and I'm going to use an if
statement again I'm doing a lot of this
stuff just to show you things you should
do fine Pat to what I'm doing with this
if statement is I'm checking to see that
this pattern was found if it wasn't it's
not going to try to print the screen but
if it did find that pattern it will
print it to screen
else print nothing found okay then if we
run it
oink you can see it found B 3 B 2 C even
though I just have everything in
lowercase letters so that's what ignore
case does for you that's a little bit
boring but we'll get more interesting
here in a minute let's say I wanted to
search through and basically pull out
every single character that wasn't a
newline I would do that
with a dot which is going to match
everything except for a new line and
then by putting the star after it's
going to match the euro to many of
anything that's not a new line so it'll
basically return everything if I run
that link you can see it printed all
that out now let's say I wanted to print
out every single thing that was a letter
real simple just bracket A to Z and then
close that bracket and then since I'm
searching through the whole entire thing
I need to use find all instead of search
which I use before and then I have to
iterate through all of the different
results that were available so I'm going
to use pot find all everything else here
is going to be exactly the same except
I'm going to iterate through it and
print to screen everything that I found
and you can see it prints all the
letters just letters out to screen that
match and it ignores everything that is
not a letter and if I didn't want all of
these to appear on different lines I
would come in here and type end is equal
to and the two quotes and it would print
all the letters out on one line by
default this will shoot out a newline
that's the reason why everything went on
one line whenever I did that I could
also search for just randomness that's
in this string file as well as 0 to 9
this and it searches through and it
pulls out all the numbers and all of the
different codes you see that inside of
this bracket area I do not need to
escape backslash these guys it
automatically works just right along on
its own and allows me to search for all
of these different things and just to
change it up and try out something new
let's say I wanted to search for a digit
followed by something that was anything
but a digit followed by whitespace
followed by everything that wasn't
whitespace any character at all
that's not a character and then followed
by something that is a letter now we can
do that just like this boom and it finds
this very specific thing the only thing
that matches being a digit something
that's not a digit followed by a space
followed by something that's not a space
followed by any character followed by
another thing that is not a space
followed by something that is a
character that's basically what we were
able to do right here it was able to
pull something that convoluted out of
this nonsense that we have right here
previously I talked a lot about
searching for Jennifer so I have another
file here that is just just names
Jennifer Clark Paul Brown so forth and
so on let's say I wanted to search
inside of that file well I'm going to
type in names which is the name of that
text file string search is already
defined I'm going to pull in all that
information line for line and store it
in string to search and in this
situation I'm going to search
specifically for Jennifer's and let's do
it the convoluted complicated way okay
so basically what I'm doing is I'm
searching for any word that begins with
the first letters je followed by either
n ni fer and NY or just simply N and
here I'm saying that I expected to find
between one to six characters followed
by a space then one or more characters
and followed by another space so that's
what I'm searching for there so it will
return Jennifer for me like that and you
can see it jumped in or grabbed Jennifer
Clerk Jenny from the block and Jen
Simpson now I could like I showed you in
the previous tutorial actually simplify
this and put a nifer y and of course I
already got an N in there and this is
what you would do if you wanted to be
sharp see it actually said I want J and
E followed by one to six characters that
are either the character ni f e ry
that's exactly what it does and then it
spits out the first and last names for
anybody named Jennifer and you can see
it skips over Paul Brown and all these
other different things so it's sort of
like a convoluted tricky little way to
grab all the Jenny's and Jennifer's and
so forth and so on from code now I'm
going to jump in and I'm actually going
to look at something else this is random
text and this is somebody talking about
the number pi so I'm going to jump in
here and I'm going to grab grab
specifically PI from it so the name is
random text I'm going to leave
everything else the same except here I'm
going to define exactly what it would
mean to be pi well basically it's a
digit and then I have to escape out the
dot because in this circumstance I
actually want the dot and I don't want
it to be considered any character except
newline followed by another digit just
that simple
and then I instead of using find all
because I'm only looking for one I'm
going to use search in this situation
and then I'm going to use the group
method so I'm going to call print find
Pat - dot group and if I print this to
screen and I'll search through all that
information and print 3.14 buhbuh buhbuh
blah - screen like it did right there so
that's a way to search for a series of
digits or another way to search for
things but another thing if you look at
the end of this file here is a telephone
number let's say I wanted to search
through here and find said telephone
number well how I would do that again
I want these brackets in here and then
it's going to be a number from 0 to 9
and then since it's a telephone number
it's going to be at least three digits
in length and then that might be
followed by a dash so I'm going to in
this situation put a question mark
that's a you know that's a definition
that it might have a dash in it or it
might not now you can make many
different complicated telephone number
regular expressions this is just what
I'm focusing on right now and again
- it might exist there you could also
put braces followed by a question mark
and then it would search for it but it
wouldn't say it was not true if it
didn't find those things I'm actually
going to show you how to do that in this
exact little thing here so again it's
going to be digits between 0 and 9
followed by four of those set digits and
then I'm going to close off that because
that's going to grab me one type of
telephone number
but like I said before if I wanted to be
able to grab telephone numbers that
might have these braces in them I want
to be able to do that so let's use the
or symbol followed by another brace and
then I'm going to put this brace inside
of here but I'm going to have to escape
it so I got a backslash it but that
might not show up so I'll use the
question mark brace 0-9 again I'm going
to be looking for three of those digits
to be found there
and then after that there may be the
brace so I'm going to escape it put the
brace in there and then put the question
mark in there saying that it is does not
need to be there but if it is there
that's perfectly fine then I'm going to
define that I'm going to be looking for
three digits again and then potentially
a - and then digits from 0 to 9 that
should be 4 numbers in a row and then I
want to put a bracket around there so
I'm looking either for a phone number
that meets these this distinction right
here or that's what that or is there for
or I'm looking for a telephone number
that is going to match this pattern
right here and I'm going to come down
here and type in find all and I'm going
to iterate through and print everything
to screen if it is found it searched
through every one of those these
telephone numbers that are actually near
here at the end of the line so it was
able to find all these different types
of telephone numbers there's three of
them there and it was able to locate all
three of those telephone numbers and put
them in there so there are a bunch of
different ways you can use regular
expressions inside of Python if you have
any questions leave them in the comment
section below until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
