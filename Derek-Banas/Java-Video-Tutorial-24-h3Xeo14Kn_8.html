part 24 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to show you how to use
combo boxes inside of Java swing I'm
gone over all bunch of these things like
these libraries you know what all these
guys do so I'm going to skip over a good
part of that in this tutorial one thing
I'm going to do here though is show you
how to create a jcombobox and that's it
jcombobox
and I'm going to name this favorite
shows I decided to just cover one
component in this tutorial because I've
been getting a lot of questions about
the other different components so I
thought I'd simplify this to make sure
you get it and in the next tutorial
we'll do something a little bit more
complicated when I'll cover lists so
create myself a string here and it's
always a good idea to give it just a
default value of nothing and then we
come down here start playing around some
of our other little things here now of
course this is going to create the size
for the frame this is going to by using
null place the frame in the center of
the screen this is going to handle
closing it this is the title for your
frame and this is how you create a panel
that's going to go on the frame now what
I'm going to need to do here if I want
to load a whole bunch of different
things into my combo box is I'm going to
create a string array and I'm gonna call
it shows real simple right like this and
I'm going to throw some shows inside of
here there you go just some random
television shows so nice string array
now if I want to load all those into
this combo box again just going to refer
back to favorite shows is equal to nu J
combo box and I'm gonna take that string
array and throw it in right like that so
pretty simple now if I wanted to add an
item you're gonna find out later that
it's a little bit harder to add items to
list boxes but it's no problem with
combo boxes all you're gonna do is go
favorite shows the name your combo box
and go add item yeah let's say I wanted
to put Pushing Daisies so that's how you
would add an item and then of course if
you wanted to add this guy we're nowhere
near done talking about the different
methods available but if we want to add
jcombobox you do it in exactly the same
way you always do it we are and now that
component is going to be tied to the
panel and then this down here adds the
panel to the frame and this says to show
the frame so that's all pretty simple
stuff but we're not done we need to
create some other things like a button
is going to allow us to interact with
this guy new jbutton
and give it a little bit of text kid
answer now we got a button and we got a
combo box of course we want to add a
listener here to handle any events that
are going to be triggered whenever the
person goes and clicks on the button and
I'm just going to give the same name as
I have in the past
equal to no listen for buttons call that
constructor to create that guy and then
want to attach this listener to the
button itself like that then I just pass
al4 button to it and then of course you
want to add this guy to the panel Add
button what pretty simple now what we
need to do is come down here and create
listen for buttons and I created the
beginnings of it down here because we've
covered that in the past now I'm going
to check if the button is what was
pressed get source that and then I'm
going to go and say was button 1 the
reason why this was all set into motion
and then if it was we're gonna do a
whole bunch of different things let's
say that you want your combo box to be
editable like I said before I'm covering
pretty much everything not something
that would be terribly common for you to
do but hey now you know how to do it all
you would do is set that to true so
unless something you could do and while
I have that selected I might as well
bounce back up here and show you a
couple other different things you can do
so let's go favorite shows let's say you
wanted to insert an item into the combo
box at index 1 how would you do that
just like this comma and the index you
want to put it in and there you are
insert item at and another thing you
could do is set the maximum number of
rows that are displayed three possible
rows in the combo box just using that
right there another thing you could do
is let's say you wanted to remove an
item pretty easy you can remove in
multiple different ways so if you wanted
to remove by the value you would use the
remove item or if you wanted to remove
using an index you would go remove item
at and then put one in there or whatever
you want then we'll come back down here
and do some other little things you saw
that I had to find a string up here it's
called info on component and I'm going
to use that I'll put some information on
the screen so we can see exactly what's
going on and just go like this and in
there shorthand to be able to continue
adding to the current values
the string and now I'm going to go item
at I can show you how to grab an item
based off of whatever its index is and
you would just go again favorite shows
and then go get item at and let's say we
wanted to use index 0 right like this
and then before we close that out I'm
going to throw a new line inside of here
just so that everything looks a little
bit neater on the screen so that's how
you would get values based off of what
their index is and let's come in here
and do a couple other different things
let's say you want to just find out how
many total items there are so let's just
say no I'm off chose and then we'll go
in here and go get item just change this
to count this is going to return the
total number of different things that
you have in a combo box so that's also
pretty useful then also if you would
want to get the ID 4 or the index for
whatever is currently selected in the
combo box also very easy to do just go
get selected item right like that and of
course get rid of this zero because you
don't need that and that's going to
return whatever item is currently
selected in the combo box and then if
you would want to come in here instead
get the value so let's say selected
value also easy to get actually index is
going to give you your index of course
selected and then this is going to be
item so just to make this clear this is
going to give you the index of whatever
selected in combo box and this is going
to give you the value for whatever is
selected in the combo box another thing
you could do is to check if the combo
box is editable again like I said I'm
covering pretty much everything already
and then that's real simple you could
probably guess what this method is going
to be called it's called
is available and then of course just get
rid of this zero and then we have to
create our little pop-up that's going to
display all this information on the
screen and I'm going to use J option
pane just like I did previously show
message dialog and then what am I going
to do here I'm going to say Java lesson
24 dot this I'm going to pay reference
to the actual frame that I have here of
course and then I'm going to what am I
going to put into it I'm going to put
info on come on end which is going to be
the string that I want to put in there
and then I have to give it a title and
I'm just going to call it information so
that's easy enough
and then the icon that I want show up so
J option
an information message and that's just
going to give me my default and
formation message and then of course I
want to come in here and reset this
string after I originally called it and
I'm just going to come in here and go
like this and that just guarantee is
that each time that I execute this
pop-up I get new information I'll show
you exactly what this looks like let's
just execute it and you can see right
here here's my combo box with all the
different things that are available and
if I click on get an answer you can see
all the different information it pops up
here you can't see this view at full
screen of course and you can see all the
informations returned back to it and of
course this is also editable so if I
would come in here and instead type
tv-show just anything and then get
answer it's going to show up TV show
here and it's going to throw it into
negative one as a default so there's a
whole bunch of things you can do with
combo boxes using Java swing like said
up next I'm going to go into list boxes
and the last couple components like
trees and so forth and then we're going
to go into all the different interfaces
that are available for this guy leave
any questions or comments below
otherwise the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
