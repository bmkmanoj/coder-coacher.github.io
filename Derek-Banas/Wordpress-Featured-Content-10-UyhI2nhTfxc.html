10 of my wordpress featured content
tutorial where i show you how to make
this featured content tool that you see
right here i know there wasn't supposed
to be a part 10 but i added two
additional features and i also wanted to
show you how to use this featured
content tool once you got it set up so
the first thing I'm going to do and oh
by the way yes I did get the news theme
finished here it is I'm going to be
doing a lot of tutorials on that if you
actually want to see it in a real world
if you go to this what's kind of like a
dummy site I have the theme there and
you can look at it and see how it works
out it's at my investment services com
all the articles just have dummy text
inside them and just wanted to provide
you this so that you could see exactly
how this guy works all right so let's
just jump in here and i'm going to show
you exactly how to add all of your
images and all the thumbnails are all
automated directly inside of here once
you have installed the featured content
tool and by the way to install it is
very very simple all you got to do is go
to your plugins folder inside of
wordpress and that is located if i jump
into the WordPress directory you're
going to see a folder that's called WP
content you want to double click on that
and then you're going to see another
folder called plugins you want to double
click on that and then in the link in
the under border is a link to a zipped
archive for the whole entire thing you
want to unzip it and you want to upload
it to this plugins folder and it's going
to be called auntie T featured content
to and this is all free it's Olga new
license you can do what anything with it
I just don't promise that it works
perfectly however in general I think
that it does everybody uses canoe
license when they want to give things
away for free but they don't want to
potentially get sued over it ok so once
you get that installed all you got to do
is drop the folder right inside of the
plugins folder if you want to then go in
and put something in the featured
content tool what you do is you go to
posts and let's just say add new and
then you just click inside of here and
then click on this little guy right here
this is going to allow you to add an
image just like it said and then I'm
going to go into the computer itself and
I'm going to click on small print I'm
just picking on something random open it
up then you're going to want to make
sure that this image is 576 x 240 like
it says right here because that's the
size of the featured content area but
here I'm just going to click on
thumbnail and you want to make sure
you have left selected here like I do on
the screen and you don't want to put any
alternate text in there because my
featured content tool automatically
creates alternate text for you but if
you want to put something in here for
the description that's perfectly fine
then click on insert into post and then
I just put some random information
inside of there and I'm just going to
call this small print then you want to
make sure that you have featured stood
as a category you want to click on that
and then here under set image way down
inside of here you can see it's
displaying the current numbers of posts
that are in the category featured and
you always want to put in at least five
of these in here because it just looks
nicer and it's currently not in the
future category that that's going to
change and you want to click on media
library image the little button it's
under set image and we want to click on
media library and then see small print
here click on show and you click on full
size 576 x 240 this time not the
thumbnail and then hit insert into post
and that's all that you have to do for
it you can click on visual to make sure
that it did left justify and it did and
then you click on publish that's all you
do and it automatically is going to
generate all that information for you
and then and then if you jump out here
to the site you can see all that
information went directly inside of
there right like that real nice and easy
to use you can flip through all these
different guys and jump out the articles
or do whatever you want to do with them
so now over to the couple of changes
that I made to this guy from the last
tutorial inside of an TT featured
content to PHP what you're going to want
to do here to make sure that this can
work on every single host is i'm going
to use what's called real path and what
real path does is i pass it or directory
this is the actual location for the
featured data text file that we created
in previous tutorials what real path is
going to do is it's going to take this
guy right here so let's just go feature
data you send it this information it's
going to go text what it does is it
figures out what proceeds this and why
that's important is it's going to
automatically no matter what website you
use it's going to go w w you think tank
for example calm forward slash WordPress
if that's where I have it located and
then wp-content it's going to fill in
this information for you that's what
real
does and that's what these two lines of
code here do for you so that gets
through a couple little problems that a
couple of people have had in regards to
using this plug-in on their hosts like I
said you can just download the code and
of course I'm going to reference this
information in the article that's
attached to this video that's all you
have to do there and one other thing
that I had to do inside a featured
content Jas is go where it says picked
name for excerpt like we have right here
you can just do a find for this specific
variable and then what you want to do is
come in here to the replace area and put
this little regular expression followed
by the letter G what that's going to do
is it's going to replace all spaces and
you can refer to the other tutorials to
see exactly what this guys doing and
that's it so you guys can look forward
to the newspaper theme coming out very
very soon I expect to be able to get
another video uploaded very soon so you
won't have to wait roll off that leave
any questions or comments below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
