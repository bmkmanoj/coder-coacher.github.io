6 tutorial in this one tutorial I'm
going to cover about 85% of what you
could read or learn about ECMAScript all
in one video and like always all the
code as well as a transcript of this
video is available in the description
along with time stamps that are going to
I to click to learn exactly what you
want to learn now ECMAScript was
originally based on JavaScript and now
JavaScript basically models ECMA so it's
a very important technology to learn
about and it's used mainly on the client
side but also on the server side of
course just like JavaScript but I'm
guessing you know all that so I'm not
going to waste your time and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it alright
so on the left here I'm using atom and
this is all the HTML we are going to be
using here and this is going to be our
script file right here and on the right
I have Google Chrome and I'm just going
to be type of stuff in here and Louden
over there the name of this file is
ECMAScript HTML but you can name it
whatever you'd like at just as long as
you link to the script file that has all
of your code alright so the very first
thing I'm going to talk about is let now
you probably are used to using var and
how let differs from var is if you use
var to define a variable that variable
is going to be available globally versus
let which is going to make the variable
available only in a block and I'm going
to show you here an example of how this
is going to work so let's say we go and
we create a variable inside of here and
then we want to print that variable
value out and then we come down here and
we go to try to print that out so now
let's reload it and you can see in this
situation that 10 prints out both times
however and that's because it's global X
right there is global now let's change
this to let and see how that changes and
reload it and now you can see that X
prints out inside of here inside of this
block however we get an error down here
that says reference error X is not
defined for this guy right here so
that's the basic idea behind using let
instead of using var another thing it's
important to know
is and the reason why that's a very good
thing is that you're going to be able to
use non global variables and global
variables normally caused all kinds of
havoc because you don't know where they
lie in your code and all of a sudden
file values or variable values change
and then it causes chaos so it's much
better to use let and throughout the
course of this tutorial and it pretty
much always use that now another thing
it's very important is we can go inside
of here and we can define another
variable and then we can say if true
once again we want this to execute every
time and we can go let y is equal to 20
so here we went and used exactly the
same name for our variable however if we
come down here and print it out you're
going to see that it's going to be safe
and it is not going to mess up our code
and document writes going to get a lot
prettier here in a moment so you can see
right there that Y still has the value
of 10 which is defined up here because
let didn't change anything so that's the
basic idea of let I'll get a little bit
more into it as the tutorial continues
but now I want to talk about constants
now constants of course allow you to
define a constant value that cannot be
changed and how you do it is just like
this so we can go in and define pi and
we can go and give it a value and if you
do so you would then if you would go in
and say no I want PI to be equal to 2
point 1 3 instead you're going to see
that that indeed is going to give you an
error see error down here just trust me
bad thing don't want to do that
however let's go and define a block
inside of here and let's define another
constant and let's put PI inside of this
block and now let's try to change the
value for pi inside of here and if we do
so let's go and do that and let's change
this to PI instead and change this to PI
right here you're going to say that we
are able inside of those blocks to
define constants without messing
anything up and there you go alright so
pretty cool stuff and that's the basics
of constants and how they work
and now I'm just going to do a real
quick example of the different data
types that are available with ECMAScript
now you still don't declare a
Atta type but instead the value is
defined based off of the type or the
value that is assigned to a variable and
the main types inside of that are
available to you here are going to be
boolean number string object and symbol
and you can see here I use type of to
basically figure out what all these
different data types are and you can say
that they automatically work and there
is boolean true you can see here his
number so there's no doubles or floats
or integers everything is just a number
there's a string this is a symbol we'll
get more into symbols later on these are
going to be objects even though the
array right here is going to be also be
considered an object and undefined is
also going to be undefined if you want
to use data types you can go and use
typescript too which of course I have
another tutorial one but that's just a
basic overview of the different data
types that are available to you and now
I'm going to take a look at strings now
something that's really cool with
strings now and with ECMA is you're
going to be able to use string
interpolation using what are called
template literals so let me give me an
example of that so we'll say we have a
first-name and I'll just pick something
out of my head here and we will also
throw in a last name and there we go now
let's go and show you an example of what
a template literal looks like I'm still
going to use document.write just like I
did previously except I'm going to get
rid of all of this stuff let's keep that
little guy right there then what's
really cool about it is I can do this
which is the back quote like that and
throw another one in here just like that
and what I'm going to be able to do is
go and throw the variable directly
inside of there which makes your code so
much neater we go F name and last name
like that and save that and keep the
break statement directly inside of there
and reload the screen and you can see
that it goes and prints out the name
directly right there
so it makes it much much much easier and
we're going to be able to do all kinds
of other cool things with it once again
template literals is what these are
called another example of what we can do
here and copy this is let's go in here
and let's define two numbers and
giving a value of 10 and let's go and
define another value inside of here and
give that a value of 5 and let's use the
template literal again we can now come
in here and throw something like 10
times 5 is going to be equal to and
perform the calculation directly inside
of here so num1 times
num2 directly like that and reload it
and you're going to see it does the
calculation directly right there so
keeps your code much much much neater
you're also going to be able to use what
are called tag template literals to
modify output using a function so let me
give an example of that I'm going to
come in here and do you find a function
and I'm going to say two math is the
name of it and it's going to be passed
in strings and I'm also going to go in
here put three dots and values and in
this situation this guy right here is
going to be a string array that's going
to contain all of the strings inside of
here and then you're going to have your
values array is going to contain all of
your substitutions let me give an
example and then you'll see exactly how
this works so what I can do now is I can
say if strings and reference that string
array and write like this break support
everything inside of there so let's say
I go add and then I can say that I want
to do a document right and change all
this and go values and grab first value
was passed inside of here plus and then
values again and grab the second value
that was passed inside of here look
don't forget to close this off right
there and get rid of this extra
straggler is equal to and then we can
perform our calculation directly inside
of there so we'll say values plus values
and get the second item out of there and
perform that calculation otherwise we
can do is say else if strings 0 we're
going to be grabbing the exact same
thing a string and we'll do subtraction
like that in that situation we're going
to form a subtraction so let's say minus
and then change this tool - son and now
what we can do that's really cool is
come down here and say do math and pass
inside here using back quotes once again
the string add and then two values
inside of there one of them be and 10
and the next one being 20 then we could
do exactly the same thing once again
let's do math and we'll throw
subtraction inside of there once again
and then there's no spaces between the
sub or the add and the dollar sign and
we could we could put spaces inside that
we're just going to have to change the
value of strings that we're working with
and the value of of the values put
another space inside of there and throw
in 20 again and then we come out here
and reload it and you can see that it
was able to go in there and grab the
values as well as the strings and be
able to perform the right calculation
depending upon the information that's at
play around with this very very cool I'm
not going to spend a ton of time on it
but very very cool and a really awesome
addition to ECMAScript we're also going
to be able to iterate over characters so
let's go let's see of F name to a
document right and then inside of here
I'm going to throw a C inside of there
and then just get rid of everything else
here except for my break statement and
reload it and you're going to see it
iterated through all of those different
characters in our string and F name once
again comes from this guy right up here
and once again I'm talking about strings
here not just template literals we're
also going to be able to come in and
repeat a string another capability we
have so let's say I wanted to print out
hello a whole bunch of times I could do
so so let's go in and go hello and then
at the end of it
save repeats and three and then we'll
add in this guy and it goes hello hello
hello we can check if a string starts
with a specific value so let's go in and
say something like F name and see if it
starts with and then
in value de for example and let's do a
couple more here we can also check if it
ends with a specific value let's change
this to ends with and we'll throw in EK
here instead and we can also check if it
includes just by typing in includes and
then we could throw something like ER e
just anything inside of there you can
see that they all come back is true
let's do some more you're also going to
be able to create multi-line strings so
we can go and create this guy is equal
to and we're going to throw double
quotes inside of there and then we're
going to say something like this is and
then to make it multi-line you're going
to do a backslash and go a multi-line
once again the backslash and string at
the very end of it and you don't have to
put a multi-line obviously and then we
can come in here and actually print this
guy out once again I'm using back quotes
here and then I can print out the
multi-line string it is and put the STR
inside of there and reload it and you
can see it printed there and another
thing you can do is get rid of these
back slashes all together you can see
it's giving me an error that error is
going to go away right now put in your
backwards and then get out of there and
throw in another one and reload it and
you're going to see that it still works
there we go whole bunch of new things
that are available to you string wise
and now I want to show you a whole bunch
of things that are different in regards
to functions now if you want to use
default values you're going to be able
to do that so let's go and let's create
a function and let's call it get some
and it receives a number and I want to
give it a default value of 1 and then
let's go and create another one and
let's give that a default value also of
1 just for the heck of it and then
inside of document right here I'm going
to go and print that information out so
we'll go num1 plus num2 is equal to and
then we'll do and perform the addition
inside of here so num1 num2 and then we
can say get some and throw 3 inside of
there like this and you're going to see
that it's going to come back with a
value of 4 why because the 3 took over
this space here but the one remained
right like that the thing to know is the
arguments array is only going to receive
the value that was passed into it so let
me give you an example of how that is
going to affect things so here we can
say arguments and then go plus and here
and once again arguments and one
normally you would get this one and this
one but you're going to see how that
changes here and reload it here you can
see that it does not take the value here
for in regards to the arguments array
for the defined value only the value
that was passed in okay so it's
something very important to be aware of
rest parameters which are going to be
preceded by three dots are going to
become or be treated as an array so
let's go and give you an example of how
that's going to work so let's call this
get some more and create a rest
parameter and here I'll say values and
then let's define a sum inside of here
and let's cycle through this guy so
we'll go let I is equal to 0 and then
length is going to be value length while
I is less than length I'm going to
increment the value of I and then sum of
these values up so Saum plus equals 2
and each of the individual values inside
of the values array come down inside of
here print that out so we can say
something like the sum is and then print
out that sone and then we can come down
here and go get some more this is just a
way to pass in values you can use it or
use arguments or you can use rest
parameters here there we are a bunch of
values passed inside of there and reload
it forgot to put the S right there
save that reload it and now you can see
the sum comes back as 10 you're also
going to be able to pass arrays and
let's see how that works we'll go let
Val's is equal to and let's go and
create an array inside of here and then
this call get some more and then pass
that inside of there and here you can
see that that all adds up arrow
functions are going to define parameters
followed by the body of a function so
we'll say let's and we'll
all this difference is equal to here
what you're going to do is you're going
to define the parameters first pass to a
function and then you're going to put an
arrow inside of there that's why they
are known as arrow functions and then
here what you want to have done to them
so we'll say num1 - num2 and then let's
print some information out here we can
say 5 minus 10 is equal to and then call
difference and then pass in the
difference 5 and 10 there you can see
that comes back it's very important to
know that you can use arrow functions
however and have more than one statement
so let's go mult is equal to and num1
and num2 throw an arrow function inside
of there and then just use curly
brackets to use more than one statement
so we can say let's product equal to num
1 times num2 and then do the document
right directly inside of there and we
can reference that file times and then
m2 is equal to and then we can throw a
product inside of there and then inside
of here we can then call our function of
course
so mult 5 and 50 and there is our answer
another things really cool is you're
going to be able to use arrow functions
with map filter and reduce so let's go
and create another array and let's just
call this value array and just throw
some values inside of there reduce is
going to apply a function against an
accumulator to get a single result so
let's say I want to sum all these values
I can do so so say some values is equal
to value array and reduce and here a and
B we're going to take in two values at a
time from our rack and we're going to
add them until no more exist and then we
can print out our results of that so
we'll just say sum and some vows and I
also said that we're going to be able to
use filter filter is going to return
those values that pass a condition so
let's say that I just want to get the
even values I can say evens is equal to
value array
and call filter on it once again the
arrow function and here is going to be
the condition it's going to be if the
value of the modulus of two versus each
of the values inside of the array as I
cycle through them comes back as equal
to zero well then we know that it is an
even value which means that it's going
to go into the evens array and then we
can print that information out so we
could say evens and then evens and let's
also show you an example using map so
here with map let's say we wanted to
basically map is going to perform a the
given action on every single item that
it's passed to it so here let's say I
want to double every single thing inside
of there and then save the results value
array once again and call map on it B
and what I want to do to every single
item inside of there is multiply them
times two and once again we can come in
here and print out our results so we'll
say doubles and doubles whoops
throw a curly bracket in there you
should have told me about that throw a
semicolon in there instead what was I
thinking get rid of that reload it and
here you can see reduce went and added
all the values inside of the array and
save them into some values evens went
and perform this condition against every
single value created a brand new array
called evens and only stored even values
inside of it and map down here helped us
double every single item inside of the
array there's a rundown of some of the
new capabilities provided to you with
functions with ECMAScript and now I'm
going to talk about objects now you're
going to be able to create what are
called objects literals like this so
we'll be able to go in or say function
and creates animal and let's say that
every animal is going to have a name and
every animal is going to have an owner
we can then say return and then inside
of here define our properties so we'll
have name owner we can of course come in
here and create a method like get info
so I'm going to get any parameters
passed to it and it is going to return
and back quotes name I have to use this
name which is a way of referring to the
object specific name because we don't
know what its
name is because we create this
definition of what this animal object is
going to be before we ever define a name
so owned by and then we can go and get
what is owned by it with owner once
again put this inside of there and also
we are going to be able to have objects
inside of this object so let's say we
want to define an address for this guy
go and create a new one and we'll say
that this specific animal is going to be
at 1 2 3 main street and city say that
every single animal is going to be in
Pittsburgh on Main Street we can do so
and we'll close that off of semicolon
now what we're going to be able to do
with that guy is let's go bar spot is
equal to and let's call create animal
and let's pass inside of it spot and
we'll say that spots owner is going to
be a guy named Doug we can then say we
then go document right and we can call
the get info method we defined inside of
here by referencing spot and get info we
can then also access the objects inside
of our objects let's go do this again
and we will go and get spots name so
spot name is at and then access the
object inside of the object remember we
defined everybody lives in the same
place so we'll go like this and then you
just go address like that and if you
want to get the streets you just do that
and reload it you can see spot is owned
by Doug and spot is at 1 2 3 Main Street
another thing it's kind of interesting
is we can get the properties and methods
of an object just by coming in here and
saying object and gets owned property
names and then pass in what we want so
that's going to be spot in this
situation and then I want to do a join
and then separate everything it comes
back with a space and then throw in our
dollar sign and our curly bracket like
this and this is get own property names
like that you can see that all of them
come back right there you're also going
to be able to store values from objects
using something called destructuring so
let's go and define that we'll say
that we want the name and the owner that
is stored inside a spot we can do so and
then I'll just grab the name out of here
like this and there you can see we grab
spot we can also get an inter class
value so we'll say let's and then we'll
go address equal to spot and then get
our address value out of there and how
we would do that is reference address
and Street specifically inside of there
and there that is something else that's
neat is we're going to be able to do
structure arrays let's go and create a
favorite numbers all right and throw
some random values inside of there let's
say that I just want to get to the last
one of them
I throw in two commas like that and
let's say I want this to be called chaos
and pull it from favorite numbers of
course and that if I want to print that
out and goo chaos okay awesome course
pretty cool and of course if you want
any of the other values you just put
them in there instead of just the blank
quotes for the blank commas you're also
going to be able to use rest items to
grab part of an array so to do that we
go let throw a comments out of there and
so let's say that I want to get the last
two items and save it into an array
called last two pulling that from
favorite numbers again and it'll say
that I want to get the second of those
items so we'll say second gnome and then
we'll go last two and get the zero index
out of that and another thing is neat is
we're going to be able to switch values
so let's say we go what value one is
going to be equal to one and value two
is going to have the value of two
we can then come in and go Val one and
Val two is going to be equal to Val to
in Val one and that's going to switch
the values from where they were
previously very very nice and neat and
then we can just go and grab Val one
here just to prove that it worked you
can go grab Val to if you do not trust
me so we get like this and Val to and
you we know that it's supposed to have a
value of two however since we switched
it you can now see it has the value of
one okay so pretty cool stuff you can do
there now I want to dive deeper into
what we can do with classes
now classes are going to work much like
they do with other languages so let's
come in here and let's define a class
and let's create a constructor for the
class and we're just going to define
that this is going to receive a name by
default and you're going to use this
once again to refer to the objects you
create however you're going to protect
this information by using normally and
underscore followed by the normal name
that whatever the variable name is like
that and that's all we're going to do
with our constructor right now and we
can also use getters and setters and to
do so you just go get and name and of
course this could return some custom
value or some custom version of our name
and again you're going to use an
underscore and then you can create
setters as well and you're going to do
exactly the same type of thing here
except you're going to receive a name
that's going to be changed and then once
again we'll use this and save whatever
value is passed inside of here okay and
you're also going to have the ability to
use static methods and so we'll just
create one here and this one is actually
going to create mammal objects and pass
them back and it's just going to receive
a name and to go and create a mammal
object you just go new and mammal
exactly like that and then pass the name
inside of there and the constructor will
take care of the rest and also we could
have for just regular old methods inside
of here so we'll just do get info and
the whole point of this is that it's
going to return a string with all the
information about our object that we
create so I'll just go this and here I
can say name is a mammal and there we go
and that's going to return it and we
come down here and then go and test out
this stuff see what happens if we want
to create an object we could say let
monkey is equal to and then new and
all uppercase of course and then you
could pass in whatever you want your
monkey to be called so I'll call this
one Fred we can also change the name and
to do so just go monkey name no
underscore of course and throw in mark
and we could also call our getter and
here we can just say mammal and then get
our value for our monkey and again we
just use the name we don't use a
underscore prior to that we can also
come in and create a mammal using our
static function so let's go chipmunk and
to call our static methods or functions
inside of here you're going to precede
it with whatever the class name is so
here I'll go mammal and then I'll call
for make mammal and then and I'm going
to pass in a name so let's call our
chipmunk chipper let's print out some
information about that so let's just
call this mammal too and then we will
call chipmunk followed by the name and I
haven't run any of this you can see what
that looks like
see right here mammal and we receive the
name for it which is mark and mammal two
which is chipper so you can see that we
are able to create objects that way
we're also going to be able to come in
here and inherit all the properties and
methods with extends so let's say I want
to create something called more sue Biel
I think I spelled that right and to get
everything from the mammal class we
created will just say extends mammal and
then we can create a brand new
constructor for this guy and let's say
that our more super Yule objects are
going to have names and also they're
going to have a boolean which is going
to be whether they have a pouch or not
somebody out there might know more about
more soup eels than I do I don't know
that they all have pouches and I'm going
to put that in there if we want to call
the super constructor for our mammal
class we just go super it runs that and
it's going to take care of the name
setting up name and then we'll have a
pouch be inside here because that is
special to our marsupials and so there's
house pouch and we can come in and
define getters for has pouch as well and
we will of course just return
this and then we will have an underscore
and has pouch and we'll create a setter
as well for has pouch it's going to
receive the true or false for has pouch
and then we will store that as pouch is
equal to whatever true or false was
passed into it we're also going to be
able to come in and override methods
just by providing the name and then more
or additional different information and
it automatically overrides it so here we
can say return and then we can say this
name is a marsupial and now we will use
this marsupial class to create a brand
new object and I'm just rating this out
of my head so kangaroo as far as I know
kangaroos are marsupials and so let's
just go and create them so marsupial and
Paul and we will say that that is true I
do know that kangaroos have pouches
positive about that and let's go and get
some information here so let's go
it's is and we'll say kangaroo as pouch
that and let's go and get kangaroo once
again has a pouch see how that works out
for us we all week also can come in and
test the over overridden method so here
we'll go in and we'll just go like this
and chipmunk and get info and don't
forget to put those parentheses inside
of there and then we're going to do
pretty much exactly the same thing just
to test this out with our kangaroo
so change chipmunk to kangaroo we're
also going to be able to dynamically
inherit from classes which is something
kind of neat so we can say get class and
class type and then here we can say if
class type is equal to one then we want
to return a mammal else we will return a
marsupial so that's kind of neat
something that ecmascript does that
isn't very common and then we can
command and test this with class
and let's create a koala and let's have
its extends and then we will call get
class on that and pass a to inside of it
just to test this out and create a new
constructor that receives a name and
then we'll just call the super name like
that and then we can come in here and
test this so we'll say something like
let's and coral is equal to new koala
and give him the name of coral and then
let's print out some information about
this
so we'll say coral and get information
yeah and if we run that we didn't create
any errors it looks like it's going to
work it is true that Paul has a pouch
chipper as a mammal and Paul is a
marsupial and those of course come from
these guys up here and I have a little
bug down here and that's because I
didn't put a capital M right there so
let's save that reload it and now you
can also see that Carl's a marsupial and
that we were able to create a dynamic
class with our koalas so pretty cool
stuff and now I'm going to jump over and
talk about symbols now a symbol is going
to be kind of like an enumerated type
that can be used as an identifier and
they can't can't be changed which means
they are immutable and to create a
symbol that is used like a label and an
array or something like that you can
provide a description in quotes but it's
only really there for debugging purposes
so let's say we want to go and go
Capitol and let's create a new symbol
and this is what I'm saying about
putting in a description so I'll say
something like States Capitol and then
let's use it
so we'll say something like let
Pennsylvania and let's create that
object like this and then we'll go
Pennsylvania and then we'll use Capitol
like a label just like you can see there
and we'll put in Harrisburg save that
there we can now come in and go document
rights and we can say capitol of PA and
then inside of here get rid of that guy
and go Pennsylvania
and capital and I spelled Ken Sylvania
wrong not a good thing to do
Pennsylvania and you can see capital P a
comes back as Harrisburg so let's go
into a couple more things here we can
actually come in here and get the
description that we have saved for this
we can say symbol capital and then go
capital to string and there you can see
is the information on the wit along with
the description for our symbol we
created you're going to be able to share
symbols by using symbol for so we'll go
let employee number so it's all
employees are going to have a number so
let's share the symbols so we'll go
symbol for and this is going to be
employee number and then we'll be able
to go and Bob Smith and let's create
this object here and then go Bob Smith
and use the employee number and we'll go
and give you an employee number of 10
and then we're going to do a similar
thing with another one so we'll go
Sally marks throw that in there and then
use that symbol again Sally marks and
employee number and make her equal to 11
and then output this information so we
can just go Bob like that and then Bob
Smith and then throw the employee number
inside of here and then do pretty much
exactly the same thing for Sally marks
so we'll just go Sally and then this is
going to be Sally marks and there you
can see it popped both of those out so
there's a rundown of symbols and now I'd
like to take a quick look at arrays so
let's go and create an array I'll just
call this array 1 and you can use array
of to create arrays instead of the
normal array constructor you might be
use of so we'll just go array of and 1 2
&amp;amp; 3 is going to be our array we'll also
be able to change an object into an
array so we can say let's array 2 equal
to and you're going to go ray from to be
able to do that we could use a string
for example we're also going to be
able to use array from to manipulate
values so let's go and create another
array here this is going to be array
three and array from and here we'll pass
in array 1 and we will take each value
that is inside of array of one and we
will multiply it times two and then save
it into array three and then of course
we're going to be able to iterate over
our arrays so I'm going to say for let's
value of and I'll print out all the
information for all of these so I'll go
array one and then I want to print out
some info so we'll go array value and
then the value that we're going to print
out is just going to be VA el ray from
got that there you can see array value
one two and three that is from this guy
right here we can also come in and just
change this into a row too and reload
and you can see they're cycled through
all the values in that string and
printed those outs and then we can also
test to see what goes on if we were able
to double all these values here and we
see that we did okay so quick rundown of
arrays and I want to take a look at sets
now a set is just going to be a list of
values with no duplication inside of
them so let's go random set is equal to
new set and define that guy and then
we'll be able to come in and say random
sets and add a value to it so there is a
10 and other random sets and we can
throw anything inside of here so we can
say throw us a string inside of there
instead there that is and we're going to
be able to check to see if a set
contains a value so we can check to see
for example if this set contains the
number 10 and to do so we're going to go
random set and call the has function and
what specifically we are looking for
inside of it we are also going to be
able to come in and get the size of it
so let's say sets size and go random
sets once again and size and we will
also be able to delete an item from
such so random set again and let's say
we want to delete 10 out of there we
don't want it anymore and of course we
can iterate over all the values in a set
so we'll say let value of random sets
and then we will print all those
different items out so what we want to
put here maybe like sets value like that
and then get all the individual values
just by throwing value inside of there
and we can run this and see how it works
out you can see has 10 comes back as
true set sizes too and right here we
have set value is equal to word and the
reason why is there's only 1 value
inside of there because remember we
deleted the 10 all right quick overview
of sets now let's take a look at maps
now a map is going to be a collection of
key value pairs and I will come in here
and create one so we'll call this random
map and you guys go new map like that
and there you go you created one and if
we want to handle error enter in value
we can go random map set and then we're
going to define our key I'm just going
to call this key 1 of course it doesn't
have to be called key 1 and we can throw
anything we want inside of there so I
can say random string random map again
and we'll throw another one in there and
I'll just call this key to once again
for no reason I'll throw a 10 inside of
there we're going to be able to get the
values that are stored inside of there
so we can say key 1 and then we'll go
random map get and then pass in whatever
key that we were looking for and it's
going to pop that back to us and let's
go and grab the other one just to give
you an example of what they both do so
just change that to key 2 and that's not
a problem and there you can see random
string and 10 comes back this should be
key to whatever that's fine we're also
of course going to be able to get our
map size the number of values that are
stored inside of it and that's just
going to be random map and then size
like you may have guessed that is and
then once again of course we're going to
be able to iterate through this guy
one way to do that is with four each and
here I'm going to function I want to get
the value and the key that is going to
be stored inside of there come down here
throw that there and then I want to
print out that information so let's just
keep this rather simple I'm just going
to say that I want the key and then
after that I want the value associated
with that key and you can see it did
just that
okay so cool stuff and now to wrap it up
I want to talk about promises now
promises define code that is going to be
executed later and promises either
succeed or fail once and they are either
going to have a state of fulfilled
rejected pending or settled and I think
the best way to understand them is to
sort of see them in an action now a
promise what I want to do here first is
cover a promise that is handled
immediately so to create one let me go
p1 and say promise resolve and I'll call
resolve me as what's going to be passed
inside of here then you're going to have
a function and it is called then and
it's going to take two optional
arguments being first a callback for
success and then another for failure but
they are optional so here we go res that
and this is going to be resolved so we
can go documents and write and then we
will print out on the screen the message
that we want printed out on the screen
I'm going to show you three examples and
there's resolved me so this was passed
and it was caught it was printed okay so
let's do something a little bit more
complicated what I want to do now is
create a promise that's going to execute
after say two seconds so let's just
create a brand new one here and we'll go
to p2 is equal to new promise once again
it's receiving a function and we'll say
resolve or reject close that off and
then to time it out I'm going to call
set timeouts don't put anything inside
of there use our arrow
and then I will call resolve and pass
resolve me after two seconds of past so
that's going to be 2000 milliseconds so
then we can come down here and call the
then function and here is going to be
the message passed in once again and
then we can do a document right on this
guy and pass the message inside of there
there you go reload it and then uncaught
and get rid of that throw that and
reload it and you can see resolve me
shows up and then after two seconds
resolve me shows up maybe I should
change the message so resolve me to
reload it and there you can see resolve
me two shows up after two seconds now
let's show you another one where we have
a situation where a promise can be
fulfilled or rejected so I'm going to go
random value is equal to 18 and then we
will define our promise call this
promise 3 is equal to new promise and
here we'll have our function and it will
need to be resolved or rejected through
that down there and then it's going to
be resolved or not resolved based off
the value of the random value so I'm
going to say if the random value is
equal to 6 then I want to resolve it I
want to say that this is a good value
and of course it's just random stuff and
then we can reject it otherwise and we
will say that it's a bad value and how
we can handle this is go p3 then and vow
and document writes and print out our
value in that situation and why do I
keep spelling then wrong and then I'm
going to put a comma here and then we'll
have a situation in which we get an
error and in that situation we will
print out that error I like that and
then close that off like that and here
you can see bad value comes back because
the value here is 18 and if we would
change this to 18 you can see that we
get good value another thing that's
important is that you should add a catch
to the chain to handle your errors
always so it's going to do one more
example here so I'm going to go
our p4 is equal to new promise resolve
and reject again and let's come up here
and throw our random value inside of
here just so we can have something to
check against so here we'll say random
value is equal to 18 just like we did
previously and now what we're going to
do is which will say if random value is
less than or equal to 17 then we want to
throw an error and what we'll say here
is can't vote which is going to work
basically exactly the same as a reject
LS will say resolved and in that
situation we will say can vote and then
we'll use then once again so we'll go p4
and then and we'll receive our value and
then in which we do not have an error
thrown there we will print out the value
that was passed there and otherwise we
can say catch and catch the error in
that situation and here we will print
out our error message and there we go
and reload it and see what happens and
you can see the can vote comes back and
if I would come in here and change that
to 5 and reload you're gonna see the
can't vote shows up all right there guys
that is a rough overview of a vast
number of changes that have taken place
with ECMAScript 6 since the previous
version hopefully that helps you guys
resolve any issues or questions that you
might have and like always please leave

otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
