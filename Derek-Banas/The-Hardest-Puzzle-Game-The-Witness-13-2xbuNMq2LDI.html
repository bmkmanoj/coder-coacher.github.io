much for showing up my how many people
are watching I don't know how many
people are watching 22 fans you are the
best okay so cool so I figured out how
to enter this area after I left last
night basically if you want to know you
just come down here huh come down
through here between these rocks and the
little blah so this is where I came in
at okay so I'm just missing it before
but whatever we figured it out and I
think there's another path yeah there's
another path here do-do-do-do-do watch
me I'll go and get lost just see there's
the whatever that thing is called like I
said I don't know what anything is
called because I'm going out of my way
to not know anything about this game
until I play it all right so where's the
party at now that I was looking for okay
so i must I didn't look at this stuff so
I'm assuming it's sound again oh boy
there's a little dot and there's a big
dot very happy to hear that Jackson 55
fans 51 fans drop down to 51 okay so i
gotta listen to this did so i don't know
ok
I guess let's just try this okay that
work okay is this a new sound so sound
like the same sort of thing so is it
like this okay oh boy I hope boy can you
guys hear that oh boy
no i do not think it's possible to learn
java in one night i mean i don't know it
depends on if you know any other
languages i guess okay so i gotta listen
to the second do it okay so okay so i'm
guessing
ok so that's definitely the lowest is
the big one and there's only that it
starts off with two sides that are the
same so this this it sounds like it goes
up ok this is my guess awesome ok next
one oh boy yeah it's a bird what I'm
trying to do is solve the puzzle by
trying to figure out these pitches oh my
what this is insane yes the the big dot
is the lowest bid what sounds like the
big one is last which kind of makes
sense this isn't saying this really is a
present yeah I am enjoying this game
there's a lot of added pressure to live
streaming it because you know overwatch
updated said something like this I think
the big ones the last one that is not
right oh that means i have to solve this
one so i have to memorize how i did this
and then solve it again this is like
this and then like this and like this
and like this yeah the four are the big
dots definitely last those are the same
size
yeah I think it's got it wrong person I
think it's like this bridge me Oh
oh boy it's so hard to hear because
there's different sounds
okay well it's definitely this
I'm guessing let's try this oh I got
lucky okay good and now this one
okay so it's it's a little dot and then
it's this dog I think oh wait a minute
come on board I think it's a big dog is
it like this i'm i'm doing a little bit
of guessing here on problems no
monogatari day this one I don't know if
you guys have heard this before but I
really think this game makes you better
at problem solving by doing this like in
general which I guess makes sense you
know practice
I think it's this that's definitely that
I i don't i'm seriously just guessing
how many chirps are there let's say
looks like 10 chirps I think I got the
beginning right oops oh I can't do that
oh yeah I can I can do this I know what
I am not kidding you I guess pretty much
in the last three and I guess I got it
right right so now what oh where does
the light goes over there someone
yeah there was plenty of sounds there to
mess with me so where does that thing go
to
in here I think this is just a dead end
right oh maybe not
yeah it is
wait it's over here ah what's this oh
this is the laser did I saw it awesome
and other laser down hmm alright another
turf parent what's it gonna do Sh Oh
what's this
and then that opens all right and then
when i asked you guys what i should do
next you told me what the greenhouse
which i guess is this thing down on the
beach alright so we've got another laser
i think i'm dangerously close to getting
this done to beat in this game ok so
here we are and somebody else told me
that i might not be able to pass this
because I'm color blind which would
really suck but this is a great house
right this is what you were calling a
greenhouse I mean it looks like there's
plants in there so I guess that's a
greenhouse last time I checked so black
and the white and let's just go down
here and do this and do this and do this
and do this is that right good and we
are here pretty flowers ok what's this
like growing in there Oh
a sitrep what's a sitrep I don't know
what that is sorry okay so we got
different things again this looks like
paint now and that looks that's a purple
thing let's look around here and see if
there's some clue to what's going on
okay so i gotta solve these to do this
no idea what this is so i'm just gonna
guess okay so then we I'm just going by
whoops whoops by how we solve two other
puzzles in the past which is basically
to just divide everything up and I
worked so how are we gonna divide this
up do this do this do this and do this
Sam's yes okay good ok these are hey I
don't want to say it as soon as I say
these are easy thanks get a lot harder
let's try to notice and then like this
and then like this and then like this
okay and let's try doing
I'll situation report I'm trying to
solve mazes how I'm solving this if you
want to look at least this is what I
assume so this game just gets
progressively harder and it's been what
they enjoy doing is making you think you
know what's the way to solve the puzzle
and then you find out that that's not
true so what I did here was I divided
the purple and the white dots away from
the green dots so everybody's in its own
Gordon cordon off space and that's how I
saw the puzzle so and it just gets
progressively harder and harder and
harder the longer you play so something
lay way there's a purple layer
maybe
and that's not going to work maybe like
that and then like this
and then like this whoops see everything
has to be in its own box ish I mean it's
not really a box but they're basically
discordant off awesome did it oops I get
some more and the whole idea is to light
up these lasers for some reason I have
no idea why I'm hoping they call it the
witness i'm assuming I'm witnessing
something but somebody said it might
just be like some strange you know like
double meaning thing I don't know who
knows this guy's kind of nutty so yeah
and this is from the creator of braid
see they just get more and more
complicated well actually they don't
this one's not hard let's do this and
down like this and everything's all in
its own box I still don't see the
problem with being colorblind I'm not
like completely colored want I can it's
not like I see greys or whatever a lot
of people think color color blind means
all you do is see Grey's it's not true
the color blind i am is I you know what
I don't even know specifically but I
look at certain colors and my wife yells
at me and tells me no they're not the
color that I think they are there some
other guy so that's the type of color
blend I am so I'm blind to certain
colors in certain situations make sense
let me do this important this Oh nope I
have to get those Purple's together
hmm right here this
the Purple's there
hmm
yeah i'm semi colorblind
no I'm colorblind the same way in both
us as far as i know you know i don't
really look at it I don't really pay any
attention to it how i divide to
something also keep the purple I don't
know
mrs. I'm stupid here
does that would have the yellow and the
it's not purple it's pink say you can
find out what color that looks like pink
to me so is that really purple I don't
know my wife yells at me all she knows
more about my problems than than I do
that's a good thing about being married
maybe and I'm sorry I can't solve these
problems I'm just gonna act like it's
gonna work as long as the Pink's are
outside of this other area I'm gonna say
if that works or not well I don't know
so I'll do like this and then like this
so everything's corned off let's see if
that works please please there you are
ok so the blues and you know I think you
get it
so do the blues and whites need cordon
off maybe we'll do the purple or the I
keep calling upper that's like a I don't
know what color that is
I can't do it that way
this
that's the same color yeah i think they
are so i can do it this way right yay
alright so i made it into this lab
occasionally they give you like an audio
file but the auto fouls make no sense so
you know whatever that's worth okay so
wait a minute
I notice yes I did notice this look at
that the color is different that's not
just my eyes is it see look they have
two reds or four Reds a whole bunch of
greens and then like a gray at the top
so am I supposed to follow this or am I
supposed to follow what's in the yellow
just stumbled upon that
hmm
somebody says at the end of it something
happens that I don't know why I'm system
am I supposed to be paying attention to
color in a glass or the other color I
know the color are the colors in a glass
or a heck of a lot easier let's see that
doesn't work this put this on the odds
yeah I don't think there's a solvable
based off of just use this many colors
there's too many things oh yeah this is
definitely not solvable look the screens
over here and I have to have them all in
the same box so I bet you I need to use
the colors I sir outside here all right
I'm just gonna roll a picture to save
myself from losing my mind oops some
people are of the opinion that it's
cheating that if you use a paper and
pencil but i don't care i want to solve
this game sometime in my lifetime and
it's hard enough I don't need to worry
about that all right so up here up here
up here and like this and then like this
and then like this if you want to see
what I drew there you go say that's I'm
going to try and drawn out here on this
so otherwise I'd have to be able to keep
that all in my brain all at one time and
you know no you straining myself so so
it's this way and then like this let's
see if that works awesome what's I'm
guessing this is the same way right so
walks yes paper time
if you're any noise in the background
that is my wife and children they very
loud kids
so to be out there have kids that are
not loud I've heard of it I see some of
these kids on TV I sort of scare me you
know like the four-year-old that's can
play the piano as good as you know
professional pianist and things like
that see these are actually easy well
now that I saw that thing and they're
impossible without putting the mirror or
without the window this is a little bit
harder
my kids are four and seven
okay two girls and I could give you my
great-grandmother's theory on why people
have girls versus boys but I don't want
to cause a riot all right it's at all I
can all I will say is that her belief
has held true of every single person
that I've ever met that had a child not
honors this is okay oh I guess the only
thing there is to do is to do this
everything's the same does that mean I
just do this no all those colors are the
same as far as I can tell is there a
window to look through no oh what's this
over here I supposed to do this instead
okay
all right ok so now I see that they are
different this is actually oh boy yeah
I'm having a hard time seeing us I can't
see it that's just in the spectrum of
what I'm gonna be able to say I don't
know if everybody else can see it easy
but yeah it's not easy for me ok puzzle
was easy was just everything else was
hard about it
um I don't think I can solve this so
that means i need the the light thing
right and maybe I'll do this and it'll
open up again they're closed yep that
was what I'm supposed to do
look at me using my brain might light up
two lasers in one game i don't think
i've done that before i'll be very very
exciting awesome Oh was that there's
nothing else in here is her nope okay
now this is the this is lettuce cabbage
some sort of i'll just say leafy
vegetable and leave it at that
some sort of elevator I don't know if
there's a clue in here to what's coming
up next or what okay so stairs do I go
down or do I go up there's more
vegetables time for the hard part oh no
this is not a rerun oh this is where I'm
supposed to be
why is this hard
I mean it looks straightforward is it
not straightforward
somebody just said this is hard I'm when
I say somebody I'm not talking about
somebody in this world talking about
somebody in the chat to see he'll think
I'm completely crazy and I'm hearing
voices
okay whoop now where am I what's going
on okay so elevator
so the stairs got me up here
there's the elevator
it's not a puzzle hidden here somewhere
is ur the Flint oc1 so one on a roof hmm
definitely messes with the RS I don't
know I'm confused
was there a latch or some sort of switch
in this elevator that I missed elevator
is here right yep oh the puzzle changed
maybe I have to do the puzzle again and
just do it different
it's like this ok so I just have to do
this puzzle which attempts
this is supposed to be hard this is easy
the wire on the right means something
okay
okay this and that this and that
no that's not the way to do it start
over this and that
okay like this right I don't sound good
oh it's broke maybe that means that's
where I'm supposed to leave okay oh wait
a minute this isn't changing I did it no
change the same okay so look at this
place puffers more peppers cool
um
all right now I don't know completely
confused is there like a pane of glass I
can look through to make it do something
different that's the same puzzle and
it's broken
am I supposed to use the logic from the
previous video where the Blues are if I
was looking through glass those are
blues and then I'm supposed to just
assume so under that assumption it would
be like this hahaha oh it didn't work I
thought it worked but it didn't work
okay well I laughed and what happens now
maybe something did change and I just
think it didn't all right now i'm
thoroughly confused
and I can't fall off of here right nope
and I can't climb up this edge of this
nope
and this is broken and i have no idea
how to bring it back okay so solve this
again
I'd bet you
Oh
treat this center two colors on the
puzzle has two different sections okay
hmm
okay well based off somebody I think
helped me a little bit here so you're
saying that I should go like this that
through a certain color of light that
the deep blue would be different than
the green and the cyan
oops this is closed
there's still no way up
oops oh I got off on it did I just break
the game oh I did break the game
oh let's came back for me okay so to
that again I got a little bit too
interested oh ok so let's go and pack up
again
oh ok so I'm here awesome
so is that it look at all the flowers
I'm walking all over did I actually get
to lasers in one playthrough all that is
awesome i think if i can get this to
light up oh there's a thing up there
that's probably the last puzzle or
something is it
and do I do this now
no it's not what I do oh I can't move oh
ok hmm
so
so I must I have to go and solve one
more time to get up there there have to
get three
hmm
ok so hopeless
hmm
oh these are different colors
oh ok
that's color blind see I can't I
couldn't tell the difference between the
top three and the left three from this
distance I can't tell the difference
they look like the same color that's why
I was so confused somebody pointed out
that they are in fact different so let's
try doing this and doing this doing this
and doing us awesome thank you for that
somebody is very unhappy at my video in
my chat system I'm not certain why
alright I guess this is it two lasers
one show what should I try to beat next
tell me sorry if it's impolite to pull
the point I guess it is actually what
should I do next I don't know what's
next I don't know what I've accomplished
already oh I know what I've accomplished
already but I don't know what lasers are
left to do so if any of you guys out
there have any idea what laser you and
or what area I should go after next I do
remember there was a lighthouse and was
there anything else I remember passing
up not really I can't think of anything
so whatever go back to the shipwreck and
take a look around windmill town I think
I've done like almost everything I've
done very little in the town aside from
what they are calling the monastery I
did both the tree levels distinction oh
look at that shot up in here I did the
treehouse I did the deserts pyramid
thing I think I'm very close to being
done I mean based off of what people
have told me so all right so you want me
to go into the town next there's a
basement you went to from the jungle
windmill alright so everybody's saying
do the windmill and do the town so next
time I do a stream which will be
Thursday thank you all for showing up I
really appreciate it it's fun and I'm
sorry that I upset that one guys so much
but either way uh like always please
leave your questions and comments below
up next I'm doing windmill or the town
or whatever and otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
