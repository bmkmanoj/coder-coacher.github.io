you my recipe for scrambled tofu it is a
great way to brighten up your breakfast
and it is extremely easy to make when
combined with a meatless sausage patty
and a little bit of refried beans and
salsa this makes for one heck of a
hearty breakfast so let's get into
making it now the very first thing we're
gonna do is get ourselves a half of a
tablespoon of salt and then I'm gonna
get myself some garlic powder and I'm
gonna add one teaspoon of garlic powder
in a separate Bowl and then to make this
a little bit spicy I'm gonna add one
teaspoon of paprika if you want to make
it less spicy just don't add the paprika
and then I'm gonna get myself a teaspoon
of onion powder and as you can see
pretty much everything here is gonna be
all about the spices and it's gonna go
together really well then I'm gonna get
myself a fourth of a cup of nutritional
yeast which you can get in pretty much
any health food store or you could order
online nutritional yeast is a great way
to spice up vegetarian cooking and then
we're gonna get ourselves 14 ounces of
soft tofu and I'm gonna let a little bit
of the liquid in there just to aid in
mixing the tofu with all of the spices
we're gonna be adding and then I'm gonna
be adding 1/2 of a cup of onion pepper
and mushroom and I'm gonna chop these up
real nice and tiny and I'm gonna get
myself some mushroom again 1/2 of a cup
and then once again we're gonna say it
ourselves some green pepper and this
isn't very hot so I'm just gonna mix
this up and again 1/2 cup of that and
then I'm gonna chop it up until
everything is nice and tiny and now we
move on to the tofu and I'm gonna dump
out some of this excess liquid basically
I'm gonna have about 3 tablespoons of
that excess liquid inside of there like
I said before just to aid in mixing
everything and I'm just gonna crumble
all of that soft tofu down and then I'm
gonna add my vegetables and then I just
want to mix all of these vegetables
together in the soft tofu until
everything is very equally combined
across all of the tofu and then I'm
going to slowly mix together all of the
spices into the tofu so I'm gonna
sprinkle on some of those spices and I'm
going to mix and then add some more and
the
mix and I'm gonna do this slowly don't
add it all at once it'll start to clump
you want to make sure that all the
spices are evenly distributed across all
of the tofu and vegetables you have in
your bowl and now it is gonna be time to
cook so I'm gonna put about a tablespoon
two tablespoons of olive oil and I'm
also gonna have myself some meatless
sausage which I actually have the recipe
for that in the description underneath
this video as well and I normally cook
these two guys at the same time so I'm
gonna have my meatless sausage over in
one pan at 60% and I'm gonna cook it
three minutes per side I'm gonna drop a
little chunk in there and wait till it
boils and then I'm gonna add the sausage
to a pan and as you can source see there
it's bubbling now I'm gonna add it in
there again three minutes per side and I
can just put that on another burner and
basically ignore it and then I'm gonna
add all of my tofu to another pan and
it's gonna be set on high and I'm just
gonna stir stir stir until about six
minutes goes by and then of course I'm
gonna taste it maybe add a little bit of
pepper but this time it tastes fabulous
and this is what it's gonna look like
when it's done looks almost exactly like
eggs I'm gonna throw in a meatless
sausage and I'm gonna throw in some of
my tofu in a bowl I also I'm gonna add
some homemade refried beans and some
homemade salsa to this dish it's a heck
of a great breakfast please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
