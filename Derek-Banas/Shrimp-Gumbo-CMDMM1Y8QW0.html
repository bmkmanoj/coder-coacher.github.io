you my family's absolute favorite things
that I make it is a shrimp gumbo and
it's absolutely awesome over rice or you
could just eat like a soup like this and
it's extremely easy to make and now I'm
gonna show you exactly how to make it
our first thing I do is get about 1 cup
of white onions and chop that up and
then do the same with 1 red pepper that
has been deseeded and then you're going
to get 2 pounds of shrimp and you're
gonna take all the shells off and you're
gonna add 2 cups of water to that turn
it on high for that to boil and doesn't
just let it sit as you create a roux I'm
using an Earth Balance olive oil spread
you can use butter or whatever and I'm
going to throw into the pan 3
tablespoons of butter roughly and then
to complete the roux of course you're
going to get some all-purpose flour it
doesn't matter just white flour stir
your butter so to make sure that the
flour doesn't come in contact with the
hot pan and then you're going to be
adding in 3 tablespoons of that flour
you could also use arrowroot here
instead of flour if you want to avoid
the gluten and then you're gonna whisk
this together until there are no lumps
and this is roughly how big the onions
are whenever I have them all chopped up
you can dye something or do whatever I
like them to be a little bit chunky and
then you're going to add in all of the
onions and all of the peppers into your
pot and then you're going to stir those
together until everything is nicely
formed together not a big deal just
start them together a little bit then
you're gonna be adding in 29 ounces of
diced tomatoes and leave all the juice
inside of there and it doesn't matter
what brand you get I just got hunts
because they were on sale and then
you're gonna add in 16 ounces of tomato
sauce and once again I used hunts and
then you're gonna get yourself some
minced garlic and I'm going to put 2
tablespoons of minced garlic inside of
there you can use regular old cloves of
garlic if that's what you prefer but I
just choose that because it's easy then
you're gonna add 2 tablespoons of
parsley flakes and yes I prefer parsley
flakes over a regular fresh parsley and
then we're going to add some salt and by
the way the pot is on hot right now it's
on high and we're gonna add 1 teaspoon
of salt and we're gonna add 1/4 of a
teaspoon of black pepper and now it's
time to bring the heat I got some
cayenne pepper and I use 1/2 of a
teaspoon but of
she wanted hotter just to add more
cayenne pepper and it'll be hotter now
just stir everything together to make
sure that the flour or the roux is all
mixed together with the tomato sauce and
then you're gonna get the juice from the
shrimp that has been boiling over on the
left side and you're gonna get all that
juice and try to get any shells inside
of there and dump the two cups or
whatever remaining of the water into
your tomato sauce mixture you're gonna
bring that to a boil and then you're
gonna get yourself 14 ounces of okra and
then stir that together and then you're
going to turn it down to medium heat and
let that cook for 15 minutes after the
15 minutes are up stirring of course to
make sure that nothing burns in the
bottom you're then gonna get your two
pounds of D shelled shrimp and throw
them in there and then they're either
gonna cook if they're frozen they're
gonna cook for at least ten minutes and
if they are not frozen you're gonna cook
them for about five minutes and there
you go you got yourself some shrimp
gumbo like I said I prefer this over a
rice some people just prefer it as a
soup you can eat it would it ever way
you prefer and of course the recipe is
in the description below and like always
