like the last video I did on the United
States economy so today I'm going to
explain the United States financial
crisis by the end of this video you're
gonna understand derivatives
collateralized debt obligations and
credit default swaps and a whole bunch
more
believe me this stuff really isn't that
complicated and you should never trust
someone who says that something is
complicated as you hand them your money
derivatives were simply created to help
banks investors corporations manage risk
it's just simply a financial arrangement
between two groups and a person would
buy a derivative so that they have the
option to buy an investment at a set
price in the future no matter what
happens to that investment whether the
price increases or what-have-you they
can still purchase it at that set price
by buying the derivative these items
commonly are commodities corporate bonds
currencies government debt interest
rates good mortgages stocks etc here's a
really simple example let's say you go
to the coffee shop with your buddy and
you don't have your wallet your buddy
says fine I will buy you a cup of coffee
today for $1 and in exchange the next
time we meet you will buy me a cup of
coffee no matter what the price is the
only difference between that situation
and what goes on on Wall Street is
contracts are signed so if a cup of
coffee costs $2 in the future you just
saved yourself a dollar by buying that
cup of coffee or spending that dollar
this day another example is with
Airlines airlines often will go to banks
and they will buy a derivative and they
will say I want to give you a certain
amount of money to guarantee that I can
buy fuel in the future for $100 how much
do I need to pay you so that I can hedge
against the risk of oil prices rising
above $100 a barrel what a lot of people
don't realize is that bank does not
purchase that barrel of oil and hold
onto it for six months they instead take
on the risk that they will have to buy
that barrel of oil for say $150 in the
future and then sell it for $100 losing
$50 per barrel there are two types of
derivatives that are the first is the
option what this just simply says is in
the future the purchaser of the
derivative has the option to buy the cup
of coffee but will not be forced to do
it if they do not want to do it then you
have futures or swaps they are identical
they're the same exact
and under a future or swap derivative
these two people in the future will be
forced at some point in time or when
some event occurs to make a transaction
the only problem with this as you're
gonna see later on in the tutorial is if
these derivatives are handled in an
unregulated market there is no guarantee
that the other side is actually going to
fulfill the contract then we come to
collateralized debt obligations a CDO is
just a pull of assets in this
presentation I'm going to really focus
on mortgages because that is the heart
of the collapse in the stock market to
own a mortgage CDO you pay a fixed
amount of money to own a piece of the
CDO and then whenever the homeowners pay
principal and interest each month you
receive a percentage of that principal
and interest payment to make it really
simple let's take it down to one
mortgage homeowner goes to a bank says I
want to buy this hundred thousand dollar
home in exchange the bank says fine
there's a hundred thousand dollars fine
this contract and promise that you will
pay us principal and interest until the
home is paid off then commonly what
occurs is the bank takes this agreement
and sells it to an investor and there
you go you got a collateralized debt
obligation so in essence the homeowner
is paying the investor in the CDO the
investor then to hedge against the risk
that the home owner does not make
payments or defaults on the contract can
go to a stockbroker and buy what's
called a credit default swap or a
derivative and by paying the stockbroker
a certain amount of money if the
homeowner defaults this stockbroker
promises to pay the investor in this
derivative in the future to further
explain as a credit default swap is kind
of like life insurance the only major
difference between a CBS contract and a
life insurance contract is that the life
and health insurance industry markets
are regulated as you can see here's cash
reserves they must have money on hand to
pay out if purchasers of life insurance
should pass away the CDs market is not
regulated see no pool of money so if the
life insurance industry wasn't regulated
like the CBS market this is how life
insurance would work I convinced you to
pay me $20 a month for $100,000 payable
on death I don't create a separate
account from which I can someday pay
your beneficiary that $100,000 you die
and when your beneficiary shows up
wanting $100,000 I
don't have it in this situation I would
be liable for that hundred thousand
dollars but that really doesn't matter
now does it now on the other hand me
being the person that sold the life
insurance I could go to a stockbroker
and say I want to buy a CD s that pays
out if mr. Smith dies the bank would
then say okay this is how much that
would cost and then I would be able to
cover that issue however once again if
that broker sold me this CD S through an
unregulated market they also would not
have principle to pay me so we're back
where we were before what's worse is
credit fault swaps can be sold to
uninterested party so in this life
insurance example people that have no
interest in mr. Smith's life could
actually go and pay a bank a certain
amount of money and whenever mr. Smith
dies they would receive a payout if the
bank actually has any money to pay them
so these two gentlemen on the Left
actually have an interest in mr. Smith's
death more than they have an interest in
mr. Smith living in unregulated markets
this is possible in regulated markets
like the life insurance industry however
this is not so there was a lot of
interest in purchasing these CB o--'s
because the payouts were great but after
a while they were just not enough highly
rated mortgages to sell so that's where
the credit rating agencies stepped in
they said that if you pull enough of
these bad mortgages together you
actually lower dramatically the overall
risk of any of these homes defaulting
and the credit rating agencies believed
even if you had a whole bunch of bad
mortgages if you pulled enough of them
together they would actually be triple-a
rated and so begins a very vicious cycle
in which bankers who pay the credit
rating agencies to rate their
investments pay the credit rating agency
and turn bad mortgages into supposedly
good triple-a mortgages or CDOs
and then the banks were able to go to
outside investors and even though the
investment was a triple C for example
they were honestly able to say this is a
triple-a rated investment because the
credit rating agencies said it was but
once again because this was an
unregulated market whenever all these
homes began to get foreclosed on and
investors in the credit default swaps
wanted paid because of the foreclosures
the banks did not have any money in
reserves to pay out on these credit
default swaps and to show you just how
bad it got on the left you will see
total payout amount on all credit
default swaps this means this was the
total amount they were on the hook for
it equals out to sixty two point two
trillion dollars in one year because of
the financial collapse of these credit
default swaps that total payout dropped
to thirty eight point six trillion
dollars in just one year and as a
comparison you can see on the right side
of the screen the total global gross
domestic product of the entire world
which is sixty two point nine trillion
dollars so on the Left you have sixty
two point two trillion that supposedly
these banks were gonna pay out even
though in an entire year the globe could
only actually pay out sixty two point
nine trillion dollars then we come to
the collateralized debt obligations in
2007 all of these collateralized debt
obligations had a total value of one
hundred and eighty billion dollars in
just one year that amount fell to twenty
billion dollars
then the banks got really creative they
actually started pulling together CDOs
that were designed to fail they went to
their clients and they said oh yeah this
CDO is really good you should buy it
they then turned around and went to
other banks and said I want to buy
credit default swaps that will pay out
whenever these bad CDOs that I sold my
clients fail the bankers that they
bought these credit default swaps off of
of course did not have the principal to
pay out whenever these CDOs collapsed
but they didn't care about that because
they expected the United States
government to step in whenever this
whole entire ball of wax melted the
Federal Reserve spent two point seventy
four trillion dollars buying toxic
assets and funding the banks after the
collapse unregulated credit default
swaps are still not regulated in the
United States over seventy five percent
of all trades on Wall Street or actually
not regulated and no one has been
punished as of today for this whole
entire mess so simply what you have to
ask yourself is when it will it happen
again and put this big payout by the Fed
into perspective on the left side of
your screen right here you see two point
seventy six trillion dollars at the Fed
paid out this is the entire net worth
all assets minus all liabilities for the
bottom 80% of Americans that equals out
the four point fifty four trillion
dollars so that means that the Fed paid
out over sixty percent of the end
our net worth of the bottom 80% of
Americans and hereby all the way is the
total net worth of the top 19 percent in
the United States and the top 1 percent
which is at 27 point 74 trillion dollars
