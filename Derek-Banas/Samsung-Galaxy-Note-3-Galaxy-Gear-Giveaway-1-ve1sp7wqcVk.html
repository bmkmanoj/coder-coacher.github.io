hopefully everybody's here for the live
hangout I'm going to shut off my email
cuz that's one of the ways i'm going to
verify that i got the right people out
there okay so I'm gonna give everybody a
chance to log on can everybody hear me
and I'm also checking to see that I can
see chats and such on the screen don't
the boom to doom so with anybody could
please go and say that they see my chat
so my pop ups are everywhere okay
alright so I'm just going to jump into
this what you guys are here for I had a
contest and now I have six of these but
I'm not giving away all six today I'm
giving away this what you see in my
hands right here this is what you're
getting and to be able to get into this
contest you needed to go on and answer
all of my trick questions on my website
and a good number of you did I had 52
people i believe all together and all
those people are right here all of you
are inside of their books one of you
almost popped out okay so that is going
to be the goal but what I wanted to do
and please leave a message here if
anybody can see me I had see that I have
15 viewers but I want to make sure that
i can see what you type into the screen
now I always see these contests and they
only seem to come down to luck which I
don't really care for very much so what
I did was I decided I was going to give
away these six devices based off of
competition like real competition so
basically the very first one was a whole
bunch of trick questions based off of an
interview that I did and I thought that
came through pretty well and keep
getting google hangout messages and
basically
get what I want to do with the rest of
them is I want to have completely
different competitions for each of these
pairs of devices right here so what I'm
going to do for the next winter I
thought it would be good basically what
i'm doing here is just wasting time
waiting for people to get on i see i
have 34 viewers to win the next pair of
devices what i decided to do was to
incorporate multiple different skill
sets so that people with different
skills would have an equal opportunity
of winning so the first one was based
off of trick questions and that was
basically just you know an easy thing to
do my next one is going to be based
around the concept that I personally
think this is the best phone for artists
because of the pen I think that and
everything um if anybody ever would say
to me what's the best phone for for art
I can't there's nothing even comes close
to this this of course is my opinion and
I'm not being told by Samsung to say any
of these things is purely what I think
so i thought the next winner would be
the person over this week you have from
now until next friday to send me links
to your artwork just go on my website
new think tank calm and leave a link to
any type of artwork that you have now to
make sure that i could cut down on
copying potential copying of other
people's artwork i want to the artwork
to in some way incorporate either a note
3 i don't care if it's a robot shape
like a note 3 or anything or a person i
don't care really i'm just using this
like I said to basically keep people
from copy and other people's artwork and
because there is a chance that I won't
be able to find it on the internet or
the galaxy gear smartwatch so you have
to incorporate that somehow into artwork
to get into the contest and if you are
the best you will win
completely judged based off of either me
or my daughter I haven't decided who's
going to decide what artwork is the best
so that's the person that's going to get
the next phone I'll war and the next
watch after that what i want to do
because this device also i don't think
anybody knows this is one of the first
devices i think there's only three
devices that record at 4k video which is
ridiculously a high-resolution this
records at 4k since it is a fabulous
device for video it would be good to
have people make a video and submit that
video to me and the person that makes
the funniest tasteful video is going to
win another device for the third well
actually it's the fourth device I want
somebody to make android apps so you can
make an Android app using traditional
java android or anything that you like
and whichever one I think is the best
you are going to win said devices and
then you could like I said you use App
Inventor you can use unity3d I don't
care what it is use anything you want
send it to me and like I think I've
shown in a lot of my videos you can sit
down for two hours and make a pretty
nice app so I think that's more than
worth almost nine hundred dollars in
devices I mean and for the fifth what
I'd like you to do if you want to win
these devices and these are going to be
structured over weeks so the very first
week this week coming up you're going to
need to make some type of artwork that
in some way incorporates a note 3 a and
or a galaxy gear smartwatch I don't care
what it is it just has to incorporate it
in some way not saying that has to be
the focus of the artwork but it has to
be in there somewhere and like I said
these are my ideas also um Samsung gave
me all these devices to give to you guys
and I said to them what I wanted to
in these giveaways and this was a
hundred percent my idea all this stuff
here is a hundred percent mine I know I
of course I had to ask them is it okay
and but they said yeah that sounds great
so more information is going to come
then for the fifth device I want you all
to take photographs and I'm going to put
limits on what the photograph needs to
be of or something that needs
incorporated into the photograph best
photograph wins I think it sounds I
think it sounds good and it's going to
give people with all kinds of different
skill sets an opportunity to win which
is my main goal and then the final phone
is going to go to I want you to write
and this is going to be like five weeks
from now so you could prepare for all
these um the very final one is I'm going
to have people submit short stories I
haven't decided how long the story needs
to bait but everybody that once in the
competition to for a chance to win has
to submit a short story and the best one
wins so basically we're incorporating
programming ability basic art ability
video skills photography skills and
writing skills and so I thought that
would be a fun competition and just
threw it out there and I'm giving you
peep I'm giving everybody here five
weeks notice on how to win all of these
different devices so kind of cool and
I'm going to go over here and see oh
okay i'm starting to see your messages
they're not coming up where I thought
they would but whatever i'm looking at
your messages and it says yeah
everything needs to be clean err on the
side of funny and I mean you know if
anything is inappropriate i'm just going
to delete it i'm reading all your
questions here are you going to list
these so we could refer back to it yes
I'm going to put all this stuff on my
website um and I am going to say hey I'm
happy so people are enjoying this and I
just think it would be fun I just I
don't like contests where people just
win by luck
um dum de dum de dum it doesn't have to
be digital art actually I would prefer
if it was not digital art I'm actually
this is one thing I'm actually trained
in his illustration so i will like if
you do a wonderful watercolor i will be
able to appreciate the quality of said
watercolor so yes don't try to add don't
try to dumb down your artwork because
you think I won't be able to appreciate
it the better the better chance you have
of winning alright so I'm seeing all
your comments it's just not showing up
where Google told me it's supposed to
show up inside hangouts but that's cool
because I'm looking elsewhere and I can
see everything and yes am i echoing by
chance because in the video i did i was
echoing if you can't draw that's ok
because I'm I have other opportunities
to win based off of being funny or
entertaining in some way in a video or
making an app or taking a picture
remember it's going to be a picture of
something that I want to I want to see
and or writing a story so there's
numerous different ways to win know the
app doesn't have to have anything to do
with me I'm answering your questions if
you're wondering where my answers are
coming from the app doesn't have it
could be anything the app can be
literally anything I don't care what it
is I'm just going to judge it purely
based off of whether I like it or not
whether I think it's a professional
quality application yes you can start
doing them right now um but I wouldn't
start posting them on my website you
guys probably don't know this but I get
pretty overwhelmed no echo thank you for
that I was kind of guessing it was you
Jenny's earphones because minor ungodly
ugly but they work yeah don't start
submitting them until I actually say yes
it's time to submit the either the
artwork the artworks going to be like
right now you can start submitting the
artwork as soon as I put the page on my
website that says
the details about how to enter that
contest like I said you're going to be
able to enter the contest and submit
artwork up until Friday so you guys have
six days and then next Saturday I'm
going to look at all the artwork that I
have and I'm going to give away another
device to devices so yes you can do that
um and everything looks like you feel
free to ask me any other questions but
yeah I would you could start submitting
artwork immediately um but I would hold
off on submitting videos and short
stories and apps and all of that stuff
because the way it's going to be
structured you know this you know
there's my writing this is going to be
the next phone next one next one next
one next one I'm and a handout one a
week so over the next five weeks we're
going to have all these competitions and
I just thought it would be fun to do it
that way cuz you know just pulling a
name out of a hat this is basically were
you able to figure out all of my
trickery and yes there was a lot of
trickery in the questions and not all of
them but some of them and one of them I
ended up because it was fooling so many
people I decided to eliminate that
question and if you answered it wrong
over the course of the entire
competition just know that you were
qualified later like I think I have 52
people qualified there's a lot of people
that are qualified or yes I'm reading
the comments from Google+ but I think
they're exactly the same as the YouTube
ones oh well whoever just wrote that let
me look there's absolutely nothing that
needs to be included in the writing it
can be anything mhm so Nick Prada I saw
your message and your message is are you
reading the comments from Google+ of
YouTube so wherever you posted them I'm
on google+ I have a tendency to use
Google+ mainly because Google and
YouTube pretty much force anybody that
uses you too
to use google plus otherwise you can
just stomp your feet and get really mad
about the whole situation but I don't
think that really helps anybody and for
all of you people out there um I think
it was pretty well known that I used to
answer every single comment I got and
I've started to see people commenting
about me not answering comments what you
have to understand is very often under
the new youtube comment system I cannot
answer your comments I would guess that
I probably see thirty percent of your
comments and I'm able to answer them
sometimes I'm able to actually see your
comments but I can't answer them so just
understand if you don't have a Google+
account chances are i'm not gonna be
able to answer your comments so and
that's not going to change anytime soon
so on yes you can make app inventor
trivia games you can make any type of
app you want that's going to be for the
fourth the fourth phone um but the doc
tada and I don't know anybody else have
any other questions before I do the
drawing feel free to leave them in
wherever you're at google plus I suppose
no other questions okay well I gave how
many people are watching I've 43 people
watching I'm guessing as I'm looking at
these names I um i'm seeing almost
everything pretty handsome oh that's
funny yeah i don't normally tend to try
to look handsome let's sit here and
basically the way this is going to be
done is a name is going to be drawn i am
going to show you that and then i'm
going to ask that person to send me an
email i'm going to verify that the same
email was used that you provided on my
website as what you're going to use here
and the very first person that both is
drawn from the magical bowl
and responds or sends me an email is
going to be the winner and that's going
to be at please put this in writing some
where can I put what in writing oh oh
the contest the additional contest in
the future I will do that arm I don't
actually have a macbook I have an old
imac the main reason why i use macintosh
computer i can tell you one thing it is
unix and it has imovie those are the two
reasons that i have a mac and i use it
and also the screen is very big I like
it that's the reasons why I have that
because I'm noon normally I do like 50
million things at once on a screen your
application that you make does not have
to do doesn't have to have anything to
do with my tutorials or anything I'm
just looking for a quality application
don't care about how you made it I'm not
going to investigate how you made it I'm
going to check to make sure that it's
not you know a somebody else's software
to the best of my ability but other than
that I don't care what it is I don't
care if it's a frog or if it's if it's a
notebook app genre the story I don't
care what it is that's the short story
part of the competition don't care
really what it is um I've read all kinds
of things I don't normally now I have to
say I could like teen fiction I like The
Hunger Games it was alright so okay so
hopefully everybody's here and it's time

help me draw mom willow will come

website and those people that got the

drawing to win a note 3 and a galaxy
gear watch so that's what that was all
