my programming with Python 2.7 tutorial
today I'm going to cover a lot of things
like how to allow people to enter a
infinite number of attributes
inheritance how to override methods
polymorphism how to inherit from two or
more classes and I'm going to review
some additional interesting object
functions well one thing that's really
irritating about this program that I
created last time are these access or
functions so I'm going to get rid of
them and I'm going to show you how to
accept an infinite number of different
attributes without all that mess and I'm
also going to get rid of hungry up here
and then everything else is pretty much
the same except I added a new method
here called eat but I previously didn't
have now I'm going to show you how to
make a proper constructor file if you
didn't see the previous tutorials you
absolutely have to watch them otherwise
you're going to be extremely confused
because here I'm going to use my cave
orgs key value arguments dictionary to
allow the user of this class to set up
an infinite number of different
attributes which is going to be created
in this dictionary full of tuples you
guys asked for more complicated
tutorials and you're definitely getting
it right now then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take these attributes
and set them up based off of the key
valued pairs that are sent to this
constructor and there you have a real
constructor set up for you and then what
I'm going to do is I need to create a
way for the user of this class to be
able to set up arguments and I'm going
to create a method inside of here called
set attributes and it's going to do just
that
it's an accept key value pair as you see
right there and then remember self is a
reference to the object that is created
with this class and all I'm doing is
setting up the attributes here and this
one function is now going to take the
place of all the access or functions
that I previously was using going to do
it all automatically for me and this get
function will return any attributes as
long as I supply it with the proper key
and you're going to see in a second how
this works you could also do this inside
of Python with something called
properties but I'll save that for a
later tutorial okay so now this guy is
going to allow you to create as many
attributes as you need now I'm going to
go into exactly what we mean by
inheritance and make sure that you take
out your indent here because we're going
to define a new
class in this class is going to be named
dog and remember it's good practice to
have all of your classes start off with
an uppercase letter and we are going to
inherit all of the methods and
attributes of the class animal by
placing them inside here where we are
defining our class dog and as you see up
here with animal we did not inherit any
other methods when we technically did
you basically inherited the base object
with this but you can see that there's
no braces here and here we specifically
are adding the animal methods and
attributes and that is what we mean by
inherits now I get to create a
constructor file for this new class and
you do it in pretty much the same way
except for one thing I am going to call
specifically and this is going to set up
some errors here until I fix it this is
going to call the constructor file to
setup all the attributes up here so it's
actually this line of code is going to
call this constructor to setup all these
attributes for me and I'm passing it the
object dog so that it can easily do that
and then I'm going to set up the
specific attributes for this new dog
class okay
this line of code is not useable inside
of Python 2.7 without first going up
here and typing this line of code to
underscores mehta class 200 scores is
equal to type and meta classing is kind
of a complicated subject just to
understand the dis line of code is going
to allow you to use the new python 3.0
object functions inside of Python 2.7
and one of the options that's provided
by putting in that line of code is the
ability to use this super function which
is very very useful
and so that is inheritance and now what
I'm going to do is show you how to
override a function now of course dogs
make the ERR noise but they also make
the ever-popular wolf noise so what
we're going to do is we're going to
override this function and instead say
wolf wolf so now whenever noise is
called for a dog specific object it is
going to print out wolf wolf overriding
the original herb noise but how would
you access the ER noise because dogs
make that or noise as well and print out
the original the inherited class no
for the animal class how would you
access that simple just start off with
animal followed by noise braces and then
place self inside of that and that's
going to provide you with the ability to
use this new ability plus on top of that
use the previous methods as well and we
are also going to create another
inherited class called cat and this is
later going to be used to explain
polymorphism and save time I'm just
going to copy this but instead come in
here and change this to cat and of
course change this to meow and get rid
of this altogether and I'm going to also
come in here and create another method
called noise too and Aperta noise now
I'm going to create another function
outside remember of this class called
play with animal I'm going to pass to it
the animal object and then I'm going to
call a couple different functions all
this code is available at new think tank
by the way for free obviously and here
I'm going to get the attribute named
name and remember the double underscore
makes this attribute private and then
I'm also going to get the attribute
owner then I'm going to jump down into
main and create me a dog object for the
class dog I'm going to assign it a name
of Jake and then I'm also going to
create an owner Paul I'm creating
objects and I create another object
called Sophie and it's going to be a
type cat and named Sophie and make the
owner sue I don't know anybody named Sue
or Paul by the way it's kind of funny
and then this is polymorphism play with
animal and I'm going to pass it Sophie
instead even though it accepts of type
animal I'm passing it an object of type
cat which remember is inherited it
inherited all the classes and attributes
from the animal class and if I run this
you can see that this is what we call
polymorphism I am passing a class that
is not of type animal but inherits from
type animal and Python and an
object-oriented programming in general
it automatically accepts this animal and
whenever these methods are called it
says this and it figures out the
interpreter figures out completely on
its own that yes this is an object that
inherited from animal so I'm going to
that it's okay to use but whenever these
individual methods are called
it is going to actually call the
original objects method the new methods
that override it the animal methods that
were inherited this is polymorphism it
figures it out all on its own so I can
send this any type of animal anything
that inherits from animal and it's
automatically going to figure it out for
me and I'm going to come in here and run
this again so that it's separated so you
can see that it comes to animal noise
and automatically calls the cat version
of noise crunch crunch did not change
eat was not changed and neither was move
and so hence it just used the previous
animal method that was inherited and
then here you can see I used to get
attributes to receive both the name and
the owner of the cat and then and down
here you can also see where air shows up
and that's wherever we reference the
previous meaning the animal noise method
so there's a lot of stuff going on
inside of there but this is in essence
polymorphism just figuring it out on its
own on the fly and if I want to set or
create any additional attributes like
for example let's say I want to create a
clean attribute for the cat and dog well
let's just come in here and again we can
use a reference to the animal object and
define a key value pair burning off with
clean and giving it the value of yes and
if I would want to reference this new
attribute that I created just call print
animal dot get underscore attributes and
then the key that I want to reference
being clean I want to get rid of those
quotes and you can see here I went in
and created this new attribute and it
printed out yes because that's the value
that I set for it well I previously
mentioned you could also create classes
that borrow or inherit from multiple
different classes well here I'm going to
explore what would happen if a cat and
dog mated and all you do is put your
additional classes in here that you want
to inherit from and they're going to be
assigned to the new class you create and
I'm just calling it that and again I'm
going to come down here create a
constructor the constructor works the
same even though it's two classes you're
using here it's going to set them all up
want to override the function move here
and let's just say that something kind
of went wrong whenever with these two
animals made and this dat as we're
calling it just chases its tail tails
now whenever I put dog first that means
that because of course we have different
noises for the cat class as well as for
the dog class what that means is in
circumstances in which both of these
classes both have methods with the same
name whichever class is listed first is
going to be the class method that's
going to be used in instances where both
of the classes inherited have a method
with the same name and we jump down into
main and create a new method of type dat
and give it the name Jaffee and we're
saying that su is stuck with this poor
animal we're calling for Jaffe to move
get that print out of there and the
noise function to demonstrate how dog
overtook that and you can see here chase
his tail but like the dog because we
listed dog first when you call noise it
is going to call the dogs noise and not
the cats noise whoever Jaffe is still
going to be able to use noise to which
is only available in the cat class and
also purr so Jaffe is able to chase tail
woof like a dog and also purr like a cat
so it's like combination of those two
different classes if you want to be able
to get the attribute name for Jaffee and
you can see that Jaffe was returned
there's also a whole bunch of really
kind of cool functions you can use to
analyze objects with inside a Python
like let's create an object of type cat
well you can ask Python if for example
cat is a subclass of animal just by
typing is subclass followed by cat
animal you can see that the answer is
true on that you also can get it to
print out the base class of any class
two underscores bases get it to print
out all the objects of a specific class
get it to print out an object's class or
get it to print all of an object's
attributes and you can see right here on
the right side of the screen that it did
just that one of the questions you might
have is in regards to how to implement
Enter
inside of Python the ability to create
interfaces is not built into Python
but is available by importing modules or
libraries wherever you want to call them
and I'm going to discuss this in a later
tutorial and Python has something that
are called protocols which are similar
to interfaces as well and I'm also going
to cover those in future tutorials but
between this tutorial in the previous
tutorial that really goes over a lot of
the meat of object-oriented programming
inside of Python if there's anything you
didn't quite get leave a question or
comment below and I'll help work you
through object-oriented programming with
Python till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
