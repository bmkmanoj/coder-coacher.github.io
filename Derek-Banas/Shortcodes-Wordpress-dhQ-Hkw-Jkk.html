wordpress shortcode tutorial I did this
tutorial because bilqis sent me a
request to create or show him how to
create a very easy way to grab RSS feeds
from multiple different sites and
display them and precisely the way that
you see them here on the screen now what
a shortcode is is it is used in
WordPress to create really cool
functionality with little to no effort
so for example to get all of this
information to pop up here and this is
all grabbed instantly whenever this guy
is fired up all you need to do is type
in here's all the code involved but all
you would need to do is put this little
bracket here followed by NTT feed me and
then the blog title the blog feed and
the number of articles that you'd like
to grab in this situation 5 that is all
you need to do and if you do that you
get precisely what is here on your
screen so I'm gonna show you how to
create this and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to add short codes
to the functions PHP file which is kind
of a traditional way to do it and then
in the next tutorial I'll show you how
to actually embed short codes in a
plugin which is more of a
non-traditional way to do it but
probably a much better way but either
way let's jump into the code and if
you'd like to do this on a website what
you would do you could actually do it
right inside of WordPress itself you
would just need to look in your right
sidebar for theme functions functions
dot PHP and then you'd want to open this
guy up and then at the very bottom of it
you'd want to come in here and actually
put in all of the code for your
shortcode and of course make sure that
it all ends right here so I'm gonna
actually do it in a text editor though
because it's gonna be easier for you to
understand alright so if you want to
create this first thing you want to do
again this is gonna go in functions dot
PHP it's always safe to start off these
guys by saying if function exists
because we don't know what version of
WordPress they might be running we want
to make sure that the function called
fetch feed actually exists before we go
calling for it and trigger errors and if
it does exist we're gonna say include
once and by the way if you haven't seen
my previous WordPress theme tutorial or
wordpress plugin tutorial you might want
to check those out because it might make
it easier to understand so then what
we're gonna do here is include ABS we
want to actually reach out and grab all
the functions that we're going to need
and this is a reference to the WP
include folders where this guy resides
dot php' this is the code that we're
gonna need to make sure everything works
put bracket here then what we're gonna
do is define the function it's gonna be
called whenever that short code is
entered that I showed you before and you
want to give this a name that will be
different so I'm gonna call it NTT feed
me or SS a lot of people use their
initials and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna have all these attributes
that are sent to this guy being the blog
title and the RSS feed and the number of
articles to grab we're gonna have all
those sent to this a TTS variable here
and we're gonna save them in this guy
and it's an array then we're gonna
extract all those attributes out of the
array and those attributes are going to
be feed it's the name of the feed that
they're going to want to pull
information from and if they don't
define one I'm going to define a default
feed so they'll only see this if they do
not type in a feed and then we're gonna
pull out the num variable again these
are all variables that they sent and I'm
gonna put a default of five inside of
here so if they like five they don't
even have to enter that and then blog
title this is what is going to appear
before the feed is shot out to the
screen and then it's good to put
whatever the name of the website is
you're going to be pulling this
information from then you close that guy
off now we're ready to retrieve the
external feed that was to find both and
once again this is using the simple PI
class of functions that are new to
WordPress 3.0 so this is all up-to-date
and I'm just going to call this the feed
and then I'm gonna call the function
fetch feed and then I'm gonna put in the
feed that they requested which is this
guy right here so it's going to be
defined with a dollar sign now just
remember that don't want to make that
mistake and then we're gonna define the
maximum number of feed articles to pull
you know how you do that is calling get
item quantity and then inside of here
you're gonna put num which is the NAM
attribute that was passed over and then
you're gonna define where to start in
the RSS grabbing feeds and you're gonna
do that by defining the starting place
and this is going to be an index of zero
the whole way to the end so we're
actually going to take this guy the
limit and put that inside of there say
zero that's actually going to be the
first article and then we're going to
say the limit which is going to be five
articles in and it's all you got to do
there and if there are no items returns
we want to
we handle that so we're gonna say does
this have a value and if it doesn't
we're gonna do is go echo feed available
which is just a friendly little message
else if there are things available well
we want to be able to get them then I'm
going to create a variable called feed
content and this guy is going to contain
all the feed information so I'm gonna
find out div of type class its equal to
and I'm gonna call this NTT feed and all
of this code is available in a link in
the underbar by the way if you want that
so I'm going to surround all this
information with a div so I'll be able
to target it with CSS code and then I'm
gonna add on to this string that I just
created here with the dot operator
followed by equals and then this is
gonna put span after it
NTT feed played open I'm gonna ground
blog title that they said they wanted
what I'm talking about these guys just
so you know this is the blog title right
here
and then these are all the individual
articles that are being pulled and I'm
doing this all on different lines just
to keep everything neat remember a lot
of these things I do in tutorials I
wouldn't necessarily do in the real
world but but I've just found that this
way of doing things works pretty well
with tutorials so that's why I do the
things that I do it's not necessarily
best coding practices and then I'm going
to create a for each looping mechanism
that's gonna store all the results that
I get into a variable called item
changes to the item that's this guy up
here and then I'm going to cycle through
everything continuing to add information
to this variable called feed content
we're nice around all this with a div a
age reference is equal to and then I'm
gonna grab the link to the article that
is set in the feed this is also
something that's pretty easy to do just
gonna go item - and call this function
called get permalink so this is a link
to the original article it's in the RSS
feed I'm gonna continue to add that to
feed content and then I'm gonna close
that guy off and then I'm gonna grab
that title and so that everything fits
inside of here I'm gonna call the
substring function which is going to
shrink the results down to just 40
characters because that just ends up
working with what I got in my CSS code
and Bill key specifically asked for the
design and the CSS code so I didn't
really care and just so you do know if
you actually wanted this to show up if
you wanted
the content to show up and of course you
could abbreviate this with a substring
function that I just showed you here you
actually would do this and then type and
get content and this would give you an
excerpt and would print out to the
screen of the actual content so that's
just how to do that if you'd want to but
in this specific tutorial didn't want to
do that and then I want to close off my
div and I'm gonna create another div and
this is gonna be sort of like a
horizontal rule that is not a horizontal
rule you'll see in a minute so I'm gonna
call this H or Z again this is just for
CSS styling reasons that I'm using this
at all it was just stick up space in
there and then we need to close or for
each loop and that's how you do that and
then I'm also going to close my
if-then-else statement and then I'm
gonna close this final div and then what
I have to do for the shortcode to work
is return being content back to the
caller of this function and then I'm
gonna call closed the NTT feed me RSS
function and then I'm going to close the
does this function exists and that it's
all you got to do for that function and
then if you want to add the shortcode
you have to type in add shortcode and
whatever you want this guy to be called
I want to kind of try to keep it short
but at the same time try to make it
unique and then this is a reference to
the function that I want to be triggered
once someone uses this shortcode so
remember antiquey Femi RSS scroll up
here entity feed me RSS so that's what's
gonna do whenever this is typed in this
function above that we just created is
gonna be triggered and then you just
want to copy this guy and then again
remember we're in functions dot PHP it's
where we're at you're gonna want to
scroll down to the very bottom of this
guy right after this I like that and
then paste in everything and then click
update all right so that's super now
we're gonna edit the CSS code GT feed
this is a class that we defined the most
a font family and then we'll say sans
okay so that'll be the font that's used
throughout this whole entire short code
guy except for I define differently here
I'm defining I want all the text to be
black and again this is based off of
Bill keys recommendations you could
definitely do whatever you want font
size point a line height width of this
div 265 pixels and then this is good if
you want these divs to line up next to
each other you're gonna have to say
position relative and then say
float:left
that way the divs are not going to force
a line break they're going to line up
right next to each other and
and I'm gonna call NTT feed title do a
little bit of styling inside of there
and I'm gonna say the color needs to be
red font size 1.2 e/m line height
because it's a title we want it to be
bold the text that is and then that's
done no we want to target any div inside
of this div called NTT feed and then a
link that lies inside of those divs
that's how you do that and I'm going to
say that I want all the text to be black
and I want to remove the underline and
you do that by clicking on done then
we're also gonna style the div link when
it's hovered over we're gonna change the
text to red background color to like a
grey and we're almost done we're also
gonna do is styling on the day of when
it's hovered over color read all the
text inside of there's gonna be returned
red and I'm gonna change background
color to this guy and then as a final
thing I'm gonna style that horizontal
rule that I talked about I'm gonna say
inside of a div something has a class
name of H or Z or I'm gonna say if
there's a div that has the class name H
or Z is what I mean this div is gonna
have a height of two pixels width I'm
making a fake horizontal roll here
that's whatever the other two hundred
sixty pixels background color of that
gray you have to do this for Internet
Explorer to find a line height in a font
size of one pixel and then you want to
grab all this stuff and you're gonna
copy and paste this over and WordPress
so here we are in WordPress and we're
gonna scroll down and it's almost always
called styled on CSS in the right side
so you want to click on that and open
this guy up I probably should have
explained this before this thing I'm
using this editor here is under
appearance you click on appearance and
an editor inside of WordPress and then
once you figure out what stylesheet
you're using you want to scroll down to
the very very bottom of it and paste in
your code and hit update file and
whenever you save all that this is what
you got you're able to put in all your
short codes I put everything inside of
tables as you can see inside of here and
I also labeled border as none so borders
wouldn't show up because that's what
bill key wanted me to do with this but
this is basically how you do short codes
inside of WordPress if you have any
other questions or comments leave them
in the comments section below otherwise
