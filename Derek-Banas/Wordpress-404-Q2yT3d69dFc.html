tutorial on how to make a wordpress 404
page and this is the current 404 page i
use on my site i change it all of the
time basically a 404 page is the page
the people are sent to whenever they ask
for a web page on your site that doesn't
exist and what my site just simply does
puts up a goofy picture and it lists all
499 articles in our on my site currently
which is going to be 500 after today
well you don't need to understand the
previous tutorial that I was doing on
the WordPress News theme to take
advantage of creating a 404 page of your
own this is what that currently looks
like I haven't edited any of it yet so
in this tutorial to fix everything you
see on the right side of the screen this
is the current 404 dot PHP file that I'm
using and as you can see it doesn't do
much first thing I'm going to do is I'm
gonna come in here and get rid of that
right there and then i'm going to call
for my side bar code and how you do that
inside of wordpress is call get sidebar
and i'm going to put in first inside of
here and the reason i do that if you
didn't see the previous tutorial is I
called my sidebar file that I'm going to
be pulling code in sidebar dash first so
inside of wordpress if you want to
target that specific side bore you have
to call get sidebar and then put in the
word that follows the dash after sidebar
for that file which is again sidebar
dash first so that's the name of my side
bar code that I'm going to be pulling in
so that's how you do that in WordPress
if you didn't see the previous tutorials
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create a stay of i'm going to call it
main content make sure you put both the
quotes inside of that and then i'm going
to pull in an image and i'm basically
going to pull this image in right here
so i'm just going to click on this copy
image URL is equal to and i'm going to
paste that inside of there so there's my
image all ready to go to be put on the
screen give it a value of 704 width and
i'm going to give it an alt equal to
page not found i'm going to close off
that image tag and then what i'm going
to do is I'm going to create another div
and then on the next line i may call it
a PHP mi go echo sorry make it exactly
what's on the right side of the screen
here now I can't find that page and of
course I'm going to list out on the
screen just a bunch of articles that i
have on my site being 499 currently
which i was surprised to see i'm going
to close off the div that i created then
i'm going to retrieve the number of
published hosts so all the number that
represents all of the currently
published posts on my site so I'm gonna
create a variable called num pose is
equal to if I want to find out how many
posts are currently published this is
how you do it real simple call that
function WP count posts followed by dash
bracket publish and that's going to
return the total number of published
posts and if I want to format in case
there are thousands of them first I'm
going to check to make sure that number
of posts actually has a value which is
very important and if it does I'm going
to make the value of numbered posts
equal to and I'm gonna call number
format and all that does is puts in
comas in the case of there being
thousands of posts that's it so it's
just like a little 4matic thing and I'm
going to close off the PHP right like
that I'm going to create a header and
open PHP up again I'm gonna say echo
check out the followed by number of
posts articles well and I my clothes off
my PHP code again and then I'm going to
close off that header tag take j out of
there and then i'm going to create an
unordered list i'm going to give it an
ID equal to archive list make the call
to PHP and then i'm going to retrieve
all of the posts that are currently
published I'm gonna get myself some
extra space here in a wordpress if you
want to return all of the posts that are
currently available create a variable
called my post function that you would
call is called get posts and then you
say number posts and you pass it the
value of negative one and then it will
return all of the published posts and
then I'm just going to cycle through
them so I'm going to go for each my
posts as post colon inside of their
close down the PHP section I'm going to
create a list I call PHP again and I'm
going to put in the time here month day
your colon inside of there followed by
i'm going to create a link open up PHP
the permalink is a function that's going
to return the address for the post
online i'm going to reopen PHP and the
title is going to return the title for
the post clothes off PHP again closed
off the link close off the list item or
maybe I'm
do that here so it's formatted a little
bit nicer reopen PHP and then you want
to end the for each loop closed off the
PHP closed off the unordered list closed
off the div leave footer in there
exactly as it is right now and if we
file save that jump over here and reload
it you can see that it did exactly as I
want it except there's a little bit of
space up here no problem I can just come
in here throw in a break statement what
the heck let's throw in to file save
real udy and there's a little bit of
space thrown in there so that's how you
make a wordpress for a four-page down
below is all the code if you'd like it
you can do whatever you want with it as
well as there's a link to a bunch of
really cool 404 pages that are available
online leave any questions or comments
below weather wise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
