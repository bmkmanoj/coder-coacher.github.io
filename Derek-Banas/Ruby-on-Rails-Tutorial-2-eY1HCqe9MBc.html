2 of my Ruby on Rails tutorial this
tutorial is going to be about all making
everything easy in the last part of the
tutorial I gave you sort of an overview
of a lot of things in rails this time
we're going to focus in on creating a
real blog it's going to allow you to
create articles we're going to have
users we're going to allow people to
make comments we're going to style
everything with something called sass
we're going to of course create a
database we're going to do a whole bunch
of different things but what I need to
do now is go in and really zoom in on
the things you need to understand if you
want to develop rails web applications
ok so we have the model-view-controller
that is the basis of almost everything
inside of developing a rails web
application so if the user goes to the
browser and they type in users that is
going to call for a specific method or
function to be fired and executed inside
of the controller more specifically that
is going to call for the index action to
be executed which we're going to look at
in detail here in a second then the
controller is going to tell the model
hey I need all the users so go get them
from the database the database is going
to call for the ID password and emails
are going to be sent back to the models
that information is going to be stored
in what is called an instance variable
called users which can be used by the
view to display it in the browser that
is the whole process now let's look at
it in detail now you're going to have
not only URLs passed in the browser but
you're also going to have specific HTTP
methods we're going to have get post
patch put and delete so when the user
types in users and decides it wants to
use the get method the controller knows
that it needs to execute the index
function whenever users is going to be
used but we're going to use the post
HTTP method then the controller knows it
has to use the create method and so
forth and so on if we would type in
users and a specific ID that tells the
controller we need to call the update
method and we more specifically need to
update the user with the ID whatever the
idea is and that is the job of the
router and the great thing about this is
rails creates all of this for us and
we're going to see that in a second so
let's zoom in here on the controller
whenever we specifically call for the
index method to fire this is the index
method this
is all it is it's very simple and
article all's going to call the model
and the database and pass over all of
our articles to display on the screen
that's it
here specifically you're going to see
everything we're going to create here
are all the HTTP methods get post patch
put and delete and their matching URLs
that are going to be put inside of the
browser and again for the most part
these are going to be generated on their
own and then you're also going to see
the matching controller methods or
functions that are going to be fired
whenever these specific URLs and HTTP
methods are executed at the same time
you're also going to see here that index
going to display all the Articles new is
going to create a form that's going to
allow us to create a new article create
is going to allow us to create a new
article show is going to display one
article that's going to be whatever the
ID is edit is going to allow us to edit
a specific article with this ID updates
can allow us to update an article and
deletes can allow us to delete an
article that is everything this is
everything you really need to understand
MVC Model View controller you need to
know that there's different HTTP methods
and specific paths you don't need to
memorize this you just need to
understand what these guys are and what
they do that's it the model part is
thankfully for the most part handled by
rails so we were just going to say two
rails hey we want you to handle the
configuration that's going to allow us
to grab data from the database and
provide it to our controller we can use
in our view and display in a browser
that is the model part pretty much for
the most part you don't even have to
worry about it and then you have the
view remember the instance variable
articles that we had right here in index
there it is well in the view we're going
to be able to use it we're going to use
it right like this we're going to cycle
through all the different articles
output a title a post a user ID and then
links that are going to allow us to call
for show edit and destroy on set
articles that is pretty much everything
this is what you need to understand
about rails take a deep breath if it's
confusing it's really not though it's
just something you have to get used to
and this is the entire process of
creating a rails web application right
here so what we're going to need to do
is create our database tables rails is
going to do it for us but we need to
know what we want inside of our tables
so we're going to have a user it's going
to have an ID this is automatically
going to be created for us the ID and
it's on the auto increment every time
new user is created and then we need to
know that we need a password which is
going to be a string and email that's
going to be a string then we're going to
have articles again ID is created for us
we're going to have a title which is a
string post which is a string user ID
which is going to be an integer and
that's going to link to this table we're
gonna have comments again ID the
commenter the body of the comments and
the article ID which is going to match
in to our articles so now let's go in
and create the whole thing and basically
what we're going to have here like it
said before we're going to be able to
create articles users comments and we're
going to style everything and create a
database up here we have our browser
where we're going to execute everything
down here we're going to have our
terminal or command line if you're in
Windows and over here we're going to
have sublime text it's going to allow us
to create a meal and what we're going to
use this time or what are called
scaffold generators to basically create
our rails web application and basically
a scaffold and rails is going to be the
full set the model the database the
migration for our model the controller
to manipulated the views to manipulate
the data and a whole suite of testing
features that are also going to be able
to provided which we're going to get
into in the later part of the tutorial
so to create this whole entire thing we
have to decide what directory we want to
put everything in and then we're going
to type in rails new and on this call
this espy blog dash D we're going to be
using MySQL again and then type in MySQL
and hit enter this guy's going to create
everything foresting and we went over
what all these guys are before but you
could say a whole bunch of different
files are created for us and whenever
that guys all done with we are then
going to come in here and we're gonna
say bundle install and that's going to
go out and get everything that our app
is going to need whoops wait a second
we're going to first off go change
directory to SP blog and then we're
going to type in bundle install and
there it got it alright so everything's
all created for us now we need to set up
our database so what we're going to do
is if you are on Windows I'm going to
type in su BL dot exe and the directory
you want to open up in sublime text or
we're going to type in su BL and dot on
Linux and on OS X and you can see here's
everything that was just created first
thing we're going to do is set up our
database go into the config directory
and database yml and we
are going to name our user s be admin
and the password is going to be password
terrible don't use that here is going to
be the database name we're going to be
using so let's just copy that so we can
use that later and then we need to
define our socket and the easiest way to
get that is to open up the MySQL
workbench and more specifically we're
going to come over here and click on
server status and you're gonna see your
socket pops up right there there we are
copy that
pumps down here paste in your socket
right like that yours might be different
than mine maybe the same and we're going
to create our database so let's go and
copy this guy and make sure we save our
database dot yml file and then inside of
our terminal we need to create the
database so we're going to login with
MySQL 5 - you yours might just be MySQL
user and I'm going to login with root in
there and then type in my password and
Here I am now we're going to create our
database and then just paste in the name
of the database that we got from the
database dot yml file put a semicolon
there it is all created for us use and
paste that in there again database
changed and inside of this we're going
to create our user we want to use for
our database so grant all privileges on
and then there is the name of our
database dot star and then to SB admin
which is the user's name but we're going
to have to put this inside of quotes SB
admin at again quotes local host quotes
and then identified by and the password
you gave to that user so there's a semi
password in this situation semicolon and
there we went and created that now we
want to go in and verify we created it
so let's exit out of MySQL and let's log
back in as SB admin and password and
then we're logged back in and then we
can say use and there is our blog
database changed there our scroll back
and if we come in here and say show
tables you're going to see there's
nothing there well there will be
something there very quickly and we're
going to leave that open and open up a
new shell here and now we're going to
use the scaffold generator to go in and
generate our user tables and our
shoulders and everything and to do that
we're going to type in rails generate
scaffold user is going to be the
specific one this time and then we need
to say what we want in our user table
well we want a password we don't need to
put an ID in there that's automatically
created for us and we want that to be of
type string and then we want an email
which is also going to be of type string
and hit enter and this might take a
little bit of time because it's doing a
lot of work in the background and there
you can see it created everything so it
has the migrated file which is going to
allow us to create the tables in our
database there's going to be our user
model right there test units which we'll
get into later on here is going to be
our controller then we'll have all of
our different views created for us there
they are
helper files and assets and here's going
to be our style sheet we'll use to edit
our styles and everything else okay so
there we go that created everything for
us very useful now we need to go in and
have our database tables created for us
so we're going to go rake DB migrate hit
enter and there you can see it wind
created that table if we jump back over
into MySQL and click on show tables
you're going to see there is the users
table and if we say describe users
you're going to see there they are and
there is our password and there's our
email there is the idea that was
automatically generated here is created
at and updated at which are always
generated for us automatically and our
application is also generated for us and
we can just type in rails server hit
enter and if we go to localhost 3000
right like this you can see our rails
application is ready to go now let's go
in here to the views and sort of go
through and explain what's going on with
those so we're going to go into our app
section and then views
there's views and there you can see the
user views that are generated for us now
this guy right here is what we call a
partial what this is going to allow us
to do is separate out duplicate code so
inside of edit HTML you can see right
here here is the partial so whatever you
see render form that is automatically
going to take underscore form and put
all of that
that we have right there wherever that
shows up inside of our view and you can
also see over here here's index there is
JSON a way of basically pulling all of
our information out in JSON format get
more into that later
here is new their show and this is going
to allow us to show a very specific part
of our database as well and if we want
to open all these guys up the route file
is going to do a lot of work for us but
we could just go into our localhost and
do something like users and let's say we
wanted to get user 1 well first off we
have to create a user so let's just go
users and here you can see and we'll go
new user and we'll create one and I'm
going to go abcdefgh just put a password
inside of there DB at aol.com and create
user and user was successfully created
if we click on back you're going to see
the user show up right there we're then
going to be able to go to edit and
you're going to see users one there's
the ID for our user and we're
specifically in the Edit view we can
then click on back and go back and do
that where we click on destroy which is
going to say then are you sure you want
to delete that let's say cancel and we
click on show as well and that's going
to specifically show our user alright so
there's the difference between the views
and what pops up and how the URLs are
going to pull the right information and
display it for us you're also going to
be able to see if we go into users
controller which of course is in the app
and more specifically the controllers
folder here are all of the matching
functions that are going to be executed
so whenever we want index you're going
to see it's going to get all of our
users and throw them over there for us
all this stuff was automatically
generated I didn't have to type any of
this in there show there is new there's
edit there's create there is every
single thing automatically generated for
us because we use scaffold let's go into
another terminal area here and let's
make sure we're in the right place espy
blog there it is there's all our files
and if we would type in right routes
like this you're going to see the
matching HTTP methods also show up here
and there they are so there's good
there's post there's the other get and
all of these other guys patch put and
delete and you're also going to see if
we come over here how they match up to
specific methods inside of the
controller so that's all the stuff that
I showed you before clear
now we come back over inside of sublime
text and let's take a look at our route
file so let's click on this and you can
see there is the resources user that was
automatically put inside of there for us
and if we wanted the users to show up as
default we could type in route and then
users index save that up over here and
just change this to regular localhost
and you can see all our users show up
right there that's how easy that is to
setup and now we'll jump over into the
controller so just come over here in the
controllers folder users controller take
a look at before action and basically
what this is going to do for us is we're
going to say before a user is created we
do not want to show show edit update and
destroy on our screen so that's what the
before action means and like I showed
you before here is going to be users and
if we jump over to the users view and
then specifically look at index you're
going to see right here the exact same
code I showed you before
say there's users it's going to allow us
to cycle through and display all those
on our screen now we're going to go and
generate our article again using the
scaffold generator open this guy up and
to generate all that we're going to go
rails generate scaffold article and then
we're going to have to list all the
things we want our articles table to
have so we're going to have a title
which is going to be a string and then
we're going to also want to have the
post and that's going to be text because
that's going to be a little bit longer
and then we also want to match up with
the user ID for the user that comes in
here and I'm actually going to show you
different ways to create foreign keys
and so forth but this time we're just
going to focus in on basically pointing
at a user and then in the next part
whenever we deal with comments we're
going to actually create a foreign key
and link those comments directly to the
articles there you can see all of the
views and the migration files and
everything has been created for us jump
back over here and let's specifically
look at routes and you can see also
there is articles is listed as a
resource we also now have an articles
controller we have views for our
articles and everything else we're going
to need here now let's take a look at
validates it's a very easy way for us to
come in here
and make certain demands before we will
allow the user go in and edit our
database files and we're going to do
that inside of the model so let's come
over here to models and first we'll go
to users and let's say that we want to
require a password as well as an email
to be to allow us to you know create a
user so what we're going to do is we're
going to say validates and password in
this situation and if we want to demand
that it be there we're going to type in
presence and true let's say we also want
to demand that it be a certain length
before we'll allow it to create this so
we'll say late and then we'll say
minimum and let's say we demand that it
is 8 characters in length that's all we
need to do all right so let's also come
in and validates and let's say that we
want an email we can just keep this
simple and just say presence true and
that's all we need to do there now what
you'll see if we go into our web
application and we click on new user
I've got a little error no big deal just
remember we went and created our
migration files but we did not create
those tables in our database and that's
one of the things and rails in an
upcoming tutorial going to go through
all of their common errors and what they
mean if you see them but we're just
going to type in rake DB migrate and
that's going to create our tables for us
I think that's one of the things that
confuses people about rails more than
anything else is understanding the some
kinds arcane types of error messages you
get and let's just jump over into MySQL
and we'll say show tables and now you
can see there's the articles table and
if we come in here and reload this you
can now see we can create a new user and
if we go and we don't type in 8
characters and we don't even put in an
email and hit create user you're going
to see that rails automatically displays
errors for us here and if we don't do
anything like let's just say we come in
here and don't type in anything you're
going to see we get three years so we
can't have a blank password it must be 8
characters long and you can't have a
blank email so that's very useful that
it automatically creates all that for us
it's also go into the model for our
article and let's validate a couple more
things here going this and validates and
we'll say
we have a title we demand that the title
exists for our articles so type in
presence again and then true and then
let's say that with this time we want to
define a maximum or a minimum length
let's say minimum or maximum I think
that makes more sense so that we don't
have titles that are super super huge
we'll say maximum 50 and then we'll also
come in and validate our post and we'll
say that we demand that it be there and
that's all we need to do to have that
set up so now we have the model set up
for articles as well as our users now we
want to set up an association between
the users and the articles and how we do
that is with belongs to and has many and
this is also going to further enforce
the fact that we should just let rails
generate all this stuff for us most of
the time but if we don't want to or if
we forgot this is how we're going to do
it
so if our users are going to potentially
have many articles what we're gonna do
is type in has many right here again
we're inside of the model called user
dot RB and we're just going to say
articles and save that then we're going
to go into article RB and we're going to
say that each of these articles are
going to be belonging to a user so we'll
say it belongs to user and that's going
to create the association between those
two now we'll go in and create our
comment model and to do that we'll go
back inside of the terminal and inside
of here and as you can see I'm running
the server at the same time now to
generate the comment model we're going
to go rails generate model and as this
tutorial continues I'm going to get more
into the Nitty nitty-gritty of this
stuff so that you'll understand every
single thing just want to have a little
bit of fun here though so we're going to
have a call manner which is going to be
a string the body of the comment could
potentially be long so we're going to
have that be text and this is
automatically going to work with any
database we're using MySQL here but I'm
going to use any database and if we want
to link these comments to specific
articles we're going to say what we want
to link it to and we're going to say
references and that's going to generate
everything we need for our comments now
we can go rake DB migrate and you can
see here it also went in and created a
foreign key for us if we jump back over
into MySQL and say show tables there you
can see there is
comments and if we come in specifically
and say describe comments there you can
see the ID and here we can see that we
have a link to our articles if we then
also come over here a once again and
look at our comment model open it up you
can see that it automatically put
belongs to article inside of there for
us now we need to go inside of route so
RB again this is inside other configure
folder and here we're going to need to
state that comments is going to be a
nested resource inside of all of our
articles and to do so we'll just go
after articles and then we'll go do and
then we'll say resources comments right
like this and then end and that's gonna
nest all of our comments in the articles
exactly where they need to be and now
let's generate our controller for our
comments and open up Ruby there we go
open up our terminal and to generate
this controller we're gonna go rails
generate controller comment but whenever
I did that I actually thought hey wait a
minute I wanted to call this comments so
what do I do I automatically went in
there and created all this stuff and now
I found that I don't need it no big deal
what we're gonna do instead is go rails
destroy controller comments exactly what
we just typed in there and that's gonna
go in there and fix everything for us it
removed everything very useful and now
we'll type it in the right way so we'll
say rails generate controller comments
it's going to regenerate everything easy
way to fix just about any error that you
might have clear that out now I'm going
to go into the view and make sure that
we have our comments all show up inside
of our articles pop back inside of here
want to edit our views there's articles
and here is show this is where we're
going to put our comments of course
that's going to make sense cycle our way
down inside of here where right after
the user area give ourselves some room
h2 tag and we'll just have comments be
right there now if we want to cycle
through all of the different article
comments bracket % and then we're going
to go at article there's that instance
variable and then specifically comments
each do and temporarily hold it in the
variable name comment and then as we're
cycling through here we could have
commenter
then we'll go and get the commenter and
display it by just going comment comment
or close that off and then we're going
to do the same thing for our specific
comment that they made so comment
changes to comment and this is going to
be commenting body and this of course is
going to match up with our tables so
it's going to MySQL will say show tables
and there's the comments table right
there and describe comments now let's
zoom in here and you can see right there
there's commenter and here is body that
is where it's coming from now after this
of course we're going to have to close
off this guy this little loop that we
created here so come down here and just
type in end now we also want to allow
them to add a comment so we'll come in
here create another h2 tag and say add a
comment what we're going to do here is
use a form builder to create a form for
our template so we're going to say form
for and I'm going to do a lot more with
form 4 as this tutorial continues just
bear with me here what I'm saying here
is I want to target this article and
then on top of that add comments to this
article something like this and then
article comments build so that's saying
I want to add specific comments to this
specific article that I am currently on
we'll say do and then F and close that
off and now I'm going to cycle through
and generate the forms that are going to
allow them to come in here and add all
these different comments to our article
to do so want to create a label
commenter and then we could close this
off generate a text field text field
commenter and then we're going to allow
them to put in the actual comment so
let's just be a label and then just
change this to body which is the name of
it inside of our database and then we
have this guy right here change him also
to body because that's also going to be
it now let's make this a text area and
then finally we need to put a submit
button inside of here o submit if you
guys go in here I'm going to make this
very very structured there's a link in
the description underneath the video
that's going to allow you to walk
through this whole entire process of
creating everything here then of course
don't forget to end everything by
putting end inside of here I'm going to
have
of our other additional links make sure
we save that and now let's go over into
the comments controller and update that
so it's a little bit of doing some
things for us and a little bit of doing
things from scratch in this tutorial now
whenever a new comment is going to be
created we need to be able to handle
that and of course the create function
is going to be called when a new comment
is created so we're going to go define
create and close that off we want to
very first get the article the comment
is attached to so just because we're
going to need to match up the comments
with all the articles and we're going to
store those in instance variables of
course so that we'll be able to use them
in to view and to get the article this
is attached to remember we're in
comments controller we call find params
and then we're specifically looking for
the article ID then we want to come in
and create and save our comment so we'll
go at comment equal to at article
comments create pass in our comment
parameters and then we want to go to the
article that this comment is associated
with this is going to be a redirect it's
going to send the browser somewhere new
to article 1/2 so what this is doing
basically is getting the article the
comment is associated with creating this
comment and then redirecting back to
said article and displaying the comments
that are underneath that article if we
want to redirect back to the main
article where this is graded we just
type an article and then of course end
and comments parameters because we do
not want people to be able to come in
here and mess around with this this is
always kept private
so we'll go private and all of your
private methods need to show up last in
the files if you put create after this
is going to cause all kinds of problems
we go define there's comments params
there we go params dot require comment
and then we're going to permit two
pieces of data to be passed inside of
here well wait a second close that off
so we're only going to allow data to be
sent inside of here this is for security
reasons and that data is going to be the
comment or and the body of the comment
and then of course put end here to close
off this function make sure we save it
then go to
we'll host 3,000 articles and we come in
and click on new article and we can say
something like rails is awesome there we
go
well I left the post blank so let's cut
back accidentally hit enter with my
finger yes it is alright and user let's
just put one inside of there we'd have
this tied in so that it only shows the
users that order created in our database
but we didn't do that yet will it create
article and you're going to see an error
show up here did this on purpose what
this is going to show you here because I
want to show you errors that come up see
that you know how to fix them so it's
saying undefined method comments inside
of show and more specifically no method
error for article show what that is
going to tell us is that this error is
inside of our articles model so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
over here and take a look at exactly
what that could be so let's open up
articles there's our articles model and
what's it saying it's saying undefined
method comments what that is telling us
is we forgot to come in here and tie our
articles in with our comments and that
just basically means we need to tell it
that it has many comments which it does
and save that and reload it and now you
can see rails is awesome yes it is and
here we're allowed to add additional
comments as well now we'll go into the
commenter area right here type in dark
super article create comment and there
you can see the sort of the article and
there you can see the comment also shows
up there so let's jump back again and
look at our full list of articles and
you can see that it looks rather ugly so
that must be really hard to clean up no
not really
let's go in and talk about sass and how
we can style everything so that it looks
a little bit prettier of course if we're
going to be styling things we're gonna
be styling our style sheets and our
style sheets are going to be located up
here inside of assets and of course in
the style sheets directory and
specifically we want to zoom in and
we're just going to edit the article
style sheets so here we are let's think
about what we want to style let's just
first off decide that we want to just
style the articles index so those are
going to be in the view section so
here's articles and here is the index
file and you can see everything is in
table format
was this is the thing that was
displaying really ugly previously so
what's the minimal amount we can do to
this to style this up and make it look a
little bit prettier let's say that we
just want our rows to be different
colors for example inside of our table
how could we do that really easy here
without messing around too much let's
just come down inside of our table here
and let's say that we want each row to
be a different color well there's a
really easy way to do that with rails
all you're going to do is go class and
then we're going to put our little
brackets inside of here
equal to and if we want to change the
class name for each one of the rows
we're going to say cycle and then we'll
say that we want the first one to be
list line odd right like that
and then the next one to be list line
even and then close that off and then
put our little brackets inside of there
so that's going to have each row in our
table get a different class name the
first one's going to be list line odd
and then let's not even and then so
forth and so on as the tables being
generated and that's all I'm going to do
with this guy and then I'm specifically
going to go into the article style sheet
here it is right here and then let's
just start styling these guys so let's
think about what we want to show up here
we have our table right here so let's
say we want the borders not to show come
back over into this say something like
table and then we're going to type in
border and I might do a sass tutorial
sass Perini and let's say collapse
that's going to get rid of those borders
for us inside of our tables so in
bounce-back over here let's also say
that we want to target table TRS as well
as TD's down inside of here so we can
add some padding we'll just go to table
TR TD and we'll say padding:10px it's
also say that we want our table heading
this guy up here to be a different color
the problem T head and let's also change
some alignment line everything to the
left let's change the background color
to dark color 308 F and I'm getting
these colors from the wiki colors thing
on Wikipedia if you wondered and let's
say that I want the text color to be
white so that it shows up nice say we
also want to put some padding in the
table heading area we need to target th
can't target T head
you're handling padding and let's just
say we want that to be 10 pixels and now
we can cycle through the different rows
and we're going to go list line even
remember when we put those in for each
rows on our table and we'll just go and
change the background color for this guy
to f EI e BD 7 and then we're going to
do a similar thing with lists line odd
chain just odd and then we'll change
this a little bit light colors right
like that and save those style sheets
make sure everything else is saved and
now if we bounced over into articles and
reload the screen you'll see that that
shows up a light color these are all the
different changes we can create a new
article ruby is great and then we could
say yes it is great whatever Gretta and
we'll just to user 1 create article
automatically created and then we'll
click on back and there you can see the
table and it looks a lot prettier there
you go guys that is a heck of a lot of
information about rails I'm going to
keep making more rails tutorials they're
going to come out very quickly this
weekend so please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
