mail script tutorial if you watched my
previous HTML definitive tutorial I used
a PHP form to process all of the
information that was sent from that HTML
page I had a lot of people send me
emails asking me what that code looks
like and to describe it so here we go if
you didn't see that click right here and
watch the HTML tutorial ok basically how
you create a PHP file looks it opens up
and is similar to an actual HTML file in
that you open it start it with the HTML
tag you see right here and basically the
way I have this laid out here is all the
code in black and white and in the blue
boxes I have descriptions of what that
means then I go have the tags for my
header descriptions within the PHP file
body telling the browser that content is
coming and then here's the beginning of
the PHP code you would start off with a
PHP tag this tells the browser that it
should expect PHP code to follow this
tag until this tag ends what we have
here is just a comment section it's good
practice always comment heavily you all
of your code that you write in PHP what
I do here is I explain each part of the
PHP program that will follow it begins
with this forward slash and star and the
comment section will end with a star and
a forward slash it's all comment nobody
will see this except you down here what
I'm doing is checking to see if the form
was submitted now how I do that if you
go back to the actual HTML code
down here if you remember and you saw
that I have this code in the HTML file
itself you're riding to find a variable
name submitted and I gave it the value
true now if we jump back into the PHP
all I'm doing here is saying is that
variable submitted equal to the value
true it's all it is saying if this is
this variable is set then start working
on this code and continue to work
through this code until you see an
ending tag that is that it's facing in
the opposite direction of this or is
facing this direction and it's all is
being set here and this dollar sign
underscore post bracket and with a
little colon here what this this is
accessing the variable that was sent
from the HTML code it's what we're doing
here is we're creating what's called an
array or you can just consider it a box
in which information is stored and the
name of the array is errors and you
begin all of your variables with a
dollar sign in PHP and this is another
way to add comments if you have two
forward slashes the browser will ignore
all the code that comes after it until a
new line is signaled so that's what that
means
now what I'm doing are these three lines
of code check to see of the email
variable subject and message variables
have a value again it's all it's
checking if they do not have a value it
is supposed to post an error message
into the array that you just created up
here
and it does that for the email variable
subject and the message and that's what
that code there does what this is doing
here is checking to see if there were
any errors entered into the air array
out here it's checking to see if that
error array is empty that's it if it is
empty meaning there were no errors
entered all the code between this
bracket and this bracket should be
evaluated by the browser what we're
doing here is we're taking everything
all the variables that were passed from
the HTML code and we're signing them to
variables of like names and again
variables begin with the dollar sign all
we're doing taking that information sent
from the HTML assigning it to the
variable what we're doing here is using
a function known as echo to print into
the browser all of the text that lies
between these quotes and the semicolon
ends the statement so we're putting all
that information out now if we jumped
over into your HTML file it would keep
referring to and we type in all the
required information and then we clicked
on send you can see everything was
processed and an email was sent
that's basically what was going on there
that's what this echo is doing printing
out this information right here in the
round window okay down here what we're
doing is we're taking this string or
text information and we are combining it
with the variables and we're combining
them with this period function
after we combine all of these strings
and variables together we are going to
assign them to the variable message that
is all that's being done here you can
see in this line of code what we're
going to do is remember again here's
another comment and this function mail
is going to send a message to whatever
email address was assigned to this
variable with the subject being whatever
was assigned to the subject variable and
the message body of the email sent is
going to be whatever was assigned to the
message box variable and here we're just
printing out message sent thank you so
that the user knows that the email
message was sent now moving on another
comment and here we are
echo printing into the browser window a
link this link will provide the visitor
your website the ability to click on it
and jump back to the previous page up
here I'm checking to make sure that
submitted is equal to true well if the
submitted variable was not equal to true
it would have jumped down here that
would have meant than an error so what
we're going to do is print out some text
and as you can see here with the echo
function as long as you have this quote
here in this quote here it will print
all of this in the browser window even
though you have a newline get within
your code so it prints everything until
it season it quarters then what we're
doing here is we are going with for each
function going to sort through all of
the errors within the error array and if
we find an error we're going to assign
it to the variable message and then echo
out onto the browser screen the error
that was found and we would use a new
line right here this would also create a
new line it's all this codes done
creating the ability to create a link so
the person can jump back to the previous
page with echo again and then here is
another comment and then finally you're
going to close your PHP code off with
this ending tag and then close off the
body section with your body tag and your
HTML closing tag and that is basically
all there it if you go to my web page
you'll be able to copy all of this code
- all of my comments and use it on your
own website text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
