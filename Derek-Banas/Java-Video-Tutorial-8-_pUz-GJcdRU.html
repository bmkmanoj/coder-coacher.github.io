my java video tutorial series today
we're going to just totally break off
from what we've been doing and totally
take an experiment here and see what
happens you guys want me to get into
some of the logic behind programming and
you also seem to have an insane interest
in video games well there is an immense
amount of logic in creating a video game
so in this tutorial I'm going to
continue from part seven if you didn't
watch it definitely watch it and we're
gonna make ourself a very simplistic
video game but we're going to learn a
lot of things along the way now if you
don't catch everything as I go through
this tutorial don't worry about it
because based off your comments below
I'm going to go and expand and explain
anything else that you do not understand
here we're going to be jumping right
into it this is basically what our game
board is going to look like what you see
right here on the screen and I'm going
to create a bunch of monsters inside of
here and they're going to move around
and if they touch each other they are
going to attack each other
and eventually kill each other until
there's only one left all right so just
basic this is the idea and what you're
looking at here is really an array an
array is just a bunch of boxes and this
specifically is called a
multi-dimensional array because this
would be considered just a regular array
and because there are multiple groupings
or this is a two-dimensional array we
call this a multi-dimensional array and
I'm going to show you how to make those
I'm going to show you how to import new
libraries we're going to do tons of
things in this tutorial so we're going
to do right now is we're going to jump
over into our monster dot Java file and
I'm going to rename this monster - this
is our object that's going to create all
of our monsters for us and then just
quickly I'm going to scroll through here
and make sure that I replace monster
with monster - everywhere below here and
this is going to take a couple videos to
get through this whole entire thing
alright so there we go
and we've replaced all those guys and
actually this guy we can just get rid of
all together so what do we need to do
the very first thing we're going to need
to do is create our game board and also
because we're going to be using arrays
I'm going to want to import a library so
it's important jabba dot util dot arrays
so there is a new library that we're
going to import we're going to use some
information out of that and we're going
to jump down inside here and I'm going
to start building some stuff so the very
first thing I want
do is I want to create our
multi-dimensional array and how you do
that I'm going to make it static
character multi-dimensional it's going
to be a 2d array so put two of those
little guys inside of there two little
brackets and I'm going to call it battle
board and you go equals am new and
character and then this is very
important you have to define how big
your array is going to be and mine is
going to be ten by ten and I'm just sort
of like going through this out of my
head so logic might not be 100% perfect
but I want to do it this way because I
think this might be a little bit more
fun so then what we got to do we need to
build our battle board so I'm going to
call this build battle yoäôre D and
this is just going to be a public method
it's going to be inside of our class a
public class method and then what I want
to do I want to cycle through the whole
entire array and give it a fault value
of the star which you saw previously so
that's when I didn't want to populate
this whole entire array with stars let's
worry about our monsters later on so how
exactly do you do that well there's this
nice little statements created just for
a raise and to make every single thing
in the array you're just going to type
in 4 and then character which is going
to be exactly what you're going to be
referencing and then row is going to
represent a temporary holding cell for
all of the stars before they get put
into the array so that's all that does
and then we need to define what is the
name of our array so battle board there
it is we created our array and here
we're going to populate our erase this
is going to represent the individual
cells this is going to represent the
individual stars that are going to go
into these cells and this is the array
itself you don't quite get it definitely
going to get into a lot more detail
about arrays as we go on well then this
is why we needed the arrays library
I'm gonna go arrays and I'm gonna go
fill when I call a fill method and I'm
gonna say okay row which it represents
one of the individual little boxes that
we won't put something in put that
inside of there and then here where it
says Arg 1 on my screen I want to say
what I want to be thrown in there and it
cycles through all those individual
little blocks in the array and throw
stars in every single one of them that's
what this code does real nice and neat
and pretty cool so what else we going to
need to do well after we go and we put
all these stores inside of there we
might want to do something like redraw
the board so I'm going to create another
public method that's not going to return
and I'm going to just call it redraw org
right like that and it is going to do
exactly what it says it's going to
redraw the gameboard on the screen so
you know if I'm not complicated so what
are we going to do we're going to create
a temporary variable field or whatever
you want to call it called K and then
I'm going to use a while loop which we
talked about in previous tutorials Wow K
is less than or equal to 30 because and
this is what I'm doing here I'm drawing
this line right here on the screen
that's what I'm doing and there's 30
dashes here so this is like a shortcut
quick way to draw 30 dashes I'm just
going to put it all on one line
system.out.print I don't want to do a
print line because then I wouldn't put
everything on the same space and this is
what I want to draw put that inside
quotes and then I'm going to increment K
like that and then close off the while
loop so that's just going to draw 30 of
these dashes on the screen that's all
that guy does no reason to get upset or
worry about it so system and then I want
to do a new line so I'm just gonna do a
grid line inside here you know like I
said I'm just sort of guessing my way
through this tutorial hopefully it works
out well short well otherwise I'll redo
it and then what do I need to do well I
need to cycle through the array and put
all the little stars as well as the
dashes so this is basically going to
draw all this stuff right here it's
going to draw all this I need to draw
all that out onto the screen so I'm
going to use a for loop int I is equal
to and then I'm going to say 0 I while I
is less than battle board length and
this is how you get the size of your
battle board now you know from up here
it's 10 by 10 so that's what this does
battle board length is going to return
the length of the battle board so how
many things are inside of it whatever
all right and I'm going to increment I
and another one I'm going to do is when
I'm putting these stars onto on my
battle board what I need to do is
basically go okay I want to start with
Row 1 and that's going to be I then I
want to be able to target all these
individual columns well that is going to
be J so you're going to represent
everything inside of your array pretty
much like this it's going to have a
bracket and like for example if I wanted
to target this guy right up here this
star up here all I would do it woody 0
comma 0
right like that and that would give me
the address for this star right here if
I wanted to target say this guy right
here well in that situation I'm going to
go one on a zero and then that's going
to get this guy so what I need to do is
have a value for both of this and this
and that is where we have I and J the
two variables and I'm going to be using
here in a second and there's a link to
all this code underneath of this video
if you want to get it probably help you
out understand watermelon so what am I
going to do well if I want to be able to
target I and J both needed variables to
be able to target that array well I need
to create another for loop that's going
to cycle through everything else it's on
the screen so I'm going to call this int
J is equal to zero pretty much same
exact thing while J is battle in this
situation I need to target you know not
this whole entire row but I need to
figure out how many individual spaces
are in each of these columns so how I do
that is I need to be able to ask it okay
what is the length of this column and to
do that I need to ask it using I so this
is saying what is the number of spaces
in each one of those rows and we're
going to use length again and that's
exactly what it's going to tell me and
then I'm going to increment J and create
another for loop and then that this guy
is going to do is go system let's go out
and then we're going to use print again
on the screen and I'm going to put the
little or sign up side of there and then
plus and then I'm going to go battle
board and then we go I and J which is
going to be the old location in the
array it's going to contain either the
star or eventually the monster's names
and then this is going to draw the whole
entire line across the board so what do
I need to do after I draw this whole
entire line across the board like I did
right here I need a new lock so let's
get one and let's just cheat and copy
this there we are so now that's going to
print out all the information onto the
screen for me there and then what do I
have to do I need to go and draw my line
across the bottom again so I'm just
going to come in here to this guy and
I'm going to copy that and then outside
of this for loop I'm going to paste it
so this is going to handle the line it
goes across the top this is going to
handle the line it goes across the
bottom and this is going to handle
all of the lines and stars and
everything that is going to go inside of
our battle board play around with the
code you'll get it okay so what else am
I going to do here well let's just
scroll through and figure out if we want
to make any other additional changes
well I think that x position and y
position need to be public fields so I'm
going to change them and why don't I
just come in here cut them out of there
leave a space in there so that I know I
made a change and then let's just change
these to public I might decide to go
back and change these later on but for
now I think they're gonna make more
sense as public's so let's just leave
him that way another thing that I'm
going to need to do because all the
letters or all the monsters are
represented with a one letter what I
want to do is I want to come in here and
I want to create a variable that is
going to or a field that is very
specific to that so I'm going to go
public character name pair one is equal
to and in this situation the default is
going to be big monster because that's
this first letter here and later on in
the video I'm going to show you exactly
how to pull just this letter out of this
string and then we're going to go public
static and I think I might want to track
the number of monsters using a field or
variable whatever you want to call it
and temporarily or currently there are
no monsters and we're going to leave it
that way
and what's something else that I
probably want to do here I want to find
out if this monster is alive at all
times and for some god-awful reason I
didn't do that before so let's provide a
way to be able to find out if our
monster is alive or not and we're just
going to copy this because the basic
sort of style and we're just going to
call this get alive and it's just going
to return whether the monster is alive
or not then I need to make some changes
down here to my constructor for my
little monster objects so let's just
scroll down inside of here and figure
out what sort of changes I want to make
and one of the changes that I think I
really want to make is I want to be able
to pass a string that's going to contain
the name for the monster so let's do
that
there you are string name so then what
am I also going to do I'm going to go
this name and this is reference to the
object that we're working with right now
and we're going to change it to name
which is a new variable that's being
passed along or a new field well then
what do I want to do
I want to define the X&amp;amp;Y for my battle
board for the position of the monster
that seems like that would be something
I definitely want to track so how am I
going to do that I'm going to go in max
I'm going to go X board space that means
this is going to be the maximum number
of spaces horizontally and how do I get
that I go battle your D battle board and
then length again and then I'm going to
say minus 1 why did I do that the reason
why I did is whenever you create an
array this is zero zero remember so that
means if it's going to give me a total
length which is equal to 10 well this is
0 this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so when it
kicks back 10 it's going to be wrong
because if I try to put it in space 10
on my battle board well space 10 doesn't
exist so that's the reason why I'm
knocking one off of there
well then I also want to get my maximum
space for all of my columns just type
that in there change this to Y I'm going
to go in here and type in 0 and then
this is going to give me the maximum
space in the column which is going to
kick back right here is going to kick
back 10 minus 1 is going to be 9 so
hopefully that makes a lot of sense and
let me give you an example just to make
sure it does so that means if I want to
be able to target this last most space
what this is is : 9 comma 9 all right
that's this right here 9 9 so that's the
reason why I'm trying to get that length
because I don't want the Monster to
accidentally fall off of my battle board
what else do I need from a monster well
I'm going to need a random number
generated thing that's going to be like
where the monster begins whenever
everything starts out so I'm gonna go
random X and random number Y both
integer is just going to tell me where
to start and then I want to use a do
loop to generate my random space for my
monster I am using a do loop in this
situation instead of a while loop
because I always want to define a space
for the monster no matter what a lot of
people have asked for an example of why
you would ever need to do loop well
here's one so let's go random num X is
equal to and then I'm going to go into
I'm going to cast this into an integer
and I'm going to generate a random
position from a monster x
and then this is going to be Mac's board
space so there is going to be the
randomly generated exposition for my
monster and then I'm going to generate
my random space in regards to Y and then
Y like that and this is going to close
all I'm going to go while battle forward
and here I'm going to only allow my
monsters to go on a space that currently
has a star represented inside of it so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
while I'm going to continue generating
new XY positions while and I'm going to
take the sample that was created right
here paste it inside of there so this is
the new location where the monster may
be located and we're going to say well
it's not equal to star I'm going to
continue to generate these guys so if
there's a B there or whatever I'm going
to say ah this isn't a star we need to
generate a new XY position for our
monster because we don't want to start
dropping monsters on top of other
monsters especially when the game starts
out and then what are we going to do we
need to assign an x and y position to
the object that we had before so we had
these guys let me scroll up here see
here where we have x position and y
position assigned to each monster object
that we create well we want to assign
them after we go through the do loop and
we realize okay we found a position for
a monster I'll let's assign it so we can
go this x position is equal to and then
it's going to be what random X because
we found out that random X works and
then we also want to go in here this and
generate the Y position or assign the Y
position and then remember before
whenever I said I was going to get the
first initial from whatever the
monster's name is and assign it to name
character 1 I'm gonna go this name Karen
1 is equal to I'm going to go this name
dot character at index position 0
because just like arrays strings put all
their characters in the zero place and
then 1 2 3 okay so I want the character
that's in the zero position for the name
and just so you understand what I'm
doing
see this is a string and its name is
name and this is big monster and named
character 1 is going to have whatever
the first letter for my mole
stur assigned to it so that's what I'm
doing remember name character 1 and name
and then scroll back down here and
that's exactly what I'm doing
name character 1 is equal to this dot
name and I'm saying I want the character
that's in the index position 0 for name
and assign that the name character wants
over that makes sense
pretty simple stuff it doesn't don't
worry about it we're just going to force
it through here and I'll explain more as
with the tutorial prove seeds and then
what I want to do is I want to take this
first character that we just got and put
it on the battle board so we're going to
go this Y position just assigning this
inside of the array X position is equal
to and we're going to assign it whatever
the character is in named character 1 so
now the array is going to have a monster
character inside of it and then we
probably also want to go a number of
monsters so that we can track how many
monsters are are well we know that if we
ran through this constructor there's now
one new monster enum let me see if
there's anything else want to do here
yeah I want to throw I want to increment
the number of monsters if this basic
constructor is called
so let's file save let's see how we're
doing here ok so we're back over in
lesson eight dot java and what are we
going to do here well I know that I'm
going to need this array function and
we're going to get back to this monster
believe me there's a lot more to do with
it because we have to define how it's
going to move we're going to have to
define how it attacks we're gonna have
to define a lot of different things but
I want to import that library because I
plan on using arrays obviously because
it's a race here and also I want to
import or do an Apache Commons 1 3 Ray
Ray utilities and this is actually a
awesome library that is not included
inside of Java and I provide a link
underneath the video that'll take you
step-by-step with pictures and I just
thought it would be easier to explain it
with pictures rather than me doing a
video tutorial on it if you want to see
a video on how to import Java libraries
leave a comment below and I will alright
so now we're down inside of lesson 8
inside of the main method and if we want
to build a new battle board no problem
we just go monster to dot build battle
board and this provides us the ability
to call that method that we created over
in monster to say
right here build battle board so if we
want to call or execute a method inside
of the class monster - all we have to do
is put monster - dot and then build
battle board and that's going to create
our battle board for us see that's all
we need to do that's why object-oriented
programming is so awesome because you
build all the tools in the background
and then it becomes like this easy way
of just creating everything else well
let's go and create a temporary battle
board container as well and how you do
that it's just tenth battle or is equal
to and then we're going to go new and
this is going to be multi-dimensional
array again and then what we're going to
do is we're going to create a ray that
is going to have all of our monsters
inside of it and when we want to create
a an array of monsters basically the
format for that is just going to be
whatever the object name is which is
going to be monster - followed by
brackets and then you need to give an
array name so we're just going to call
this monsters I like that is equal to
new and then what do you need to do then
we're going to say whatever the name of
the objects that are going to go inside
of there again so that's just going to
be the object name again object name and
this should be the array name right now
and then here you're going to say the
number of objects that you want to put
inside of it because when you're
creating an array you have to define
that and in this situation I'm just
gonna say 4 but now I'm going to show
you the real thing so if we want to
create an array that's going to contain
a monster a bunch of monster objects
we're just gonna go monster who puts
little bracket inside of there and we're
gonna go monsters is equal to new
monster - and and I'm from creating 4
monsters well I'm gonna send one in my
array I want 4 boxes set aside to
containing 4 monsters and then if you
want to load those monster objects into
this array let's just go monster
monsters and then in the zero index I'm
gonna say equal to new monster - I'm
calling the constructor file that's
going to create all these guys and let's
jump over there just to see what that
looks like so here if we scroll down
here's monster 2 right here this is the
method that we're going to be calling so
let's just copy that
just so we know exactly what's going
inside of there we know we need to send
a health to this so let's just say a
thousand and we need a tack
that's 20 and then movement let's just
say this guy's slow and put a 1 inside
of there and then let's just call him
Frank to make his attack a little bit
better and also increases speed and
let's just call him Drac and of course
we're going to put this in the index one
this one in the index 2 and this in the
index 3 and then we can basically leave
the rest of these the way they are I
don't know let's just create another
monster called Paul and another one
named George and then after we create
all of our monsters and load them into
our array let's go to monster - and
let's redraw our game board and we can
file save it and see what happens and
there you say we created our little game
board there it is on the right side of
the screen and here's all the default
values you can see here's Frank
well there's Frank's represented right
there and Drac is represented right
there and there's Paul and there is
George so in this tutorial you learned
how to create a game board how to make
sure all the monsters go exactly where
they're supposed to go and also made
sure that they all got an individual
space to start their life out and before
it all ends in the next part of the
tutorial I'll show you how to move these
guys around without crashing into each
other and then later on we'll teach them
how to attack each other leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
