10 of my learn to program series in this
part of the tutorial we will focus in on
inheritance polymorphism and magic
methods if you haven't watched any of
the previous tutorials you should
probably watch those first and I provide
a link here so you can do that otherwise
you might be confused and as well in the
description underneath the video I have
links to all of the code using this
tutorial as well as a transcript of
everything that I talked about and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so here we are so when we create a
class we can inherit all the fields and
methods from a previously created class
and this is called inheritance so makes
a lot of sense and the class that
inherits is going to be called the
subclass while the class we inherit from
is gonna be called the superclass so
what we're gonna do here is I'm gonna
create different types of animal
groupings and animal is going to be my
superclass so what I need to do here
first is to come in and define my
initialization method and then inside of
it I am going to define different
classifications of animals so I'm gonna
have something like birth type which
means are they born in an egg or that
are they born live and I'm gonna put
unknown in here as a default and also we
could have appearance so it could be
things like doesn't have fur does it
have feathers or whatever you'd like
and then finally I'm going to have
blooded I don't know if any of these are
technical terms or not I'm just doing
this this way and then I'm gonna create
reptiles and mammals and we're gonna see
how they differ okay so now we need to
come in here and set these up and once
again self is a reference just like you
would refer to yourself as my self is a
way for objects to refer to themselves
that don't have a name yet and we can
put appearance inside of here as well
and just want to make you guys well
aware I answer every question that
YouTube sends to me so if you have any
questions leave the
in the comment section below and I will
answer them because I want to make sure
everybody understands what's going on
and make sure you spell parents correct
there we go and now I'm going to define
my Gitter method and we do that by
setting different fields up as
properties so I'm going to first come in
and cover birth type and make sure you
put self inside of there and whenever we
return the value for this make sure you
say self with two underscores and birth
type in this situation so that that
works for you and then we will define
our setters by going at and birth type
once again and this time we're going to
say Sutter and define and put birth type
inside here again and birth type is
going to receive self as well as the
birth type that we are going to be
changing it to and then whenever you
want to set this you just go self once
again and again remember the double
underscores and birth type and then
assign whatever birth type was passed
inside of it and that's all we need to
do for that and then we need to do
exactly the same thing for appearance as
well as blooded and I went ahead and did
that so we come in here and do
appearance and remember you can hit
pause on these videos at any point in
time and I typed in exactly the same
styling here for the property for
appearance as well as the setter and
then here we did the same thing for
blooded as well as the setter for
blooded now we're gonna get more into
magic methods here in a moment but I
wanted to show you a magic method here
right now and this is the string magic
method and it can be used to cast our
object as a string which means if
somebody just types in print and
whatever the animal name is the animal
object is it's going to print out a
certain very stylized version of
information so to find this we just go
define two underscores STR and two
underscores that's what sets this off as
a magic method when it starts with two
underscores and ends with two
underscores you know that is a magic
method
and it gets elf as well and then you
need to define the string that is being
returned so I'm gonna say something like
a and I'm gonna put all of the
information inside of here that we have
about our animal is and it is and it is
and then there's the four things I'm
going to output about this and the first
one is of course I'm going to be using
format here for this guy very first
thing if you want to actually get the
classes real name what you do is go type
and then you'll say self and then
outside of this you're gonna need to put
a dot and two underscores and name
followed by two underscores and you can
see it went to the next line there and
that's one way to get to the class name
we also want to get the birth type so
let's go and get birth type and we also
want to get appearance and then finally
we want to get blooded okay so that's
gonna take all of this information
whenever the user tries to print out our
object on its screen it's going to throw
all that information to these nice
little parts here using format and then
I'll put a string onto the screen
there's your first magic method and I'll
show you some more here in a moment now
we want to inherit every getter and
setter and method in general that is
inside of the animal class in a new
class that it's called mammal and to do
that we just go class and we define the
name for it and then you can put animal
inside of here and you could put more
things inside of here if you add them so
let's say at a reptile class that for
some reason you wanted to input all of
the methods into that guy you know
that's how easy you just put a comma
there and you can import multiple
different classes into this one class
then of course we need to still
initialize this so we're gonna do that
and this guy's is also going to be
receiving the birth type and just to
keep this simple I'm going to define all
the things that separate mammals from
just generic animals so I'm going to say
it
is born alive and we can also say go
down to the next line we can also say
that the appearance for mammal is going
to be hair or fur and also we can say
blooded is going to be equal to
warm-blooded and then finally we can
also say something that separates
mammals from other different types of
animals is how they nurse their your
young and the fact is that that is true
that mammals do nurse their young now
what's neat here is we can call the
initialization method inside of animal
from inside of our new mammal class that
we defined and how we do that is we just
go and to find the class we want to call
and the method specifically want it we
want to call and don't forget to put
self inside of here you have to put self
inside of there and then we'll just pass
in all of the things that the animal
initialization method can handle so it
can handle birth type it can handle
appearance and it's also going to be
able to handle blood it we can't pass
nurse Young inside of there though
because that doesn't exist in animal and
then after we do that we can say self
and how this differentiates we go and do
nurse young on its own and if
information on how the mammals nurse is
in there then we can put that inside of
there another thing we need to do though
now since we have nurse young inside of
there is we need to set that up with the
getters and setters so let's go and copy
that right there and then paste it
inside of here and instead this is going
to be nurse
young and then this will be nurse young
as well and this is going to be nurse
young nurse young and nurse young nurse
young and finally nurse young okay and
those are all set up for that
new mammal class that we defined another
thing that is important to know is we
will also be able to overwrite any
methods that are inside of the classes
that we inherit from and they will
automatically take effect so let's say
that we want to overwrite our magic
string method no problem define and we
can get that guy right there itself and
of course well we want another way that
we can call for a method to run in
another class is to type in super
because that's the superclass animal is
the superclass and mammal is the
subclass and then we would just go and
reference that magic method and that's
gonna give us everything that we need
and then we'll concatenate the string
that this guy throws back with our new
information that's going to talk about
nurse young nursing young so we'll say
and and let's put a space inside of
there it is and then we had true or
false we're gonna say true they nurse
their young that on the end and we'll go
format and then we could just go self
and in this situation you don't put the
double underscores though you just type
in Norse young like that another thing
that we could do here is we could go and
put let's go put this right here
if we want to extend our string across
multiple lines we can put a double quote
there and then a slash and then down
here like that and that's going to allow
us a backslash is going to allow us to
continue that string onwards all right
so there's another neat little thing
that just came up there and I thought
cover it so we went and created our
mammal subclass of the superclass type
animal and you can see exactly how all
that is all set up there so let's go and
create another class and this one's
going to be called reptile and it's also
going to inherit everything from animal
and we could do pretty much the same
sort of things that we have here let's
go and get our find this guy we're not
gonna worry about nurse Young this time
now paste that inside of their birth
type and here we're going to change the
birth type to born in an egg or born
alive and appearance is going to be dry
scales and then blooded is going to be
changed to cold-blooded and here we'll
be able to just simply call the animal
class and have it initialize everything
so we'll say animal and underscore
initialize that and make sure you pass
self inside of there and then we just
pass in all of our different things so
birth type and appearance as well as
blooded now I want to talk about
something that is called function
overloading which is very common in
other programming languages especially
object-oriented programming languages
but it really doesn't make sense with
Python so what am I do is I'll just
demonstrate how overloading works with
other languages now with most
programming languages not Python and
pythons awesome and that's why it
doesn't matter what we would you have to
do here is let's say that we wanted to
have a method that received an unknown
number of values well because in most
programming languages you need to do
things like define that you're gonna
receive two integers and a string
meaning you need to define that yes
we're going to definitely be receiving
an integer first then another than
integer and then another string or a
float or whatever and you have to be
very specific about what the datatype is
that you're going to be receiving in
your function if you would want to
receive a different number of attributes
or parameters sent into your function
what you could do in other languages is
you could come in here and actually
create a different version of some all
that says for example maybe it receives
another integer so it's going to add
three integers versus adding two
integers that is how operator
overloading works or function
overloading works in other languages and
we differentiate the version of sum all
that is used based off of what these
parameters are in Python none of that
matters as you know because you don't
need to define the data types that are
being set inside of here
so instead inside a Python if you would
want to receive an unknown number
variables passed inside of here we would
use our old friend
Splatt once again which I talked about
in a previous part of the tutorial and
then you could just come in here and say
sum is equal to zero and for I in member
you don't use the splat whenever you
refer to args outside of that and then
we could just say sum is equal to I and
sum all those guys up and then return
sum so that's another way that Python is
really cool because you don't need to
use all function overloading you can
just go and receive an unknown number of
values and they will just work out for
it just want to cover that just in case
somebody had any questions about that
alright so now that we created all of
our different classes let's come in here
and use them and we'll come down here
and call for our main function to
execute now if we want to create a new
animal type we can just go animal 1 is
equal to call our animal class and then
inside of it we can pass just one thing
just show that it works
so there's born alive and because we
went inside of here and we passed or if
we define default values we don't need
to define them all so we can define
birth type but not define anything else
and it's just going to work for us
okay so we'll say that we have an animal
and it is born alive and if we then want
to call for this function to execute and
give us information we can come in and
get a specific thing like birth type
control our look give me an error let's
see what I did wrong and we come over
here and line 61 it says I did something
wrong let's come up and fix it oh it's
saying invalid syntax these errors that
they can view in Python are terrible I
could tell exactly what I did wrong I
forgot to put the colon inside there so
now if we run it look it says animal is
not defined let's come in here and look
and see what's going on with this 36 and
it gave me that error because I didn't
have an indentation set up properly so
let's go and set that up for awfully so
that that all works and actually this is
a nice thing because we can come in here
and show you how PyCharm can
automatically correct any of your
indentation errors we can just go to
code inside a pod
arm up here and reformat code and
everything's gonna line itself up real
nice and neat so let's see if that went
and corrected that Angie's got another
error okay so going over a whole bunch
of ways to fix errors let's go into line
10 and see what I did wrong here and
says line 10 we look down here a line 10
don't see anything wrong with that but
if we will go up here and look at this
guy we can see that line 10 is a curved
line for was incorrect we put in bursts
instead of births type all right now
let's run it and we get born live print
it out okay so a couple errors sorry
about that sometimes I make them and
let's come down here and let's play
around with our objects we created a
little bit more so all that did was it
went in and got us the birth type that
we asked for or that we already set and
why don't we come in here also and call
our string magic method and see what
that looks like if we pass in our animal
one object inside of there and what I
mean by that is this guy right here this
guy is going to print out all the
information about our animal object that
we created and we can just go control
arm and there you can see a animal is
born live it is unknown it is unknown so
when through those default values in
there for all the things that we didn't
know about the animal type so now let's
go and let's create a mammal and we'll
see a print inside here it's just so we
can divide up the animal objects from
our mammal objects and to create a
mammal object we just come in and call
mammal of course and inside of this well
let's just go and create it just like
that
well we'll just leave it like that since
we set good default values for our
mammals already and then we can see what
they come out like once again if we want
to get those individual animal or mammal
parts we can just reference those
different values that we have there for
us so we can get birth type and we can
also come in here and get the appearance
for our mammal and we can also get our
blooded type as well as the nurse young
part
we are and you can see once again born
live here form blooded true comes back
and then once again we're gonna be able
to come in and call our string function
on our mammal and it's gonna give us a
nice sentence with all that information
a mammal is born alive it is hair or fur
why I should have changed that to has
hair or fur it is warm-blooded and it is
true they nurse their young we were able
to come in there and it automatically
used all those different attributes and
properties and methods that were defined
inside of animal for our mammal class
just to show you how that works so now
we'll go in and we'll create a reptile
object and we can look and see how that
might differ so we could say let's just
call this reptile one is equal to and
we'll call for the initialization of
reptile and once again of course we're
going to be able to print out
information about our reptile so we can
say birth type for example and you can
say born in an egg or born alive gets
printed out there on the screen and then
once again finally we can go and print
out the whole entire thing using our
magic muffin and here you can see that
it works a reptile is born in an egg
we're born alive it has dry scales and
it is cold blooded prints out on the
screen so pretty cool stuff and let's
also go and demonstrate that our reptile
some all it's a very smart reptile that
knows how to add let's go and show that
that indeed is gonna work so we'll say
some and then we'll use format here to
throw this inside of here format and
then to call that specific reptile
method just go reptile one and some all
and then inside of here you can throw as
many different values as you would like
and if we run that you're gonna see the
sum is 15 just like you might have hoped
and that brings us to polymorphism and
how it differs inside of Python versus
other different languages now
polymorphism in Python works different
from other languages in that functions
are going to accept any object and
expect that that object is going to be
able to provide the need
method to execute and this really isn't
something to dwell on just know that if
you call on a method for an object that
the method just needs to exist for that
object to work that isn't necessarily
true with other programming languages
and the technical reason why is that
in most programming languages you're
going to define the datatype
whenever you declare the variable and
that is called what we call statically
typed that means when the variable is
defined inside a Python if you want to
create a new variable so variable one is
equal to ten well it's an integer right
now but you could just as easily come in
and throw a string inside of there and
now it's a string inside of most
programming languages you need to say
this is an integer
it's called variable one and it has a
value of ten you can't then turn around
and throw a string inside of there or
the programming language is going to
flip out and I'm talking about languages
like C++ and Java inside a Python it
doesn't matter and that's the reason why
I polymorphism isn't such a big giant
thing and specifically what I was saying
here before languages like C++ and Java
are statically typed or the type is
defined at the declaration of the
variable versus in Python variables are
going to be dynamically typed meaning
that the type is defined when a value is
assigned and you know doesn't matter as
much so I'll demonstrate polymorphism
inside Python I'm gonna create a
function here called get birth type and
it's going to receive a sum object
doesn't know what type object but its
own I do its darndest work whenever it
does receive it and whenever it does
receive it it's gonna say something like
the blank is blank and will say format
and we can come in and do type for the
object and this is going to give us our
class name and then we can just
underscore name double underscore again
and let's go down to the next line here
and we'll say something like the object
followed by first type okay so we went
and find this new function and let's go
and grab it copy that and we'll throw it
outside of main
so we'll paste it inside of here so
there is that same exact function and
then I'm gonna use that function with
different objects and you're gonna see
that it just works so get birth type and
pass in mammal one and then get birth
type and this time I will pass in
reptile one and if we run it of course
you're going to say the mammal is born
alive and the reptile is born in an egg
or born alive okay so that is how
polymorphism works inside of Python
really it just works I mean as long as
the method exists whenever you call on
an object just like we did here so if
birth type exists inside of your object
no matter what the object type is it's
going to work in other loan languages
that would be more magical but in Python
my pythons already magical enough and
things just work and it's easy to work
with and that's one of the reasons why
to consider Python to be the perfect
language for a beginning programmer okay
so enough about inheritance and function
overloading and polymorphism now let's
take a look at something really neat
which are magic methods now as you saw
previously with the initialization
method as well as the string method
magic methods are going to be surrounded
by double underscores and we can use
magic methods to define how operators
like + or negative or multiplication
division equal to greater than well this
is multiplication greater than less than
equal to and so forth work and you can
see here an example of couple those so
just like we used a nit for
initialization STR for string if you
wanted to be able to compare custom
objects in custom ways you could use
equals here not equals less than greater
than less than or equal to greater than
or equal to add subtract multiply divide
and modulus and I'm going to show you
here an example with a custom class on
how we can do that so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna create a custom class
and it's gonna be called time and we're
gonna come in and define how this is
going to be initialized and you could
pause the video and give this a go to
see if you create your own time class
otherwise I'm gonna do it
so I'm gonna say that hour is gonna
start with a zero and minute is going to
start with a zero and second is going to
start with a default value of zero then
inside of it just like you're probably
guessing we're gonna be able to go our
is equal to whatever the hour was that
was passed inside of it do the same
exact thing for a minute and do exactly
the same thing once again for second
alright so we have our time class and
that is how we're gonna initialize this
and this is going to be military time
meaning that I'm gonna use 24 for hours
so very first magic method you've
already seen this this is the string
magic method so string just like this
and we just define inside of here what
strings returned any time our function
is called for or our object is called to
print and I'm gonna say that I want to
return I'm gonna do this in a way so
that I can demonstrate something else so
we're gonna say this is gonna represent
the hour and then if I want to come in
here and I want to have the minutes but
I want them to have leading zeros so
that there's always two digits returned
even if it's like one it's gonna come
back at zero one I just go :
zero to D like that and that is going to
make sure that that comes back as two
digits minimum so it doesn't look silly
and do the same thing for our seconds
and then outside of this I'll save
and then inside of the format I will say
so self our self minute and self second
so there we are to find all those guys
and let's just go put this on a second
line there we are okay so there is a
magic method that is our string function
you already saw it so now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna create the same thing
for add and now I'm gonna define here
what exactly happens whenever we try to
add two of these times together so I'm
gonna say other time that we're going to
be adding to this guy and then inside of
it I'm going to define something called
new time which is going to be the sum of
these times and I'm gonna call just you
can actually create objects inside you
know of a specific class inside of the
class itself which is really cool and
now you can pause the video and I want
you to work out exactly how we would
work with two different time objects and
how we could add those together all
right so hopefully you came out with a
good idea here basically I'm just gonna
make some notes on how I would do this
so what I want to do is I want to add
the seconds and correct
if sum is greater than 60 and then the
next thing that I want to do is add the
minutes and correct
if sum is greater than 60 and then
finally we're gonna do add the hours and
correct
if sum is greater than 24 all right so
we have all of those set up and now
we're gonna come in here and create it
so I'm gonna say something like self or
if self second plus other time second is
greater than 60 now I need to decide
what I want to do well I want to
increment the minutes so I'll say a
minute plus equal to one and what else
am I going to have to do well I'm gonna
have to add the new time now
or our new time that we're defining here
and how I'll do that is a new time
second is going to be equal to self
second plus other time second and then
inside of here since I incrementing the
value of one for the minute well then I
need to subtract that out so I'll
subtract out the sixty else if we didn't
have a situation which the sum of those
two values was greater than sixty
actually she'd be greater than or equal
to sixty caught a little bit of a bug
there and now it's come in and say new
time ii is equal to self second - other
time second and now I need to do pretty
much identically the same exact thing
for our minutes I'm just gonna copy this
and paste that inside of here
and instead what I'm gonna say is minute
make sure I have a minute up here not
minutes yes I have minute and minute
second da-da-da-da-da that's good and
minutes and this right here it's gonna
be changed to hour and this is minute as
well and change all these other guys
over here also two minute and just so I
can say a minute again here's a couple
more minute changes and there we go
so there we went and we created that and
now I need to come in here and do
something similar with our now here what
I say is if self our plus other time our
is gooder than 24 here I'll go a new
time and I'm just gonna keep this simple
I'm gonna expect that they're not adding
large numbers of times and so forth like
that's gonna throw me way over 48 hours
and things like that so I'm gonna I'm
just keeping it simple I'm just
demonstrating how to use the add magic
method here I'm not trying to make the
absolute perfect method so here we can
go self our plus other time hour and
then outside of that subtract 24 else I
could say a new time hour is gonna be
equal to self hour plus other time hour
and then this is very important you then
need to return whatever the result of
this is which is going to be
new time object and then down inside of
here we can create our main function and
we'll create our time so we'll say time
1 is gonna be equal to time and we'll
throw a 1 20 and 30 inside of there and
we can print this out just to make sure
our string magic method worked out for
us
there's time 1 let's run it and it
didn't print out let's go up here and
see if we can figure out why that might
have been oh I know why because I didn't
put main down here boy I'm making
seriously silly mistakes ok so there
that goes right there
and let's go and create another time
let's call this time 2 is equal to time
and here we'll say 24 to make sure that
the hour increments and we'll change
this to 41 and then we'll change this to
30 and we'll see how those work out to
check our magic method out so we'll go
print and we can say time 1 plus time 2
and know that that's gonna work and
there you can see that it indeed did ok
so pretty cool stuff and for homework I
think you guys should go in there and
get the time objects to work with some
of the other mathematical and
comparision operators and that should be
a fabulous exercise is gonna teach you a
whole lot and just like always please
leave your questions and comments below
