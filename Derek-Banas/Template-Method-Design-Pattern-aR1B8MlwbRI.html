16 of my design patterns video tutorial
today we're going to talk about the
template method design pattern it is a
extremely easy design pattern to
understand and by the end of this you're
going to completely understand it like
most of these tutorials it's all
self-contained so if you're just here to
learn about the template not the design
pattern you're in the right place and if
you'd like to learn about all the design
patterns refer to the link above so
let's get into it so what is the
template method design pattern well it's
used to create a group of subclasses
that have to execute a similar group of
methods and to implement it you create
an abstract class that's going to
contain a method called the template
method and if you're not getting this
don't worry about it the code will
totally fill you in as well as a UML
diagram that's coming up very quickly so
any way you create the abstract class
it's going to contain a method called
the template method and the template
method contains a series of method calls
that every subclass object will call
however in certain situations the
subclass objects that are formed from
this guy they're going to be over to
override some of the method calls that
don't work for it let's take a look at
the UML diagram basically what I'm going
to do in this tutorial is I'm going to
use a fictional restaurant called the
hoagie Hut and the people that work
there are called sandwich sculptors well
the hoagie Hut has decided to automate
the process of creating sandwiches and
they're going to replace all their
sandwich sculptors so it's our job to
make it all happen now this guy right
here makes sandwich that is the template
method and it's going to execute a whole
bunch of different methods and here are
those methods or cut bun add meat add
cheese add veggies wrap hoagie and give
it to the customer then what we're going
to do is we're going to implement things
called hooks now if we want to make a
sandwich it doesn't contain meat right
here we're going to set this boolean
value to false over in one of the
subclasses it's going to implement this
abstract class called hoagie and we're
going to over here say now we don't want
to add meat or veggies or cheese or what
have you to our hoagie and that's going
to automatically void out all of the
methods that are contained within this
template method called make sandwich so
let's get into the code and show you
exactly how to implement this thing okay
so hoagie hut wants to replace all its
sandwich sculptures so what are some
ways that we can do that well first off
we're going to have
come in here and start implementing our
classes that are going to represent our
sandwiches now the first thing I'm going
to do here is not going to be a good way
to solve this problem but I'm going to
do it just so that we know how to do it
so let's go in here I would say all
right we need to make Italian hoagies
well the bad way to do this is just to
start bouncing around in here and start
implementing exactly how we would want
to make one of these sandwiches we could
say something like make sandwich great
this method here and then say something
like cut bond add meat and all the code
here is available under this video and
you should definitely check it out if
you want to completely understand how to
implement this design pattern add
vegetables add condiments and then wrap
the Hokie okay so no matter what type of
hoagie we make and by hoagie I mean
sandwich submarine what everyone refer
to would ask every single one was going
to have us cut a bun and wrap that thing
up now these things however going to
differ and that's going to be one of the
reasons why this design here is not
going to work and then what we would do
is do something like public void cut
bond and then do something like system
out line the hoagie is and then we would
implement all of these methods that are
defined up here down here and it would
in the end make itself in Italian hoagie
I think you can see quite clearly why
that is not a good idea because you have
to rewrite and duplicate a ton of code
and that just doesn't make sense however
we have to also think about the problem
of what happens whenever this becomes a
veggie hoagie all of a sudden we are not
going to be adding meat cheese and maybe
not condiments so what are we do in that
situation that's where the hook part
comes in that I talked about previously
let's just get into this and fix it up
and make it look the way it should so
change that back in one Italian hoagie
and then what we're going to do instead
is go into hoagie dot Java and create
our abstract class so we're going to
build all of our hoagies from so let's
just go public abstract class okie and
this is going to be our template method
and it's declared as final to keep
subclasses from changing the algorithm
because we know how we want to make our
sandwiches and we don't want our
sandwich sculptor to have any input at
all in regards to how to do so so what
are we going to do
well we know every single one of our
OGIS is going to have a bun that's not
for the customer to determine though
we're not going to put the meat and
cheese right into their hand and allow
them to eat it that way and then what
are we going to do well we're going to
define whether our customer once meat
because remember veggie hoagie is an
option and we're just going to put that
there and then inside of it if they do
want me we're going to say well add the
meat then and we're going to call that
method and then just so we don't get
lost here outside of our template method
we're going to start filling in
everything so let's just go abstract
loyd add meat we're going to force them
to implement this method with the
abstract term there and then on top of
that under here we're going to define
boolean customer once meat and we're
going to provide a method that can be
overridden however doesn't need to be so
if the hoagie hut decides that most of
their submarines are going to contain
meat well it makes sense then for this
to remain true and then allow all the
subclasses to override it if it isn't
true and this is referred to as a hook
it's basically just used like I said
before user wants to override these they
can't and whenever you're creating all
these individual methods inside of here
you're going to mark anything abstract
whenever you want to force the user to
override it and create it as a hook
whenever you want that to totally be
optional and up to our user so now that
we have the basis of how this is going
to be set up we can come in here and
fill in all of our other hooks or
options or whatever you want to call so
we're gonna say if customer wants cheese
well then add cheese just like that and
then we're going to come down here just
to keep everything organized and throw
that abstract class in here change that
to an uppercase and then change this to
add cheese and then add another boolean
value here customer once and then type
in cheese right like that
and we're basically going to do the same
thing for all of the other potential
pieces of our submarine sandwich or
hoagie or do we want to call it so we're
going to say customer once vegetables'
and then come down here and say add
vegetables and then abstract add
vegetables and then right here customer
wants vegetables and then the final
thing that's going to be an option
is we're going to come in there and also
ask the customer if they want condiments
there's that abstract add condiments and
then our boolean value right here
customer once condiments and there you
are then we can bounce up here and put
in a definite so wrap the hoagie is
going to be something that definitely
has to be done for sanitary purposes and
then outside of our template method
we're going to define what exactly cut
buns going to do public void cut bond
paste in system out the hoagie is cut
close that close that and there you
guess that's a method that's definitely
going to be called and then underneath
of our hooks here where we're going to
define whether these things are going to
be added or not to our sandwich we're
going to put in our other definite and
that's going to be public void wrap the
hoagie and then in that situation we're
gonna say wrap the hoagie like that we
file save that and then this guy's
basically setup so now let's go into
Italian hoagie and use it the proper way
with our abstract class so in that
situation we're gonna go extends our
abstract class hoagie and then what's it
going to do well let's just get rid of
all this because now the abstract class
is going to handle making our sandwich
and we need to implement some
unimplemented methods for this guy so
there we are
click on that and automatically
everything is going to pop inside of
there let's scroll back up to the top
and this has nothing to do with the
template method design pattern but i
decided i'm gonna have everything in
regards to what's going to be on the
sandwich setup inside of a string iraq
salami pepperoni kappa Cola ham so this
is going to be the basis of our italian
hoagie and then we're going to do the
same sort of thing for all the other
ingredients that are going to go on this
hoagie you're going to say cheese used
in this situation this is real simple
provolone got that in there we come in
here and say veggies used lettuce
tomatoes onions sweet peppers and then
finally condiments used and that's going
to be real simple as well we're just
going to say oil vinegar okay so we have
all of the things that are you know
inside of our italian hoagie so now we
need to go in to add meat and make sure
that
everything's generated properly here so
I'm just going to print a little message
adding the meat and then I'm going to
use an enhance for statement so we're
going to go to string meat temporary
holding cell for everything that's
popped out of our meat used string array
system.out.print and we're going to
print out meat followed by space okay so
now we pretty much have to do exactly
the same thing for all of these other
methods inside of here so for add cheese
just bounce in there adding the cheese
and then here we're going to say cheese
cheese used and cheese then come down to
the vegetable part paste that in there
adding the veggies veggie and then here
we're going to type in veggie then the
last one add condiments for that in
there adding the condiments condiment
condiments use in condiments there we go
looks like that's all good yep no errors
so that is going to be the basis of our
Italian hoagie so now we basically have
to I'm just going to copy all this just
save some time and then jump over into
veggie hoagie this is going to be the
guy that's dramatically different paste
all that code in there and then I'm
going to change this to veggie hoagie
then down here we don't have cheese on
our veggie hoagie and we don't have meat
on our veggie hoagie but we are going to
have edg's obviously as well as
condiments and then just to keep this
neat because it makes more sense in this
situation I need to override the
customer wants meat and the customer
wants cheese that's found over in hoagie
Java see right here so I'm just going to
copy these guys and I'm going to
override them in my veggie hoagie class
that I have here so instead I'm going to
type in false and then I'm gonna type in
false here so overrode those so now
that's going to work properly and for
these guys right here add meat and add
cheese well I don't need them to do
anything but I do need to implement them
so fine I'm just going to get rid of
everything that is inside of them and
have them basically do nothing there we
are we can do the same thing here there
we are and then in the add vegetables
part guess what I don't have to do
anything because I already have all
those things defined up here of course I
could change what's in these string rays
but I don't see any reason to do that so
we can file save it because guess what
we're done with that so now all it's
left for us to do
to create the sandwich sculptor this is
going to be ridiculously easy so we're
in sandwich sculptor we're in public
static void main so it's time for us to
make ourselves some sandwiches so I'm
going to go hoagie I'm just going to
create a basic hoagie and let's say
customer 12 comes in it says that they
want an Italian hoagie well now we can
guarantee it's going to get made the
right way so we're going to go new
Italian hoagie like that and then to
have it create it we're just going to go
customer 12 hoagie and then make
sandwich which is a call to the template
method that we defined inside of OG Java
let's take a look at it see make
sandwich there it is it's going to
create all this stuff for us that's all
we need to do and then if we haven't
some other customer come in and this
customer says I want a different type of
hoagie I want you to make me a
vegetarian hoagie no problem I'm just
going to come in here veggie hoagie oops
got a spot right every on and then make
sandwich change that to 13 and if we
file save that it's actually I know
gonna print a little bit weird I'm gonna
fix that in a second and there you can
see hoagie Skutt adding the meat blah
blah blah
adding the cheese and so forth and so on
and then if we want to correct this
spacing issue let me just think here I'm
sort of improvidence
let's figure out how to do it what makes
the most sense to do it inside a hoagie
do Java so let's just jump in there and
what's one quick way we can do this
we can create ourselves a boolean or
let's say after first condiment because
we have no idea of whether meat or what
sort of things are going to go on here
so I'm going to mark that as false and
then what I'm going to do is insert new
lines to make sure that all this stuff
is broken up right
so cut bond then what I'm going to do is
if there is meat on the hoagie I'm going
to come in here like this
and mark this as true and then down here
we go into the cheese part remember this
has nothing to do with the template
method design pattern I'm just fixing a
little bit of an issue here and here I'm
going to throw in that and ask if I've
already pasted in the meat part of this
and if I did I want to throw a new line
in there print throw a new line or I can
adjust put in print line but whatever
and then after that I'm gonna pop this
in there boink
this can be your homework figuring out
exactly what I'm doing here if you don't
quite get it
save that and then I'm going to do the
same thing here and do the same thing
I can't imagine somebody coming in
ordering a hoagie and just getting
condiments but I guess it's a
possibility and there we are
I'm gonna file save that and then jump
back over in the sandwich sculptor Java
and then we can bounce over here
throw in a print line between each of
these guys and execute it now it should
work perfectly and there you can see it
worked perfectly prints out cut the
hoagie ads all the meat adds the cheese
adds the veggies as the condiments wraps
the hoagie and then in here in this
situation whenever we don't have meat
and cheese just prints out veggies and
condiments and wraps at hoagie so there
is the template method design pattern
leave any questions or comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
