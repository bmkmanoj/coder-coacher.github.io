going to go through a deep analysis of
all of the value seeker personalities
value seekers or ideal seekers
predominantly all trust their hunches
and their gut reactions however when
making decisions they trust their heart
here you can see the value seeker codes
on the Left right here and the name that
I gave each of those value seeker
personality types first in the world of
value seekers we have the teachers
they're concerned and caring types that
are charming and enthusiastic they focus
on the best qualities of people and
strive to bring them out they strive to
get along with everyone through their
well-developed communication abilities
and they are natural leaders motivators
and persuaders they look upon setbacks
as just mere opportunities they create
harmony in groups by respecting
everyone's opinion they can initiate the
actions needed for the group to reach
their goals they will put in the work
needed to materialize their ideals or
their values they are very goal-oriented
and organized there are fabulous
communicators they tend to quickly make
decisions they will take responsibility
and control of their projects they are
very loyal and devoted to their friends
and they strive to please others then in
the value seeker group we have the
jumping vanes through their lively and
spontaneous enthusiasm they spread their
joy for life to others thoughts are
always flying around in their
imaginative minds which leads them from
one thought to the next in wild abandon
the combination of their sense of humor
and their ever changing thoughts often
sweep those up around them they are
constantly looking for new ways of doing
things they motivate many with their
energy and enthusiasm they are often
talented at many skill sets are great at
thinking on their feet and they love to
work in stimulating groups of people
they are very perceptive of others
feelings and abilities they give
everyone their full attention they have
no problem expressing their feelings
they are very charming and they work
well with little to no supervision then
you have the counselors they are tender
hearted souls that spread compassion to
others without drawing attention to
themselves because they're complex
imaginations they may seem eccentric to
others and even to themselves at times
they are very aware of emotions of
others and
strive to inspire growth and others they
are highly creative because of their
strong imaginations it can be very
persuasive if they get over their stage
fright they put in the work needed to
reach long-term goals and they see
setbacks as goals to be overcome they
are clear and understandable in their
communication they are great listeners
they're very demanding of themselves and
tend to be perfectionists they could
create dramatic changes in the welfare
of others they think all actions through
diligently and they are very
compassionate to others needs and then
finally we have the dreamers they are
very open to new ideas as long as they
are in line with their core values you
have to understand all four of these
personality types are all totally
centered on values they are gentle types
that believe in honoring their
commitments and integrity they are often
hard to understand because they keep
their core values and feelings bottled
up inside they will share their true
selves - very few people they generally
persuade and influence others they will
become the leader in groups that share
their values they will get the job done
perfectly if left on their own they can
deal with complex tasks they measure
themselves against the highest of
standards they will see every issue from
the point of view of all sides they
value integrity in all relationships if
they commit to something they are fully
committed they focus strongly on the
needs of others and they will not force
their values on others that is all of
the different personality types and you
could see here links to all the other
different personality types and if you
didn't take the quiz to find your
personality type links to that

screen any questions or comments leave
