quick tutorial on how to get a domain
name on godaddy as well as how to sign
up for a hosting plan with godaddy that
in which you will be built on a monthly
basis and not get stuck paying for
things you don't need first off you go
to the godaddy.com set up your account
so forth and so on that is extremely
explainable so I'm not going to go into
that I did I'm not going to get into it
but you can see here this is the domain
name that I want to purchase own website
designs the reason why I pick that to
talk briefly about search engine
optimization it's that these three terms
are typed into Google's browser search
engine in twelve thousand one hundred
times per month and the competition for
these words is only thirty thousand
seven hundred you might not know that
but that is a very very good normally
competition for words that are this this
strong is in the millions so I type in
the domain I want to purchase and I hit
go and it's available for anybody after
that things aren't any good domain names
available would be wrong and you would
come down here and click on continue to
registration this box is going to pop up
dot com is the way it is don't even
bother getting those so hit no thanks
bottom here then what's going to pop up
is this box which is normally checked
for two years I'm going to select it as
one these are all the little tricks they
try and get you with okay and then it
continued this is another place to try
to trick you your privacy and domain
protection knowledge stuff if you don't
know what that is chances are you don't
need it come down here click continue
when it in regards to emails i believe a
great way to save some money is to just
use the standard email package is set up
with godaddy i do not feel like spent on
giving them an additional dollar eighty
nine or 284 or ten dollars per month
what I do is I have everything forwarded
to the one email that they give you
complimentary so you don't have any
reason to purchase these unless you're a
big business and if you're a big
business you can use gmail systems with
other things to get around to have to
pay for your email some don't like that
either there's another place people get
tricked if you click on this which is
their web hosting deluxe package they're
going to lock you in so that you have to
pay the first full year up front I
personally don't want to do that I want
to pay on a monthly basis so I'm going
to click on no thanks and then you just
simply click on checkout and you can see
here it wasn't tricked paying the
standard ten dollars eighty-seven cents
for the package that I wanted to
purchase so I would just simply enter my
credit card information and then check
out but now i'm going to do and that and
that is exactly what you should do fill
all that out take these two things on
continue with check out if they're going
to process your credit card information
you're going to get your domain name now
what i did was i have a site already
previously set up that i want to upgrade
to the hosting package that I want and
only pay for that hosting package on a
monthly basis so what you would do is
log back in to go to any after your
domain is registered with you come over
here to hosting and here i have a
website that i recently purchased what i
want to do all right there my name
letter
still it registered I want to click on
that you're going to see over here on
the right side people get confused about
this all the time you'll see upgrade
downgrade hosting account you'll see I
have one of the accounts checked over
here click on upgrade download hosting
account and now it's going to give me a
list all the different plans I'm prefer
a Linux system and I think if you don't
want to get yourself in trouble you
should get a Linux system as well so i
zoom in here I prefer the deluxe hosting
package with godaddy 699 per month and
here's all the add-ons all unchecked for
you you click on continue and you can
see right here and actually I had a
credit but I normally would be charged
six dollars and ninety-nine cents
reoccurring my billing is going to be on
a monthly basis so I'm not spending
eighty dollars right up front before I
decided the domain name is even worth
spending money on at all and I am paying
the bare minimum for both registering a
domain name as well as hosting it with
godaddy hope that it answers a lot of
your questions again you would just fill
in credit card take everything off it
continued with check out and if they ask
you if you want to buy any additional
things just say no and process the
account and that's basically it hope
that helps somebody out there save some
money you have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
