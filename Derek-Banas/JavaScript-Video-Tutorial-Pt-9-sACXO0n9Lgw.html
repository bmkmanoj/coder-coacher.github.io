of my JavaScript video tutorial today is
all about cookies I'm going to show you
how to create cookies how to delete
cookies how to get cookies how to do
pretty much anything with a cookie on
the right side of your screen you see
exactly what we're going to create so
let's go and just type in some things
inside here and there I just actually
created two cookies and if this is
actually recreated or reloaded you'll
see that those two cookies are indeed
stored on the machine and if I
specifically asked for a cookie you're
going to see it pops up here on the
screen with the name of the cookie
followed by the value of the cookie and
I can even come in here and delete said
cookie just by clicking in delete and
typing in a cookie that I would like to
delete and then if you reload it you can
see that that cookie no longer has a
value and whenever the browser is closed
and reopened there will not be a cookie
there so now we got to get to actually
making all this stuff first thing I'm
going to do is come over here and this
is just the basic layout that I always
use and all my other tutorials for
JavaScript and just understand these are
the basics of cookies cookies are used
to store information on the clients hard
drive so that would be people that come
to your website you can only access the
information you stored on the clients
machine so for example you wouldn't be
able to go on and get any cookies that
Google would store on somebody's
computer and basically cookies contain a
name value an expiration date and also
the directory that can access the cookie
that means from your website as well as
all of the domains that can access the
cookie so for example I'm just going to
type this out so for first name would be
laid out just like this then you would
define when it would expire and then the
path that can access it if I type it in
this that means every directory within
the website will be able to access said
cookie and then domain you would define
what domains can access said cookie and
whenever I put a period in here that
means every sub domain of my website
would be able to access the cookie so
let's just create some cookies okay so
I'm going to type in paragraph tag and
I'm going to say enter your first name
and this is just a basic text box and I
have to define an ID so that I'll be
able to access it
and then all of these things are going
to be triggered through a non blur event
which is triggered whenever somebody
leaves the textbox with their mouths and
I'm going to pass it first name and then
close off the paragraph tag and I'm
actually going to copy this and make
three copies of it on the screen because
all these guys are quite similar change
this the last name change this the last
name last name that's all you need to do
inside of here and then we're going to
come over here cookie to delete given an
ID I'm going to call a different
function called delete cookie and I
don't need to pass any property over to
it cookie to get or to display on the
screen and this is just going to be
getting me get a cookie and I don't need
to pass anything in that situation and
then down here I'm going to put in some
JavaScript it's going to print out every
single cookie to screen there's a link
to all this code in the underbar right
like that that's all the HTML that goes
into creating this guy so now I got to
create one two three functions and this
is real simple this is also to a certain
extent going to be a review again of how
to use the document object model inside
a JavaScript a cookie and it's going to
receive the ID for the textbox over here
then I got to create a couple variables
get element by ID we're going to jump
over to whatever is stored cookie to get
cookie to get right here see the ID name
is getting me so I'm going to take the
value out of there and store it in this
new variable that I just created then
I'm going to call the split function
that is going to split all the cookies
and puts them inside of an array based
off of wherever a semicolon is say
there's a semicolon so I'm going to
split all these guys up stick them in
our array that's what the split function
does and document cookie is a reference
to every single cookie that is currently
stored or that we store it on the
clients browser and cookie data is just
going to be empty string so now what we
have to do is cycle through all the
different cookies with a for statement
and I'm going to cycle through these
guys depending upon the length of the
array and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to specifically search for the
value that was placed in this textbox
that I grabbed from up inside of here
and see if it is contained within the
line that has all the cookie information
in it I'm going to say I'm going to go
to this array and I'm going to call the
index of function cookie name and if it
doesn't match meaning like if we were
searching for the last
if lastname is not in this information
it's going to give me a value of
negative one it's going to pass that
back that's what index of does if it
does not find the location that I'm
looking for or the name that I'm looking
for within this string that's stored
inside of this array whatever this is
going to occur whenever a match is found
except I'm going to call the replace
function because there's actually
whitespace right inside of here that you
can't see and I'm going to get rid of
that extra whitespace so that doesn't
mess up anything here on my screen so
I'm just going to say if there is any
whitespace delete it and then I'm going
to say that I want to pull the actual
value out of it so I'm going to match a
substring starting after the end of the
variable that I'm searching for so I'm
asking how long is this variable and
then I'm going to take the substring
that follows after that so if I was
looking for last name I'd be asking for
the index that starts right here with
the letter B so that's what I'm doing
with asking what the length of that is
and then I'm going to add one to it so
that I don't get the equal sign and then
what this does is it just opens up an
alert box and in that alert box it'll
contain both the variable name as well
as the value stored in said cookie and
I'm just going to close off all these
guys and close off the function itself
so this function right here get a cookie
I type in last name you can see it pops
up on the screen with last name which is
the variable name and the value stored
there in that's what that function does
for me so now what I have to do is
actually create the function that
creates all the cookies just based off
of me passing a variable name create
cookie in here I'm going to create a new
date and whenever you create this it
automatically assigns today's date to
exp date and let's say that I want to
call a set month function and have this
expire this cookie expire in one month
call the gate month function and just
add one to it and then I'm going to
figure out what value I want to store
and said cookie so what do I do I
retrieve the cookie value from the node
that was passed to this function and
then I have to actually create the
cookie this is how you do it all in one
line new cookie is going to be the
variable
aim for said cookie you have to always
make sure you keep your spacing perfect
when you're creating these things cookie
value is going to be the value you want
to assign to that variable and then I'm
assigning that I want every directory to
be able to access that cookie close that
off and then you have to call to GMT
string so that it's in the right format
right like that that creates your cookie
with a variable name a value the path
and also the date if you do not assign
an a domain name it will automatically
use whatever your domain is that's why I
didn't put that in there there's some
other little things that you could add
onto this cookie but I don't use them
because they're supposedly for security
reasons but as I said before an
intercepting proxy can completely break
any security that you set up with
JavaScript so I don't really worry about
my security inside of JavaScript I only
worry about that with PHP so I have to
create one more function and it's going
to delete cookies cookie to delete
I'm just going to get whatever they put
in the text box called delete me I'm
going to ask for its value right like
that and here I'm going to show you
another way to create or delete cookies
you can also call the create cookie
function and this is the name of the
cookie this is whatever they pass to me
it's going to be whatever was in this
text box it's going to get passed over
here and delete that cookie I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to give it no
value which is going to have an
immediate effect and then I'm going to
have its expiration day be one day in
the past that will effectively delete
said cookie you could also use this to
create all your cookie stuff but I
wanted to show you multiple different
ways to do that and that's all let's do
it that's how to create delete and get
cookies and if I come in here type in
Sally for example reload this you can
see that Sally now shows up there
Simpson reload app you can see that
Simpson automatically shows up inside of
there and if I type in first-name you
can see first name Sally pops up on the
screen so there is a ton of different
ways to use cookies up next because of
immense demand I'm going to start
showing you how to build interfaces
using javascript and CSS til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
