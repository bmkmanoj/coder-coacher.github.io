tutorial on how to set up Eclipse
install Java setup code completion and
install Java libraries you guys have
asked for how to do this exactly on a
Windows computer and today I'm going to
show you how to do it now the very first
thing you're going to want to do is open
up your browser and type in Java JDK
you're going to need that and then
you're going to come down here which
says Java SE development kits seven and
you're going to click on it and then
you're gonna see all this stuff you want
to scroll away down here and we can just
click on accept license and that's great
and then you're gonna see windows 64
right here and you're going to come over
and you're going to click on it and
download it because Eclipse needs the
Java JDK then at the bottom of your
screen you're gonna have to give it
authorization to download this of course
you want to do it or just click on run
and then you have to give it permission
of course and then it will install and
you just have to hit next to a bunch of
times it's up to you whether you get the
demos and samples and all that stuff I'm
just gonna leave it the way it is and
you can see right here exactly where
it's going to install Program Files java
jdk 1.7 click Next and it's gonna take a
couple minutes to install everything
here it's pretty quick and snappy though
then just click Next
that's all you're gonna do click Next
over and over again and it's going to
say it's been successfully installed
which is great click finish and you
don't not need to register anything so
don't worry about that now I'm just
going to bounce over here make sure it's
all set up and here it is Program Files
and you can see here Java and you can
see here Java JDK then I'm gonna come
over and click on start and I'm just
doing a couple extra things click on all
programs and accessories over here and
then I'm going to open up the command
prompt and then inside of the command
prompt I'm just going to type in Java
dash version and you can see Java
version 1.7 is installed so that's good
okay so we have that all set up now
let's go get eclipse okay so I use
Eclipse indigo just because I'm used to
using it the newest versions called Juno
so if you want indigo go and get this by
just typing in Eclipse indigo it's a
little less buggy for some python things
I do so I just use it that way then
is going to click on Eclipse IDE for
Java developers and then over here
windows 64-bit and then I'm going to
download it and just open it and there's
eclipse it's double clicked on it and
then I'm just going to double click on
Eclipse here and whenever you double
click on eclipse you're gonna see this
click on extract all and then just it
yeah that's fine extract okay and after
that's done extracting this folder is
going to open up you're going to double
click on it and you were going to then
click on eclipse which is right here and
run it here you are you almost done this
is going to pop up this is going to be
your workspace where you're going to
store all of your code so if you ever
need to find it it's in users whatever
your username is and workspace click OK
then you're going to see this screen
just click over here where it says go to
workbench and here is everything package
Explorer is going to hold all of the
files that you create one thing you're
not seeing here on the screen you can
look over here see there's Java that's
where you're going to be able to add all
your other different plugins for
different languages you can click on
window show view maybe you want to see
the console click on console consoles
down here I often in my tutorials put
the console over here so now my console
is over here now to set up eclipse just
to make sure everything's all set up
we're gonna go in here and click on
window and then we're going to look for
preferences which is right here and then
I'm going to just zoom in here I'm going
to click on Java I'm going to open that
up and I'm going to click on compiler
and then over here you want to
definitely check compiler compliance
level and we have it set for 1.7 this is
where you can change the different other
versions if you'd like and we can click
on install GREs right here and here
you're gonna see that it yes it
automatically found your version of Java
so everything should be working great
these are all things you want to check
if it was not there what you'd have to
do is click on add standard virtual
machine click on next and then you'd
have to find the location of Java but
you already know that it is working so
we're not going to do that so that's
what you're going to do if nothing is
showing up here but like you just saw it
should all work now if you want to set
up code completion again you're going to
go into Windows and preferences just
like before and then you're going to see
this and then you're going to click on
compiler right there and make
sure your compliance level is set to 1.7
which it is and code completion should
be working as well okay so now that we
have that set up I'm going to show you
how to install Java libraries and then
we can test to make sure everything's
working now this time I'm going to
install the Apache Commons library which
is very common to use and it's just at
Commons dot Apache dot org /l ang for
language and another forward slash and
you're going to see this guy right here
you're going to scroll down here which
says release information click download
3.1 and this stuff's going to pop up and
you're gonna look for Commons lang and
you're going to unzip this guy and I'm
just going to click on open
there is your library and I'm actually
going to copy it and I'm going to go to
My Documents folder inside of here and
I'm going to paste it inside of there so
that I know where it's located and you
can see it's going to paste everything
inside of there that's just in case you
accidentally delete it and there you can
see it's installed inside of there now
we're gonna set it up to work inside of
Eclipse so open eclipse back up again
then we're going to do in package
explorer is click with the right mouse
button new Java project and just give it
a name sample Java whatever click Next
and then click on finish that'll works
then we're going to come into this
project we clicked on we're going to
right click it and we're gonna go new
we're gonna create a new folder right
like that click on it and then the
folder name for this I'm just gonna call
it Li B and then click finish down here
just come over here where we have sample
Java and right click on that and we're
going to come on down here we're gonna
click on import and then you're going to
click on general and then file system
and then click on next and then you have
to find the directory where you saved
everything that was in my documents and
there's my name and there is my
documents and there is the library that
we actually want to use and we're just
going to click on OK and then we're just
gonna select all of these guys and hit
finish there you go now everything is
stored inside the library folder right
there and it's all ready to use ok now
if I want to test everything to see if
it's installed what I'm gonna do is go
to this package sample Java and then I'm
going to click on source and I'm going
to come over here right click on it go
new and I can go class click on that and
then let's say I just want to call this
sample I'm gonna click finish see where
it is it's inside of source default
package sample that's where it's
supposed to be and then inside of this
guy if I just want to test some stuff
just go public static void main string
args C code completions working and then
I could just do a simple hello world and
if I want to execute the guy just come
up here hit on that button right there
and a low world prints out over in my
console so when everything's set up and
that is how you set up Eclipse and Java
and code completion and a whole bunch of
other different things so please leave
your questions or comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
