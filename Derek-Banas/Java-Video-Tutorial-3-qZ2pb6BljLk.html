3 of my java video tutorial series today
we're going to talk a lot about
relational operators logical operators
and the switch statement among other
things so let's just jump right into it
alright so we're just going to create
public which means it can be used by any
other class class which means it's a
blueprint that we're going to use for
our program and eventually here I will
get into object-oriented programming so
all this makes a lot more sense I'm
going to put our brackets inside of
there of course like we've done before
public static which means that only a
class can call this boy means that this
guy does not return anything after it's
done and then string two brackets and
args just like we've done before which
means that the main function which is
the guy that executes inside of this
program receives string objects maybe or
at least it needs that option and as I
go through this I'm going to go over
some of the things that I've done before
in the past and hopefully after
repeating a lot of this stuff you guys
will get it which I'm sure you will okay
so I'm creating a random number I'm
going to make sure that it is an integer
I'm going to call the math function
random and I'm going to say I want a
number between 0 and 49 remember it
doesn't go to 50 almost but not quite
the first I'm going to talk about
relational operators and here are all of
Java's relational operators there's
greater than less than equal to not
equal to greater than or equal to or
less than or equal to so that's all of
them then we're going to get into the if
statement you saw that a little bit in
the last tutorial if you haven't seen
any other previous tutorials definitely
check those out otherwise you may be
confused by this alright so we're gonna
go random number and if we want to check
if it's less than 25 we just do that ok
it's real simple sure you guys got that
and we might want to print out a message
on the screen if that is indeed true of
course it's a random number so we have
no idea what that number is and we'll
say something like the random number is
less than 5 put that out on the screen
if that condition is true and we can
check to see if it is actually before we
do that why don't we just print out the
random number underneath of this guy so
just go system.out.print lines you want
to see it the random
number is put a space inside of there
Plus and then random number bracket
semicolon let's execute this guy and see
what we got and I've also decided that
nice tutorials when I make a mistake I'm
going to point it out so I typed in Java
lesson 3 dot Java as the name of this
and then I typed in lesson 3 like a
bonehead so I'm going to type in Java
lesson 3 and I'm going to file save it
and now we can execute it make sure that
you always have this class name the same
as the file name that you give it and
you can see here the random number is
less than 25 and the random number is 13
so that checked out real good well then
we can come in here and do something
like an else if and perform an
additional check so we could say
something like random number is greater
than 40 for example then come down here
inside of these brackets and I just
copied that system.out.print line
statement the random number is greater
than 40 and then we can check it and see
how it does all right so the random
number is less than 2 and the random
number is 18 ok so this tells us
something it says that whenever this
first if statement is called if this is
true it doesn't go down to the else if
part that's where the else comes in to
so that's just an essence saying if this
comes back true random number is less
than 25 which it does it's 18 then don't
perform any other additional checks ok
so that's what that is telling you right
there then we can also come in here do
another else if statement so we'll go
else if it is equal to 18 popped up
there let's just type 18 again the
random number is equal to 18 which we
know it's not going to be but what the
heck let's just try execute here the
number is less than 25 and the random
number is 1 ok so that's how we do an
equals check now if we want to do a not
equal to let me just go in here and say
not equal to 40 the random number is not
equal to 40 and I promised these
tutorials we need a lot more interesting
actually the next one's going to be a
lot more interesting form additional
checks room number is 39 we almost got
40 and you can see here the random
number is not equal to 40 and the random
number is 39 and then we can of course
perform additional checks like greater
than or equal to which we would just
come in here and say something like else
if is it greater than or
equal to 40 or we come in here and say
is it less than or equal to and I'm not
going to bore you by going through that
all the codes through this with a lot
more comments is available underneath of
this video if you want to check that out
and then you could say something like
else if nothing above is true and you
can perform some additional statements
or execute additional statements so
let's just say nothing worked this is
like a default which we're going to see
here later on whenever we talk about
this switch statement and we can execute
this one last time just see how it goes
yep the random one was thirty-five
nothing worked okay so there you see
there's the else statement coming into
play as the default if none of these
other things come back true all right so
let's keep going here and here you can
see with my multi-line comment I made
here there are logical operators also
available to you inside of Java and
there are six of those and you have the
knot which is basically going to turn
any true into a false so if we would put
else if random number is less than or
equal to eighteen and let's say that the
value was fifteen well this would come
back true however if we would put this
guy right there that's going to come
back as a false it basically just turns
whatever it is to the right of it into
the opposite remember we're dealing with
faux Lian's and the only potential
values are true or false so it's
currents trues and falses and falses in
the throughs instead of just speaking
all this out why don't I just show you
what I'm talking about if we come in
here it's always good to put everything
inside of brackets let's just say if
false so false is the value I just put
that in there just like if zip I was
performing a check and false came back
and then we can do something like
through a print statement I turned false
into true and that's in essence what
that guy does and I get a lot of
questions about how to use escape
sequences so let's say I wanted to throw
a newline into here I'm just going to
put a backslash and an N and we can see
exactly what that does I turn false
integer see there's a newline inside of
there and this printed out because
that's exactly what I did if I would
have put a true inside here that would
have turned this whole statement into
false and this wouldn't have printed out
on the screen at all leave any questions
or comments below for missing out on
anything but I'm sure you guys are
getting it all right so let's use some
of these other logical operators let's
say we want to go if
and again just put in false instead what
these are our conditional statements
that we showed up here so random number
less than 25 if this was 20 for example
this would come back true what I'm doing
down here is just throwing in false or
any of those other different things as
boolean values just so I can show you
exactly what these guys do okay so we're
going to say our check came back false
and we're going to put the two and
symbols inside of there the other one
came back true all right so what happens
if that occurs with the and logical
operator well and we'll only execute the
code inside of here if both of these
guys are true so we're just going to say
both are true like that and we know that
they both are not true throw these
quotes in you're in the right place okay
good and if we execute it you're going
to see that that does not come up serial
number is 45 lat shows up on the screen
however if we do change both of these
into true and execute it both are true
comes back and let's come in here and
just get rid of this it doesn't cloud up
what we're working on okay so that's
what the end does it evaluates to true
for both of these guys and execute this
code right here if both of these values
are true if one of them is false it
doesn't allow that to occur well then
you have also the and function what this
guy does is even if this would come back
as false the normal double and would say
well this one's false so that means
under any circumstances this is going to
return a false well this and if you use
just one and it's going to still check
to see if this has a value of true or
not even though it's totally irrelevant
and it doesn't matter you will almost
never use this but it is available to
you so that's why I bring it up well
then you can also use the or statement
and there it is and what it's going to
do is it's going to print out this code
right here if either of these are true
or if both of them are true one is true
I can print that out and I know that
that's going to evaluate properly and as
you can see one is true shows up now if
we also change this to true and execute
it's still going to come back as one is
true even though they both are true well
then you have the XOR statement what it
does is it evaluates to a true statement
only if one is true and one is false and
there it is right there
and if we execute this guy it's not
going to print anything on screen
because you have two trues there as you
can see nothing print it out however if
we come in here and put one false
statement in it will indeed execute that
line of code as you can see it did right
there
now let's come in here and just get rid
of all this stuff again the code is
underneath this video if you want to go
get it there's a link to it let's just
come in here and delete all that just so
we have a nice clean workspace we can
play around with because now I'm going
to go over the conditional or the
ternary operator and basically what it
does is it assigns one or another value
based off of a condition so I'm going to
come in here and say biggest value
creating a new variable name Vegas value
I'm going to use the ternary operator to
evaluate what the value of biggest value
is based off of a condition the
condition is going to be I'm going to
create two additional integers it's
going to be value one is equal to and
just keep this simple I'm just going to
put it in here like this create another
one value 2 is equal to 2 right like
that then what I'm going to say is I'm
going to put a condition inside of this
I'm going to say the biggest value is
going to be assigned whichever one of
these is the biggest so I'm going to say
if value 1 is greater than value 2 which
is up above then you put a little
question mark inside of here value 1
colon value and this is real simple
don't let this mess you up basically
what it's saying is if value 1 is
greater than value 2 if this comes back
is true I want you to assign the value
of value 1 to the biggest value if this
condition right here is not true I want
the biggest value to have the value of
value 2 that's all it's saying right
there and here I can type that out
biggest value and it prints out the
value of the biggest value of the
variable and you can see here that it
prints out 2 so that is how you do that
and this is actually a very useful thing
as we progress through this tutorial
series I'm going to show you a whole
bunch of different things you can do
with it and then finally we have the
switch statement and let's come in here
and just get rid of this all together
again and you mainly use the switch
statement whenever you have a limited
number of possible values that what
you're checking for is going to have so
let's say we create a character and
let's call it the grade and let's just
give it a value of B in this situation
that works and let's get rid of switch
here
case we created a new new character and
we gave it a value of B now we're going
to type in switch and then we're going
to put inside here what we want to check
so we want to check if the value of the
grade is equal to what we're going to
check for below and you're going to put
in your curly braces then you're going
to say case log grade which is right
here is equal to a then I want to
perform all of the statements that
follow so and my statements just going
to be system.out.print line and just say
great job in this situation and then you
can if you want to type in break and it
will stop checking from that point on
however if you want to continue checking
for all these things underneath get rid
of the break statement basically what
the break statement does is it says stop
using the switch statement and jump down
underneath of it okay so that's
basically what that's doing now we can
check for all the other different
potential grades that are out there and
we could say B C D F and we could say
good okay bad you failed
it's not meant to be kind and then if we
only have a potential for this to be an
a B C D or an F what this guy should be
is actually default which means this is
what's going to print out on the screen
by default or if they entered the wrong
character and if we execute this you can
see what happens remember we gave it a
value of B and good job shows up because
good job is defined to show up right
there however what would happen if I put
in a lowercase B I mean you know that's
okay
you would think until I come in here and
then I run this and then it prints out
you failed why did it do that because we
have this set as a default what would
happen if you wanted to catch for that
situation you want to check for
multiples I'll just put it inside of
there right like that and that would
allow you to catch in the situation when
it's a lower case or an upper case B and
you can see that it shows up right there
you can do all kinds of other different
things with the switch statement as we
go through the tutorial I'm going to
show you a whole bunch of really cool
things but basically you do not need to
use default you do not need to use break
completely up to you how you want to use
it leave any questions or comments below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
