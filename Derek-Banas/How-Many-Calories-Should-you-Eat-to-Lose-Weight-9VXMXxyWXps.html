the diet nutritional plan today I'm
gonna show you exactly how many calories
your body needs based off of your frame
size and how much weight you want to
lose what frame size do you have what
you need to do very a non-invasive way
to measure frame size is to actually
measure two points that are on your
elbow what you want to do first is take
your arm and project it in front of you
bend your palm towards your body with
your hands sticking straight up in the
air now take your arm and lay it down in
front of you again with your palm in
front of you and you're gonna see the
point of your elbow right behind there
are two bones that protrude what you
want to do simply is measure the
distance between those two protrusions
on the back of your arms towards your
bicep away from your elbow and if you
measure that distance if you are a man
and your height is between five foot two
to five foot three inches you're going
if you have a medium frame size the
measurement you're gonna get is gonna
lie somewhere between two inches and a
half to two and seven-eighths an inch
this is for a medium frame and you can
see everything else here this is
pertaining to men's specifically what is
on the screen in front of you and these
are the measurements for a woman
obviously you can hit pause here and
take a look at these numbers again these
are the medium frame measurements for
the different heights if your
measurements are smaller than those on
the previous chart you have a small belt
if they are larger than the numbers on
the previous charts you have a large
belt and that is basically as simple as
it is now we're going to go to the
specifics on weights based off of
insurance tables that I have found to be
very very reliable these are the charts
that they use to decide how much to
charge you per month for her life
insurance
now you can see here these are ideal
weights for women when I'm not making
any judgment calls here is purely
informational if you have a small frame
or medium frame or a large frame based
off of your previous measurements and
you are four foot ten you can see here
specifically the type of the weight area
that the underwriting people at the
insurance companies say you should weigh
to be healthy on the next frame you're
gonna see additional heights as well as
weights or women all the way up to six
foot tall now go on to the requirements
and again this is for women if your
height is between is four foot ten for
example your required calories to
maintain your current weight
obviously if you're trying to lose
weight you're not going to want to
consume this many calories would be
between 1260 and 1420 depending upon
frame size so if you have a small frame
you would be in the low end to give a
large frame you'd be at the high end now
if you wanted to maximize losing weight
you would aim if your foot foot 10
inches for 670 calories and this is a
minimum number why it is very important
that you do not go below that number is
your if you do your body will go into
what is called starvation my starvation
mode is not only unhealthy but also will
completely destroy your diet being
unhealthy is probably the most important
thing that this is are the statistics
for men so example if you're four five
foot two and you have a small medium or
large frame these are the recommended
weights that you should aim for
and here are additional numbers with
increasing heights up to six foot four
inches for men and these are the
required calories again for the
different heights and the minimum of
calorie is that you should aim for again
to keep yourself from going into
starvation mode and this is again the
calculations for men me as an example
I'm six foot three my elbow measurement
is three inches and 3 and 1/4 inches
so obviously I'm in a large frame size I
require about two thousand three hundred
and thirty calories to maintain my
currently but since I want to lose
weight I would want to aim somewhere in
there twelve hundred and eighty two
calories per day if I was going to
maximize my weight loss I actually don't
really aim at that number I am at around
1413 fifty but the whole idea with this
diet is to not really necessarily worry
about minimizing your overall calories
obviously you want to do that but I'm
going to be loading you up with so much
food that is healthy I if I no means
want you to ever feel hungry again you
never want to consume less than fifty
five percent of your total required
calories your body will go into
starvation mode at that point you are
not only going to be eating in a healthy
manner again but you'll stop losing
weight and like I said it's okay to
consume 55 60 or whatever feels
comfortable to you definitely at the
beginning of the diet in the next video
I'm gonna show you the best foods many
people have said they're going to show
this abyss on YouTube I'm going to do it
I'm going to show you 50 of the best
foods foods that will make you feel full
foods that have a highest amount of
fiber per calorie highest amount of
protein per calorie and many more lists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
