5 of my Java video tutorial series today
I'm going to talk a lot about methods
and a lot about a couple other things as
well when this tutorial we're going to
need to import our Java scanner class
that's going to provide us access to a
bunch of different methods later on the
tutorial and I'll leave that alone for
now so of course we want to define it
outside of the actual class definition
for this actual program then we're going
to go public class and then the name of
this is Java lesson 5 just like we did
before if you didn't see the previous
tutorials definitely check those out and
this won't be confusing to you and then
what I'm going to do is define exactly
what a class variable is a class
variable starts off with static just
like we have before which basically
means it's accessible from other classes
and it's going to be accessible to other
functions within this program that we're
creating here and then because I seem to
have a fixation on PI I'm going to go my
PI is equal to three point one so this
is what we call a class variable like I
said it's accessible anywhere within
this class that's great then what I'm
going to do is public static void main
I'm going to create my main function
leave any questions or comments below if
anything at any point in time doesn't
make sense to you and then whenever
you're defining a method or a function
same thing it's all just a change in
name what you have to do first is to
find your access modifier and then
static is going to be used whenever you
want to be able to execute a method that
isn't part of a class definition so this
is very very important if you ever want
to create a method that's not going to
be part of a class like this variable up
here is you have to use static inside of
here and then you're going to put in
your return type which is just whatever
value you plan this method to return and
if you don't plan on returning anything
you would put void in there instead just
like we did here with main so that's
what that is
and then of course you're going to have
your method name which of course you
know it needs a name and then inside of
little brackets you're going to have
either parameters or arguments whatever
you want to call them and these are just
values that you want to pass to your
method so that it can do things with
numbers and be useful so
I'm going to jump down here I'm going to
make one right now and it's going to be
public this is outside of Maine and I
could define it up here if I wanted to
before Maine or after Maine either way
it doesn't matter it's not going to
change anything public static it's going
to return an integer and I'm going to
call this add them this is going to be
real simple then inside of here you have
to define the parameters or arguments
inside of it I'm just going to call it
int a and int B and yes you have to put
the int part in here otherwise it's not
going to know what it is now let's say I
want to go double small pi is equal to
3.14 oh right like that this is what we
would call a local variable meaning it
is local and only accessible inside of
the method named add them it's not
accessible anywhere else I could pass
the value out of this guy but I can't
actually access this anywhere else since
it's defined inside of this function so
that's a local variable hence there's a
difference between a class variable
which is accessible everywhere now I
actually could get the static mypie this
or this variable up here this class
variable and let me show you how I would
do that so let's just come in here and
say
system.out.print line and I'm totally
doing this out of my head here just
playing around so here's my PI up here
now I could print it out I'd say global
my PI all right so we can print that out
and of course I'm going to have to call
this function however and I'm just going
to throw some junk variables in here I'm
go add them and I'm just going to go one
comma two even though this technically
isn't really going to do anything with
this that's what I'm going to do with
this and then down here because this
returns a value of int I'm just going to
give it a junk value of return one then
I'm going to run it and you see whenever
I run it it's going to print out global
3.14159 right there
however what would happen if I would
come in here and create a new and let's
let's let's even make it be a double
let's say double my pi is equal to 3.0
so I went and created a variable inside
of add them this method and I'm going to
just execute this in exactly the same
way all I did was assign this new value
what's going to happen what do you think
it's going to overwrite it and it's
going to print out 3.1 like you see
right there so basically that's the real
thing you have to under
stand with methods is you can use the
class variables anywhere however you can
also overwrite their values but see I
change my PI to 3.0 what you have to
understand is that's not going to change
anything because and this actually is
going to be local in this situation so
there's local I'm going to copy this and
then after I make that suppose it change
I'm going to change this to global and
you're going to see what exactly happens
here which is nothing so it's going to
come in here call add them print this
it's going to prove three point one and
then right underneath of it it's going
to come down here to this second line or
you would think my PI would have changed
however it did not it remains the value
that it has right here however if you
would actually want to change that value
you could just come in here and I'm
going to make this real short I'm going
to go to my PI plus three and I'm also
going to have to get rid of the double
right there now let's execute this again
and you're going to see that they have
the same values there you are
so hopefully I explains the difference
between class variables and local
variables and how they interact inside
of methods so anyway I'm going to get
back to what I was doing here originally
so I'm going to come in here I'm going
to get rid of this and we're gonna work
with this just like it was a regular
function that's going to add two numbers
so in this situation I'm gonna get rid
of this as well just playing around here
okay so here is add them this is the
call to this method which is right here
see here's add them and then what it
does because this int is right here it's
going to return an integer which here
it's print not one but that's not very
useful and here it's going to be
retrieving two values and assigning them
to the variables named a and B and these
are the values that are going to assign
to a and B right here so let's do
something kind of useful let's come in
here and we're going to copy this and
we're going to print that up there and
it close this off so it's going to
return the value or the addition of one
plus two and it's going to print it off
the screen all in one little swipe so
I'm going to do is come in here and go
int C is equal to we'll go a plus B and
we'll return this integer which is right
here that value just to see exactly how
a very very very simple method works you
can see three popped up right here and
now I'm going to just get rid of this
all together this method we create a
here took so much time and what I'm
going to do now is try to demonstrate
how Java uses pass by value so whenever
you're passing values now I see here 1 &amp;amp;
2 it's quite simple to understand that
it's essential that you grasp the
concept of how information is passed so
let's create a new integer and let's
call it D is equal to 5 and then we'll
call and this would be a variable that
would be local to the main function then
we're going to create a new function and
it's going to be pretty much the same
sort of thing public static so if this
guy's not going to return a value so I'm
going to put a void in there and call it
try to change and I'm going to say that
I'm expecting an integer and I'm gonna
give it the same name D as we gave this
guy right here
so let's come in here like that and then
what we're going to do inside here is go
D is equal to D plus 1 and then I'm
going to go system dot out dot print
line and I'm going to say try to this is
going to be the try to change version of
D is going to be equal to that I'm going
to go plus D and don't let this confuse
you this is going to be the secret right
here see where it hasn't I'm declaring a
new version of D okay so that's what
people get caught up on pay attention to
that see I created anytime you do this
in to D and you already have an int D
here you're going to be declaring a
brand new value so don't let that
confuse you and also understand the fact
that this value of D is not going to be
equal to this guy right here because
they are in separate methods okay it's
very very important to understand that
concept they are in separate method so
in this situation try to change and
we're going to pass it the value of D
see that's how you call a method that's
going to run that guy for you and then
underneath of it I'm going to prune out
kind of the same sort of thing this is
going to be not try to change but this
is going to be the main D and if we
execute that you're going to see how
those change try to change c6 up here
well that's because we added one to it
inside of the try to change function
which was called right here however the
original value of D did not change
because this right here this D inside of
here is exactly the same as if we would
put 5 inside of there it's passing the
value of D not
the variable D okay so hopefully that
makes sense if it doesn't leave a
question below so that's another basic
concept you have to understand about
what's weird about methods inside of
Java and I'm gonna get rid of this again
I'll just get rid of these things and
try to keep everything organized and all
in one page so that's easier to follow
up and then what we're gonna do and I
can get rid of this too actually let's
make our life easy I'm going to create
ourselves a new class variable and this
guy is going to be called random number
and it's going to be an integer and it's
still class variable it means it's
accessible everywhere and then on top of
that I'm going to create static scanner
which we use previously to get user
input and you can call this user input
and call it whatever you want it's just
a name that I picked new scanner we're
going to get into object-oriented
programming your very recent so you
won't have to just ignore whenever I say
this is an object blah blah blah blah
blah you actually understand what it is
but don't worry about it right now it's
not important and then we're going to
come down inside of main where all of
our stuff is going to be executed and
I'm going to print out a message on the
screen this sort of shows why using
methods is useful and let's go print
line and we say get random num and this
is a call to a function called get
random num and you're saying what is
that because it doesn't exist so I'm
going to create it and this guy is going
to return an int and of course get
random no and it's not going to receive
any parameters or attributes or any
values being sent to it what it's going
to do is create a random number between
0 and 50 and then since random number up
here is a class variable we can pay
reference to it without declaring it
because it's already been declared and
we're going to go int cast this to an
integer I'm going to call math.random
and we're going to multiply it times 51
so that it's going to return a value
between 0 and 50 okay so that's what
that's doing that's from previous
tutorial and then what this guy's gonna
do is it's gonna return random number
okay it's gonna return this value right
here and it's an integer because this is
an integer and that's basically what
this guy does it just returns a random
number whenever it's called
which way is right there that's what
that little function does for me and
then while I'm at it I'm going to come
in here and actually create another one
and all the code from this whole video
is Val wander Neath the
and it's heavily commented so should I
answer a lot of questions that might
come up as you're doing it we're going
to create another function of lick and
Static and it's going to return an int
and it's going to check whether the
guests they provided is right or not
we're going to go if gue SS which is
passed to this guy is equal to the class
variable called random number we're
going to do some stuff and the stuff
we're going to do is we are going to
return negative 1 as a value and
negative 1 is an integer else we're
going to return the value of guess which
isn't really going to matter and now
that we have these functions defined
let's go in and actually start using
them okay so get random number what it's
going to do is it's going to both create
a random number which I'm doing here and
it's also going to return that random
number and this guy by calling this it's
going to print out the random number to
the screen and I'm basically doing that
just to make my life a little bit easier
then I'm going to create another integer
and it's going to be guessed result I'm
going to give it a value of 1 and then
I'm going to create random guess I'm
going to give it a value of 0 it doesn't
really matter what those values are then
what I'm going to do is create a while
loop guess result while guessed result
and make sure this is uppercase like it
was before is not equal to negative 1 I
want to do things and the things I want
to do is print the screen
system.out.print and I'm just going to
say guess a number between 0 and 50 I
like that because they used print
instead of printing it snot going to
skip to the newline it's not going to
issue a new line then I'm going to go
here go random guess and I'm gonna sign
it whatever the user typed in and it's a
integer so I'm going to go next and just
in previous tutorials then I'm going to
go guess result is going to be equal to
and I'm going to call the function check
guess and I'm going to pass it the value
of random guess then my while loop is
going to end and my while loop is going
to end whenever guest result is equal to
negative 1 and guest result is going to
have a value of negative 1 when what
their guess is equal to the actual
random number that's a real simple thing
it's just allowing people to go in there
type in numbers and try to guess
whatever the random number generator was
so if they leave the for loop that means
the random number was guessed and I'm
extremely simplifying this we're going
to get into much more complicated things
later but I know if they leave the
for-loop they guess the random number or
an error was triggered but either way
I'm going to guess that they did the
right thing yes the random number is
space you're going to see what this is I
know random guess is equal to that
random numbers I'm going to print out
the screen and whenever we run this guy
you'll see how it works here
I printed out the random number so it's
easy for me to actually guess it and I'm
going to type it 4 it's going to say no
that's not right now I'm gonna type in
89 even though it's wrong and then
whenever I actually type in 5 which is
the random number is going to say yes
the random number is 5 there's a whole
bunch of different things about methods
and local variables class variables and
a whole bunch of other different things
leave any questions or comments below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
