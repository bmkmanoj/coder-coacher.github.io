5 of my SQL statements tutorial you all
asked for it and here it is actually not
but today we're going to talk about
atomic data normalized data and primary
and foreign keys very exciting first off
as your database increases in size
you're going to want everything to be
organized so that it can perform your
queries quickly if your tables are set
up properly your database will be able
to crank through hundreds of thousands
of bits of data in seconds well how do
you know how to best set up your tables
up these are the rules of atomic data
every table should focus on describing
just one thing for example customer
table would have a name age location
contact information it shouldn't contain
lists of anything such as interest job
history past addresses products
purchased etc after you decide what one
thing your table will describe then
decide what things you need to describe
that thing refer to the customer example
given in the last step write out all the
ways to describe the thing and if any of
those things requires model inputs pull
those out and create a new table for
them for example a list of past
employers should have its own table once
your table values have been broken down
we refer to these values as being atomic
be careful not to break them down to a
point though in which the data is harder
to work with it might make sense to
create a different variable for the
house number street name apartment
number etc but by doing so you may make
yourself more work that decisions up to
you now I'm going to look at how
complicated your statements could be if
you make your information to atomic so
for example to pull in the house number
street name apartment number from your
customers table you would have to list
every single one of those things out if
you made the table to atomic versus just
having a whole entire street address in
one variable additional atomic data
rules include don't have multiple
columns with the same sort of
information example if you wanted to
include an employment history you
shouldn't create a column name job 1
than job 2 then job 3 make a new table
with that data instead don't include
multiple values in one cell for example
you shouldn't create a cell name jobs
and then give it the value McDonald's
RadioShack and long now I'm gonna go
through normalize tables by making your
tables atomic you're close to making
them what is called normalized
normalized just means that the database
is organized in a way that is considered
standardized by professional SQL
programmers so someone needs to work
with the tables they'll be able to
understand how to easily another benefit
to normalizing your tables is that your
queries will run much quicker and the
chance your database will be corrupted
will go down dramatically let's go
through some other roles of normalized
tables the tables and variables defined
in them must be atomic each row must
have a primary key defined like your
social security number identifies you
the primary key will identify your row
you also want to eliminate using the
same values repetitively in your columns
example you wouldn't want to call them
named at structures in which you hand
typed in their names each time you
instead should create an instructor
table and linked to its key also every
variable and a table should directly
relate to the primary key example you
should create tables for all of your
customers potential States cities ZIP
codes instead of including them in the
main customer table then you would link
them using foreign keys please note
though that many people think this last
rule is a bit of overkill and can be
ignored also no two columns should have
a relationship in which when one changes
another must also change in the same
table this is called a dependency note
this is another role that sometimes is
ignored so what the actor keys already
well like I said before if he is a
unique number that represents the rows
in your tables there are two types of
keys primary keys and foreign keys
primary keys uniquely identify a row or
record each primary key must be unique
to the row must be given a value when
the row is created and that value cannot
be null the original value can't be
changed it should be short it's probably
best to auto increment and the value of
the key by Auto increment I just mean if
the customer identification number that
precedes the new one
is the value to what our early permit
will do is automatically make the new
value three it adds one to whatever the
previous customer ID was so what are
foreign keys they're used to make
references to the primary key of another
table example if we have a customer and
a city table if the city table had a
column which listed the unique primary
key of all of the customers that primary
key listing in the city table would be
considered a foreign key the foreign key
can have a different name from the
primary key of course and the value of
the foreign key can have the value of
nor a foreign key doesn't have to be
unique and here is an example where I'm
defining a foreign key with the value of
name of foreign key followed by int
not know I have to specifically say that
it is a foreign key after the comma and
I'm going to reference whatever I name
my foreign key then I'm going to follow
that up with the statement references
and then a link back to the primary key
here is an example that'll make this a
little bit easier to understand when you
define a foreign key you start with the
name of the foreign key then define all
the attributes follow that with the
foreign key statement with the name of
the foreign key embraces and then
finally after the references statement
lists the name of the table the primary
key is located in and the primary keys
name in that table you can see here in
the diagram on the right exactly
whatever the foreign key is and how it
relates to the primary key well that's
the end of part five of my SQL
statements tutorial next up we're gonna
cover multiple tables one-to-one
relationships one-to-many relationships
many to many relationships joins and
unions then you will be an SQL guide the
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
