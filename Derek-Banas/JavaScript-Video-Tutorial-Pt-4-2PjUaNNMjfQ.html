of my JavaScript video tutorial today
I'm going to answer a lot of the
questions you guys have sent me in
regards to arrays and functions inside
of JavaScript especially when it comes
to functions JavaScript acts completely
different than any other language that I
know of so we're going to get a lot into
the differences so that you're well
aware of how it operates on the left
side of the screen here's just the basic
outlay that I always start with whenever
I'm doing these tutorials nothing really
fancy here and this is a script part
where I'm going to go through all the
different code and explain everything to
you didn't watch part 1 of this tutorial
whenever I completely covered quickly
the core version of JavaScript you
should definitely take a look at that
well if you want to create an array
inside of JavaScript and this is not
going to be a really basic basic basic
tutorial this is going to get into some
of the intricacies of dealing with
arrays and dealing with functions so for
example if I wanted to create a sample
array that was empty I would do it just
like this I'm going to call this sample
rate n followed with equals then new and
then array and let's say I wanted 10
spaces designated inside of this array I
always think it's easier to think of
arrays as one big giant box represented
by the name of the array full of in this
situation ten little boxes that you're
going to put values inside of them so
that's how you would create a basic
array with ten spaces inside of it all
of which are empty
you could also come in here and I'm
going to call this sample array and
create a new array and not designate how
many spaces you want inside of it and
then you could slowly populate this
array by first populating the first this
is called an index or first little box
inside of this new array always starts
with zero with anything because
javascript is untyped you can store any
type of information inside of this array
it does not matter so that's one way
it totally differs from other computer
programming languages and I'm going to
come in here good like that and I'm
going to put some additional things in
side of my array in box 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so let's
say I want to put 1 2 3 main and then to
enforce the fact that I can put any type
of data inside of here even an array
itself I'm going to throw a number
inside of here we briefly went over
before the for in looping structure and
what it is being used here for now is to
cycle through of all
values that I just created inside of my
sample array and here I'm going to print
those values out to the screen and I
just go samp array and then I'm going to
put I inside of brackets and what I is
going to be given as a value as it's
looping through this guy is the index
numbers that's what is going to be equal
to each time it iterates through the
foreign looping structure that we have
here so I just have to put that right
here a Miss in between these brackets
and it'll print it out the screen as you
can see right here and it printed out
all of the different values that I
stored in that array another thing you
can easily do inside of JavaScript is to
actually shoot out the length of an
array and I'm going to show you how to
do really cool things with this later on
by just typing in the name of your array
followed by the length and you can see
it shoots out on the screen that there
are three little boxes that contain
values inside of the array that I just
put here I can also create a raise in
numerous other different ways so let's
say that I wanted this is sort of like
one of the shortcut ways to create an
array so I'm going to define a new array
new a or re Y and I'm going to actually
pass my values right whenever I define
this and that right there is a hundred
percent illegal but I could also even
shorten this I'm going to create another
array call it three and if I surround
this guy with brackets I don't even need
to have the new array part they're just
automatically knows that I want to
create an array just by putting those
square brackets around it and let's say
that I wanted to join two arrays I just
use let's just create another one let's
call it zamp array and then followed by
the dot operator and then concat what
this will do is it will tack on this guy
right here Sam for a two to the end of
Sam Perret that's what that and function
does for you and if I jump up here and
grab this guy throw it down here and
then change this to Sam for a for and
change this to Sam / a for and save that
you'll see that it did that it joined
those two arrays that I created into one
called sample rate 4 and let's get rid
of some of this different code that I
have here if you have any questions just
leave them below and I'll get to them ok
so I have my basic array that I started
with here which is sample a I'm going to
show you how to do a couple other things
with it
document right here I'm going to show
you how to join an array and turn it
into a string with the join function and
an inside of here I'm going to define
between quotes that whenever we join
this array into a string I want all of
the different parts of the array to be
separated with a space I could just as
easily go in here and put a comma or
anything else that I want to put inside
of there plus I'm going to copy this I'm
going to show you two other different
functions you can also slice pieces out
of an array with this slice function and
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to say that I want to start at index 0
which is right here and I want to chop
out two parts of the array and print
those to screen and I could also print
out the screen the reversed version of
this array just simply by coming in here
and typing in reverse and there are no
properties needed to be passed in that
situation and come in here and put these
plus signs to concatenate or to join
these guys if I'll save that and you can
see that it shot out array string right
like that with the join function and
everything separated with a space here
starting at index 0 which is my name it
shot out the screen those two indexes
that came after it so it shot out my
name as well as this address and then
here it reversed the array all together
so now let's get into what's called
erase splicing which allows you to
delete and also change the value stored
in an array and what I'm going to do
here just so this is nice and easy to
understand I'm going to type in Nam List
and I'm going to create a new array I'm
just going to chop this out here and
just to make it odd I'm going to put
these numbers in here in the wrong order
so that we can get into different ways
to sort inside of arrays right like that
so if I want to come in here sort array
and I'm just going to come in here and
say num list followed by sort all kinds
of different functions that will really
save you a lot of time leave that the
same then and then I could also come in
here like I say before splice numbers
out of an array and how I do that is
with the spliced function and here I
just designate which values I want to
knock out of this array so I'm going to
say starting at index 0 I want to chop
out everything through index 3 and let's
just go and let's just file save this
just so you can see what I'm doing here
okay so this guy right here sort sorted
everything in the array and that's going
to stick and then I called the splice
function and I said I want to knock out
starting at index zero through the third
item inside of the list and it shot out
the screen those values that were
spliced out now if I come in here and
decide that I want to actually ray after
splice if I want to actually show you
what this new guy looks like I can
actually come in here just leave this as
number or num wist with that plus sign
inside of there and you can see four
five six seven eight it actually chopped
those guys out of there let's say
instead you want to use the splice
function to jump in and change values
that are inside of an index of course
you can do that and here I'm going to
again call splice in this situation I'm
going to say that I want to take those
values that are stored from the first
index here which is 0 through the next 3
and then I put another comma and I'm
going to say I want those values that
were spliced out to be replaced with
these new values and again I'm just
going to copy this guy right here shoot
him right there I'll save and you can
see after splice it replaced the four
five six that was originally right here
and in place you can now see these three
values that I inserted and I inserted
those right there
using the splice function so those are a
whole bunch of different functions you
can use with arrays and I'm also going
to get into right now how
multi-dimensional arrays work so let's
create one I'm going to call this multi
array and here I'm just going to go in
here if you want to create a
multi-dimensional array you're gonna
have to put multiple brackets inside of
here I'm just going one two three four
five and then after that square bracket
you're going to define the second part
of your multi-dimensional right and
again you can put any values you want
inside of here and I'm going to show you
how to loop through a multi-dimensional
right jump in here first and show you
exactly how to pull just one value out
of this array so in this situation right
here what I want to do is print out the
screen the value that lies in the first
or in this situation be actually going
to be the second part of this
multi-dimensional array since this one's
going to be 0 this is going to be 1 and
then I want the third value in that
second box pulled out so that's going to
be zero one two three based off of that
I'm going to get nine printed to screen
obviously I've done this before okay
what happens if you want to actually
print out all values in the multi
dimensional array well here I can do
this in multiple different ways but I'm
just gonna come in here and use the for
loop just so you're well acquainted with
how that operates yeah I'm gonna say
well I is smaller than the length
remember that guy for this array I'm
going to continue to iterate through
this guy and then I'm gonna come in here
and define another value for iteration
it's gonna be called J and I'm gonna
continue to iterate through this guy
while there are additional little boxes
in the second part of our multi
dimensional right Jim down here document
right yeah and I'm just gonna go multi
aurait put the brackets put on inside of
there and put J inside of here and
that's going to allow me to iterate
through all the values in the
multi-dimensional array as you see it
does right there one through ten prints
them all out the screen the reason why
they're on different lines because I got
the break statement inside here so
that's a rundown of a lot of different
things you can do with a race now I'm
going to get into some funky things you
can do with functions alright just as a
review I'm going to show you how to
create a function here so I'm defining
this function that's called add these
and I'm designating that it is going to
have potentially two properties that can
be passed to it and it's going to add
them together and return them and again
I know this is a very sophisticated
program right here I'm just going to say
one plus two is equal to right like that
and then I'm gonna call add this is how
you call a function inside a JavaScript
and it pass it the values one and two
and you can see that it did all that
hard work and it figured out that one
plus two is equal to three well you
don't think that's impressive how about
if I create a function it'll actually
show you how to print multiple values
I'm gonna call this guy add many and I'm
going to come in here and put a whole
bunch of different potential properties
or arguments that could be passed over
to it see what you have to understand is
if you don't send like let's say we this
function was called before I even make
it here but if admony was called and
they just sent two values
scripts not going to throw an error it's
going to say fine that's that's
perfectly okay unless this function
somewhere tries to access the value for
C which doesn't exist and then it'll
throw an error but I'm going to show you
some neat ways to work with a whole
bunch of different values so that this
function will actually change and mutate
based off of how many different
arguments are passed to it this is
obviously based off of a question that I
received okay
so function at many da-da-da-da-da now
I'm going to create a variable called I
and I'm going to give it the value of 1
and I'm going to create another one
called sum and I'm going to give it a
value of 1 as well then I'm going to
introduce you to arguments a link this
is something that I do not see people
using very often and it's a very neat
what it's going to do is it's going to
shoot out the screen exactly how many
values were passed which is extremely
useful for this reason I'm going to
create a while loop here and
arguments.length and I'm going to loop
through it based off of the number of
arguments that were sent this allows you
to accept a variable number of arguments
inside of JavaScript which is very
useful plus arguments and this is
actually an array that has passed this
guy right here is turned into an array
and it's called arguments what this is
going to allow me to do is to jump in
here and add up all the different
arguments no matter how many they sent
which is really neat sum of arguments
and this guy's just going to be some
kind of neat let's scroll this up and
let's call this function now let's leave
it on the screen so you can see it add
many and I'm going to pass it 1 comma
and then two just so you know that I'm
not faking something here if I file save
that you can see I sent 6 arguments and
it printed 6 arguments out the screen
and then it's summed all of those
arguments which 1 plus 1 plus 1 1 on the
line plus 2 is equal to 7 but even
though it expects 6 if I jump in here
and only pass 5 you can see that it
automatically still works even though
it's expecting 6 and I pass 5 it still
works which is really cool but what is
even more cool is I am now sending 8
arguments and it actually is still
working see I was able to
come in here and send more arguments
than what it was expecting and it still
works so that is a neat little trick
that not many people seem to know about
and now I'm going to get into something
that is really bizarre about JavaScript
and that is how it handles what we call
scope what you have to understand is
JavaScript does not have what we call
block level scope and what we mean by
that is let's say we define a global
variable this is a variable that is
going to be accessible since it's
outside of any function it should be
accessible anywhere within the program
and in most situations it is now let's
say and I'm not typing in real
JavaScript code here all right say you
create a function called function and
try to use this global variable inside
of here it will allow you and if you
wanted to print this out the screen it
would definitely allow you to print one
out screen
the only problem occurs is if you would
create another variable inside a
function even if it was somewhere else
in your code and gave it a value of two
and I'm actually going to show you an
example to help you understand that or
exactly what's going on this is what we
call block scope this is what exists in
most computer languages but it does not
work in JavaScript with block scope if
you create a variable using the same
variable name on a global basis as well
as on a local basis normally whenever
you would go to print global inside of
this function it would print one and
then since you change the value to two
right here whenever you call print again
in this situation it would print two
because it changed and I'm just going to
give you an example so that it makes
more sense hopefully it makes more sense
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a local variable and it is going
to be called scope test and I'm going to
give it a value of one then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
function I'm gonna call it scope be I
don't know whatever doesn't matter
I'm gonna call document write and I'm
going to say in scope e for the first
time and I'm going to call scope test
and then I'm going to come in here and
define scope test is equal to two this
is whenever JavaScript gets confused and
then copy this again print that and this
is the
second time we are going to call
document right inside of here to print
scope test out to the screen and here
we're going to return true to end this
function and here we're going to make a
call to that function and then here
we're going to say out of scope e okay -
Rudy iterate in most languages where
they use block scope if you would print
out document right and scope you first
before we reach this line this would
normally print out the screen the value
of one why because it's defined there
then it would normally print out two
here since you change that but you're
going to see that something different
happens would save it and you can see
whenever it comes to this guy right here
in Skokie first right there it prints
out undefined in scope e second it
prints out two why because you defined
scope test right here and then here out
of scope E which is the name of this
function which is right down here it's
going to print the global value for
scope test and the reason why is all
variables defined in a function inside
of JavaScript are considered defined
before they are given a value and that
is the reason why this sort of mess goes
on over here so how do you correct this
it's actually pretty simple
you could either come in here and define
your variables at the beginning of your
function which is what you always should
do lesson learned
or even better yet use different
variable names inside of functions than
you use on a global basis then you won't
have all of these different problems
show up and you can also define
functions directly inside of another
function just in case you wanted to do
this here I'm going to take doc right
right like that and I'm going to say in
s just to keep that short in the s
function and I'm going to try to print
scope test inside of this guy and you're
going to see that if I call this s
function right side here that you're
going to get undefined again because the
rules of JavaScript again are going to
be applied to even functions that are
defined inside of other functions so
hopefully
answers a couple of your questions and
hopefully liked and find useful the
arguments tool that I shows you in
regards to using functions and being
able to handle arbitrary number of
arguments whenever they're sent to you
have any questions or comments leave
them below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
