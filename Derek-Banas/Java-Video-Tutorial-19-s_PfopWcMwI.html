19 of my java video tutorial series
today we're going to talk about regular
expressions what you do with regular
expressions is you quite simply just
define exactly what you're looking for
in the strings of text or arrays or
whatever using codes take you through a
whole bunch of different things and it
will become very easy to understand in
the end first thing you need to do of
course is get yourself regular
expression library there you go now you
got that you're ready to go what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to dump
two strings inside of here that just
contain different types of information
that I'd like to be able to search for
it I'm going to take you through this
piece by piece so you will completely
understand it now to start off basically
whenever you're searching for something
you want to put it inside of brackets so
any characters you want now let's say
that you wanted to get every uppercase
letter from A to Z that is exactly how
you would do it or like that anyway if
you want to also get every lowercase
letter from A to Z that's how you do
that or you could put a through F
anything like that or you could also
come in here and put in numbers
another thing you do with regular
expression is let's say you want to
search for any sort of characters that
are not specific things so that's all
you would need to do so if you wanted to
find a series of characters that were
not a through G that is exactly what you
do you put that little caret symbol in
there and if you're looking for
whitespace for example how you would do
that this is different in Java than
other languages you have to backslash
twice and that will match any whitespace
you're searching for things that are not
whitespace that's what you do and then
if you wanted to find say anything that
proceeds and you're looking for it to be
n to M times and being the minimum and M
B and the maximum I'm going to take you
some through real-world examples here
now so you can actually see how this
works let's say I'm looking for a word
that is two to twenty characters in
length how exactly would I do that it's
actually very very simple you'd come in
here and you type in uppercase a through
z and then lowercase a through Z and
then you'd close your bracket and then
you'd say minimum number of characters
to maximum number of characters 20 and
there you are there's a regular
expression now I didn't show you one of
the other shorthand thing
that is backslash w and what you would
do in this situation is just type in
that which is going to match any
characters and then you put it to and
then you put a twenty inside of there
now get more into that here in a second
so exactly how do you make these things
work inside of Java I'm going to do this
in a separate method public static void
and I'm going to call this regular
expression checker reg X and I'm going
to pass to this a string that is going
to be the regular expression I'm
searching for it's also going to contain
this string that I want to check then
what you need to do is actually define
your regular expression now that regular
expression is going to be passed to me
with the Reg X right here so that I can
use this like a method instead of trying
to do something else with it and then
you start off with pattern and then give
your pattern na n you type in pattern
dot compile and then the Reg X is going
to be the string that is going to stand
in for your regular expression and all
the code is available underneath this
video you should probably get it because
it's heavily commented then you need to
go matcher and then you can type in
whatever you want here I'm going to type
in reg X matcher and then I'm going to
type in reg X like that and that guy
comes from here of course you want to
spell it the same way then you're going
to type in matcher and you're going to
say string to check now what you need to
do is find all of the matches for this
and I'm going to keep this consistent
put it capital M inside of there so how
you do that as you go for a while loop
and then you type in reg X matcher
and you're going to call method called
find and what it's going to do is it's
going to kick out all of the matches for
you and as its kicking out those matches
for you you're going to go if this is
what I'm doing anyway I'm going to check
that a string that is shot out by the
method called group has a value and has
a length basically I'm just making sure
that there is information in the results
that are kicked out so that's all I'm
doing there I'm just checking to make
sure that the string that is kicked out
has a length if it does I'm gonna print
it screen so I just go rig X matcher you
call group and then I'm going to also
call trim and all trim does is get rid
of all the white space if you forgot
exactly what trim does that's okay you
can also do a couple other different
things so let's say I wanted to also
find out where the starting index was
for this guy just going to copy that
paste that inside of there and then if I
want to get the starting index I just go
regex a reg X matter and I'm going to
type in start and it's going to kick
that out to me I'm going to do this
again and you can also get the ending
index and index have that also come out
there on the screen and then guess what
instead of starting to type in end
there's a whole bunch of different ways
to search for these regular expressions
and now you can actually see what some
of them look like and we're going to use
the red X checker here and then we're
going to jump back up here and remember
we're just are going to try to find any
words or string of characters that are 2
to 20 characters in length I'm gonna go
like this and then I'm going to define
my regular expression and I'm going to
say in this situation there's going to
be a space followed by capital A through
Z lowercase a through Z doing this the
long way and then I'm going to type in 2
and 20 and then I'm going to put in that
there should be a space after that and
the string that I'm going to be
searching for and of course you could
search through files you can search
through anything we'll get into that
later on them and we'll execute it and
there you could say it found my first
name it found the abbreviation for
California and the abbreviation for PA
and also printed out the start index and
the ending index so let's continue on
and we'll find other interesting regular
expression like I said before there
shorthand for a whole bunch of different
things so let's say you were looking for
digits or numbers that's how you would
find that lowercase D anything that is
non a digit or a number uppercase D and
then let's say you wanted to find
something that occurred a very very
specific number of times say five times
that's exactly what you do you just put
the five inside of there so knowing that
let's go in here and let's do a couple
other little searches so let's say for
example I was looking for what in my
country is called a zip code how would I
do that a zip code is five digits long
that's it okay so knowing that what how
exactly we're going to look for it on
this situation I'm going to use a
shorthand version four digits and just
put a D inside of there and then inside
of here and get rid of this because I
know there's only going to be five
digits inside of it if we execute it
you're going to see it works and there
you got one two three four five so it's
searched through all this stuff right
here and figured out that that is
exactly what I was looking for well
let's say that I wanted to look for
states that either begin with a
see for example or a a for example well
this is only going to kick back see a as
a result but you're going to be able to
see how to do searches for states and
other different sorts of codes and
things like that so I'm looking for two
characters that start with a C or a and
then I'll make it a little bit more
complicated by doing a search for States
in specific so what is the regular
expression for that well I'm going to go
a I'm going to put a bracket inside of
here this bracket and then for US states
there are only four states to begin with
an A and they are then preceded by the
letter K L R and Z and close off that
bracket then we're going to put four
inside of there there's a new regular
expression code and four US states uh
begin with C there's only three of those
and that's CA o and T and if I come in
here and we can do our little search I'm
gonna get rid of those spaces right
there and I'm just going to type in
exactly what I just did we come up here
and you can see it found it and just for
the heck of it let's also put Alaska
inside of there and you'll see that it's
smart enough to find that as well
however it did not kick back PA why
because it doesn't get in with an A or a
C and you can see it found California
and Alaska now what if you wanted to do
a search for something but you only
wanted to have a minimum but no maximum
how you do that put this bracket inside
of here and would represent your minimum
and then you would put a comma in there
you'd be able to have a minimum say your
minimum was five characters but you
didn't want to have a maximum well
that's exactly how you would define that
then again if you put a plus sign inside
of a regular expression what does that
mean
that means whatever proceeds must occur
one or more times and of course I'm
going to give you some examples and then
also it's good to know that there are
certain things that you need to
backslash inside whenever you're
creating a regular expression anytime
you would use a period or a carrot or a
star or a plus sign or a question mark
or either of these brackets or these
brackets or a backslash of course or an
or symbol or this bracket system so
those are things that always need to be
back slashed so let's start playing
around with this strange string right
here and let's say I want to grab any
string that contain
one or more star symbols alright so how
am I going to do that real simple just
get rid of that and here we're going to
type in strange inside so that are
strange and right here just to make this
even more interesting let's say I want
to grab these brackets here because I
also have to show you how they're back
slashed and all that in this situation
we'll put this bracket like this I'm
going to forward slash it like that I'm
going to put in exactly what I'm looking
for so remember I had to back slash this
because it's protected character and I'm
going to say one or more of those things
I'm going to throw another bracket
around it and let's execute it and you
can see it found this where there's
three brackets there's two and there's
one so that's another way to find
protected sorts of information and then
like I said you before let's say if I
was doing a search that had one or more
of whatever precedes it well that's what
the plus sign does you can see in that
situation there's the results in there
exactly the same but that was sort of
like a shorthand way of being able to
get to it let's also say that I would
want to do a search for anything
oh it's technically not anything it's
going to be a period is going to
represent anything but a newline now if
I wanted to find anything literally
anything and I just demand that there
are three of them that's it so I'm
looking for anything as long as there's
three of them in a row and of course get
rid of that period right there that'll
throw an error because it's not
commented out and then you're there's
three of anything and the reason why
they're sometimes showing up here is and
you looks like there's only two of
things is because there are actually
spaces inside of there so spaces it
matches spaces it matches anything but
new lines and like I said before if we
would want to do a search for a any type
of word type character and I'll show you
what I mean by word type character just
put those two slashes in there and W and
that is going to be exactly the same as
a through Z upper case a through Z lower
case 0 through 9 as well as an
underscore and then if you would want to
search for anything but that this is how
you would do that comment that out like
that and input an uppercase letter so
it's going to match for anything that
isn't one of those things what do you do
whenever you would want to search for
results that occurs 0 or more times and
you put a star symbol in and I'm going
to show you how exactly how to do that
so let's come down here again let's
search for any type of character
match what I just showed you up there
that occurs zero or more times and then
you can see also we've got a little
situation here where we're getting
spaces involved and things like that
let's get into something that's a little
bit more interesting and buy a little
bit more interesting let's say that I
want to look for an email address so
let's just come up here grab this guy
throw him down here and let's figure out
exactly what makes up an email address
so I've come down here into the regular
expression area well I know inside of an
email address I'm going to have
potentially uppercase letters so just
put that inside of there I'm also
potentially lowercase letters also
potentially going to have numbers so I'm
just putting in everything I can
potentially have I could have a period I
could have an underscore percent signs
I could have dashes then of course
followed by an @ symbol so remember this
plus sign means one or more of any of
these different things because we're
definitely going to demand that there's
at least one of those in there then
after the @ symbol we're going to define
pretty much exactly the same thing so
copy that
or that in there I don't think we can
technically have percent signs though
put that in there
close that off remember one or more and
then what are we going to have we're
going to have periods so put a period
inside of there and then what are we
going to have we're going to end with a
through Z or a through Z close that off
and then that should end with either two
to four characters in length so this
part here is going to be defining this
right here and then of course the app
symbols itself and then we're going to
be looking for all these different
things and then the final part is going
to be a series of characters that are
going to be two to four in length and
that is how we're going to define our
search for our email and in this
situation we're going to be looking for
that email in long string let's file
save it and see what happens and you can
see of course it looked through that
text and it found the match which is
John Smith at hotmail.com what would
happen if we want to perform a search
but we don't necessarily know if
something's going to exist and this
would come into play in situations where
we have phone numbers just like you see
here there's all kinds of different
types of phone numbers so let's actually
just copy this so we can look at these
phone numbers and then decipher exactly
what they are we're going to think our
way through exactly what potentially a
phone number could be and if your phone
over
doesn't fit into this it should and
either way you should be able to figure
out exactly what I'm doing here all
right so there's a whole bunch of
different potential phone numbers that
we want to search for it looks really
really hard but it's really really not
well we know our regular expression
we're searching for could potentially
have a one in Sun in front of it or some
number in front of it but we don't know
that that's true because if we just
demand that that's there well it's not
going to find these other phone numbers
so what do we want to do well what I
want to do is come down here put a
little brace inside of there and then
I'm going to find that there could be a
number from zero to nine inside of and
if there is chances are there's either
going to be a space inside of it or
there's going to be a dash that follows
that number however that doesn't need to
exist well how do we say that something
doesn't need to exist we put a question
mark in and that question mark is going
to pertain to this information that's
inside of those brackets but what if we
don't know if any of this is going to
exist easily that's why we have the
brackets there all surrounded we say you
know what we don't know if that'll exist
either leave any questions or comments
below and I'll be more than happy to
elaborate if this doesn't make sense
well then what do we know well we know
that potentially this part right here
could exist let's throw that one back in
nurse you know what we're doing so we
know that this potentially could exist
but however these brackets don't need to
exist as we can see here and there's
nothing here at all
so let's come in here and try and figure
out exactly how we would do that I'm
searching for this guy right here and
it's a protected character remember
there it is up here so that means I need
to backslash it backslash right like
that so I'm doing that search for that
thing however it doesn't need to exist
so I put a question mark inside of there
however if it does exist probably going
to be numbers from 0 to 9 inside of
there and what they're going to be 3 in
length or at least in my situation
they're going to be and then there could
be a closing bracket which is this guy
however because it's protected I need to
backslash it so there I did I just
backslash tit however none of this needs
to exist at all so I went and put that
closing question mark there and then I
could also do an or statement and say
that we could have 0 through 9 and that
there are three in length and no
brackets there and then we could close
that off and then the devii
vision between these numbers and things
like that could be a space which I put
the space there or could be a - put that
there however there might not be any
dashes or any space so just put a
question mark inside of there well then
what do we know well we know that we're
expecting zero through nine in digits to
follow and that it's three in length
again we're doing this part right here
now if you didn't know
and that could be preceded by either a
space or a - close that off or nothing
that's what the question mark means then
we expect zero through nine again and in
this situation it should be four in
length or we can say otherwise that we
could have a through Z a through Z and
this would account for people just
typing in just seven characters in a row
so zero through nine and if they did
that that it would more than likely be
seven in length so we're basically
looking for situations where this is
what is entered and nothing else is
entered what I'm accounting for is if
people were typing in numbers based off
of what their letter code is okay so
that's what that is if that doesn't make
sense and they would be seven in length
and then I close off the whole entire
bracket and if I did that right and file
save it execute it yep you can see that
it kicked out all three of the different
types of numbers that are potential
telephone numbers in that string just
play with this stuff you'll get it you
just have to kind of get your brain
exactly what all these codes mean but
they're really simple so don't make
anybody think that they're not simples
because they just are and of course you
can also use regular expressions to do
like string replaces and things like
that I'm going to show you exactly how
to do that by creating another method
down here so let's say I wanted to do a
regular expression replace I'm just
going to go public static void reg ex
replace and in this situation it's going
to send a string to replace yes and what
this guy's going to do specifically is
I'm going to create a pattern and that
pattern is basically going to target in
on eliminating spaces inside of strings
so I'm making this kind of specialize
I'm sure you kind of get it here and
let's say we want to match one or more
spaces so it's going to kind of clean up
string code well then what do I need to
do no just tell you that you know if you
would want this to be
sensitive and if since is it space it
doesn't make any sense
but let's say we were doing a search in
which we were trying to replace
characters a through Z like that and we
wanted to be case sensitive meaning
ignore the case we just put a column
inside of there and then you would type
in pattern dot case insensitive
this has to be uppercase as well and in
essence what that's going to do is that
if you didn't have here it would be the
same as if you would type in A through Z
in lowercase as well so that's how you
do searches based off of being case
insensitive but let's go back to what we
originally have here as I'm doing
stream-of-consciousness sort of
programming some of this stuff sort of
comes in are you basically going to do
exactly the same thing and type in
matcher and I'm going to type in reg X
match it's equal to except I'm going to
type in replace this time matcher and
the string to replace I'm actually going
to do a trim on it that just gets rid of
the white space on both ends of it and
then call my checks match or replace all
and then in this situation what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say that I
want to replace all the spaces that are
up here and then I want to instead
insert comma followed by a space and
that's what that guy's going to do right
there and then of course make this
uppercase file save it and then we'll
scroll up here and here you can see I'm
calling the method that we just created
right here so let's execute it and let's
replace all the spaces with commas and
spaces and add a little bug and a bug
was that I didn't have pattern inside of
there and there you can say them when in
there found all the spaces and replace
them with commas and spaces there's a
whole bunch of things with regular
expressions leave any questions or
comments but Lou otherwise until next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
