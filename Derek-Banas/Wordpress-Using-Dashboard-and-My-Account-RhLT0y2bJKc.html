affordable website that search engines
will love well as we went through the
last video you hopefully set up a
wordpress.com account I am here now
wordpress.com I entered my user ID and
here I entered my password now we're
gonna login gonna cover everything in
the dashboard and this which is what
we're looking at right here when you
first log in you're actually going to be
looking at the WordPress homepage at the
top of your screen
drift your mouse over to my account and
click on global dashboard first thing on
the page is an announcement from
WordPress under that in the section
called your stuff you'll find links to
your most recent posts what's hot
displays links to the hottest posts
blogs as well as the newest content now
go over to the left side of the screen
and click on blog stats those you'll
find right there
this page will be very important to you
once you have content on your site and I
no purpose use the brand new site just
so that our pages are gonna look almost
identical you'll see a great chart here
that will show the number of people
going to your site and referrers
are people that were nice enough to link
to your site top posts and pages display
data on which of your posts people are
visiting the most search engine terms
will display the keywords people use in
search engines to get to your site
clicks displays a list of your most
popular links and the final bit of data
can be found under blog stats here you
can find information on how busy your
site is information on your own activity
and the number of people who subscribe
to be notified every time you make a
change to your site a brief explanation
may be an order here posts are the
individual articles you have put on your
website by default WordPress provides
the readers of your site the opportunity
to comment on each of your articles this
option can be withdrawn if you like
categories provide an organizational
structure to your site with saying I
plan to talk about marketing and cats on
my website for example it would make a
sense to separate these two things into
separate categories so the people who
visit my site can easily choose which
subject is important to them
by separating my information into
separate categories I give them that
ability tags provides you with the
ability to assign keywords to each of
your posts this is a great way for you
to allow people to search through your
site and find exactly what they want if
you associate the tag turtle for example
to one of your posts people will be able
to click it and find all posts you have
written about turtles and by using tags
you will also increase your odds of
ranking well with search engines so take
the time and use tags throughout your
entire site the final bit of data on the
blog stats page refers to email
subscribers you can set up a system in
which those who choose can be sent an
email every time you post a new article
and on this page you'll see how people
have chosen to be alerted yeah now click
on the lake blog surfer which is located
on the left hand side of your screen
right there and here you'll be research
and track blogs that are of interest to
you and click on the link in the left
title to my comments this page will show
you all the comments you have made on
other people's WordPress blogs and if
you click on read' o matic you'll be
taken to a page that displays the top
news posts made currently by the
WordPress community tag surfer provides
you with an ability to see posts that
others write about in regards to the
same topics that you do find tags are
for also on the left and let's say you
want to see all the articles that are
currently being written in regards to
marketing all you do is type marketing
in here click on add and you'll see a
list here of all the current current
articles in regards to marketing and if
you decide you don't want to track
marketing anymore just click
this axe next to marketing and it is
going and now we'll move on to the mop
my blogs area and you'll be taken to a
page as you see here that lists every
blog that you have hosted on WordPress
you can use this page to quickly jump to
stat pages set up a system to
automatically post your posts to Yahoo
updates and/or Twitter and set up a way
to post to your blog just by sending an
email and I'll cover these topics and
future posts well in the final link
under dashboard you'll find
subscriptions which you can find right
here by subscribing to a blog you have
chosen to receive an email every time
someone makes a change that are blogs
you can see here how somebody can do
that in regards to your blog you may
have or not have noticed that there are
drop-down boxes across the top of your
screen one of those links is called my
account and you can find that right here
and what we're going to do now is
actually look at the profile page and it
has some personal information here so
I'm going to actually jump to a JPEG
with that personal information block
down as you can see right here and here
you'll find a reference to what is
called an API key this series of letters
and numbers is a password of sorts and
we will use that and later post a setup
spam blocking tool named kismet don't
worry about that at this time under
personal options leave the visual editor
box unchecked and choose the color
palette of your dash or if you like
keyboard shortcuts will be of use when
your website is getting a large number
of comments refer back to that when that
day comes where our connection option
provides you with the ability to add a
layer of security whenever you log on
the WordPress on your dashboard if you
choose to use what is referred to as
HTTPS every time you make an update to
your site these changes will be
encrypted or coded or what have you
before they're sent the only negative to
using HTTPS is that it will take longer
to update
safe and the next two options allow you
to change your specified language as you
can see right here and signing your
primary blog which you will find here
and by primary we're basically just
referring a little blog that you play on
making the most posts to all so
WordPress comes pre-installed with a
great grammar checker and you can decide
here on your proofreading what errors
you want word for us to check for and
the information under name and contact
info is quite self-explanatory make sure
you fill in as much information as
possible here and AM Yahoo I am jabber
google talk are all instant messaging
clients and if you know what they are
and you have one and one of those
contact you through them and are that
information here and if you need to
change your password you can actually
find that down here at the bottom of the
page just enter in a new password and of
course hit update profile and final two
options available to you and the profile
page or the my Gravatar and my location
my grabs a Gravatar is simply an image
that you want to represent you and in
your posts and you can set up a system
in which this image will represent you
not only on your blog but also other
social networking sites and I'll
describe the avatars in a later video
geo-tagging can be enabled if you want
to give others very specific data on
your location and I'm actually referring
to latitude and longitude information if
this sounds great go for it and I may
cover that subject in a later post and
there are three final links provided
under the my account page found in the
upper left-hand corner of your browser
window I'm actually going to switch back
to the actual thing and this is what I'm
referring to what I mean my account
section you can click on support' if you
have any questions on using WordPress
and support obviously found right if you
click on the wordpress.com listing which
it will find right here that I'll take
you to the wordpress home page and of
course log out would be used if you want
to log out of your account if you are on
a public computer somewhere
you just want to do that at home and the
only link left to cover is the link
labeled tolls if we go back one page and
click this is where you find profile
this is where you'll find tools and ER
you can cite if you want to install
gears on your home computer never do
this on any other computer other than
your own as it states gears allows you
to install your site content on your
home computer if have stalled your
interactions with your WordPress blog
will receive a speed increase and the
reason why is everything is essentially
going to be saved on your own computer
and finally here you have the option to
set up a system that will allow you to
post your blog by sending an email you
can see this right here and if that
would be of interest to you what it'll
actually do is set up on private email
you drop a email and I'll automatically
shoot up onto your blog page and that
basically completely covers all the
options found both under the global
dashboard and my account categories and
in the next video I'll cover everything
you ever wanted to know about posting
articles and in the other videos
everything else about WordPress look for
