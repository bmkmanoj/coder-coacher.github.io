11 of my object oriented design tutorial
today I'm going to continue talking
about grasp and if you haven't seen the
passport of the tutorials I provide a
link to them above like I talked about
previously grasp principles are going to
help you create great object-oriented
designs and in the previous tutorial I
talked about creator expert low coupling
controller and high cohesion and in this
one I'm going to talk again about
polymorphism and get into new subjects
like pure fabrication indirection and
protected variations don't worry it's
not as complicated as it sounds of
course I'll provide you with a whole
bunch of code examples as well as some
UML diagrams to help you understand this
stuff so this isn't going to be a boring
presentation like you're used to seeing
so let's get into it now polymorphism of
course you've seen countless numbers of
times but in this tutorial we're going
to talk about it and how it is used to
dynamically handle numerous similar
object types it is also used to simulate
a pluggable software component type
system and what you're going to find
when you're programming is you're often
going to be performing different
operations based off of conditional
statements like if in case and so forth
and so on and what this does is it makes
your system less flexible because each
time a new variation is needed code has
to be changed throughout your system now
our goal here is when you must work with
varying components you must as you're
going to see here in a second create a
varying polymorphic objects for each so
let's jump in and look at a code example
so here is our old buddy Eclipse and I'm
gonna do a little sample here it's gonna
be real short and it's going to be based
off of different silver prices that come
in to you and how you would use them and
be able to work with them using
polymorphic techniques so let's just say
we come in here and I'm just gonna go
abstract public double get price of
silver and I just created this as an
abstract class for really no particular
reason but it's definitely going to work
in this situation and let's just say
that we were going to have a couple
different companies that are going to
provide us with prices on the price of
silver and we have to figure out how to
take these different types of
information and work with them so there
we go there's our abstract class and
let's say one of these companies
is called ABC silver and we're going to
go in here and figure out how exactly
we're going to work with ABC silver so
let's say we go private string and let's
say that a silver price that's going to
come through with them let's just say
it's going to have SLV at the beginning
and it's and have a price of silver that
they currently have that they're willing
to sell it at and then we're gonna go
private string name and let's just say
that our ABCs over and I'm going to give
you a much more complex example here I
just win two E's in so let's say that
this is going to have get price of
silver inside of it and there's going to
be a string and this guy is going to
handle the problems for us inside of
here we're going to be creating this guy
to get a different silver price because
this silver price is going to come
across this way and as you're going to
say here it's going to come across
differently from the other silver
company so I'm just going to go
substring and I'm going to say that I
want to get from index four onwards and
then I want to return that go in
converting this into a double parse
double and we'll just throw our string
price inside of there so like I said
this is a real simple example and we're
just gonna go public string get name and
then we'll return the name of the
company now we're going to go into XYZ
silver and it's going to work in a
different way and of course this guy
here is going to have to extends its
silver price can't forget to do that and
then we're going to go in to XYZ silver
and it's going to do exactly the same
thing it's going to extend get silver
price and of course it's gonna give me
an error message saying I need to come
in here and add this on implemented
method okay I did that and of course
we're going to override that grab it
string silver place and let's say that
in this situation the silver is going to
come across thirty sixty seven and then
it's going to say silver ask price so as
you can see we're getting the price for
silver from these two different
companies in two different ways
ABC silver is just going to have this
and XYZ silver is going to have this so
it's our job to come in here and make
them work seamlessly so how could we do
this well we could just go and create a
string array and we could say
String price and well then we'll just go
silver price and then maybe split it
based off of the space that's inside of
this guy because that seems to work and
then we'll just go return and we're just
going to convert it back into a double
and parse double and string price and
that'll be the zero index because that's
where the split is and then of course
public trinket name return name and then
jump up here and of course private is
equal to XYZ silver and there we go
so now we're going to jump into silver
prices Java and just make this guy work
which is simple so let's say we want to
throw all of our silver prices inside of
an array list it and we're just going to
use the abstract class gets the
overpriced Java hold everything inside
of there and I'm just gonna say silver
sellers is equal to new ArrayList it's
over price again Dada and there we go
and of course give me an error message
saying I need to import this library and
there it is okay so now that we got that
all set up let's just add our different
silver sellers to our ArrayList so just
go new ABC silver just to keep that
simple and and silver sellers add new
XYZ silver like that and like that and
then we could do an enhanced for-loop
and gets over price and then silver or
price and take this from silver sellers
and system.out.print line these are the
sort of things you just have to think
about whenever you are trying to work
dynamically with a bunch of different
objects that work differently and I'm
sure you get this one the one after this
one's gonna be a little bit more
complicated and then I'm just going to
do a silver price bounce out in there
and get price of silver Dada and we
through - unlike objects inside of an
ArrayList and whenever we run this it's
going to just work with it as you can
see ABC silver and it prints out all
that information exactly the way we want
it so that is a simple way of using
polymorphism and
the way in comparison to what I did
before now we get into pure fabrication
now like we saw previously with the
expert pattern while it is often good to
have objects that can complete tasks
needed for part of a system altogether
all on their own
if this however limits reuse other
alternatives should be investigated and
this brings us to pure fabrication if we
create an object to fulfill a need that
has no real-world counterpart this is
known as a pure fabrication an example
of this would be an object that would
only save information or update
information or delete information in a
database now using the expert pattern we
previously talked about well it might be
a good idea to keep all of those things
all in one class however if it limits
code reuse and also limits high cohesion
and contributes to high coupling that's
where we might want to separate these
guys and an example of how this can be
done using the Gang of Four design
patterns is the adapter the command and
the strategy and a couple other
different patterns so let's look at this
as a UML diagram to explain it further
you can see here an example where we
have a class that is sale and it's going
to have date items item prices purchase
amount and all kinds other different
things
however what might look out of place is
all of these methods down here that are
going to insert information and database
update it and delete it and so forth and
so on
you can see here that this sale class is
going to be highly coupled to whatever
database interface we choose to use
whenever we first create the system this
is going to limit first off code reuse
and it's going to tie it very directly
to our current database now if we think
that we might not want to always be tied
to that current database this is where
pure fabrication comes in we may decide
to take those methods completely out
create another class called Access
database for example and then through
composition then tie the sale into this
other class and then insert that
information into a database and like
said for example of pure fabrication
it's up to us program or whether you
think you should do this more than
likely it is going to be a better idea
to create a separate class for things
such as saving to files as well as
accessing databases especially if you
plan on doing it in different ways in
the future so pretty simple so let's
jump into something a little bit more
complex which is indirection now
indirection is a technique that is used
to avoid coupling between objects by
separating them with an intermediate
object now these adaptors there's a big
word right there which you're going to
see here in a second because I'm going
to use the adapter design pattern to
sort of implement indirection these
adapters are going to allow system
objects to interact with external
interfaces dynamically using polymorphic
techniques so let me show you a code
example so here we are back inside of
Eclipse and let's say we are going to
have a video game we create and it's
going to have enemy tanks and enemy
robots inside of them however enemy
robots is not going to directly work
with the interface let's go in here and
I'm going to show you the interface and
then you can see exactly what I'm going
to do here so let's say I go public void
attack and I define this method inside
of here and it must be implemented and
it's going to be used with an interface
this is also a way to use interfaces if
you're not used to using ok so then we
go into enemy tank which is an outside
class which we have little to any
control in regards to how it works
however we are going to be able to say
that it implements enemy attacker and
the great thing in regards to this is
enemy tank whenever we come to here
we're going to be able to add
unimplemented classes in this situation
whatever you're going to see in a second
enemy robots not going to work that way
and we have to figure out how to work
around that so let's say we have the
option to come in here and create a
method which is just going to go
system.out.print line and then say
something like tank fires two missiles
so using polymorphic techniques this
works this is just simply going to work
and I'm sure you can see in your head
exactly how it's going to work however
if we save that and we go into enemy
robot let's say enemy robot does not
allow us to have that
our let's say that enemy robot only has
one class and it is called jump on enemy
and that is it now that is how the enemy
robot is going to attack but we have no
way of going in here directly and being
able to change or add an attack method
to this and whenever it's called it just
says something like robot jumps on the
enemy okay so how exactly are we going
to go in here and do this well using
indirection we are going to implement an
adapter and I'm going to call that enemy
robot adapter and what this adapter is
going to do is it's going to call the
method jump on enemy when an enemy
attacker is supposed to call the attack
method and enemy adapter in this
situation is going to implement enemy
attacker just like before and it is
going to allow me to add that on the
implemented method just like that
however we're going to make a couple
changes here of course because we don't
want this guy to attack we want the
enemy robot to attack and to do that
we're going to go enemy robot and throw
it inside of here and let's say we call
it the robot so this is the object we
want to be able to use however enemy
robot only has jump on enemy as an
option so we're going to say that inside
of it and then another thing we're going
to do is create a constructor for this
and it's just going to be public enemy
robot adapter and it's going to get past
the enemy robot and then of course we're
just going to go the robot is equal to
new robot okay pretty simple
now whatever this method being attack is
called we just need to call the correct
method inside of enemy robot to get this
whole thing to work so inside of attack
we're just going to go the robot and
then call jump on the enemy right like
that or jump on enemy and if I'll save
that and now if we jump over into test
adapter dot Java we're going to see how
this whole thing edge thing is going to
work for us
so we just need to go enemy attacker
just like before we're going to create a
tank and just go new enemy tank and of
course we can throw this into anything
use it in many different ways now to
implement the enemy robot the way you
can't work well we're just going to go
the robot just like before new enemy
robot but then we have to send it
through
II robot adapter to make it work with
our system new enemy robot adapter and
then send over the robot to it now the
adapter from this day forward or this
moment forward is going to act like the
robot itself so when wherever we go the
tank and we want it to attack we just go
attack just like that and whenever we
want robot adapter or the enemy robot to
attack we just throw it to the adapter
and make it work and if we execute it
you're going to see that it doesn't work
and there we are
tank fires two missiles and robot jumps
on the enemy so there's an example of
using indirection to throw an adapter
between two different unlike objects and
make them work inside of your system and
that brings us to the final part which
is protected variations now often you'll
have the question how do you design
objects so that variation doesn't have
bad effects for you especially in the
future well what you want to do is you
want to look for elements with coupling
that may change and surround them with a
stable interface and I'm gonna use some
UML here to give you an example of that
okay so once again we have a class which
is sale and we have date items item
prices purchase amount and so forth
however there's one thing down here
which we think very well may change in
the future and that is how we are going
to calculate taxes now right now maybe
the taxes are stable and we know what
they are but there's one thing that we
are almost certain about and that is
that taxes will change
so using protected variations we want to
protect from that again in this
situation we're going to use an adapter
so in this situation what we're going to
do is create an interface called
calculate tax and inside of error you're
gonna see that let's say that we think
beer and wine taxes may be calculated
differently in the future no problem we
just created interface and then we slap
an adapter in it just like we did
previously with the enemy robot or enemy
attacker adapters and then we just tack
on calculate tax and have them just
simply work for any changes that may
occur in the future now this is
technically the end of the
object-oriented design tutorial however
I'm going to be getting into code
refactoring which I thought deserved its
own tutorial on it
as soon as I have it done there will be
a link to it above and if you have any
questions about anything you saw in this
