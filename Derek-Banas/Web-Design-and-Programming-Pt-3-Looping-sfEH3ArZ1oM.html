web design and programming tutorial in
which I will go over all the basics and
all the different languages you need to
understand the techniques behind them
that you need to understand to become a
great web designer or programmer well in
the previous tutorials I showed you how
to use form information to pass
information over to your PHP code and
I'm not going to go through all of this
here basically is the location of the
file that I want to send all this form
data to which is PHP loop PHP using the
post method and here is going to be the
label assigned to this textbox as you
can see right there and here's the
submit button and the value being send
which you see on the button so basically
what you need to understand is the name
of the variable you want to reference
over in your PHP code is going to be
count two and now we're going to jump
over to the PHP code and show you how to
sort through this and go over looping in
PHP okay here I am in PHP loop dot PHP
which is where all the form information
is going to be sent after the person
types in 100 as I have here in this
example and now I'm going to show you
how to create while loops but first
previously I showed you how to get
access to that information using dollar
sign underscore post as a reference to a
array in which all the data from the
form is passed over to the PHP program
well here I'm going to show you how to
use another one and it is called
requests I'm going to create a variable
here first called count two I'm going to
cast that string into an integer like I
showed you previously and here's the new
guy request
unlike post and yes indeed there's also
a get can receive both form data that is
passed in the post method or the get
method so you no longer need to worry
about these guys because request is
going to work for everything as I showed
you in the form data however the
variable is going to be called count two
so we're going to reference that and it
close this off with a semicolon and then
I'm also going to create another
variable called start num and give it a
value of one here I'm going to create a
while loop a while loop you basically
say that as long as the condition that
lies inside of the while loop
aimes true you want to continue
performing all of the actions over and
over and over again hopefully not in a
continuous loop until that condition is
no longer true so everything is going to
continue running that lies between the
opening curly brace and the closing
brace until this condition right here is
no longer true so as long as a person
doesn't enter one we know this is going
to run okay
so what I'm going to do here is not do
something quite so easy use use an if
statement what I'm going to do is print
out either every even or every odd
number that lies between start number
and the number that they passed over in
this circumstance 100 and how I'm going
to do that start num let's perform a
modulus on it now if I would say not
equal to what this is going to do is
print out all the odd numbers that lie
from the start number two the count two
or the ending number why is it going to
do that because what I'm doing here with
the modulus command is performing a
division and then passing back modulus
gives you the remainder of a division so
hence if there is a remainder that means
it's going to be an odd number hopefully
that makes sense so what I'm going to do
since I want all of the odd numbers to
be printed when I create a curly brace
I'm going to echo to screen the start
number if indeed it is odd I'm going to
close off that brace and then show you a
couple more new things use the elsif
which you've seen previously stored
number is greater than or equal to 1000
let's say we don't want to print more
than 1000 numbers to the screen there's
a real easy way to do that so if a
person types in 10,000 up here it's only
going to print to a maximum 1000 so it
doesn't over use your computer time or
what have you it's just an excuse for me
to type in break because what break will
do is it will jump if it is ever called
inside of a while loop or any looping
structure for that matter it will jump
completely out of the while loop down to
here meaning the line that that follows
the closing curly brace for the while
loop and will not continue iterating
through even if this condition up here
is true okay so that's what the break
does then you have else meaning if it is
an even number we
still are going to need to iterate so
we're going to have to use a short cut
plus plus which adds one to the variable
name start number and then we're going
to call the continue command and what
the continue command does is it jumps
back up to the beginning of the while
loop and continues iterating through it
doesn't jump out of it it just doesn't
continue going downwards like let's say
there were additional statements that
lied after this such as in this
circumstance there will be which is
another iterator it is not going to get
to this line even though it lies between
the opening and closing curly braces for
the while loop it is going to continue
meaning it's just going to skip this
line and jump back up here and continue
performing all of the tests and let's
say we want to put some additional
breaks after this do that just like that
and everything else is already closed
off here so we can save this and then we
can jump over to form two there's 100
and hit Send and as you can see it
prints out all of the odd numbers to
screen then if I wanted to come over
here and instead print out all of the
even numbers just go into this if
statement it equals save it jump inside
of here hit send and you can see it
prints out all of the even numbers well
you could also do something very similar
with something another looping structure
called the do-while loop so let's jump
down here the only difference between a
do-while loop and a while loop is that a
do while loop will perform everything
between the opening and curly braces no
matter whether the condition is met
whenever it is first called or not so
what we're going to do is we're going to
call or create iterator to variable and
give it a value of 1 they call it an
iterator because it is a value that
constantly changes normally moving
forwards and helps you iterate or cycle
through your looping structure they
create and I'm going to create a
do-while loop by starting with do again
it's going to perform all of the actions
that lie between these curly braces and
I'm going to just make this quite simple
and define while and I'm going to say
iterator 2 is less than or equal to 100
make sure you put that semicolon there
and of course you close this with the
parentheses and
just going to echo to screen Raider to
Alma like that and then I'm going to
increase the iterator to variable by one
again that's just a shortcut and I'm
going to jump in here and copy this save
it jump over here and run it you can see
here it's putting all of the numbers
from 1 to 100 again what makes this
different from a while loop is this code
will be read at least once what that
means is if I put 101 in here and hit
save and reload as you can see it
printed 101 it's guaranteed to go
through here at least once so that's the
real real difference well now let's say
I want to actually come in here I'm
gonna actually go jump back into my form
information create a new one of these
and I'm going to do a Fibonacci series
all that is its fancy for 1 on a 1 comma
2 comma 3 comma 5 all the Fibonacci
series is is you take this value plus
this value and that B equals this this
Plus this equals 3 this Plus this equals
5 and so forth and so on I'm going to
show you how to actually code that
create another text box except I'm going
to call this not like that and that's
all I need to do over there and I'm
going to jump over to the PHP code and
actually calculate this out using a for
loop I'm going to create a variable
called Max fib is equal to call for the
request array type in the key that is
associated with that array and here I'm
just creating the first two instances
that I'm going to add up in my Fibonacci
series and this is how you create a for
loop here is greater you define the
starting value of the value that you are
going to increase in value or to help
you iterate through your loop or cycle
through your loop call it whatever you
want and then you define the condition
in which you will continue to loop and
then you perform your iteration at the
end of it so for loop pretty much
contains everything that's sort of
spread out in the while loop and the
do-while loop all into this one little
box but it's going to perform everything
inside of those curly braces just like
the while loop does and in my
circumstance I'm going
say echo to screen my first sequence if
this confuses you at all of the
Fibonacci stuff don't worry about it I
just wanted to do something in the
tutorial that was at least semi
interesting instead of just flunking out
information it's equal to save me some
time copy this paste it into there plus
paste that in there and type in sec for
sequence is equal to the second sequence
and then i'm going to have the second
sequence is equal to sum' that's how you
calculate turbine Archie series inside
of PHP and you can see if I really load
that that is printing out the Fibonacci
which is zero plus one equals one one
plus two equals three three plus five
equals tada tada tada you can see how
this number gets very very big very very
fast so there's a couple of sort of
real-world example ways of using looping
inside of PHP if you have any questions
