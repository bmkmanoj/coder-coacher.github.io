new and improved personality quiz I've
taken the personality quiz that I
created over two years ago and added in
all the different functionality and
answered all the questions that I have
received over the past two years to make
this what I consider to be the best
personality quiz online so what are you
going to get out of this you're going to
receive the most advanced personality
test and everything I talk about here is
free a hundred percent you're going to
learn how to identify both your
personality as well as all the other
sixteen different personality styles
very very quickly so where did this all
come from what I did was I combined both
the myers-briggs and the kursi
personality analysis and then I tore out
all the jargon and made everything much
much easier to understand once you
understand all this stuff you're going
to be able to spot both your gifts your
weaknesses why you disagree with others
why other people disagree with others
and you're going to learn how to improve
your communications with other people
and a whole bunch more the major change
that I put about here was that I
simplified everything and cut all the
jargon out and as this presentation
continues you're going to be able to see
just how easy it is to spot different
personality types I broke everything
into what are called Duty seekers what
does that mean that means that their
personality focuses on accomplishing
tasks then you have action seekers these
are people that's life goals are all set
about in regards to action then I broke
everything down into bowls givers recipe
followers planners and all these other
different types I'm going to show you a
report in a second then you have a
knowledge seekers and you have the value
seekers but you might ask yourself what
exactly is a personality a personality
quite simply is how a person prefers to
take in information and make decisions
that is it now it's very very powerful
however because if you understand
different personality types you'll be
able to improve your communication and
your persuasion abilities let's take a
look at a report I am a recipe follower
and as you can see here from this report
and there's Martha Stewart who is a
perfect example of a recipe follower we
have here just a little brief
introduction into what or a speii
follower is and then on the left side of
the screen we have all the abilities of
the recipe fall where these are all the
things that you do very well if you fall
into this subset and then here if you
are a follower this explains all the
different reasons why other people might
disagree with you if you can't see this
all this in
available underneath of the video and
you can also watch this full screen so
in this simple one page you're going to
see all the things you're great at and
if you're having trouble with anybody
more than likely this bulleted list is
going to explain exactly why you have
trouble with the people that you have
trouble with and then I go into more
specifics in regards to all the other
different personality types well the one
thing that's very important about this
thing you see here on the screen is this
code up here by the end of this
presentation you're going to be able to
work out and figure out what your code
is and then hence figure out what
personality type you lie in so what do
all these letters mean well here I break
it down the first letter tells you how
you focus your attention and energize
yourself meaning that you're either an
extrovert or an introvert a kin
information being either sensing or
intuitive how you evaluate information
and make decisions whether you are a
thinker or a feeler and I want to
reinforce that there is no wrong way to
be in regards to personality and then
finally whether you prefer getting a job
done or following a plan so what do we
mean exactly by extroverts or introverts
well this refers to a person's ability
to energize themselves either through
the outside world interaction with other
people or are they energized by
themselves and an introvert even though
modern society believes it's true
doesn't mean a person is necessarily
antisocial an extrovert acts and then
thanks a seek interaction very talkative
like variety and they think out loud
while an introvert thinks and then
speaks likes alone time tends to be
twelve very quiet
likes to think about one thing at a time
and they best think through problems
with themselves then you have sensors
versus intuitive sounds really
complicated but it's really not a sensor
trust past experiences values common
sense focuses on problems considered
realistic and consider specifics to be
very very important and they prefer
facts while an intuitive trust hunches
tend to be more innovative focus on
goals tend to have a much more developed
imagination prefer the big picture over
specifics and they prefer insight then
you have the thinker's these people are
not easily insulted they just make
decisions with their head tend to be
very direct objective and like
you analyze facts while feelers tend to
insult it easily decide with their heart
tend to be indirect and they are
convinced by values or feelings now
modern society would tell you that a
thinker is better than a feeler however
what a thinker prefers to do really is
make decisions by just laying out a
whole bunch of facts and analyzing those
facts and then making decision however a
feeler what they prefer to do is find a
person that they consider to be an
expert make a decision on whether they
trust that person or not and then make
their decision based off of that experts
opinion see there's no positive or
negative personality type then you have
judging people versus perceiving people
judging people are very structured they
seek goals they like finishing projects
they like to plan and a value order
while perceivers are more easygoing they
like starting projects they adapt as
things come up and they value taking
their time so let's analyze this more
specifically I'm going to look at a bull
bulls are extroverted they act and then
they think they seek interaction they're
very talkative they like variety and
they think out loud they are also
sensors they trust past experience they
focus on problems very realistic
specifics are very important to them
they are also thinkers which means they
decide with their head they're very a
direct and objective again you can just
see the force that a bull would put upon
somebody and then finally to apply even
more force they are judging which means
they like finishing projects they set
forth a plan and they push forward until
that project or that plan succeeds what
do you do if you want to find out what
personality you're dealing with pretty
quickly well as you're gonna find out in
a second for the most part in society
you're only going to deal with a very
limited number of personalities however
this works most of the time like I said
there's a really long questionnaire at
the end of this tutorial that'll give
you a very exact personality but this
works most of the time you want to find
out if somebody's an extrovert versus an
introvert just ask them do you prefer
working in groups extrovert or on your
own introvert then if you want to find
out somebody's a sensor or an intuitive
which is most important specifics it's a
sensor or the big picture that means an
intuitive do you act on what feels right
feeler or do you study all the facts
thinker and then the final one do you
like to plan this means the person is a
judging person or
adapt this means they're a perceiving
person and of course I have the letters
all lined up here so that you could put
together the codes and find out the
exact personality you're dealing with
now if we look at the mail personality
types you can see right here that males
tend to be recipe followers as you can
see right here with this orange bar and
they also tend to be bulls this is the
duty seeking category these first four
bars so you can see just how much of the
male personality type is in this one
quadrant people in general however Duty
seekers here I broke down the most
common personality types being recipe
followers bowls calculators inventors
and geniuses and the least common being
teachers counselors compassionate
scamander's and friends females as you
can see very similar also tend to be
Duty seekers and by looking at this you
can see that it's going to be pretty
easy to figure out a personality type
because there's not going to be much
difference between the male or the
female personality types and the vast
majority or the percentage of
personalities all lie in the duty
seeking quadrant they tend to be
planners givers recipe followers bowls
for friends and then of course tend to
not be commanders visionaries inventors
counselors or teachers so which groups
are going to tend to get along well Duty
seekers action seekers knowledge seekers
and value seekers all tend to get along
because their main goals in life and
what drives them are very very similar
meaning Duty seekers focus on
accomplishing tasks action secret seek
action on secrecy knowledge and value
seekers seek to fulfill their values so
now I want to focus in on exactly two
groups that often would not get along
now I said before let's just focus in on
males specifically now twelve point nine
percent of males are what we call holes
while 6.2 percent of males still a
pretty high percentage or what we call
jumping beans well I'm just gonna write
beans here these two groups have a
tendency to not get along and if you see
arguments or fights between males
chances are it's a bull fighting with a
bean now exactly why is that let's take
the different personality codes we have
Bulls which are E's which means they
what do they do they talk and then they
think about what they just said followed
by an sa-2
II and AJ then you have beans they are
also extroverts which means they talked
before they think then followed by what
and F Peas
as you can see right here these letters
are completely in conflict and at the
same time
you better believe that they are both
going to talk about why their position
is most important now if you want to
calm down this situation a bowl is going
to have to realise as well as a bean is
going to have to realize that these are
their conflict areas and they're going
to need to change those to be able to
get along and properly communicate if
they do not actively try to communicate
with each other they will do nothing but
disagree so this is why personality
analysis is very very important there's
been a lot of confusion in regards to
how to answer this guy basically what
you need to do is everything goes from
left to right so you answer the question
which is going to come at the end of
this video if your answer is a you put a
mark there and then if the next question
your answer is also a you put a mark
there and then if your next answer is a
B and a B and so forth and so on so the
whole entire answer sheet is answered
from left to right then we get into a
little bit confusion down here in
regards to how we add all this stuff up
well here I have an answer sheet that's
actually been completed and if we scroll
way down here what you need to do is add
up all of the different information in
the columns so here I have two x's in
here I have eight x's what does that
mean that means in this situation person
an answer this test is an introvert then
things get a little bit more complicated
you're going to need to add both of the
columns the second and the third one and
whenever you do that you're going to
have here two as a result eight here as
a result three here as a result seven
there as a result and then whenever you
add all of these up you're going to have
five and 15 what does that mean that
means you're an N so we're going to come
over here and we're gonna go I and we're
going to go n then if we add this qalam
up this is going to work out to being 16
+ 4 and then in the final column if we
add these up this is not common but it
does happen here we got the same exact
values in both of these columns in that
situation what do you do you choose the
item on the right so in this situation
is
person is an AI and T P now why is that
that we choose the item on the right the
reason why is society thinks that we
should all be e s T J's and why is that
the reason why is the vast majority of
leaders and managers are what are called
bowls which we talked about earlier and
what is a bowl and E s T J so if society
puts pressure on us to go and actually
answer questions in ways that are not
true which often happen that's whenever
we tend to get these answers in which we
answer positive on an equal basis for
these two different ways of analyzing
information so now that I've gone
through all of that stuff I'm going to
proceed through the presentation and
based off of input from you guys I'm
going to speed through this and just
rely on you to hit both the play and the
pause button then you'll pretty able to
progress through these questions as
quickly as you want to so go and get
your answer sheet if you do not have
them already or you can just do this on
paper but the answer sheet will be
easier and I'm going to speed through
these questions
okay the test is over if you guys have
any questions or comments please leave
them down below I find this information
to be extremely important and I found
that it helps people a great deal of the
last til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
