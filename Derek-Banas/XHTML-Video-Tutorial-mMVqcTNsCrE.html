tutorial on the differences between HTML
and XHTML XHTML stands for extensible
hypertext markup language and at the end
of this tutorial you will be able to
tell people that you know how to write
extensible hypertext markup language
version 1 strict that is w3c compliant
doesn't that make you sound impressive
after my previous tutorial which I
taught you HTML with over 50 different
tags in under 15 minutes there were a
couple things that were brought up by
you guys out there one of them was that
whenever you are writing HTML you
actually should not have this closing
tag right here and that is indeed true
if you are going to be writing
traditional version for HTML
however with XML you always want to put
it in there and that's why I made that
little mistake also in any meta tags you
want to get rid of that if you are
writing HTML and you would also
eliminate that closing tag in any links
as well as images only two other things
came up in comments that you guys wanted
me to cover and one of them was how to
link to different parts within the same
page well I'm going to show you how to
do that here right now and you can see
on the right side of the screen this is
basically what was left over from the
last tutorial but if you wanted to
create a link to another part of your
page you would type in H reference again
this creates a link equal to in this
situation I'm gonna put pound and I'm
going to type in great stuff right like
that that simple I'm going to go to
great stuff and I'm going to close that
off right like that okay well now I got
to put the location for where you're
going to be sent to if you click on go
to great stuff and let's just go way
down here in the bottom right after all
of these lists so if I want to create a
location I just type in a and then
followed with name as equal to and I'm
going to type in great stuff close off
that tag and I'll just type in great
stuff right like that I'll save that
jump over here and if I click on here
you can see right here the link go to
great stuff and if I click on it it will
show the great stuff here in the window
normally this would be displayed at the
very very top but the page ends right
here so that's the reason why that's not
like that so that's how you would create
a link within your individual page and
the only other thing I'm actually going
to delete this out but you guys thought
I should have covered guys are very
smart and tasman was the guy who saw
that little error there what I put that
backspace in I want to give him credit
you know the other thing you guys wanted
me to could make sure that I covered is
how to create a link that would
automatically open up your mail software
to email somebody and again it's a H
reference just with any link that's
exactly what you would do then you click
on mail to and if I had an AOL account
this would work and you just type in
your email address and if you would like
to tag on a subject that would
automatically be added to this gun you
could type in hello and then if you want
to put any spaces in a URL you would put
a percent sign followed by two oh and
I'm going to type in hello again and
close that off send me a message all
right if I file save that and reload it
you can see send me a message is here
and if somebody clicks on it it'll
automatically open up my mailbox and
send an email so that is how that would
work so those are the two things you
guys thought I should have covered and
I'm glad you brought those up now on to
what this tutorial is about which is
XHTML the really aren't major
differences between HTML and XHTML but
of course there are some and just so you
know that what I'm going to do here is
definitely going to be XHTML compliant
you can see here I already validated it
so I went to validator dot w3.org
forward slash check and if you plug in
your code they will tell you if it is
valid XHTML one strict okay so we know
this works because I already checked it
well the next thing you got to do you
got to change your doctype and i'm going
to come in here this is all the same
right up until this point here I'm going
to put an X in and of course this is
going to change to 1.0 strict /e and two
slashes there and just don't so I don't
confuse myself let's just get rid of all
this right down to this point and then
you're going to type in HTTP colon
forward slash wwww three org board /tr
XHTML one /d TD for
slash HTML 1 - strict this is just
telling the browser what type of file
that is working with DTD and then link
okay and all this code is it and you
think tank comm and it's located in the
underbar you can get it because i don't
know anybody that types us in everybody
just cops and face it alright then
you're going to make a couple other
little changes in your HTML tag here you
get a type in XML and s is equal to HTTP
colon forward slash W w3.org ford slash
1999 /x HTML XML colon language we're
just lying to find that you're doing in
English if that's what you're doing and
then you can type in lang is equal to
and again English there yet so that's
all fine and dandy we come down here to
this meta tag which is in regards to
your content type there's a lot of talk
about the content type actually being
changed to application /e XHTML plus XML
but so forth this isn't compatible in
all the different browsers so we're
going to keep that the same the other
thing is with XHTML you definitely
always want to have a closing tag which
is this forward slash and this is also
true if you put any break statements
inside that's how you create a break
statement which skips to the next line
but then we move onwards any defining of
styles of any type in XHTML is frowned
upon so you would not want that in there
you would instead want to link to any
CSS files for any styling period
everything else here is perfectly fine
because I do have these ending tags here
so that's all perfectly fine and good
but as we scroll down here there are
some things that need to be changed but
you have to understand I'm just going to
type these out for you
XHTML doesn't allow you to use a couple
HTML tags good thing is most of them
aren't really used commonly anyway but
occasionally people use Center you're
not allowed to use Center anymore you're
also not allowed use font
you're not allowed use frame allowed to
use iframe allowed to use menu strike
for strike or underlined so those are
the tags that you are not allowed to use
that you would normally be allowed to
use in regular HTML and it provides you
that just for completionists reasons
also on top of that you're required to
have all your inline out
moments be placed inside of block
elements I'm going to explain this in a
second in the body section of your HTML
you're in inline elements are those
elements that don't force a line break
after their closing tags and you can
exceed examples of them here with the
abbreviation and the acronym that is why
they're showing up all on the same line
see there's no line break here something
abbreviated ASAP I want this so this
means they're in line for their block
statements such as h1 is a block
statement you can see that here because
there's a line break right here also the
paragraph tag is a block tag as well so
with XHTML you have to surround all
these in lines with block code and
that's not really that big of a deal
jump over here the easiest way to do
this is just to put paragraph tag around
all of the inline statements so let's
jump right here in front of abbreviation
and put a P inside of there and then
let's come down here and close off the
paragraph tag now this is all XHTML
compliant remember we didn't have to do
this with the h1 tag because it's a
block element another requirement to
make this XHTML compliant is if you use
block quotes you have to surround the
information that isn't contained inside
with paragraph tags and of course you
have to always put the closing tag each
time if you create these guys and also
you wouldn't be allowed to come in here
obviously and put the paragraph tag out
there you want to always close all of
your other tags before you create any
new ones ok and of course you're not
allowed to use Center so we're going to
get rid of that and we're also not
allowed to use the strike tag so I'm
going to get rid of that but all the
other tags that we have here on the
screen are all perfectly fine so we
don't need to worry about changing any
of those and of course we come in here
in front of this emphasis tag and then
you can close these open these create
paragraphs wherever you want to from
that point on but all these got little
guys these inline statements have to be
surrounded with paragraph tags ok so now
all that is XHTML compliant as well your
image so I have this image file right
here also needs to be surrounded with
paragraph tag ok everything else there
is perfectly fine and everything we do
here in this list area does not need
be changed that is also all XHTML
compliant and it doesn't need to be
surrounded with paragraph tags if
however I have a link that I created and
let's just make it real simple and
previously I put target is equal to
underscore blank so that it would open
up a new window whenever this link was
actually clicked on in XHTML you're no
longer allowed to use this target you're
able to get around this using CSS but to
make this XHTML compliant you're not
allowed to have that sorry then we jump
down to the form area and here to make
this all HTML compliant all we're going
to need to do is put all of these guys
which again they're inline they do not
force a line break we have to put all of
these inside of paragraph tags right
like that
and then you would just continue to do
that over and over again for each one of
those tags okay so now all of those are
HTML compliant have all of them
surrounded with paragraph tags and
you're also going to want to put a
paragraph tag around your button and
this hidden field and if you do all that
your webpage is now X HTML version 1
strict compliant like I said before if
you jump over to validator w3.org for
slash chat you can paste all of the
source from your web page directly
inside of there and check it and it will
tell you if you are XHTML one strict
compliant and if you are I think what
you get is a row board is you're allowed
to put this on your website so that is
how you make an HTML file XHTML
compliant if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
