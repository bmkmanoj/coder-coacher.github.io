2 of my tutorial in which I will teach
you how to make a light box for your
website if you didn't see the previous
part of this tutorial definitely check
it out first there I show you all the
HTML and CSS that goes into this guy
right here on the screen and today I'm
going to show you all the jQuery and
JavaScript that goes into creating this
lightbox and basically I'm going to give
you a rundown of what you see here on
the screen here this darkened area is
called light box background this
container right here is called lightbox
panel that holds all of our information
on our screen and you have the close
button the previous button and the next
button and every image or movie or
whatever that appears inside of this guy
is going to be of type class ntt media
file so that is what everything is going
to be so basically if you give an image
or a movie or anything that could
possibly show up inside of here the
class name ntt media file it's
automatically going to get loaded in
here and this will hold pretty much
anything you could ever imagine
size-wise so basically in this tutorial
I'm going to show you how to open the
lightbox I'm going to show you how to
show the lightbox background I'm going
to show you how to load the first image
I'm going to show you how to skip to the
next image by clicking on the image I'm
going to show you how to show the
previous image by clicking on the
previous button I'm also going to show
you how to go to the next image by
clicking on the next button I'm of
course going to show you how to close
the light box and also as you can see
how to get your lightbox to
automatically resize based off of
whatever content you have inside of here
so let's get coating now the name of
this file is light box j/s code AS it's
a javascript file and if you want access
to the code its there's a link in the
underbar that provides you links to a
zipped archive of everything that is
here even the images now since this is
jQuery we're going to start off by
saying whenever the document is ready or
it is loaded I want to run a function
and that's what this says and if you
don't know anything about jQuery I
provide a link to a tutorial on that
okay so what we're going to do first is
we need to open the lightbox up so we're
going to say we have a link that's what
a means and it has a class name of open
like
box and when it is clicked I want to run
another function don't need to define a
name for these functions and the first
thing that I'm going to do inside of
this function is look for an ID that's
why we use a hash character there named
lightbox background I'm going to say
that I want to change the opacity using
the CSS function to eighty-five percent
then I'm also going to say because even
though this information is on the screen
it's all hidden as you saw in the
previous tutorial so here I'm going to
make all the hidden parts of the light
box up here I just need to type in all
these different parts like I told you
before next button previous button and
i'm going to say i want to fade them in
which means they'll gradually appear on
the screen then what i want to do is get
the height width of the first image or
movie or whatever first media type that
is going to be displayed on the screen
so how i do that is i'm going to create
a new variable image height and i'm
going to say image with the class name
and TT media file I specifically want
the first one that is in the div and I
want to get its height that is exactly
how you do that then I'm actually going
to copy this cuz I also want the width
and to get the width is almost identical
except of course you got to change this
to width and change this to width there
you go now with that information I'm
going to change the size of the parent
div that surrounds all of the media so
what I mean there you can see here was
the length that I just just talking
about I want to create this box that's
going to contain this media and since I
know the size of the media I'm going to
be able to do that I'm gonna say this is
how you do everything in jquery so I'm
saying that I want again get that image
that is appearing and I want the parent
meaning i want that which surrounds it
which just so happens to be a div and
i'm going to use the animate function to
have it change the height of this div
and then I'm going to add a hundred
pixels at the end cuz im using pixels
for everything here and that's how you
add 100 pixels and that'll give me a
little bit extra room at the bottom for
my buttons and then I'm just going to
leave wit that way and I'm going to say
that I want these changes to slowly take
effect and
and we're going to close this function
this function right here I'm going to
come back here and close it off all
right so this is the first thing that's
going to occur whenever that link is
clicked and the light box is open that's
all that's all the code that's required
and now what I'm going to do is actually
set up the close button so I'm going to
say if an image with an ID of close
panel is clicked on I want to run this
function then what we're going to do is
we are going to do the opposite of this
we're going to make everything disappear
and to do that we're going to come in
here and we're going to say fade out and
that's it that's all we need to do to
make that work and now that function is
effectively closed done that's all it
took in a social space and now I'll show
you how to use all the code for the next
button so that when that next button is
clicked it's going to automatically
trigger a click event which is going to
put a new image on the screen so we got
to do there again use this handy dandy
Jake everything next media which is the
knee ID for this image just create a
function here i'm saying i want to
target the current visible image that
has the class type and TT media file and
i want to trigger a click on it just as
if someone clicked on it because here in
a minute I'm going to handle that event
and I'm going to show you how to put a
new image on-screen and another thing is
pretty handy is to be able to close the
lightbox if the escape button is pressed
well want to do that because that's a
common thing people do they don't know
what that X means in the bottom corner
and we're going to capture the event
that's what the e stands for and we're
going to say if the key pressed we say
key code make sure that C is uppercase
is equal to 27 which is the key code for
the escape key what do we want to do we
want to fade out everything let's just
copy this and fade it all out I took
good see if you break this down there's
not that much code involved and we want
to close off that function and now we're
going to create the function that was
triggered right here whenever the next
button was clicked and this guy is going
to show the next image whenever an image
is clicked there's no reason to do this
twice you know handle these clicks so
I'm having any time somebody clicks on
the neck
but and I'm going to act like they
actually clicked on the image and then
everything is going to be handled right
here scroll this up I'm going to say ntt
media file which is the class if it is
clicked I guess what I want to run
another function don't need any
attributes for that function I'm going
to say if this meaning the thing that
was clicked that's what this is a
reference to this is a reference to this
penguin picture or this money picture
that is what this is it is what was
clicked and then here I have to check to
see if there are any more images to load
so how am I going to do that I'm going
to go ntt and here I'm checking to see
if there are any more images to load and
i'm using the next function to do that
so I'm saying does the next image of
class type NTT media file have anything
in it how you find that out as you say
the length and then you go is it equal
to 0 if it is equal to 0 which means it
doesn't exist what we want to do is we
want to close all visible images or
whatever of type ntt media file if they
are visible and how you do that is by
saying toggle and then what I want to do
is flip back to the first image that is
of type NTT media file again NTT media
file first and yes I could do this in
easier ways meaning a little bit less
code but I'm trying to explain this
stuff so if you ever wonder why is he
doing it that way the reason why is
understandability I want it you to
understand what I'm doing and then so
that I do not need to resize the div
over and over and over again I am
actually going to create a function
called NTT resize div and that's just
going to resize the div that surrounds
this media that's it now if there is an
image available in the next position
what we want to do is we want to load it
so again we want all the current things
that are on the screen to be deleted so
just reuse this code point then what I
want to say is this next item that I
know exists I went to toggle it which
means I want to make it appear on the
screen and then after I bring it on the
screen I want to Reese
the div to make sure that the div
properly surrounds it and that's it that
functions over that's all the code it
took to do all that complicated stuff
and also this is the function that's
going to be called if the next button is
clicked on as we saw right here see we
triggered an event on an image whenever
the next button was clicked which is
going to trigger this function down here
and then everything's going to run and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to trigger some events if the
previous button is clicked on now I'm
just going to copy this just to save
myself some time and change a couple
things I know code reuse is wonderful
but I couldn't figure out a non
complicated way to do this so that's why
I'm doing it this way so I'm going to
say ntt if the previous button is
clicked I'm going to run a function and
this guy's going to say if and in this
situation I'm not going to be able to
use this because this is actually the
previous button that was clicked so what
I want to do instead is go ntt media
file visible so I'm saying on whatever
the current image is that is being
displayed on the screen I want to check
if the previous image to it with the
same class name and TT media file
contains anything because I want to
check if there's a previous image before
I try to load it on the screen otherwise
everything will fall apart won't cry if
it doesn't exist I want to toggle all of
the current images to their off position
so they're not shown and then I want to
display the last image on the screen
it's just the opposite of what we had
before everything else is the same here
else if there is something on the screen
I need to get the current index value
for the media item that has shown or the
image that is being shown so I'm going
to create a new variable it's going to
be called NTT current media shown and
yes I always use very very long-winded
names and it aggravates a lot of people
media file and I'm going to say the
visible item I want to reach free of the
index for it which means the number like
an array that is associated with the
order of those images see if we go here
we close this and reload it just like an
array this is going to have an index of
0 this is going to have any index 1 this
is going to have an index of 2 this is
going to have an index 0 3 so I need to
find out what those indexes are to be
able to do what i want to do here
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create another variable and it's going
to be called ntt previous item to show
and I'm going to take this index right
here and if I want the previous index
what do i do is subtract one not that
hard and then I'm going to toggle off or
delete all of the current media that is
being displayed inside of my lightbox
that's what this line is just like
before and then I need to toggle on the
new one so i'm going to copy this right
here remember i can't use this because
the thing that was clicked open this
function was the previous button and not
the image that was on the screen and
then i'm going to delete this say i'm
going to use the eq function to select a
media item based off of the index value
of it and the specific index that i want
to choose is this guy right here and i
want to toggle it on and then I want to
call this function and then this is the
end of most of the jQuery so close this
off and you're going to actually get to
see what this function looks like an it
we're all done that's all it took the
world of jQuery coding is easy so learn
it jquery is cross browser so anything
you do in jquery is going to work
anywhere even in absolutely horrible
internet explorer so what am I going to
do here well first I'm going to scroll
up so you can actually see this I'm
going to get the current height and
width of the visible media that is on
the screen remember I'm resizing the div
that surrounds the media here come in
here and how old do i do it ntt media
file and I want the visible media on
screen I don't want too tight and then I
want to copy this you just a width
change this to wit then I'm going to
define my margins remember the margin is
outside of the box or the div or
whatever you want to call it and I'm
going to take this guy and divide it by
2 or 4 and this is just the way it ended
up working out that's all this is left
and this is going to be with in the end
i'm going to say that i want to target
the image that is currently visible on
the screen and then I want to target the
parent the div that surrounds it and I
want to change some CSS cut on that div
that surrounds my image I want to say I
want to define my height as ntt image I
and I want to increase some pixels to
100 and then define my width and I want
to do this dynamically so it's a little
bit flashier
you can change this to whatever speed
and you could also define inside of here
a thousand which would make it occur or
this make this change occur over one
second or you can change it to two
thousand dead it out of that and then as
the final thing I'm going to make a
couple other little changes here to this
div so I can actually copy this and I'm
doing this on a separate area just to
keep everything a little bit more tied
together or pushed apart i guess i
should say i want the position on this
to be fixed scroll up i'm going to
define my top which means the upper
left-hand corner to be twenty-two
percent don't want the upper left-hand
corner I gotta define a left this'll be
22 again and again this is just the
numbers that ended up working out for me
I'm also going to define a minimum width
530 pixels because if somebody goes and
throws some sort of weird thumbnail
inside of there or whatever I want to
make sure that the whole entire lightbox
doesn't collapse upon itself and here
I'm just defining my margins copy and
paste margin left margin left and I
don't need this guy and then I want to
close off this box all together so that
is all the jQuery code that is required
and JavaScript code to make every single
thing work here on the screen as you can
see it if you have any other questions
or comments leave them in the comment
section below eventually I'm going to
turn this into a wordpress plugin
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
