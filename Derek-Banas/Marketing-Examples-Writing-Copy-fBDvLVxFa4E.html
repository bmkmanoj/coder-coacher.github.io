you exactly the process that I as well
as most advertising executives go
through whenever they are trying to
create marketing and advertising
materials start off the first step in
advertising is to study the product
you're advertising because the more you
know about it the more likely you are to
come up with a big idea for selling it
obviously study the advertising of your
competitors as well he has seen what
they are doing that is giving them
success and when things they may be
doing that is hindering their success
find out what consumers think of your
product and why they would buy it there
is a lot that goes into the personality
of a product that most people don't
really look into whatever their first
creating a brand name obviously your
packaging your price a style of your ads
and the nature of the product what you
have to understand is when someone makes
a purchase ninety percent of what they
are actually purchasing is the marketing
behind the product not necessarily the
utility of the product itself so I have
to talk to business owners that say they
don't need to market this flies right in
the face of that because it's been
proven countless numbers of times the
people by the marketing so without
marketing you and then essence have
nothing to sell this is what most
copywriters fail they try to use clever
wordplay puns and cute coffee that
doesn't make for good headlines that are
that will pull somebody down into the
content which ultimately sells a person
when you make a purchase ask yourself do
you want to be amused or you just want a
quality product and a great price this
is why clever wordplay while it might
make you laugh doesn't alternatively
make you want to buy the product we are
not in the business also of being
original especially if you're a small
business you do not have the time money
wherewithal
background to create fabulous things
that are created what you want to do
instead is reuse that in which you know
already works and basically you find out
just by looking at what competitors are
doing again and what other marketers are
doing and receiving great successful
take what works and apply it to your own
product and win it's impelling memorable
and persuasive in beginning the creating
of a marketing brand you want to get all
the material possible related to the
product including your competitors ads
brochures catalogs articles market
research letters on the illustrations
photos everything you just want to pile
that all in front then what you want to
do with your own products is sit down
and first off write out the features for
the product or service that you sell
after you're done writing down the
features and next to those features you
want to write down the benefits so for
example a feature of a corner for
example might be that it gets 36 miles
to a gallon the benefit is you save
money on fuel so you have to think of
that mindset you have to write every
single thing down then you have to ask
what benefit is the most important write
that down then you have to ask how do
you differ from your competitors what
attributes can be stressed that have not
been stressed by your competitors and
you wouldn't be able to answer all these
questions unless you had all of your
competitors marketing material in front
of you as to what problem does the
product or service owns how does the
product work how long will the product
the last how economical is the product
how easy is it to use who has bought the
product and what do they say about it
you want to write down answers to every
one of these questions this is the
process the whole goal here is by
writing all this information
down you will at some point have of what
they refer to as a aha moment and that
is where you're going to get your great
ideas for marketing again ask what
options are available what service and
support do you offer and is the product
guaranteed then you want to ask
questions about your customers even ask
your customers themselves if you can't
you have to ask who is your customer
what does the product do for them why do
they need the product why do they need
it now
very specifically what is the customers
main concern when buying this product or
a type of product what will motivate the
buyer to buy with an emphasis on the
word now does the ad have to appeal to
more than just the direct fire determine
the objective of your coffee is it just
to generate inquiries answer inquiries
generate traffic either by telephone
website what-have-you just to stay in
touch
is this a marketing tool that you're
going to use in person is it going to
generate sales just purely on its own is
it going to be used to qualify prospects
show new ideas or just build recognition
most major corporations just need to
build recognition continue building it
and stay in touch that is why their
marketing is going to be completely
different than yours yours is to drive
traffic they already got the traffic
they just want to maintain it hence they
just want to stay in touch make you
laugh and keep you coming back
at the you create must follow these
following steps they must first capture
the processes attention you have to
figure out how you're gonna do that
if you answered all those questions from
the previous frames up that you're
having some ideas right now then you
want to maintain prospects interest how
are you gonna do that then you want to
move the prospect to a favorable action
either contact you or buy a product
there is little sales value a vibrating

blunt easy-to-understand language was

message matters to your customers
because five times as many people read
headlines as read the body copy to have
to make sure that your headline above
all is dynamite

see an advertisement then they look at
the illustration then they look at any
copy that explains the illustration and

the good money that you have in your
pocket you have to constantly think of

or this service do not make your
headline so short that it fails to fully
persuade all the weight headlines that
sound like they should be carved into a
monument like unusual times on these
we headlines that simply makes people
say oh how clever avoid meaningless
headlines and there's plenty of suggest
in a headline that coffee contains

thought remember keep it simple include
your brand name in the headline if your
advertising is named at a small group of
people for example people with asthma or
