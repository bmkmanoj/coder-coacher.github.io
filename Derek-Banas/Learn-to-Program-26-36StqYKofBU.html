26 of my learned program series I
decided because you guys asked for to do
one more TK inner tutorial a whole bunch
people asked me to do a TK inner
tutorial in which I showed how to
integrate TK in or with a database and
so here it is so in this one video I
will go through the whole entire process
step by step on how to create a TK inner
database system and I have a lot to do
so let's get into it
alright just like always all of the code
and a cheat sheet for this whole entire
video is available in the description
underneath the video and the only thing
I have done ahead of time is design the
database application the way it's going
to look now I own purpose kept this
extremely simple however we're going to
be able to do a whole heck of a lot with
this simple thing here just so you can
look at the code and completely
understand it so what we're going to be
able to do here is it's going to create
a database for us of course it's going
to create tables for us and then it's
going to allow us to come in here and
our first name and last name click on
submit put it down inside of a list box
if you click on that it's going to pull
that information from the database put
it back up inside of here then you'll be
able to go in and edit that information
click on update and it will update it in
the database so as you can see with this
very simple little layout here you're
going to be able to make pretty much any
type of database application you can
imagine so let's jump over and go
through the planning stage of exactly
how we're going to build the structure
of this thing all right so here we are
starting from step one well what I know
I am going to need is a couple modules
here so I'm going to import TK enter of
course and let's go and get T TK and
actually you guys could pause this video
right now and try to create what I just
showed you there and that would be a
great activity for and then you can sit
back and see how I made it or I'm going
to demonstrate exactly what I'm going to
do with this guy and then you could come
in and pause it after I go through the
step-by-step sort of use case that I'm
going to design here and then try to
create it or do whatever you like
alright so here it is it's a student
database so the very first thing I'm
going to think about here
what do I need to do and I'm going to
create all of my functions here for now
I'm going to leave out my class fields
but let's go and put them in here anyway
so class fields I know I'm going to have
to come back and I'm going to have to
create those guys now I'm going to
create the different functions well I
know I'm going to have to have a
function that is going to set up my
database all right so that's going to be
pretty self-explanatory and there that
is and then we can just come in here and
do something like set up database
alright pretty simple
what other functions am I going to need
well I'm going to need another function
that's going to allow them to submit
information so I'll just call this
students submit like I said I'm just
writing this out of my head so don't
expect the names to be exactly perfect
so let's come in here and we'll go
submit student whatever stud okay and
what else might I need well I'm going to
need a way to update my list box see I'm
just going through here and just easily
explaining all the simplistic ways and
all the different things that I'm going
to need and update and just do this box
like that I'm also going to need a way
to load my student information into
whenever they click on the list box it's
going to load into the entries so I'm
going to have to create that so load and
let's just call this student so there's
that and load stud and the next thing
and you might want to go and just you
know create or print out that little
diagram I showed you there draw it on a
piece of sketch pad just so you have it
in front of you so that you can see
exactly what I'm looking at right now
I'm also going to have to come in here
and create a way for them to update the
student information so just throw that
inside of there as well so update stud
and what else I'm going to need well I'm
going to need a way to initialize
everything so we'll just come in here
and do an init and I know that I'm going
to need route so let's go in here and do
that since I'm working with TK enter and
I don't know what else I'm going to do
for this right now so let's just leave
that
and then of course we also know that
outside my class I need to get a TK
object so let's go and create that guy
right there
and students database I'm going to need
to go and create my student database so
let's create that and we're going to
pass it route of course and also we need
our main loop alright so now we have a
rough overview of every single thing
that our application or our student
database objects are going to do set up
the database allow them to submit
students update the list box load
students update the student specifically
and initialize everything so now let's
think about the class fields that we are
going to need and whenever we're
thinking about this what we need to
think about are what types of pieces of
information are these different
functions going to be able to access so
what they're going to need is they're
going to need to have you know the
database connection of course because
all of them are going to have to connect
to that so let's just put that inside of
there and they're also going to need a
cursor that's going to be used to
traverse the records of the results and
if none of this makes any sense that's
because you haven't seen my database
part of this tutorial series and I'll
put a link in the description to that if
you want to go take a look at that but
as I go through this this whole entire
video I'm going to react splain all that
stuff so don't worry about it all right
now what else am I going to need I'm
also going to need to keep track of the
current student that is being selected
and I'm going to need to do that because
like for example if they click that they
want to low to students and we're
probably going to need to know how to
update that student all right so we're
also going to need that I'm just going
to give that a value of zero as well all
right so as of now that those are the
only things that jump to mind I'm going
to need a database connection for all
these guys I'm going to be able to
traverse that information for all these
guys and I'm going to need to keep track
of what student I'm working with alright
so as of now these are the things that I
know I need so what I like to do is to
get the actual design out of the way so
what I'm going to do now is
create this guy right here inside of my
application so like I said you could
draw a quick sketch and maybe even pause
the video and try to create it yourself
otherwise you can watch me create it
right now alright so I'm going to do
this in the initialization phase and the
very first thing that I want to do here
is I want to put a title on this and so
let's goes students database okay so we
have that created what else do I want to
do well I want to try to estimate how
big the box should look I really have no
idea so let's just go Joma tree and
let's do something like 300 by 350 let's
see what that looks like whenever we
create it and of course this needs to be
put inside of quotes okay so then I got
my first row so I have a label that says
first name and then I'm going to have an
entry box inside of it so let's go and
let's actually put first row inside of
here so first just so we can and divide
everything up and it's a little bit
easier to say so I have my first name
and label is going to be equal to label
to do so we pass in route and then the
text that we want there so our little
diagram we have says that the label is
going to be called first name and pretty
simple I'm then going to go in and
create my label and put it in a grid
system so it's going to start off on row
0 it's going to start off in column 0
I'm going to throw some padding on it
just because you know that looks a
little bit nicer so let's just do
padding all around with it and then I
want it to be pushed over to the left
side of the screen and how we can do
that is sticky W all right so that's
west or you know left side of the screen
then what I need to do is hold the
different changing values for first name
and so what I'm going to do this is
going to be for the entry box I'm going
to create another guy this is going to
be first name and entry and value
because what I want to do here is create
a string variable that I can tie to the
entry that is my entry widget that I'm
going to
creating here and this is going to be
route and it's going to start off with a
value of nothing so that's pretty simple
then I need to tie this to my entry
widget that I'm going to create here so
I can have N and this isn't going to be
entry value this is just going to be the
entry widgets and to create that I'm
going to go ttk entry and I'm doing it
this way so that if I wanted to come in
and style it more later on I could do it
that way and what I'm talking about is
the ttk part here not going to do it in
this part of the tutorial just doing it
because it doesn't hurt anything then I
need to tie it to the string variable
that I just created and to do that I go
variables text variable is going to be
equal to and self and FN entry value all
right so those are all going to be tied
together then I'll be able to reference
this guy this guy right here to change
the value in the entry box that we
create for ourselves and then after that
I just need to use the grid system to
put in my little entry here so this is
my entry widget so I'm going a grid and
row is equal to 0 and column is going to
be equal to 1 so this is row obviously
rows going left to right column is then
going to be horizontal so we're going to
have the label be first and then the
entry itself be second all right pretty
self-explanatory let's go and get this
as well and let's also grab sticky so
that is and there that is all right so
there we went we created our first row
and what I mean by that is we created
our first name being the label and this
guy being the entry box so now let's
create our second row won't we just copy
this and save ourselves some time so
let's do that paste that in there and
this is going to be the second row
second row and here we'll just change
this to last name label and this is
going to be last obviously and last name
label all this stuff obviously the row
this time we're going to be on the
second row which
is one column zero is perfectly fine
change this to I'll change this to L
that oh we can leave that be the same we
can leave this be the same this is going
to be last name entry value and last
name entry and then just make sure that
this is on the first row and this is on
the next column after that let's run it
see what happens so when we get some
sort of silly error so ducted uh lan
labels not defined and that's line 42 so
42 up say got rid of got rid of that guy
no problem and as I'm going here I'm
just going to occasionally run it to
just see if I made any type of little
silly mistakes randomly and we could run
it again and here we can see that is
what we got so far so looking pretty
good all right so now let's go and
create our two little buttons that we
have so there we're going to then come
in once again this is going to be our
third row and then we just need to put
two buttons inside of there so I'm going
to go self and I'm going to call this
submit button because that's what it is
and ttk create our button instance
widgets and it's going to be tied to
route just like before the text on this
guy is going to be submit obviously
because that's what our little diagram
we got from our people told us to do and
then I'm going to go command and I need
to tie this to a function that I'm going
to call whenever it's clicked on and
that is student submit right there so
stud submit so we'll just type in stud
submit and at any time they click on the
submit button it's going to call for
that function to execute next thing I
need to do is just go and put it in the
grid so submit and button M grid and I'm
going to basically do the same sort of
thing here this is going to be row 2/3
but you know starts at zero going to do
a column is going to be zero obviously
and you know what let's just go and use
exactly the same stuff here so the
padding and sticky and let's throw that
in there
alright so that's pretty cool then we're
going to have update right next to it so
let's go and throw that inside of here
and just change this to update and
change this to update and the text is
going to be update and we are going to
change this this is going to be Row two
but this is going to be column one and I
think that's everything let's run it see
what happens and there we are and I'd
like the update to be merged over here
to the right so I'm going to go over to
the sticky part I'm going to get rid of
it so let's do that and run it and there
we go and we'll see how this lays out
whenever we do our little list box side
of there but that's looking pretty okay
alright so now we need to go and get our
little list box and throw it inside of
there so this is going to be our fourth
row and I'm going to throw a scroll bar
here but I'm not certain that I'm going
to use it or not and then let's create
our list box and throw it inside there
so I'm going to go self and list box is
equal to and list box and that's going
in roots of course and once again we're
going to go self and list box and here
I'd like to bind it so that when one of
the whenever the list box is clicked on
that it's going to load the student in
the two entries whenever it's going so
once again if they come in here and they
click on Derrick pianist then it's going
to load these two entries with that
information to do that to bind to a list
box click I just go a list box select
and then close that off and then an I
tell it what function to call whenever
the list box items are clicked and what
did I call it I call it load students so
that is I can get rid of those two guys
is this is going to be student submit
this guy up here well let's leave that
in there but this is going to be student
update
update all right so now we have that set
up I'd also like to start off if there
is nothing in the list box that there's
going to be like a little bit of
information in regards to what will go
there so I'm going to insert a little
message in there I'm going to start at
index one and it's just going to go
students here just so there's a little
message there whenever they first create
their application and whenever the
application first loads and then I need
to just place all of this into the grid
system so a list box and I will say grid
and this is going to be Row 3 now column
is going to be equal to 0 because the
leftmost I want this to span over all of
the available space so there are going
to be three boxes that I want to fill in
here so I'm going to go call them span
is equal to 4 and then we're just going
to do our paddocks thing here again so
pet X and I want it to fill all of the
available space let's go down to the
next line there's that and I want it to
start at the west most and cover the
east most so I wanted to cover all of
the available space that's what the W
and E mean there and then also to finish
off initializing because remember I'm
initializing my interface here to
initialize this I want to then call from
my database to be created and I'm going
to create that in my setup DB function
that I have up above already define that
and then of course if there is any
information put inside of this list box
I want to take it and put it in the list
box whenever everything first loads so
we'll go list box and there we are so as
far as I know that is all we need to do
in regards to initializing our
application on startup and so because
the initialization function is going to
be the very first function that is run
and at the end of it setup DB is going
to be the first function that has run
I'm now going to create set up DB all
right so what do we need to do to set up
our database let's just walk through the
steps once again so I need to
open or create my database that's the
very first thing that I want to do then
what I want to do is I want to go and
create the cursor so I will be able to
traverse the records of my database so
let's go create cursor and the next
thing we're going to need to do is to
create the table then I'm going to store
all this information in if it doesn't
exist so that's something I'm going to
need to check for and is there anything
else I need to do I don't think so so I
want to keep my functions nice and neat
and small as possible so first thing I
need to do is open or create my database
so I just go sofe and then I'm going to
go DB connect to my database and I'm
going to use in SQLite database Connect
and I am going to call it students DB
because it's a student database so it
makes sense all right so we're moving
right along here getting a lot of stuff
done so let's go now and create the
cursor I already gave it the name up
here so there that is and to create that
we just go self DB connect and then you
go okay I want the cursor so that's what
that does create my table if it doesn't
exist now here I need to understand a
little bit of SQL so I'm gonna walk you
through exactly what goes on here what
I'm doing but like I said you may you
know if you need more information on
what I'm going to explain to you then
you're going to have to go back in this
learned program series and take a look
at you know the SQL SQL like part of it
so to create a table pretty simple you
just go create table now remember it
says if it doesn't already exist well
how do I check if it if it already
exists or not it's actually pretty
simple you say if not exist alright so
that's pretty simple and then we're
going to call it what our table is going
to be called students now what am I
going to need for each student to
differentiate them from each other well
I need an ID so I'm going to go and
create a student ID here and how you do
that it's going to
an integer and I want it to be a primary
key that means that it's going to be
used also to differentiate each student
from each other primary key is sort of
another way of saying that I want it to
automatically each time a new student is
entered in database to automatically
increment the ID so I don't have to
worry about doing that guess how you do
that you go Auto increments pretty
simple and I want every single student
to definitely have an ID how you do that
is you say not null so that's what all
that stuff means as we know I'm going to
be storing a first name inside of here
it is going to be text and I definitely
want that to be a requirement and that's
what not null means again then I want a
last name inside of it and it's going to
be text and it's also going to be not at
all
all right so there we are we got
everything that we want to put inside of
there and here how you create an SQL
command you want to run as you put
semicolon inside of there right along
with this double quote outside here and
then that guy right there all right so
that is going to create our database
table for us and it's just yelling at me
telling me that's too long I don't care
that's how long it's going to take all
right another thing we want to do here
is this might cause an error whenever we
call for this guy to execute we could
actually we come in here and put a try
block around all this but I'm gonna put
a try block around this part only so I'm
going to say try and then what that
means is I need to end all of this so
there we are so tri is just going to
protect us from getting an error and
we're going to try to handle that error
if it happens then after you create a
command that you want to execute you
have to go and call your database
connection and you need to tell it to
commit that execution that we want right
there and that's what that's going to do
for us then I want to catch any
potential errors so we do that with
accept and more than likely if we have
an exception here x2 I'll light wise
it's going to be an operational error so
we're going to go operational error
there that is right there operational
error and here what we're going to do is
we're just going to print out a message
that's going to say there is an error
and we can debug that later if there's
something that could happen
so we'll say something like table not
created all right do I need to do
anything else I don't think so
there we are now we know how to set up
our database so what do we want to do
next well we want to come in here and we
want to figure out what happens whenever
a student is submitted
well basically all I'm going to need to
do here is insert the student into the
database and what else do I want to do
well whenever the student is submitted
into the database this is just me
talking out of my head right now
I'm thinking to myself I probably want
to clear the entry boxes where the first
and last name are so let's go and let's
also do that clear entry boxes and
anything else so we need to do well of
course if we just submitted a new
student we want that student's name to
go into our list box so we'll say update
list box all right so now we got to go
in here and let's create this guy so
what we need to do ear is execute
another command inside of our database
so we're going to have to go and get our
database connection and we're going to
need to execute a command and anytime
you want to insert some information in
the database you call insert into and
the students table this table we just
created up here and what are we going to
insert for awhile remember the ID is
going to auto increment so we don't need
to worry about doing anything except
submitting the first name and the last
name inside of there and close that off
and I want to separate these into a
couple different lines so it's easier to
look at then what you do is you say
values and let's go and put space here
because we need to put a space between
that and values and then what you do is
you
put another bracket inside of there and
you need to put the first name and so
forth then the last name you have to
surround them with quotes so I'm going
to put a single quote here so it doesn't
get confused with the double quotes that
we have there already and then I'm going
to go down to the next line and actually
get the information from the entry box
remember we are submitting a students
and we're getting it from the entry box
and I want specifically the FN entry
value and how I get it is by calling the
get function and we're going to go plus
and then I'm going to put a single quote
there to close off this single quote
right there they put an extra one in
there so be careful that you don't you
know leave that there or actually I'm
going to put my double quotes and then
we'll have a single quote right there
then I'm going to put a comma and a
space and then I'm going to have another
single quote and another double quote if
you get any type of error with this just
jump to my website again it's in the
description copy and paste the code then
you'll see the difference between the
single quotes and the double quotes kind
of hard to see here on the screen then
we're going to do exactly the same thing
with the last name let's just go and
copy this and let's paste that inside of
there and this is just going to be last
name entry value and there's get and
then we're going to once again have plus
there and this is going to close off
this that that there and after this
we're going to have a closing bracket
for our value and we are then going to
close off the whole entire thing so
hopefully I did all that right so next
thing I need to do is to clear my entry
boxes and to do that you just go so and
you reference the entry box that you
have here so you go that and see leet
zero and end and that calls for the
first name entry box to that you know
the name and air to be deleted and this
is going to call for the last name to be
deleted and I also have update my list
box that's something else I want to do
so let's come in here
and let's update our list box to do that
we just go to solve update list box and
I'm going to call for that and figure
out what I want to do there so as you
can see again this function basically
has four statements inside of it this
guy right here had what not that many
setup the date of it I mean we set up
the database in one two three four
pretty much four main lines with the try
block to catch any errors so now we are
calling for update list box so I should
probably come in here and create the
update list box function alright so now
it's time for us to think about what
happens whenever we update our list box
well we're going to go and get the
entire list of students from our
database and put them in the list box
but chances are there's already going to
be some things inside of the list box so
what I want to do is I want to delete
the items in the list box so let's do
that first
next thing I want to do is get these
students from the database and order
then after we get all of those students
out of there we want to put the students
in the list box so put students in this
box and we need to do anything else
not really we need to use try-catch
blocks to go in there and catch any
exceptions but that's it so how do we
delete items in our list box well we
just call for self and then list box dot
delete zero and end now we need to get
our students from our database and to do
that we are going to remember we're
going to use a try block here and then
when we get the result by calling our
database we'll go self we're going to
use our cursor here and we're going to
say execute and to get information or
select information from the database you
go select and what do I want
I want the ID I want the first name I
want the last name and then how I'm
going to go from students obviously that
is the table that I'm going to be
pulling information from so that's going
to get me all of the students with their
ID first name last name and after I get
those results what I want to do is
throw them into my list box so I'm going
to say four row in result and row is
just going to be each individual student
pulled from the database and then to go
and get all that information out if I
want the student ID well the student ID
is the very first thing we're pulling
out of here so that is going to be in
the zero index of our row and then if I
want to get the students first name that
is going to be in the next index of our
results and the last name is going to be
Row two there we are
so now we got all that information and
now I need to put - that information
into my list box how I do that is go
self and list box and we call insert
that's how we put that information in
and student ID and that is going to
represent not only the ID for each of
the individual students but it's also
going to represent the index for the
student information just another way for
me to store it and also keep track of
everything so that'll work out real nice
and then I need to put the student name
first name and last name just like you
see right here so it's going to go first
name and last name and as you can see
the ID doesn't show it's the index for
each of the list box items alright so
we're going to go students and first
name and then of course there's a space
between those two guys let's do this and
then we'll go student and last name
inside of there and that's it so that's
going to go and put that information
inside of there and that's this guy put
students in list box so we can go and
copy this out of here and paste it right
there so that we know it's thoroughly
commented and somebody can read this and
understand it so there's the try block
so now I need to come in here and go and
catch an error so rather than type that
out let's go and just copy this
we are lazy or at least I am and make
sure it lines up with the try block
whoops see there's the try block this is
where the exception goes throw that
inside of there and here what I'm going
to do very often whenever I'm doing I'm
tracking errors I like to put one inside
of here especially if I'm going to do
the same thing over and over again I'm
actually going to do it to the bottom
part though so let's just here go here
and we'll say the table doesn't exist
and then let's catch default exceptions
as well so we'll go except and here we
all go for now another message so I'm
going to say one because this is an
error that definitely could be triggered
couldn't retrieve data from database all
right so there's that and do I need to
do anything else not as far as I know
and all right so now what we need to do
is load our student information and what
this is going to do is load list box you
know items that are selected into our
entries so what are we going to need to
do once that is called well we're going
to have to get the index selected and
that's also going to be which is student
ID and what else are we going to have to
do well and just so you know load
students if we scroll down here that's
going to be what's called whenever a
scrollbar or whenever a list box item is
clicked on so that's what this guys
doing so it's going to get the index
that was selected which is going to be
the student ID and it is also going to
need to come in here and call for the
events because I'm going to need to get
that index from that event then the very
next thing that we are going to do is we
want to keep track of all of the current
students that are selected so we want to
change that guy up there so what are we
going to do put our note inside of here
just so we can remember that let's say
something like store the current
students index and then what are we
going to do we're going to retrieve the
student list from our database and
specifically we want the students that
has the same ID that was clicked inside
of our list box so
retrieve students list from DV and then
after that we want to set the names in
the entries all right so get index that
was selected with to get the student ID
so well how do we get that I'm going to
create a list box widget and to get the
widget that was clicked on the cut you
know called for this event to trigger we
go event widget and then if I want to
get the index specifically that was
clicked on we're going to convert it
into a string we go lb widget and then
we go cursor selection and we want the
item the very first item that was
selected there so we'll go 0 and we're
going to go +1 to that because the list
box is going to be 0 indexed while the
student database is going to be 1
indexed it's going to start off at 1
while this is going to start off at 0 so
that's the reason why we change that all
right so hopefully that makes sense
well then we want to store the current
student index so let's come in here like
this and go self and current students is
going to be equal to the index that we
just got right there we want to retrieve
this to the student list that has the
same index there so it's always going to
be one item and we're going to be
accessing the database that means we
want to use try once again we will go
result self and the cursor and execute
and then we are going to do trying to
select something out of the database we
go select and we want ID we want the
first name we want the last name and
that's all we want from there
from students and here we're going to
use where the ID is going to be equal to
and then we'll put the index that was
selected in our list box and what else
we needed well we are going to receive
the lists that hold the results we're
going to use the four again inside of
here so we'll go for row in result and
that should always be only one result
because we are auto incrementing the ID
and we want to here get the students ID
and that's going to be the very first
thing that's passed once again because
that's the first second and third we're
going to do the same thing again for
students first name equal to row and
there's that and students last name and
that's going to be Row two all right so
we got all of that and then we need to
set the names in our entries some pretty
simple stuff well let's go over here to
have that in there and how we set those
is by setting the value that is
associated with it so we'll go first
name entry value and we call set and
then we put students first name inside
of there and we're going to do the same
thing for the last name there's this and
it's going to be the last name and this
is going to be last name dropping out
from that and then what are we going to
do well we're going to catch any
potential exceptions that are thrown
when we just copy this whole entire
thing right here make sure it lines up
with the try block that we have right
there down to the next line paste that
in there and it does line up and what
errors could we have with this well
let's just leave table doesn't exist
that could be an error let's change this
to so that we know if this is triggered
that that's the reason why that was
triggered and that's all we need to do
the only thing we need to do now is
update student and that's going to be
called any time that the user changes
something in the entry box and clicks
the Update button so what are we going
to need to update our records
well we are going to have to
call for the updates based on whatever
the current student is so remember up
here what we were setting the current
student right here well this guy down
here is going to update based on
whatever the current students is okay so
that's going to be a call to our
database and what else are we going to
do well we're going to clear our entry
boxes and then update our list box so
their entries and then finally we are
going to update list box with the new
student list that is going to have the
changes that were updated whenever the
guy was click accessing the database
we're going to throw this in a try block
we are then going to call for a command
to execute so connect to our database
and we're going to say execute and
anytime we want to update something in
the database we call update and we're
going to call students and we
specifically are going to set to
whatever the first name is inside of our
entry so we're going to put an equal
sign here and a single quote and then a
double quote so that's what that guy
does let's jump down the next line to
get the entry value we're going to self
first name and entry and value and to
get the first name entry value we call
get and then let's go down to the next
line we are then going to close that
single quote off this single quote up
here we're going to close that off so
let's get rid of that's a little guy
right there doctored up getting an error
on this copy and pasted from the code in
the description chances are you've got
your quotes wrong okay so no big deal
people do it all the time then we're
going to go last name is equal to and
what we're going to have a single quote
and then we're going to have a double
quote again I don't like the tourm does
that but it doesn't alright so then we
want to put a plus sign once again and
we're going to go so silly pycharm went
through a double quote there let's get
rid of that and jump down here and then
once again we're going to go so dot last
name entry value and then get to get for
that guy plus jump down to the next line
whoops let's jump up here double quote
single quote there we are
that's going to make that better jump
down here I knew I had an error there in
my quoting because it jumped down weird
okay just look for then we're going to
have another double quote and we're
going to have a single quote and then
we're going for space and then we're
going to say where the ID is equal to
and we know that it's going to be equal
to whatever the current students is so
current student okay so if I quoted all
that right which since it lines up
everything should be okay but if I have
an error in this code I bet you it's
going to be in here and it's going to be
because of these doggone quotes all
right so let's come in here and let's
continue so then we're going to call for
this to commit it's a DB connect and
commits and then we're going to catch
any potential errors that we have so
let's go and grab this guy right here
copy it make sure that we are here
underneath the try block and make sure
it lines up go back like that and there
that is and here we'll say database
couldn't be updated and after that well
we want to clear our entry boxes we're
going to say self and first name entry
and we'll call delete on that pass a
zero inside of there and an end inside
of there and we're going to do exactly
the same thing for the last name let's
go air get rid of that that's all
beautiful and then what do we want to do
we want to update our list box with our
new changed student list item to do so
we go self and update list box and if I
did everything right this should execute
without errors and let's run it and see
if I was per fan whenever I ran it I'm
getting a little bit of an error here
and let's see if we can figure out why
that is so let's just go in first name
let's throw some names inside here so
Dirk and Vanis and submit okay that
worked now let's check to see that when
I'm able to actually pull this
information back up here to update it
aha there we go couldn't retrieve data
from the database let's go in here and
just do another one just to see if I can
trigger any more errors submit Sally
Smith went in there and it overrode it
let's jump to another one mark and samus
it's MIT okay so it's over writing that
information let's see if I figure out
what I did wrong here and as I reviewed
the code I see here that I have an equal
sign where this should be
an underscore and let's see if that one
silly error there caused everything so
let's run it up still getting a little
bit of an error here let's see what's
going on run it and see how this works
so the dark minutes and submit there
that is and it loads in the screen and
let's change this to Derrick I don't
know Smith and update ah that's not
going good yet so let's go and see if we
can find any other little silly errors
we have here and I also noticed
something else each time we go through
here and get our results we want to put
this in the list box but I went and put
it outside of that for loop and then I
did it also down here so another silly
little error to catch throw that in
there throw that in there and now let's
execute it and see if it works it's done
aha no errors and here it is and let's
take a look and we will throw this in
here and throw it here submit and there
I am again let's change my name's Smith
and see if it updates gave me another
error let's look and see what's going on
the data line 144 and this debugging
process is just as important as anything
else I'm doing here so let's go and take
a look at what could possibly be causing
problems here and this says student
database object has no attribute student
update or stud update so let's go and
see if I went and put the wrong name
here inside the function absolutely this
is supposed to be update student not
stud updates
and so let's come down here and there's
student Smith that's good and here we
have stood up date see that was wrong no
problem
paste that inside of there and run it
again and I'm getting the feeling it's
going to work this time so turk guess
and submit and then let's click on that
and change this to smith and update a it
worked and then let's throw Sally Smith
inside of here and submit works Sally
Smith pops up when I click on that
Derrick Smith pops up when I click on
that and what else could we do let's go
and change this to mark and submit and
Mark Smith pops up there and let's
change this to Venus update and there we
go guys looks like a fixed everything
and there it is a working TK inter
database application all in one video
hope you guys learned a lot and enjoyed
that video and like always please leave
