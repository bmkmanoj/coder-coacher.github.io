3 of my decision making tutorial where I
will go through completely how people
make decisions to do things and of
course I am covering this decision
making process using the psychological
mapping techniques of meta programming I
will not go over what meta programming
is so if you want to understand it
better please see part 1 of this
decision making tutorial and then
everything should make sense Pacifica
Lee I'm going to cover all the ways we
decide how we develop preferences and
focus attention and what I'll do is I'll
describe I was tested my mentor program
was defined and I will explain how I
personally make decisions there are no
wrong decisions by the way i will then
explain all that different other ways of
making decisions and then tell you the
questions you should ask to find out
specifically how a person makes
decisions and eat each of these
classifications now I'm going to go over
directions down meaning whether a person
moves towards goals or away from
problems I definitely move towards goals
rather than away from problems the major
problem for people like me is that we
have a tendency to leave things
unfinished I luckily am able to avoid
this problem because I know of my
shortcomings and force myself to get
things done or delegate them to others
with the opposite personality the
problem for those who move away from
problems is that they have a hard time
making decisions because they always
want to get everything just right people
with a move toward motivation talk a lot
about their goals achievements gains and
once people with an away from
personality will talk about the problems
things to avoid and values that keep
them from doing certain things you want
to know what a person is just ask a
person to list their goals and problems
whichever list is longer will tell you
which personality they have now I'll go
over how people accomplish tasks people
are either recipe followers or gut
instinct people I'm a gut instinct guy I
always think things can be done better
this tinkering has benefited me at times
and also made me hard to manage those
managers that have just left me go on my
own have made a lot of money off of me
and those that tried to put me in a box
well didn't the other personality type
is great at performing very specific
step-by-step directions they
will not enjoy directions like just
figure it out these are your perfect
little worker bees but they will
struggle when they're forced to figure
out something on their own to find out
which personality someone has just asked
them why they made a certain decision if
they talk about the new capabilities
possibilities an empowerment they gain
from this decision their gut instinct
types if they talk about how they
performed research asked does is etc
you're dealing with a recipe follower
then you have how people adapt to
changing situations and there are the
flexible and the controlling types I
definitely have a controlling attitude
I'm constantly planning how I'll get
things accomplished I do not take well
to unexpected situations but prefer to
push problems out of my way to reach my
goals other personality types trips
through life with an easy come easy go
attitude they have trouble making up
their minds planning and getting things
done quickly you can find out which
personality you're dealing with by
asking a person if they'd like to plan
things out or take things as they come
then you have how people motivate
themselves either through reasoning or
necessity I have a reasoning personality
I do what I do because I want to I like
having the option to accomplish tasks in
my own way the other personality does
what others think they should or what
their personal values dictate you can
discover what personality type you're
dealing with basking what motivates you
to go to work if they respond that they
have to or they would be in trouble they
act out of necessity if they say they
enjoy it have a lot to accomplish or
need to get something done you're
dealing with the reasoning personality
reasoning types are harder to manage but
if left on their own will get things
done assess the people respond well to
force and follow the rules people also
have very specific interests in life
meaning either people places things
activities or information I'm most
interested in information as you would
probably gather I consume a large
quantity of books and articles every day
I read and scan through 20 news websites
and two books / dad leaves my major
issue in life is that I don't take my
head out of the book long enough to
experience the real world some people
love to consume the information about
people however they don't like to be
alone and may have trouble with
gossiping others are interested most in
different destinations they live to go
on trips and to experience the world it
may however have trouble fulfilling
their obligations at home because
they're constantly planning quests or
questing many
are most interested in random things
here are your gadget people they go
through life with a thirst to buyer
tinker with that which they just
purchased their major issue in life is
living beyond their means and ignoring
regular people finally we have those who
see the world as a place to do things
they have one activity after another
schedule they bounce around asking what
we're going to be doing and for you're
feeling bored again they may have
trouble meeting obligations in life to
find out what type of person you're
dealing with that has them what they
enjoyed most about their vacation then
you have your goal styles and how people
set goals you have your perfectionist
your optimists and pessimists I love the
whole idea of accomplishing things
perfectly I'm great at getting things
done but people with this style may have
an issue of tinkering too much to a
point that they never reach their goals
I've overcome that issue but sometimes
come off way too forcefully an optimist
approaches goals in a manner that thing
will work out they plan a little but
don't beat themselves up or others if
things don't work out they will struggle
to a greater degree when trying to reach
a goal a pessimist is defeated before
they even try to reach a goal obviously
this personality should be avoided and
if you think you may have this
personality focus on your little
accomplishments to reinforce your belief
that better days are on the horizon to
find out who you're working with just
ask them what are some of your goals for
the future and how are you going to
accomplish those goals if they respond
quickly with a smile you're dealing with
a perfectionist if you get a response
that is similar to things will probably
work out you're dealing with an optimist
and a pessimist will act negatively to
the whole question people make the
decision to purchase also based off of
what of either cost service quality or
time when making the purchase I focus
more on the price than any other factor
I value the quality of the product
secondly which is why take a long time
to make purchasing decisions I have the
personality type that is very hard to
sell to and I have this personality type
because I feel I've been taking
advantage of by salespeople in the past
and most cost oriented buyers have as
well most buyers have been dissatisfied
more often in purchases based on one of
the following costs bad service quality
or wasted time so over time they start
to value those products which are either
cheaper provide the best customer
service quality level or time savings
just ask people what is the best
purchase they've ever made to find out
why they will purchase something then
you have responsibilities people are
either over responsible unresponsible or
somewhere in the middle I have an even
responsibility level I don't have a
problem allowing others to take a
leadership position but also have no
problem standing forward when I'm needed
others thrive on taking on more
responsibility these people will go out
of their way also to back up any promise
they have made even if it hurts
themselves the unresponsible types do
everything they can to avoid being the
leader they want to be told what to do
each step of the way to find out who
you're dealing with just ask them if
they like being in charge also you can
find out a lot by asking if they thrive
on being in charge then you have overall
trust style people are either trusting
distrusting paranoid or naive when being
introduced to a new person product or
way of doing things I normally approach
it with distrust remember I'm highly
motivated by doing things my own way so
you should have seen this coming this
caused me to question many things and
may cause others to think I'm
unapproachable I know this about myself
so I forced myself to be very open and
approach others to break the ice quickly
others trust everything and thrive on
change these are your friendly types
that can pick up conversations with most
anybody these people are easy to take
advantage of and if they border on being
naive they may also be heard often on
the other end of the distrusted spectrum
you'll find your paranoid types they
think everyone is out to get them they
believe heavily in conspiracies and have
an issue with controlling their
outbursts you can find out who you're
dealing with by asking do you think
government officials act in the people's
best interest or do you find most people
trustworthy in the next video I'm going
to go over how we specifically decide to
respond through communication and work
with others also what we value how we
see ourselves and the world if you have
