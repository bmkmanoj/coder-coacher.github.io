on my tutorial on how to make Android
apps today we're going to focus in
completely on Android fragments and more
specifically on how to replace fragments
many people seem to be very confused by
fragments so what I'm going to do is
break my fragments tutorial over a
couple of different videos so that you
will completely understand them by the
end all right so this is the only slide
in the presentation everything else is
going to be code and what we're going to
do here is basically just explain what
fragments are now fragments quite simply
just make it easy to create interfaces
that work on different screen sizes and
they're going to be able to do this by
breaking different parts of your
interface into fragments that's where
the name comes from and why this is
great is because activities can then
decide which fragments to use and where
to put them based off of screen size or
orientation or numerous other different
things and of course it's also going to
be very nice to use the same fragment on
multiple different activities as we'll
see in a couple videos here now if your
app is going to be running on a phone or
a small device you're basically going to
have one single fragment on each
activity but that's not necessarily true
but it's very true very often and so you
may be asking yourself what versions of
the Android API are going to allow us to
use fragments well there's a couple
different answers to that version 3 is
where fragments were introduced and it
is the starting version of Android that
is going to allow you to use fragments
without a support library and of course
because there are support libraries
which I'm going to show you here in a
second you are definitely going to be
able to use fragments on older versions
of Android however you will not be able
to use the preference fragment class
unless you use API 11 or higher so I'm
just going to jump in here and create
our application and show you how to get
these support libraries alright so here
I am in Android studio and I'm just
going to call this Android fragments and
I'm going to come down here and hit next
and I'm going to let this be set for
Android 4.0 3 which is perfectly fine
and I'm going to click on next
let this be a blank activity click on
next my activity is fine and let's just
call this Android fragments and then
click on finish ok so as that is being
built I'm going to show you the location
for the support library in your Android
studio folder
you're going to have a folder called SDK
you're going to go inside of there
there you go two extras then you go to
Android then you're going to go to
support then you're going to go to v4 or
version four and this is the library
right here that you're going to want to
use and if you want to use it for older
versions of Android like I said versions
three and backwards you're going to have
to put that in this jar file right here
in your libs folder inside of Android so
let's jump over and see if Android
studio is ready yet
all right Android studio is open so
basically if you want to be able to use
older versions of Android you're just
going to go and get that jar file and
drag it and drop it right here in your
libs folder then you'll be able to do
that so what I'm gonna do is just start
building everything right now the very
first thing I'm going to do is build my
fragment so in my layout folder I'm just
going to click on that and click new and
I'm going to go to file and I'm going to
call this guy portrait underscore
fragment and all the code is available
in a link in the description underneath
the video and portrait fragment that
works for me and then I'm going to come
over here to the layout folder again and
I'm going to have two fragments in this
tutorial come over here click on file
and this one I am going to call
landscape fragment so what I'm gonna do
here is we're going to switch the
fragments each time the orientation on
the device changes which is something
you're gonna do a lot okay so I have
that all set up I can could grid that
right there
I'm just gonna go into the regular old
XML file that I have here and select
everything just to keep everything nice
and easy jump over into the portrait
fragment don't worry about the rendering
problem that's saying that because you
come down here to the text tab there's
nothing in there
okay so just paste that inside of there
I'm just going to let everything be
there exactly the way that it is however
I'm going to come into the string area
right here and we are in the portrait
fragment right yeah portrait fragment
and inside of this I'm going to say in
portrait fragment and there we go and
let's say that I want to increase the
text size as well because I want this to
show up nice and big text size and let's
just make it thirty DP something
ridiculous okay so good enough so now
let's go get this guy I light all that
jump over into landscape for Ag mint
switch over into text view paste that in
there I can also jump back here
course and I normally do do this let's
just put our little mouse there and then
come over here to the little light bulb
extract string resource and let's give
this a name that's a little bit better
than what we have there let's call this
portrait mode textview and that's good
come down here click on OK and that's
better
all right so save that jump over to the
landscape for argument and make sure we
change this to in landscape fragment so
that that makes sense get a little light
bulb click on that extract string
resource come up here and this one we're
going to call landscape mode textview
keeping this very very very simple come
down here click on OK and we're done
with that so there's our fragments
already built the only thing we want to
do here is the context part let's go and
delete that and let's do that let's save
it and also do that in this one ok now
what I'm going to do is go into activity
my daughter Sam L and instead of a
textview inside of this I'm going to put
fragments inside of it so in the exact
same place I'm going to go fragment
there we go and let's just have this B
match parent and match parent just to
keep it nice and simple and then for the
ID on this guy I'm gonna call the ID and
then that and then I'll call this guy
land scape fragment and at the end of
that close that off good and then we're
gonna go and get ourselves another
fragments get rid of that and this one's
just gonna be portrait portrait fragment
there you go activity Mize done or
activity main what everyone who refer to
it as now we're gonna go in here and go
into our Java folder right here and
we're going to actually create the
fragment code so new Java class and then
I'm gonna call this guy fragment
landscape just to keep that nice and
easy understand and hit OK there that is
and then to actually build a fragment
class inside of this guy you're just
going to say extends fragment there we
go and I automatically imported the
library and then we're going to
right-click inside of here and we're
going to go generate and we're going to
say override methods and then inside of
this I'm going to find myself on create
view on create view with the inflator
right there and automatically created
that for me and then in here all I have
to do is change what is
earned sand what I'm gonna have to do
let's just go get rid of that whole
entire thing here what we're going to do
is return an inflator and I talked about
inflaters earlier a layout inflator is
going to take the provided xml layout
that we want to use by passing that to
inflate so i'm going to say in this
situation our dot make sure that i'm in
the landscape one yes i am r dot layout
dot and then i'm going to get the
landscape fragment there it is and then
to that I'm going to pass in a container
and the container is going to be the
view that the fragment could or could
not attach to depends on if we want to
do that or not and then finally this is
going to tell you if you want to do that
or not you're going to pass in false
based on whether you want to attach the
optional view named container or not now
if you want to know specifically what
all these things are inside of on create
view layout inflator I already told you
what that is the view group container is
going to be the view the fragment should
be attached to if we want to do that and
then saved instance state is passed if
the fragment is being reconstructed from
a saved state and that's it that's all
we got to do to create that and to
create the other one basically couldn't
do exactly the same thing we're just
gonna change the layout fragment that's
the only thing we're changing here so
let's come over here create ourselves a
new class Java class call this fragment
portrait okay and again extends fragment
there we go
automatically imported that get rid of
this might as well just copy and paste
the one create view inside of there and
look at this this is the only thing we
have to change and this is going to be a
great way to be able to change fragments
so portrait fragment you're this last
part there you know what everything
already does there save we're done with
that so now all we're left to do is go
into my activity dot Java and make
everything work and we can come down
here and either get rid of these or keep
them it totally depends upon you and I'm
just gonna get rid of this right now
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to need what's called a fragment
manager which is going to allow me to
interact with the different fragments
inside of the activity so fragment
manager and we'll just keep this simple
and just call it fragment manager and to
get our fragment manager I'm going to
call get fragment manager and then I'm
going to have to
create a fragment transaction and to do
that let's call this fragment
transaction is equal to fragment manager
I'm going to have to call begin
transaction and that's it and basically
what begin transaction is going to do is
it's going to begin the fragment
transaction which is going to allow us
to do things like add attach detach hide
remove replace animate transition and a
whole bunch of other different things
we're going to use replace this time and
we're going to base all of this off of
the changing orientation of our device
now if you want to get information on
device configurations and so forth and
so on what we're gonna have to do is
create ourselves a configuration object
and why don't I call this config info
device info i typed in configured foe
that works and to get all that
information you're going to go get
resources and then you're going to say
get configuration now if I want to check
my screen orientation I'm just going to
come in here I'm going to go if config
info dot orientation only option there
is equal to configuration dot and
orientation and I'm going to do
landscape in this situation well in that
situation I'm going to call fragment
landscape new fragment landscape and I'm
going to be able to go fragment
transaction and replace and if you're
wondering where fragment landscape comes
from it comes from up here want to make
sure that you're well aware that safe
fragment landscape that's where that's
coming from creating a fragment
landscape object in that situation so
what I'm going to do is the transaction
is going to allow me to call for a
replace to take about and to do so I'd
just go Android r dot ID content and
then I'm also gonna have to pass inside
of this the fragment landscape object LS
basically going to do the opposite let's
just go and copy this paste that inside
of there fragment you know the other
option we have is fragment portrait
right portrait and fragrant portrait I'm
just going to take this guy copy it
paste it in there and then the final
thing after we decide what fragment we
want to use down here is to call
fragment transaction and schedule for
the replacement of the fragment as soon
as possible and to do that
you call commit and that is it let's
execute and as you can see right here as
I change the orientation of the device
it is automatically switching into
different fragments a core skill you
need to understand work with fragments
