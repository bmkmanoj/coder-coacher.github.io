of my Java video tutorial series today
we're going to talk about layouts inside
of Java swing and I'm going to show you
all the different layout classes that
are available or at least I'm going to
show you three of them now of course
we're going to need to import ourselves
some libraries so I'm going to bring in
Java
OTT and I'm going to show you the border
layout and also I'm going to show you
all the things I didn't show you in
regards to how to use the flow layout
Java flow layout and the fluent layout
is what we've been using all along and
basically the way that it works is it
just puts everything exactly right next
to each other so as you add a component
it just continues to cycle and put those
components on the right side of whatever
component you previously put into the
panel so we got all the same stuff here
we've seen before of course you know how
to create buttons and this is the size
of our frame and this is the location
which is going to be in the center and
this is going to handle closing and this
is a title for it so let's get into the
flow layout and exactly what we're going
to do with this guy just like before of
course I'm going to go jpanel and I'm
going to call this panel equals new J
panel create myself a panel that's going
to go inside of the frame now one thing
I haven't shown you in regards to this
is you can actually define the flow
layout alignment meaning you can either
position it to the right the center or
to the left and how you do that just go
to the panel and then goes layout and
we're going to go new flow layout that's
why we needed to import that library and
let's say that I want everything to go
to the left flow layout dot L EFT and
that will make every component that I
add automatically justified to the left
now of course I wanted to justify to the
right I would do this just I've been
right or Center I would just type in
Center of course now let's see exactly
what this looks like
go to button one it's equal to nu J
button and we're just going to call this
button one and then we'll also create
another button in here so you can see
exactly how that lays out so just change
its a two and change this to two then
down here we have this actually being
added to the panel and this makes the
frame visible on the screen but of
course we have to go the panel add and
then go button one and then we have to
also add button two and there we did so
let's see what this looks like left
justified and there you can see there's
the two buttons if you can't see this
you can view it full screen this is an
HD video and there
everything is aligned to the left side
of the screen and of course you can
align it to the right side of the screen
but I figure you know how to do that
another thing you can do that I haven't
covered is you could also define the
pixels they actually separate the
different components so right here where
I have flow layout I could also use
alignment what the heck let's just make
this right and then after I define that
I can define both a horizontal vertical
gap well there is not going to be a
vertical gap in this situation and the
first thing you would define is a
horizontal so let's say that I want to
put 30 pixels inside of there and then
let's just put 20 inside of there for
vertical which isn't going to do
anything to it but what the heck let's
just see what happens there you can see
everything's right justified however
there's going to be 30 pixels in between
these two guys right there and now you
are an expert on how to use the flow
layout because that is pretty much all
you can do with so I'm going to jump in
here now and cover the boarder layout
now the boarder layout how it differs
from the flow layout is you put
components or panels remember you can
also put panels in there in different
positions in either the north south east
west or center of a frame still going to
use J panel just like we have in the
past and to use the border layout you
have to come in here and go set layout
and then go new order layout because the
flow layout is the default so you have
to actually define your layout tool
you're going to use here because it's
different than the default and then
we're just going to go button 1 is equal
to Nu J button now I'm just going to
come in here and create a whole bunch of
these and change this to 2 3 4 5 and
then just to show you something this is
a common error people use with the
border loud is they try to throw buttons
into the same exact space so how you
would actually add these buttons after
you create them to this border layout is
you type in ad and then you would go
button 1 and then you have to define
where it's going to go so you go border
layout dot North remember
north-south-east-west Center only
positions you're allowed to play with
this so now we're going to come in here
we're going to go button 2 and we're
going to put it also in the north and
let's see what happens and as you can
see button 2 shows up here in button 1
does not show up here the reason why is
whenever you're throwing things into
these different frame areas as you did
here you tried to throw them both into
North and this second button that you
tried to throw in there just over rights
the other one and as you can also see it
pletely fills up a total top of the
screen now there's multiple different
ways you can handle this and let's just
go in here and just throw everything
into all of the different separate
components you can also throw multiple
different components into different
parts I'm going to show you how to do
that so let's go south east west and
then you have Center all these different
components are all going to be in
separate parts of this frame and we're
just going to go three four five now
you're going to see what that looks like
and as you can see there's the buttons
in the north/south east/west and center
as you can see whenever you put all
these different components in here
Center is always going to be the largest
area inside of this overall frame but
what if you wanted multiple different
buttons to show up and say the North
quadrant you can do that what you need
to do instead is throw the buttons into
a panel and then install the panel into
its gonna get rid of this all together
I'm going to create a new jpanel and I'm
just going to call this the panel to is
equal to new J panel then we're going to
go the panel to dot ad and I'm going to
say button one then I'm also going to
add button two to that panel and then to
make everything go into the North
quadrant I'm going to go the panel dot
add I'm going to add the panel to the
North quadrant and if we execute that
you can now see that both of the buttons
show up in the North quadrant and that's
pretty much all you can do with the
border layout now whenever you use all
these different layout tools you use a
whole bunch of them very often together
and that allows you to create pretty
much anything and now we come to the box
layout now with the box layout it's more
common to avoid this panel usage all
together so we're just going to delete
all that and also you normally don't use
this guy right here I'm going to use a
different one because this is a box and
a box layout just uses horizontal or
vertical rows of components in this
situation we do this don't add the box
so that's the common usage whenever
you're using a box layout of course you
have to define it and you type in box
and I'm going to say the box equal to
box and I'm going to create a horizontal
box and that's how you create a
horizontal box pretty simple you could
also create a vertical box but by
putting vertical inside of here instead
of horizontal and put a dot inside of
there instead so now we created our
little box here I'm going to add
different buttons to it so I'm going to
go the box
add button one and of course to be able
to do that we're going to need our
buttons to find inside of there so there
we got that I'm going to copy that and
I'm going to paste four of these
different buttons in here and I'm going
to call this two three four of course
and if we execute that there are my
buttons displayed horizontally on the
screen all equal width apart there's a
lot of other neat little things you can
do with this guy
you can also separate these different
buttons using what are called struts
which is just a definition of distance
between all these different buttons
that's all it is so how you do that you
just go the Box dot add I'm going to go
box dot create or Zano and a strut and
let's say I want these to be four pixels
apart throw that in there and it's
pretty much just defining a four pixel
difference between or distance between
these components you just throw it in
there execute it now you can see I threw
four pixels in between all of these
different components now you might not
always want to use struts because it can
cause problems where it'll actually
throw these different guys right off the
screen so if I change this to 40 and
execute that you can see my button
actually isn't being displayed on the
screen it moved it right off of the
frame at least so that's not always good
thing you can also go and define what is
called a glue and what a glue does is it
will just move a component over to the
maximum amount that it can possibly move
it I'm just going to copy this so let's
say that we want to get rid of this all
together so that this shows up well on
the screen and we can just come and come
in here and get rid of this and then I'm
going to change strut to glue you're
going to see what this guy does there
you can see the button has been moved
the maximum space away from this other
component right here however it is still
contained inside of the frame which is a
good thing there's something else to
play with and then you can also whenever
you have multiple of these boxes on the
screen them later on in the tutorial
series I'm going to use a whole bunch of
these all at one time so you'll be able
to see what this looks like but you can
also define not only the horizontal
pixels but you could also define
horizontal and vertical like we saw
previously with the flow layout whenever
we were playing around with that and to
do that what you need to do is create a
rigid area and then inside of this
you're going to define let's say 30
that's going to be your horizontal space
and let's say 20 so this would be as if
you had multiple different boxes on the
screen and you
to be 30 pixels apart and also 20 pixels
on a vertical basis however you have to
pass this what's called a dimension
which we've seen in numerous times in
previous tutorials and you just go
dimension and wrap this whole entire
thing up inside of that like this and
then you can execute it and there you
can see everything's positioned in an
odd way using 30 pixels like we talked
about before so vitter is all the
different methods that are available for
flow layouts border layouts and box
layouts all of the code is available
underneath this video it's heavily
commented go play around with it you'll
better understand these different layout
tools that are available to you in the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
cover all the other layout tools that
are available to you leave any questions
or comments below otherwise until next
