5 of my blender video tutorial on this
part of the tutorial we're gonna focus
mainly on lighting so we're gonna cover
things alike all of the different
lighting lamp options light emitting
plants three-point lighting but we're
also going to cover cycles renderer and
some specific cycles materials along
with a whole bunch of examples and a
whole bunch of other different things
like always in the description
underneath the video is a link to a
cheat sheet in which every single thing
I type in or do is going to be there and
available for free in text format and
also you'll find there a link to the
finished file so you'll have everything
available there and I have a lot to do
so let's get into it alright he huh so
this is blender and I didn't change
absolutely anything the very first thing
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit a and that
is going to deselect everything and then
I'm going to create a plane so I'm gonna
go shift a you can see everything in the
left-hand corner that I do so there we
are and then I'm gonna come over and I'm
mainly gonna focus you go and press n to
open this up and close it just wanted to
cover that I'm also going to scale this
guy so I'm gonna scale it by 10 and 10
I'm gonna try to use numbers because
people say they prefer that and I'm also
going to come in here and I'm going to
change the location to 1 for our cube
and then I'm going to split my screens
up a little bit I'm gonna come up here
to this little guy right here and I am
going to drag it downwards like this and
then I am going to come up to it again
and I'm gonna drag it to the left as
well I want to get rid of this guy right
here so I'm going to go end and I want
to get rid of this guy so I'm gonna go T
and we're gonna change this over here to
my a node editor which is right there if
you can't see this view at full screen
and everything should be wonderful and
happy going to move this over a little
bit more this is where I'm gonna be
playing around with everything so I'm
going to leave that as a 3d view that's
what this is 3d view right there
and then I'm gonna change this to a
rendering view so we will go a render
view and how we're gonna do that is
click down here for viewport shading and
I'm going to change this to renderer and
you can see it is right there I'm gonna
use the cycles renderer though you can
see what that looks like we're gonna
make it
much prettier so don't worry about that
I'm gonna pull this down a little bit
and in regards to the render engine that
we're going to be using we're gonna
using the cycles engine like I said
before basically what the render engine
is gonna do for us is it define how
lighting shadows materials textures and
so forth are going to look on our screen
and the node editor what you're gonna
see more of here in a moment is going to
allow us to combine multiple different
shaders and a whole bunch of different
effects that is going to affect our
final output now I want to set up my
rendering here so that I know what I'm
gonna get so I'm gonna click on this guy
right there that little guy right there
then I'm gonna come down to sampling
which is over here and I'm going to
basically whenever you're rendering you
want to have a minimum of 500 samples
and I'm gonna leave this be 32 but
whenever we start actually doing a lot
of work I'm gonna take that up to 100 in
the preview is gonna be this guy down
here but changing the renderer samples
down here isn't going to affect anything
so don't worry about that and just by
increasing the samples basically what
that is going to do is it's going to
eliminate graininess in my renders that
we get to see now I'm going to create a
couple different cubes here so I'm gonna
hit and unselect this guy and whenever
you put your mouse here blenders and is
intelligent enough to know that you want
to work in this area and so forth and so
on so wherever your mouse goes that's
where your commands are going to be
issued now what I'm going to do with
this guy is I'm going to select it and
I'm going to add a diffuse shader to it
so I'm gonna come over here to materials
that's what that guy is and I'm going to
say that I want to add a material let's
go and get rid of this material first so
there goes that and I'm gonna go new and
then I'm going to leave this be diffuse
and location 0 0 1 all of that is
perfectly fine and scale is all 1 1 1
and in the material I'm using is this
diffuse in color right here and we could
change this color to something let's
anything we want let's just go and make
it like a bluish color that's perfectly
fine then I want to create another cube
so I'm gonna go a and I'm gonna go shift
a and create another cube and I'm gonna
position this guy I'm gonna go up to a
location and I'm gonna say something
like negative two point five and
then I'm going to do like negative too
and I'm gonna do one and the reason I'm
setting it up this way is I want to show
you how reflections and so forth work
and how you do that is you add a
different shader so this shader is going
to be a glossy shader so I'm going to
change it to this and then I'm gonna
change it to glossy and when you can see
the reflection down inside of here for
this guy see the blue is actually
reflecting in there and let's go and
give this a little bit of a color so
it's not so boring let's make it like a
greenish color or something like that
alright so that looks good you can't
really see it because there's no
lighting but we're gonna be adding
lighting here in one second so if we
come over and we well let's just bounce
out here this is a point lighting and a
whole bunch of different things are
going to show up inside if here whenever
we select that size is going to define
how large the light is and maximum
bounce is gonna define the number of
times light reflects after hitting a
surface if cast shadow is checked then a
shadow will be will be shown and if it
isn't well then it won't be shown so I
don't know if you can see down here but
I'm shutting it off and there's no
shadow all right and you're like I said
I'm gonna light this up better here in a
moment and multiple importance may or
may not reduce noise actually I find
that it uses or actually creates a noise
very often so I normally shut it off but
it's actually gonna work a little bit
better once we get everything properly
lit so for now we're gonna leave it off
so I'm gonna come in here for my point
lighting and I'm going to reposition it
so I'm gonna do something like 1 and
negative 3 and then 8 okay so I got that
positioned and its position kind of over
to the left and in between both of those
cubes that we have right there you know
actually I'm gonna go and delete it so
I'm gonna go like this just to show you
here delete this guy and X and it's
gonna go delete and then I'm gonna
create a brand new one so you can also
come in here
and you can just create lamps just like
you do anything else there you are let's
go point and then once again let's come
in here and let's change the location 1
and negative 3 &amp;amp; 8 so there we are we
put it in there again and I'm gonna shut
off
importance and I'm going to change my
strength to 1,000 so that it shows up a
little bit better you're gonna see now
you can see these and you can also see
the reflection in here from this cube to
that cube they're all of course gonna be
able to change the color let's say we
want to make it like a light blue light
color that's perfectly possible and
quite recommended because white is a
pure white light as never seen in nature
so it's gonna look kind of odd you're
also going to notice that if we come in
here and actually try to rotate this
light that it's not going to have any
effect on our overall scene so I'm gonna
go and rotate that 37 see no effect so a
point light is going to show the same
amount of light in all different
directions some of your lamps are going
to change what you see on the screen
based off of rotation but the point
light Wilmont and then of course we're
going to be able to add some other
lights and disregard the point light
just by coming up here and clicking on
the eyeball and the light goes away just
like it doesn't exist alright so now
let's talk about a Sun lamp so I'm gonna
keep my mouse cursor here I'm gonna go
shift and a and once again I'm gonna go
and create Sun and you're gonna see this
guy and I'm gonna position it in a
little bit different direction so let's
say negative 5 and a 1 and a 10 and you
can see the light up there and if you
zoom in on it you can actually see that
it sort of looks like a I'm gonna hold
down the shift key and then move the
middle mouse button see it sort of looks
like a Sun got a neat that's one way to
differentiate it from other different
light options that you have just by
looking at that once again my turn off
multiple importance another thing that's
interesting about the light is as you
move it it's actually not going to have
any effect so we'll have our location
I'm actually just gonna grab it right
here you're gonna see I'm actually gonna
move the Sun underneath the plane and
you could say that nothing changes at
all
however unlike our point lighting
rotation does matter with the Sun and as
I change the rotation you're actually
going to see that the color or the
shadows and so forth are going to change
maybe hit R on this guy there see how
it's changing as the Sun Point lamp is
being moved around okay
so there's an example of how the Sun
lamp works now I want to talk about the
spot lamp and I'm going to once again
come over here to
son if you can't see I'm clicking on
this eyeball right here to make that go
away then I'm gonna create a spot lamp
shift and lamp and spot and basically a
spot lamp is exactly that it's going to
focus the light in one area and then the
option to blend is going to define how
soft the edge is around it and I'm gonna
come up here again and let's position it
try like a negative two and a zero and a
ten something like that and you're gonna
need to see the sphere there's
surrounding or the circle that's
surrounding our cube that we have down
here if I increase the strength of it
you're gonna be able to see it a little
bit better so there you go and now you
can see say it's shining directly down
inside of there and then the blend is
going to define how soft the edge is
gonna be or how tight it's gonna be if
it's at zero it's gonna be a tighter
sharper edge around the cubes and if
blend is higher it's going to be smaller
but also softer and you're also gonna be
able to come over here to show cone and
click on it and it's actually going to
draw the circle for where the spotlight
is going to show directly there in your
scene and then of course you're going to
be able to also change the size of your
spotlight just by adjusting the size
which is going to represented by a
degree all right so there is the spot
lamp and then I'm gonna take a look at
the Hemi or the hemisphere lens or lower
lamp shut off the spot command here once
again shift and a and a lamp and Hemi we
are going to position this guy and
basically the hemisphere lens is gonna
act just like our Sun lamp that we have
I keep saying lens I keep I mean to say
lamp so let's go and position this at 4
and negative 1 and 10 you can see where
that is lined up on our 3d scene and
then I'm gonna move it just like we did
with our Sun lamp to rotate it so that
it actually turns over onto our shapes
that we have here in our scene so let's
just change those to like 25
leave everything else at zero and now
you can see it's pointing down directly
right in the middle of those two cubes
that we have there on our scene and then
I can go and maybe increase our strength
1.5 and then of course you can come in
here and change the color to whatever
you would like it to be and then for our
final example before I start doing some
cooler examples I'm gonna go and create
an array lamp so I'm gonna come in here
we go shift whoops I hit rendering by
accident
shift and a and there we are in an area
lamp is a little bit more popular than
some of the other different lamps and
basically the way it's gonna work is it
is going to be a rectangle out in space
or a square so I'm gonna make it a
rectangle and you can change whatever
the size of it is I'm actually gonna
keep a ten and ten so I could just left
it at a square but whatever and you can
see how it shapes out there directly in
our 3d view and then going to change the
location on it negative one and negative
three and in the eighth area and now you
can see that it's pretty much floating
directly over top of our shapes of
course I'm gonna have to increase the
strength of it though to make it
properly a light our lamps and there's
that multiple importance again let's
shut it off and you're gonna see some of
the fragments go away all right so there
you go that is a very quick example of
how to use all those different lamps and
now what I want to do is actually show
you a really cool thing which is how to
emit light from a plane so let's go and
shut off the array and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a plane
directly inside here some mesh and plane
I'm going to go and position it so let's
go to location and negative five Y is
gonna be negative five and Z is going to
be six and you can see how that's
positioned and then what I want to do is
I want to rotate it around so that it
emits light directly onto our cubes so
I'm going to do a rotation on the y axis
of negative forty and then I'm going to
also scale it so you're gonna see that
you're going to be able to scale it just
like you did with our area lamp
I'm going to scale this specifically on
the x-axis to 3 and on the y and z axis
I'm just gonna leave those as 1 now what
I can do is I have material selected
here already I can go new and come in
here and change it to a mission and now
you're gonna see that that lights that
up and then I'm going to be able to
increase the overall strength let's try
something like 25 and you're gonna see
now that that is emitting directly onto
our cubes and giving us some nice really
cool effect you might however ask
yourself well let's say that you know
like if i zoom out on this you're going
to see this plane here maybe I don't
want that ugly plane to be there in the
middle of our scene how do I get rid of
it it's actually quite easy
I'm gonna come here where it's at where
object is this little cube right there
so I'm going to check on that and then
I'm gonna come down here to cycle
settings and let's zoom out so you can
see it goes away and then I'm gonna come
down here where ray visibility is and
just click on camera there you go now
you got rid of the ugly little plane in
the air
that's up in the air but at the same
time you were able to still keep the
emit for the lighting that we were
looking for so now I'm gonna get rid of
that plane and then I'm gonna do
something even cooler which is
three-point lighting so what I want to
do here first is I want to actually I
want to get rid of our cubes that we
also have here once again just clicking
on these eyeballs to make them go away
and I'm gonna switch into top view so I
click on 7 to be able to do that and
then what I want to do is I want to
actually create the monkey head and put
that on there so I'm gonna go monkey and
I'm going to come in here and position
it somewhere in the middle of our scene
so I'm going to go to and then negative
2 and
zero to position it inside of there and
there is our monkey head but you can see
that he's underneath the plane which we
don't want I'm gonna come in here and
rotate our monkey head so let's go and
get it like a negative thirty-six and a
let's just leave that at zero and then
fifty and we'll take a look at our
monkey head see how he's doing inside of
here and you can see that he's not quite
in the right position let's go and
select our plane that we have here yeah
let's select our monkey head and let's
move it up just a little bit so let's
change it to 0.5 and there he looks like
he's in a better position all right so
we got a monkey head and now what we're
gonna do is light it using multiple
different planes that are going to emit
a light just like we just saw here or
second ago
however I have this little node window
open here so I might as well use it so I
have the monkey selected I'm gonna come
over here to materials and select it I'm
gonna go to new and this time what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to use a mix
shader' and I'm gonna use multiple
different shaders to go and work with
this so I'm gonna go over here and zoom
in a little bit I'm gonna grab this guy
I put it over here and get my mixture
put it right there now what I want to do
is I want to mix together the diffuse
shader with the glossy shader that we
saw before
and then I'm gonna use something called
Fresnel which is going to UM define how
light is reflected to give our monkey
sort of an interesting type of look here
on our scene if you want to add those
different shaders you can also come over
here and go add and then shader so I
said I wanted a diffuse shader so let's
put that right there and I also want a
glossy shader and in later tutorials I'm
gonna get into the different options
that are available for these different
shaders probably in the next part of the
tutorial I haven't decided yeah then
what we can do is mix the shaders just
by coming over here and dragging that in
there putting it there if you want to
disconnect it you can just hold down
your control key and go like that and
it'll disconnect and I did that with my
mouse that's what them I'm dragging
there so just so you knew put that there
and let's get this guy put it right
there I'm also going to want to use the
Fresnel and I'm gonna go add an input
Fresnel and let's put that guy right
yeah and like I said before that's going
to define
how light is reflected and just drag it
put it right there under diffuse I want
to make this a bluish color so let's
come in here and drop that in there that
looks about right
might change it I'm gonna roughing it up
a little bit so let's go something like
point seven I just put it in there like
that point seven there we go
I don't know leave glossy exactly the
way that it is okay so there's a monkey
and now I just have to come in here and
light it so let's zoom out a little bit
and like I said before I'm going to add
a couple different planes might hit a to
deselect shift a and create a plane
plane is over here floating in wacky
world let's go and position it and I'm
gonna position it turn and zero and four
and you can see where it is and let's go
seven so we can see the top view and
normally you're going whenever you're
using three-point lighting you're gonna
have a light source here light source
here and then a light source behind it
and we're gonna light it in different
ways from all those different light
sources so what I want to do is I want
to add once again I have the material
selected I'm gonna go new I'm gonna go
emit or a mission there we go
and then what I need to do is just put
it into a position so that it rotates
onto our our monkey head so I'm gonna go
negative one one five and I'm going
let that be zero and let's change this
to 100 like that and then I need to
maybe scale this up some to two and two
and then we want to increase the
strength let's put the strength at like
point five I want this to be kind of
subtle then I'm gonna give it another
color I'm gonna make this a slate like a
tannish type of color it's real real
slight and then just like we did before
I'm gonna go object like that and camera
to make the plane not show up in our
scene okay
so I'm getting the light it's very very
subtle and then what I'm gonna do now is
I'm going to add another plane and this
is going to be the main light that is
going to define what our monkey head is
gonna look like it's gonna be the
strongest of our lights do you select
once again and shift an a and plane once
again and we're gonna position this guy
at the two and negative eight and for
position C like I said on the left side
of our monkey head this one's gonna be
much bigger so I'm gonna scale this up
to three and three I'm gonna increase
the strength of this I need to come over
here to add a material new material and
a mission and let's change this to three
point five so a lot stronger and I just
need to rotate it into position so it
shines better on my monkey head so let's
drive like 130 or negative hundred
thirty how about that and there you can
see it's starting to like the monkey
head a little bit nicer and also I'm
getting to the point now where I would
like this to look better so I'm going to
go into renderer and then I'm gonna look
for preview down here and let's change
this to 100 and hopefully this doesn't
break my computer because and you can
see right here as it's adding up to 100
and you can see the monkey head starting
to look kind of cool now what I'm gonna
do is add another plane in the
background just to give it a little bit
more definition but the monkey that's
looking pretty cool as it is right now
I'm gonna come in here do you select
everything and I'm gonna go and create
another light source so mesh and plane
and this guy I'm going to put at
negative 3 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 3 I'm gonna give it a
strength of 0.5 once again go in here to
materials new material omission
and let's make it be point five go into
the rotation make that 180 let's make it
a negative 180
negative 55 and negative 35 just adds a
little bit of interest and then we're
also going to color this up a little bit
let's give this like a mid tone type of
bluish color a little bit darker than
what we previously have been using for
our other different lights leave the
scale at 1 1 1 and then once again we
can click on object and come down here
and make the camera disappear so it
doesn't show up in on the side of our
scene and there you can see there is our
monkey head and as it continues to
sample gonna get cleaner and cleaner and
you can see a lot of really cool edges
on our monkey head and so forth and so
on so it's starting to look like a
really nice graphic that we have going
there all right so hope you guys enjoyed
this and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
