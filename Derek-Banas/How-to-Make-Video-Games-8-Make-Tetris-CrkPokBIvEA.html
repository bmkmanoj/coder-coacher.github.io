8 of my how to make video games tutorial
series in this part of the tutorial
we're going to start making Tetris and
one of you guys asked me the next time I
make a game to start from scratch to
literally not think about the game dump
pre-plan don't do anything just make the
game right here alive in the video and
that's what I'm going to do right now
like always all the code and the image
is used here will be available in the
description underneath this video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so we're going to start off by
basically trying to figure out what we
want to do with Tetris so there's
numerous different types of Tetris and
basically there's just a whole bunch of
blocks inside of a grid system
so let's look here from looking at these
I can see that one two three four five
Ilyn average almost every single Tetris
game has tens grid spaces across the
bottom and roughly 20 going up so that's
what we're going to base our system off
of and they all have a similar sort of
look and feel in this sort of 3d type of
cube thing so I'm going to create that
inside of GIMP alright so here is GIMP
and I'm going to setup everything here
just so everything works so you got our
pen tool I'm going to change this to 1
pixel I'm going to change my size to 1
and my dynamics is going to be set to
dynamics off my eraser should have taken
all those on yes it did and that's
basically all I have to do so what I
want to do so I have 10 across the
bottom 20 across the top why don't we
just make a 20 pixel by 20 pixel cube
and see what that looks like so I'm
gonna go to 20 bytes one out need to do
anything with transparencies or anything
this time because I have I'm going to
completely fill you know the graphic so
let's zoom in here and basically we had
this indentation sort of thing so what
I'm gonna do here is I want to use my
pencil tool and I'm going to come over
here and I'm going to select a color I'm
going to have everything be gray and
then I'm going to colorize them inside
of unity so let's come in here and let's
just get a very light gray color
something like that click on OK and then
basically the way these are set up is
it's like indentation
like this so I'm gonna draw this in and
this will be the lightest gray that I'm
going to use is it I don't know they
look very great does it mm actually
let's change it to white and then I'm
going to change my color from that point
so let's go and have this be like 93 I
don't know it looks kind of good okay so
let's go one two three there it looks
much better so let's draw our little
cube inside of here and then for the
next part I will just make it slightly
darker on this screen so I'm just
dragging in here with the pencil tool
side of GIMP you use Photoshop whatever
you want I just like to use free tools
so that everybody can use it click on
this once again and we'll make it a
little bit darker let's say something
like 88 and that looks good color in all
these guys and do the same thing here at
the bottom of the screen and there we go
and have that all set up and I think
what I want to do is I'm going to have
this basically cover this edge and I'm
going to have this guy collar cover this
edge and so forth and so on
so then we'll come in and change our
color and we'll make this just a little
bit darker still I don't know 80 or
something and then color this in so then
this one's going to cover this bottom
edge and just color that all in and two
for I think you get the idea what I'm
doing here okay got that all set up and
then make it a little bit darker still
take it to like 72 or something and then
do this for the final part so then this
is going to take up the bottom corner
and then take it right up to that area
and then fill this in all right so this
is my basic cube that I'm going to build
everything off of and what I'm thinking
I'm going to do is I'm going to have the
inside grid also be and I just pressed
the O key so that I could select this
I'm going to have the the surrounding
areas also going to be made up of these
cubes just to keep things nice and
simple but at the same time I think that
the Hat that will have a good look let's
take this down to like 90 or something
and then fill in the center of the cube
once again lower case and
in there that looks about right so let's
just draw that in there and I'm probably
going to get a lot of the graphics done
in this video and then in the next video
we will try to spin the shapes around
and move them around inside of our
little box that we have but we'll say
what happens basically just as long as
it's going to take all right then I'm
going to export this so export as and
I'm going to throw this in My Documents
folder like I did previously
so let's go documents obviously you can
put them more of you want I'm going to
create a new folder and I'm going to
call it Tetris assets because that makes
sense to me and we will call this cube
and it's a ping file if the ping isn't
selected just come down here and select
ping with that but that all works for me
and I'm going to hit export and then a
little women is going to pop up and then
I'll just click on export again so there
we go we have all that set up and now
we're going to jump over in unity and
create our Tetris application okay so
here we are I'm going to click on new
and I'm going to call this Tetris and
let's make an uppercase temptress it's
going to be a 2-d game obviously I've
decided where I want to put this and
everything works exactly the same on
Windows and Mac OS so use whatever you
want to use and I'm going to go find my
stuff inside of here and my Documents
folder and unity and then inside of here
I'm going to create a new folder and I
am going to call it Tetris and then I'll
drag everything inside of there there's
tucked wrists and then we'll say select
folder and then we'll go create project
all right so we have everything set up
if you want the same layout I have just
click on layout and 2x3 but you can do
whatever layout you want very first
thing I always do is I come in and I
create all of my folders so I'm going to
have my sounds folder and I'm going to
also have my sprites folder which is
where all my images are going to be at
and I'm going to have a scenes folder
and what else we need look folder
prefabs and is there anything else in it
yeah scripts obviously and then I think
that's it so scripts that's where all my
c sharp code goes all right so we got
all that inside of there now I need to
go and get
cube and here's Tetris assets and I'm
going to grab my cube right out of the
folder and drop it into my sprites
folder so that's all set up if I click
on sprites you're going to see the cube
shows up right there all right so what's
the very first thing I want to do well
let's go and get our camera and let's
set our background to black and that's
very simple let's do that and then like
that and then I am going to want to
create my borders that are going to go
across the top the sides and the bottoms
so I have to think about how am I going
to set this up and I have the size for
my camera let's set this to 20 right now
and we'll just see how things work out
there from that point so I want to
create a whole bunch of walls so I'm
going to come in here and I'm going to
go create create empty and I'm going to
call this horizontal wall and then I'm
going to create another one and I'm
going to call it a vertical wall and
then I'm going to create the rest of
these either end up going to be prefabs
that I'm going to drag over and then put
make a top right left bottom wall out of
these guys so I'm going to go start off
with horizontal wall first and I have my
positions all set for 0 on those and I'm
going to grab a cube and I'm going to
drag it and drop it right here
now what we have to do now is think
about what we want to do with these
cubes now I'm going to have 20 open
blocks up and I'm going to have 10
blocks to the outside so what I think I
want to do is my top and my bottom walls
I want them to be 12 wide to accommodate
for the 20 spaces up so my horizontal
walls are going to be 12 in size so I'm
going to duplicate this 12 times or
actually 11 times just so I have a total
of 12 okay so that I have all of those
all set up now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to select this one this is
going to be at the 0 0 mark on our
screen and then I'm going to duplicate
it from that point onwards oh one thing
that I'm going to need to do is you may
have noticed you can't see the cubes on
here well the reason why I'm going to
select the cube here I'm going to have
to come over and I'm going to set it
these are 20 by 20 20 pixels by 20
pixels in size so what I want to do is
I'm going to have pixels per unit we set
to 20 and then just like before because
this is pixel art I'm going to set this
to point and that's all set good and I'm
going to click on apply so that applies
there now you can see a cube inside of
there so that looks a lot better all
right so now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to select each one of these and
I'm going to move them to the right side
so I'm going to select this first cube
and then I'm going to come over here and
I'm going to increase this to 1 so I got
that set and then I'm going to select
the next one and I'm going to change it
to 2 and 3 and you're going to see see
they're growing across the screen all
right so let's just do that for all of
the different cubes that we have here so
we can make that horizontal wall and
this one is going to be 11 so there we
go I have them all set up and they all
are stretching across the screen so now
what I can do is close that and I'm
going to current create a prefab so I'm
gonna go horizontal wall drag it to
prefabs throw it inside of there and
then delete this off our screen and then
we can make our vertical wall going to
do basically the same exact thing we did
previously we're going to grab our cube
and drag it over here and drop it in the
vertical wall and then this time I want
this to be 20 in size so I'm going to
make 19 duplicates of this and there you
go got no 19 duplicates and this time
I'm going to have to increase the Y so
I'm going to change this to 1 and you're
going to say say it girl so let's go and
zoom in here so you can see a little bit
better what's going on move out a little
bit there we go so then we'll select the
next cube and we'll change that to 2 and
the next one's going to be 3 and so
forth and then we'll have 17 and then we
will have 18 actually I want these to be
20 in size so that would only be 19 so I
want to make one more duplicate here and
then let's change this to 19 so now
there are a total of 20 cubes altogether
so we're going to close that and once
again we're going to drag this over into
our prefabs folder and we're going to
delete it off of here now what we can do
is
we can go and create to those those you
know walls that we want so I'm going to
have a vertical wall just going to drag
it from the prefab section over here I'm
going to grab another vertical wall rag
it inside well I don't want it to go in
that wall though let's go and change the
size of this first so my vertical wall
this is going to be left wall is what
I'm going to call that and that's good
grab another vertical wall drag it in
there and this will be right wall so
let's just get this there's right wall
and then I'm going to have my horizontal
wall so let's drag that in there and
this guy is going to be top wall and
then I'm going to grab another
horizontal wall and this will be bottom
wall I'm going to try to line these up
here as good as possible because I have
to keep them nice and tight so that they
don't bounce so that you know the
squares don't bounce off of each other
all right so I have all of these inside
of here I'm going to select my left wall
and I'm going to zoom out here on the
screen so I can see what's going on
let's select the main camera 20 doesn't
look right in this situation let's take
it down to 12 or something looks a
little bit better alright so I'm just
eyeballing this like I said I have no
idea what's going on so we're gonna
select this now and we'll go and select
all these individual cubes that we have
inside of here I'm going to grab them
and I'm just going to eyeball them for
right now because I don't know exactly
how they're going to line up so go and
get my right wall drag it out of there
and then I will get the horizontal now
the way I had this set up I was this 12
crossed and 20 up that means that the
main ones are going to be the top wall
on the bottom wall so I'm going to grab
that grab all those guys and these are
going to be the ones that really really
matter
we'll go and move it up mmm I don't know
like I said it's not going to matter
right now I'm going to line them up
based off of each other here after I get
them all set up and let's select our
bottom wall and move it out of the way
as well just move it out of the way and
then get the other ones in there alright
so got all that set up now I'm going to
get my left wall and I'm going to line
it up with the top part here so I'm
going to get this and I'm going to zoom
and really get it perfect so I have that
set up I'm going to come up here and get
this little guy here that's going to
allow me to very very precisely line
these up so let's see that's just about
perfect and the left is just about
perfect so I was just lucky there so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
go and get the right wall and line it up
and then line all of them off all at the
same time so let's go in here grab this
drag it over and that looks perfect and
we'll move it down a little bit and that
looks perfect
all right good so now let's get the
bottom wall and we'll line it up and
then we'll line them all up at the same
time so let's get this that's not
perfect it's okay it'll be perfect here
in a second and there we go now they're
all lined up now I just want to try to
Center all of these guys together here
so that they all look good
let's get that and let's put it in the
center right where the camera is see the
cameras right there so there we are and
this is just going to constrain that and
I think that looks pretty close and
let's move that up and there we go so
that should be exactly in the center of
the screen
this looks fouled up in the game window
but it doesn't look bad there let's go
and play and see what it looks like
yes it's off so that's a little weird so
let's move this guy over a little bit
and the top one down slightly so let's
get the whoops top wall and we'll zoom
in here a little bit so we can see and
we'll select this little guy right here
move it down just a bit there we are and
then get the right wall and move it in
just slightly and there that is and
we'll move it in just a little bit and
move it in just a little bit more and
that should be about perfect then we can
play it just to see and do everything
looks good all right so we've got all of
our walls all properly set up and we can
close all these for now and then we can
start worrying about other stuff now
what I want to do is come in here and
create our interface so I'm going to
come up here to create and UI and text
and that's going to create our canvas
and I'm going to have next be on the
left side and score be on the right side
next is going to show the next shape
that's going to appear so let's go next
but this is just going to be a label so
let's call this next label alright so
we'll select that guy and what are we
going to have we're going to have the
text be next that's what it's going to
say and we'll see where everything is at
here on our screen you can see there is
our canvas it's huge and we're going to
have to select that and we're going to
change the render mode to world space
and I'm going to set my dynamic pixels
per unit to ten and everything else here
at least right at the very very moment
is okay and let's change our position to
zero zero so that we surround our camera
on the screen with our canvas and there
that is and then the size is obviously
completely wrong right so let's go in
here look soo mning out just so I can
see the canvas II the canvas is
absolutely huge
let's bring the canvas down so that it's
a considerably smaller so here is our
width and height for our canvas I'm
going to change the width to 40 and the
height to four do just to see what it
looks like and the canvas is it needs to
go down just a little bit so let's make
that 30 that's better and then let's
have the width to be 50 see if that
works and it's making a little bit
bigger
so 55 there we go so now we have a
canvas that looks a little bit better so
we're going to zoom in here and there is
the canvas surrounding our camera looks
better now we work now we'll worry about
our next label and positioning that now
where is it actually we zoom way out of
here and you can see it's way way way
down here see there it is there's our
next label so we're going to move that
guy will they up here closer to the
screen your closer to where we want it
to go and some of you guys have been
having trouble with your text being all
blurry I'm going to show you some ways
that you can fix that what you basically
want to do is you want to have your you
want to scale with scale your text
mainly here this is where you're mainly
going to define how big the text is
going to be and then keep your font size
small if you do that then things are
going to look nicer so we want this to
be bold and I'll worry about font space
after I figure out how far to scale it
and now
just be white since its black background
so this is going to be white and that is
so what I'm going to do is I'm mainly
going to scale it using the scale tools
over here and that needs to go down
big-time so let's try 0.2 0.2 and point
two and see how that looks alright so
look at that it's already looking
doggone close and you can see my text
see my text down here in the lower left
hand side of the screen looks pretty
good done it that's because I'm scaling
it with scale I'm not trying to scale it
with the font size that's a mistake a
lot of people make and I made it and
it's just how I figured it out all right
let's take the width down on this guy so
it's not so big let's check it down to
say something like I don't know 22 and
just something and height let's take it
down to 10 and where is it well there it
is that's not good so let's select it
again and let's increase the width on
this and one we just eyeball it here
this way let's take it down this way
that looks a little bit butter let's
take it down to 50 that looks about
perfect
all right so we'll have the width be 50
and the height be 30 and I'm just you
know that box is what I'm messing with
and let's zoom in here so we can see it
a little bit better on our screen and
grab it and move it over here and I'm
going to have it be sort of positioned
wherever alright so now I'm going to
make a duplicate of that and this is
going to be my score label so I'm going
to go in here and let's change this to
score so get rid of that whoops I
suppose now score label there's that and
I'm going to change this the name of it
to score and whoops let's make it all
uppercase just like we did with next so
score and bold and white and then all
the other stuff is exactly the same and
then we're going to hold down the shift
key so that it hopefully will stay in
line and is it going to it's getting
there
and what I want to do with this guy is I
want to have it be centered and then I'm
going to make a duplicate of it and then
under that I'm going to have the other
thing like I kind of want the size font
size of this to go down a little bit so
let's go and make it something a little
bit more reasonable there's
and that looks a little bit better and
then we'll go and move this in a little
bit this is just the beginnings you know
so I'm just trying to you know sorta get
it working so that looks kind of good
and what I want to do here is I want to
make sure that the y-axis for next is
the same so this is at eight point seven
and score also eight point seven so
that's good I'm then going to mmm height
is way too much on this let's take the
height way down let's take it down to
like something big how about we just
make it 15 I change that to 15 and then
change this also to 15 that looks pretty
good and there we are let's just leave
it like that for now grab the score have
this be Center alignment and then I'm
going to make a duplicate of that so
duplicate and I'm just going to call
this score and I'm going to give this a
value of zero and this is going to be
the actual score on the screen so I got
that all set up and then we can come in
here and we can grab that and put the
score underneath there so there we go
all set up so there's the interface that
we have right at the very moment it's
not perfect but it's looking pretty good
and now what I want to do is create all
of my Tetris shapes so how am I going to
do that I'm going to zoom in here a
little bit and basically I'm going to do
it the same way I created my walls so
I'm going to go to my sprite section and
I'm going to grab my tube and I'm going
to just throw it anywhere it doesn't
matter where it goes
yep I think it went inside the canvas
area did it or it didn't no it didn't
okay good so I have cube selected and
I'm going to have my position on this be
0 and then the position also zero like
that and there I know it's in the center
of the screen now I'll show you a couple
different little tricks here because
this is about doing some tricky stuff so
I'm going to create a empty create an
empty right there whoops get rid of that
let's go and create it up here create
create empty there now it's good
grab a cube throw that inside of there
game object I'm going to make sure this
is a 0 and this is also at 0 once again
grab this guy so that
make sure everything's zeroed out and
everything will look a lot better that's
the swim the map will be easier on this
and the very first thing I'm going to do
is make the big cube that's made out of
the four so I'm going to call this just
a shape because of sort of shaped so
we'll go O'Shea and then I'm going to
have the cube here all of the Tetris
pieces have four cubes inside of them to
make them up so we're going to do four
duplicates here this and duplicate there
and what I'm going to do is there's
numerous different ways to set these up
this time what I'm going to do is I'm
going to select this guy right here and
then I'm going to click with my mouse so
grab this one on the top doesn't matter
what grabs then I'm going to hold down
the V key after clicking on that and
that's going to allow me to then move
these into position so let's go and
let's select another one so I'm going to
select it there you go you can see I
have cube - I think you can so his q and
then with it selected inside of here I'm
going to hold down the V key I'm going
to drag it over see how it goes in and
then I want to go and get the final
piece right here idents again the V key
I think this is going to allow me yes
there goes and you're going to see all
of the different pieces that go right
there and you're also going to see that
as we select the individual parts of our
shapes that we're going to be changing
these by one value so it starts off at 0
0 then 1 1 then 1 0 and then 0 1 ok so
we have all of those guys then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to select every
single one of these and I'm going to
change the color for our our shapes on
this and I don't know what the standard
color is for squares so when we just go
on the internet and find out you can see
right here the standard color seems to
be yellow so let's just stick with
yellow at least for now ok so I have all
those selected then I'm going to change
the color for all of them to yellow so
let's come in here and we will go and
just change it to yellow see how that
turns out and it looks be a good enough
color so let's just leave it like that
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to take my own shape and I'm going to
drag it over and drop it into prefabs
and then I'm going to delete it off the
screen
and then I'm going to do this for all
the other ones so let's go and let's you
know make a couple more let's try an eye
shape this time so once again I'm going
to go in here and go
create empty I'm going to call this a
shape there that is drop out of that and
then I'm going to get my cube and drop
it right inside of there I'm going to
make four duplicates sorts duplicates
duplicates and duplicates grab this
right here and then I'm going to do the
same thing as I did previously so I'm
just going to select this specific guy
that I have right here I'm going to hold
down V and then I'm going to move it to
the right and then I'm going to do the
same thing once again let's grab this
guy there we are and hold down V and
drag it to the left and grab this again
and see if I can move it over here again
I get that there select it again and
there we are so we are able to go and
make our eye shape this time so that
looks pretty good then I'm going to
select all those different items and I
went and looked ahead of time what
colors that I should make all of these
different things just so that we don't
have to waste it or waste time doing
this and I decided to use a hex code for
zero zero nine zero F F F all right so
there's a blue and that's what color
we're going to use for that guy so once
again I'm going to get my eye shape and
I'm going to drag it over and throw it
into prefabs and then I'm going to
delete it off the screen and then I'm
going to show you how to do one more of
these shapes just so I'm positive that
you have it and then I'm going to make
them on my own so you don't have to sit
here and watch me do this whole bunch of
times next one I'm going to do is a J
shape there's JJ I'm going to grab my
cube throw it in the J shape area and
I'm going to make a couple duplications
of this duplicate and duplicate and
duplicate grab all those and let's go
and select this guy right here and I'm
going to make them B flat on the top so
J shape that's going to be this way
cuz I'm going to go like this drag that
over there I'm going to select here once
again and hold down the V move it over
there and then move it over there and
then I'm going to get this guy this is
the last one I believe V move it over
there I'm releasing the V dragon again
releasing the V for
bringing it down so there you go that's
going to represent my J shape and then
I'm going to select all of those
different guys click on the color and
what did I went from my J shape this is
going to be 0 0 c7 F F F F and that's
going to be like a cyan blue alright so
there we go and of course we're going to
go and get the J shape drag it in to the
prefabs there it is
come in here and delete it now I'm going
to go create all the rest of the shapes
and okay so I'm finishing this up I have
a whole bunch of the shapes already set
up the last one that I'm going to set up
here is my Z shape so once again I'm
going to select this hold down B come
over here like that
come over here select this one hold down
V come over here like that down and get
the last guy get this here put that
there drag it down here whoops
that's not good stick it back there is
drag it down there
and there you are so there's my Z shape
and I'm going to select all of these
different guys come over here select
color and then put in my final hex code
and then after I do this I'm going to
show you how I changed all the shapes
when I was off-camera so that you can do
the same thing and that's going to be
red of course come over here grab this
drag it into prefabs and then delete it
from the scene there it is and you can
see there are all my prefab so
horizontal wall eye shape J shape L
shape a shape S shape T shape vert wall
and z shape then what we can do is way
down here if you select one of these
shapes when the prefab section if you
actually come down here and grab this
and raise that up
you're going to be able to see a sample
of those different images so if you want
your colors to look basically like what
I have you can see here I can select all
of the different shapes that we have
here on the screen and you can see all
of my different prefabs that I'm using
and the colors that I'm using for all of
my shapes
alright so there is a lot of information
basically we have our entire interface
set up and all of our game assets
created I was going to jump into code
but I think that's a little bit
overwhelming so in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
rotate and move all of your objects with
in your grid system on the left and
right and down and so forth and so on
and that should be a lot of fun so like
always guys please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
