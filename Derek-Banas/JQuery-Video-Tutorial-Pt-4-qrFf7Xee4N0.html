4 of my jQuery and video tutorial today
because you guys have sent me tons of
emails asking me questions about how to
add and remove elements and a lot of
questions in regards to how different
functions operate in jQuery that's what
I'm going to focus on today the first
thing I'm going to do is as you can see
on the right side of the screen I create
an h3 tag couple headers paragraph text
box and bunch of buttons that are going
to be hooked into functions if you
didn't watch the previous tutorials to
this definitely watch them otherwise you
may be confused also that a link to all
of the code that I use here today is in
the underbar so you might want to get
that before we continue but either way
let's continue so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to bind these buttons we
have on the right side of the screen to
some functions so they actually can do
something and replace with HTML is the
name of the first button on the right
side of the screen so I'm going to find
that button so that whenever it is
clicked it triggers a function with the
same name to be fired and right here
what I'm demonstrating is the difference
between the HTML instead of the text
function that's available for pasting
information into elements on web pages
there you go
I just bound both of those guys now I
got to create the functions for them
replace with HTML don't need any
properties in the h3 tag ID number
that's assigned to it is h3 tag and here
I'm going to use the HTML function to
paste in an h6 tag close that off let's
create another function except this is
going to do exactly the same thing
except it's going to call the text
function everything else is precisely
the same so we're going to file save
that jump over here and if you click on
replace with HTML you're going to see
that it did change it into an h6 tag it
did not print out these aged six tags
however if you click on replace with
text you're going to see that the tags
show up inside of there so that's how
those two functions completely differ
from each other so what I got to do now
is come in here and create a couple more
or bind a couple more buttons to actual
functions I'm going to show you one way
to add a paragraph in the next part of
this tutorial which is going to be a
completely different program but it's
going to be contained in this one I'm
going to show you a bunch of different
ways to add things in two very specific
locations on a web page and when I say
things I mean elements this is going to
be called remove a para
right so we got that so now we got to
create these functions no problem let's
just combine here and copy this save
ourselves some time scroll this up just
to add a para in the name of this
paragraph right here is R and para so
we're going to make those changes and
whenever we remove I'm going to set this
up so then I remove the last paragraph
and I'm doing some of these things just
to be different one of the ways anyway
to add this paragraph is using the
append function and here I'm going to
append paragraph which is kind of bad
form that either way and whenever I want
to delete this paragraph I just call
remove and call this remove a pair and
this does accept the remove function
does accept properties but I'm just
gonna leave it this way if I file save
that jump over here you could see add
text as I do that I add paragraphs and
then if I click on remove text I remove
paragraphs so now we couldn't bind a
couple more functions to buttons and I'm
going to show you how to switch these
guys mainly because I received this as a
request in regards to how you'd be able
to switch elements around on a web page
you guys do ask me some funny questions
sometimes and since I figure you got
this now I'm just going to bind all the
rest of the buttons to the functions
that I need to create below I'm going to
show you one way to add an element
before another element how to add an
element after another element make sure
you keep all of your capitalization the
same and how to change the value in a
text box in a form okay so now I got to
create all these functions I think it's
pretty self-explanatory so I have to
remove a para I'm gonna have to switch
the last with the first in one way is
actually to just keep it this way I
originally wasn't going to do it this
way but what the heck it works I'm gonna
show you here in a second a little bit
more interesting way of doing this and
here I'm just referencing the first
position here and that's all I need to
do switch the last with the first add an
element before another element here
we're going to switch this the first I'm
doing some of these things just to show
you how to use these different tools in
the second part of this tutorial I'm
going to go into some more intricacies
of what exactly is going on and here is
how you would use the after function
which change this to the last since I
already did it this way before let's
just change this to after alright then
the last function I show you is how to
change the value of a text
I showed you how to change the value of
a button in the last tutorial in the
name or the ID for this textbox is R and
text so all you do is put dot and then
followed by V al and random text if we
file save that you can see all these
guys work alright we saw this one
already before add text saw that before
last to first you can see that that
switched this previously was the first
now it's the last ad before I go before
anything jumped in there ad after I go
after everything and then should change
the value in this textbox just do that
there's a whole bunch of different ways
to put different values and move
elements around on a web page and now
I'm going to show you a little bit more
intricate way of doing this and then
explain exactly some of the complexity
involved in placing elements using
jQuery okay on the right side of your
screen basically we have an h3 tag and
we have a paragraph tag but for the most
part we're going to focus on hundred
percent on this paragraph tag them and
explain how the different functions work
specifically how before insert before
prepend to append to append and start
after and after work and i'm also going
to show you a way to delete very
specific text using the remove function
now i'm going to show you i'm just going
to type all these out before actually
places the element before the paragraph
tag itself and as you're going to say
before is going to be further out from
the paragraph tag than any of the other
ones and here i'm going to put a span
and i'm going to say before paragraph so
that you'll be able to see on the right
side of the screen exactly what's going
on now i'm going to show you insert
before insert before places the new
element as a sibling of whatever you
tell it to work with so here we're going
to tell the rand paragraph that we want
this new span to be a sibling of it
which means it's going to be on the same
level close off that span insert before
and we're just going to say insert that
text or that span that we just created
before Rand para which is the ID for the
paragraph and it shall do it now append
to actually places the new element as a
child of the paragraph and just keep my
life short here let's just go like this
and here we're going to use prepend to
entry kind is just kind of like before
sorta and here we're going to say
prepend to there
so that you'll be able to see exactly
where that shows up copy this append to
works very similar to prepend in that
it's going to place the new element
again as a child it's just going to come
after the paragraph so it's going to be
a child of this paragraph right here but
it's going to come after the text and
here we're going to copy this guy and
you have append and this is going to
place the new element as the last child
of the paragraph element here we're
going to say append paragraph and then
the last two ways of doing this I'm
going to use insert after insert after
and insert after place is the new
element as a sibling of the paragraph
just after it then the last I'm going to
demonstrate here is how the after
function works so type in after and put
in after paragraph and this just places
the new mount element after the closing
paragraph tag if we file save that you
can see this here and now you can see
where everything shows up so before this
is the before function it shows up
before the opening paragraph tag so
that's why its leftmost or outermost
then you have insert before which places
the new element as a sibling to the
paragraph that's the reason why it's
outside of / pen - which creates a child
it actually places it inside of the
paragraph tag itself and then you can
see likewise that append - also creates
a child element you can see insert after
creates siblings and after which is
right here throws my new span after the
closing paragraph tag so that is how all
three of those different things work or
actually how all what is this eight six
seven of these different things work so
try to wrap your head around it and
after you get more use to the Dom if
you're not really used to it now you'll
better understand exactly the
differences between siblings and
children and other types of elements and
how they work on a web page and then as
the final thing I'm going to show you
how to delete very specific information
on a web page and I'm just going to come
down here I'm going to type in form
just give it a junk action because I'm
just creating a button that's going to
do nothing except call a jQuery function
and I'm going to give it the ID delete
spam close that all give it a name
delete span and then close that off like
that and then close off the form so I
just create a button that's all I did
then I'm going to jump up here and find
that button little function span bind so
that when that button is clicked it's
going to call delete Spain so what I got
to do I got to create the delete span
function and I'm going to jump down here
roll that up and here I'm going to say
delete any span item or remove it I
guess I should use remove since that's
the name of the function if it contains
the word append anywhere as a value and
you could change this and have it be
based off of deleting something based
off of inputs entered into a text box or
whatever you want to do it okay file
save reload it and you can see right
here it says append and there it says
append and when I click this button that
is going to delete right now see so
there is numerous different ways to add
elements delete elements move elements
and so forth and so on with jQuery any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise till
next time uncover jQuery animations til
