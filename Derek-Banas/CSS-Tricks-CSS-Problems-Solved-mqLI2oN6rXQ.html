same cascading style sheet questions
asked and in this one video I'm going to
answer about 50 of the most common
questions that I get asked all the time
in the description you'll find a link to
all of them so you'll be able to really
quickly find whatever problem you might
have click on it and find a solution so
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so on the left side of the screen I
have a basic text editor and over on the
right side of the screen I have HTML and
I'm going to do a whole bunch of
different things here let's just start
off by editing my body tag now very
often it is very useful to use the e/m
unit sizing for our text and just about
everything else because it scales so
nicely the only problem is is the e/m
sort of don't make sense so I'm going to
show you a really easy way for them to
make sense what we're going to do is
come in here and define our font size as
60 2.5% now if you don't remember
basically whenever we use EMS document
wide all of your sizing is going to be
based off of the root level font size in
this situation that's going to be body
so by making this 60 2.5% what we're
going to be able to do if we take 16
times 60 2.5%
that is going to equal 10 and what
that's going to allow us to do is let's
say that we want to define something as
1.6 e/m that is going to be equivalent
to 16 pixels which is a very common way
for us to style fonts and that is what
we're going to do so that's just the
first thing we're going to do here then
I often come in and to find my margins
as 0 for my body this is going to solve
a lot of problems as well as my padding
also for 0 very common question is how
to get images to repeat I'm going to use
background image and we're just going to
go URL repeat pattern dot pang is
something that I have saved and when we
just come over here and reload that and
you're going to see there is a repeating
pattern now as we mess around with this
it's going to get very very sloppy but
we're going to clean it up slowly but
surely you can see there is a repeating
pattern and that is how simple it is to
do that by default it's going to repeat
to the right as well as downwards
so the thing we hear about all the time
is how do we use a fixed background
during scrolling we're just going to go
background attachment right like that
and here I can just say fixed and when
whenever we reload it you can see that
everything is scrolling but the
background is staying just firm just the
way it is you can use repeating
backgrounds at the same time that you
use a fixed position for your scrolling
let's come in here and let's style the
rapper so we'll be able to see this a
little bit better than the rapper I just
use all the time so that I can style
everything and have styling that
completely surrounds everything on my
document now here for font size I can
just go 1.6 p.m. and that's going to
work for us because of this guy up here
it's going to make a lot of sense you
can think of that like 16 pixels which
is a very common way of using fonts come
in here install my padding margin:0 and
auto is going to put everything in the
center of the screen let's just give
ourselves a fixed width of 900 pixels a
height of 2,000 pixels and we're going
to be messing around later on to show
how we can make a fluid sort of layout
so that we won't have to worry about
defining the height and let's make this
white and now you can see it looks a
little bit better and if we come out
here you can also see that the non
scrolling background is there still
working for us now let's get back inside
of here and do a couple more styling
with our body and let's say that we want
to create a gradient background well in
this situation we're going to have to do
some cross browser stuff and in this
situation I'm going to use the linear
gradient layout and you can see it right
there and exactly all the different ways
we're going to have to use or define for
this to be cross browser and you can see
I just want to start the gradient at the
top of the screen go downwards and we're
going to start off with black and then
fade to gray and if we save that reload
it you can see that's exactly what it
does starts at black and fades to gray
and it's also staying stable there as
well because we still have the non
scrollable background and I have a link
in the description that has air all this
code and it's basically set up like a
cheat sheet so you can be able to use
this to do all kinds of different things
copy and paste another thing we might
want to do is use a scalable background
image
and to do that what we're going to do is
go back round the image and I'm going to
use a completely different one-minute
link to my url and let's say I've a
mountain background make sure you always
put the semicolons there at the end then
you're going to want to define your
position as Center Center
remember we're trying to make a
background that is going to
automatically scale as the browser
window scales also going to come in and
make a background attachment and make
this fixed then we're going to have to
do another css3 trick here and make a
cross-browser and what we're going to be
using is background size with the
default set for cover and now you can
see as the background or the browser
windows scale so does your background
image so another neat little trick now
let's go outside of the body section
it's normally a good idea to set your
default margins and padding's for all of
your elements to zero so that you can
build from that and to do that we'll use
star and then we're just going to say
margin and zero and padding and zero
another thing that is very useful to be
able to do is to include all of your
padding and your margins inside of the
width and height that you define for all
of your elements and to do that document
wide you're also going to do that after
the star which once again is going to
focus on every single element the whole
entire document wide and you're going to
use box sizing with border box like I
said it's just simply going to collapse
if you say that an element is going to
be a certain height and width it's going
to include the margins and padding with
it and it just keeps from a whole bunch
of things overloading let's reload that
you can see here because I changed my
margins and padding's that if things are
a little bit sloppy but we're going to
fix that up let's go down inside of our
wrapper area here and change a whole
bunch of other different things let's
say you wanted to place a non-repeating
background and we're going to do it in
the wrapper in this situation so let's
put two of them down so we're going to
go background and image and I'm going to
URL flower background and this is a ping
file as well we have to remember it's
going to by default repeat both
horizontally as well as vertically so if
we wanted to do something different
we're gonna have to say in this
situation we're going to say no-repeat
and we're just going to put it
one position and the position that we
want to put it in background position
let's say we want to put it in the
bottom right of course you could do the
top and left and all those other
different things I'm going to do bottom
right in this situation if we do that
and reload it you're going to see there
is our little flower that we put in the
bottom right hand side of the screen now
we're also going to be able to put two
of those background images in there if
you would like and to do that we're
going to go background and here we're
going to define URL and let's do flower
background again that is put our ping
file in there and let's say we want to
put it in the top right this is one look
a little bit weird we can also go and do
no repeat here as well and then we could
also go you around flower background
thing bottom and I'm basically just
overriding the other one that I created
already no repeat and then we're going
to put white inside of there and reload
it and you can see there's a flower
background right there and there's the
other flower background so you can use
multiple different backgrounds all in
this different screen whatever you'd
like also very easily come in and change
the opacity for the wrapper which is
basically going to be everything that's
on the screen except for the body which
is going to be the background then of
course the background body is going to
show through as you can see right there
and another thing that's kind of
interesting is let's say we want to use
custom fonts now there's multiple
different ones I like to use but let's
say we want to use google fonts in this
situation you just type in Google web
fonts and Google has a ton of different
fonts that are all free another option
is font squirrel but you have to pay for
those fonts so I i'm kind of cheap so i
just like to use whatever i want to use
and let's come in here and let's first
off with specifically one of the very
popular ones is called lobster so let's
just take an Lobster
and there's lobster right there to use
it you just come in here and click on
your little button scroll down here
you're going to want to take this guy
this link right here and copy it jump
over into your HTML and you can see i
already went in there and put pasted
that in so you're just going to paste
that guy right there and then very
easily jump back over into our CSS and
let's say we wanted to style this h1
that's up here Sherlock Holmes let's say
we want to style that guy give it this
funky font go h1 and we're going to say
font family like this and you can just
jump over here to the Google Fonts and
it's going to tell you exactly what
to do you're going to use font-family
lobster or cursive copy that jump back
over here ace a 10 and reload it and you
can see now you have a funky type of
cool-looking font right there that you
are going to be automatically able to
use and of course it's from Google and
it's free so thank you google another
thing it's very common is that we want
to use our links however we want to use
them and very often we do not want
underlines with our links and I'm sure
many people know how to do this a and
visited and then you're just going to
say text-decoration:none that's going to
get rid of any underlines you have in
your links another thing you might want
to do however is highlight the links
anytime somebody hovers over them and to
do that we can just go hover and
background-color and reload it and you
can see that line went away but if we
put our mouse over top of our link you
can see that it automatically has that
different background which is kind of
cool so now let's go in here and style
our header section and of course we're
going to be able to use these tags
multiple times I have an h1 tag there
say I want to put an h1 tag down here no
problems just going to override anything
I'm going to put a margin bottom on this
guy of 0 and then I'm going to put a
text shadow on it and to do that we can
just do text shadow and here you're
going to do how much you want it to move
to the right and downwards and how much
of a blur you want and then your color
of choice you can see now there's a text
shadow on there it looks kind of cool we
could then come in and let's style these
paragraphs a little bit and let's give
them a margin of 10 pixels see they
spread out a little bit let's also say
that I want to then come in and remove
the margin for a paragraph if it follows
an h1 to do that look for an h1 and a
paragraph and then we could change our
margin top to zero if you don't like to
indent text so the first paragraph I
here has a class of first P if we jump
over here and look at that see first P
there it is let's say I want to go in
there and indent attack specifically
just type in first pay like this and
tatting left and then
point emm 1.4 a.m. and you can see that
indented so I'm just rocketing through
all the different ways of doing all
these things let's say you also want to
enlarge the first letter of a paragraph
let's say in this situation I want to
enlarge the first letter of my fourth
paragraph I can just go fourth pay and I
can target the first letter right like
this let's say I want to change my font
size 200% I'm then going to want to
float it to the left so that it has a
little bit of shape there and change my
line height one see how that works
reload and you can see there is the T
and it's a little bit enlarged and it
fits right in there and the reason why
it fits inside of there is causing the
float now let's go in here and fix my
dog pick this little cute dog up here
going to focus in on this guy again dog
pick let's throw a boarder on him want
to know how to you can throw borders on
pretty much anything so solid and let's
just make it black just for simplistic
reasons
let's also throw a margin in there 10
pixels and the reason why is we're going
to float that to the left so that it
works seamlessly with all the text but
also has some shape there and there you
can see very very simple no the thing we
can do say we want to add a drop shadow
to our little dog picture again we want
to do this in a cross-browser way so
this situation we use box shadow and
just like before we're going to say how
much we want it to move horizontally and
vertically and this is going to be the
blur amount and this is going to be the
size of the shadow and this is going to
be the color of the shadow and you can
see that's just how easy it is to add a
little box shadow say we also want to
come in here and round the corners of
this box again this is a cross-browser
way of changing the border radius and
we're going to change that radius by 10
pixels reload it and now you can see
it's rounded and then finally let's say
we want to rotate the image again
cross-browser we're going to target
using rotate and we're just going to
rotate it three degrees and there you
can see it's rotated three degrees
there's a whole bunch of different ways
to work with images and we'll get into a
couple more another thing we want to do
here is let's say that we want to use an
image inside of our list items here's a
list item right down here and let's say
we want to throw in
a little picture inside of there instead
of using boring bullets and things like
that
well we just go list style image if you
can see here I'm using sublime text if
you have a little bit of a nice editor
it's going to automatically throw in
everything you need there you're not
going to have to think so I enjoy not
having to think if at all possible let's
come in here and if we want to remove
the list indents which can be unsightly
we can just go to list style type and
change that to none and we're going to
have to also change our padding left
let's make that 20 pixels and then
remove the margin left automatically and
we'll change that to zero point now you
have little cute little icons there
instead of ugly bullets then you can
play around with the margins and have
that line up however you'd like if you
would then want to have all of your list
items instead displayed horizontally
these are called notices that's the name
of this class we would then target our
list items like this and then display
inline reload and now you can see they
line up horizontally it got rid of the
bullets and all that but here is the
list items right there all horizontally
set up and now let's mess around with
tables so we have this table down here
that has all kinds of football
statistics inside of it I'm going to
style that guy up first thing I'm going
to do is target the table as a whole and
I'm going to define that I want my
caption which by default goes at the top
so this guy up here I'm going to
automatically put that down at the
bottom instead and to do that you have
to go caption side and change it to
bottom and you can see and if L football
stats goes down at the bottom we could
then come in and target quarterback
stats bounce over here and look at it
where's our table app you can see here
is a table there's the caption there you
are and the name of this is quarterback
stats that's the table again so we could
either target it as the table or using
the class name doesn't really matter say
that we want our width for this to be
600 pixels we could add a border to this
all one pixels and let's make it solid
and let's make it black if we want to
eliminate any space between ourselves we
could do border collapse and set that
for collapse up change this to
quarterback stats there you
see our tables start to look a little
bit nicer if we would want to come in
and put a border around ourselves we
could do quarter back stats target the
rows and let's also target the headers
stats th and then go border one pixel
let's make it solid
let's make it black again it's coming
together looking a little bit nicer each
time we make a little change here we
could then style the table columns
specifically so quarterback stats TD say
we want to have the text alignment set
for center because we think that'll look
a little bit nicer and we could come in
and do some padding as well say 0.3 e/m
coming together looking a little bit
nicer now let's come in and style our
table headings specifically change our
font way to bold so that they show up a
little bit nicer change our padding to
the same 0.3 mm let's give them a
different background color a little bit
darker color and let's change our text
color to white so that it shows up nice
boom coming together alright so let's go
in here and change couple other
different things let's say we want to
alternate the colors on our table rows a
very common thing people like to do we
can just go TR and then go end child and
let's say we want to do styling on the
odds you could also put even inside
there to get the absolute opposite
results and then you just go background
color and if you're wondering where I
get these colors from well let's reload
it so you can see that there you go it's
looking pretty cool I just go wiki
colors and if you go on here right this
guy right here
Wikipedia wiki list of colors a through
F you're going to see a whole ton of
different colors and this is where I get
all those couplers from I've shown you
guys this before but what the heck ought
it show again another thing might be
kind of neat is if we're trying to look
at this table right here let's say we
would like to really be able to focus in
whenever we hover over certain rows we
can also do that we're back stats and TR
and we can specifically zoom in on hover
and make changes only when it's hovered
over
and background color I need to figure
out what you can do and what things you
can change whenever you're hovering over
different things it's a nice little
touch you don't often see on most web
sites and then we can also change the
color of the text if we'd like and
reload and now whenever we go over all
these different rows we'll be able to
really focus in and be able to read the
information in the table a lot cooler
and you can see this these two little
lines of text right here and it adds a
lot of functionality it's something you
don't often see and it's really cool now
let's go into actually styling forms and
you can see here is a form right here
and it's very very ugly so let's make it
so that everything lines up a little bit
nicer now this has the ID of custom form
so let's target that and let's give it a
width first off of 375 pixels we then
target a div inside of it so custom form
you can see over here what that is
let's get out of this and here is our
form right here and it has the ID of
custom form so custom form and then
inside of it it has a div okay so custom
form div say we want to float this to
the left side of our screen with 375
pixels
add some padding to this guy so 0.5 e/m
basically the same thing on the right
let's add a little bit more padding
though see it's starting to straighten
up a little bit so let's add a little
bit more of width to all of our labels
so that they will all line up for
themselves
let's go to a custom form and target the
labels which is the thing that's causing
problems you can see here the labels are
butting up right next to the input
fields and you know kind of a mess let's
fix that to a float:left on those and
then define their width let's make it
100 pixels so that looks like boom now
you can see they line up a little bit
better
let's also come in and specifically
target the input fields custom form
which we have a text area here and let's
also go and target the inputs that are
inside of the form and let's give all of
those the same width of 250 pixels boom
now everything lines up looks a lot
neater got that submit button down there
looking kind of ugly though so let's go
and fix that as well so let's go custom
submit let's float it
to the right side of the screen with
auto and then give it a margin right of
10 pixels see what that does
reload boom there you can see it lines
up all really nicely and looks a little
bit nicer and looks a lot nicer than it
did before
another thing it's kind of neat is to be
able to really highlight the different
parts of the form whenever they are
accepting input and how you can do that
let's go to custom form input and use
focus so anytime an input field has
focus we're gonna change this background
color their background color you can
play around with this and pick a color
that you think works best for you there
we go just that one line of text and now
whenever you focus
we're gonna see the background colors
ever so slightly changes so that's
useful and then we could do exactly the
same thing for the text area let's just
come in here and we could just do this
copy just to keep it simple and then
focus reload and now you can see the
color change there as well
just a little touches a little touches
here and there as this whole tutorial is
basically about just a little tiny
changes you can make that add a lot of
functionality now let's say that we want
to come in here and let's just imagine
this is a store or something like that
and we want to float a discount offer up
here on the right side of our screen how
might we go about doing that and we can
see here come way down there it is div
class discount is the name of the class
and let's say we want to float 50% off
with offer code Sherlock okay let's say
we're selling Sherlock Holmes stuff here
well to target that we're just going to
get a discount change our background
color here to a white so that shows up
real nice and easy let's go and throw a
border on it because things like that
normally have a border and we'll say 4
pixels solid and let's make that black
and we'll throw a little bit of a
padding on that as well
of 10 pixels and then let's have our
font size which would make a lot of
sense if it was 14 but we're using our
little e/m trick that I showed you here
first off so we're going to be able to
go 1.4 am and now what we're going to
want to do is since we want this to
float up here on the top right hand side
of the screen and the div is actually in
any HTML way way far below what we're
going to do is we're going to position
this absolutely so whenever you do
things absolutely the positioning is
going to be based on the viewport
the browser window itself and we're
going to see that sometimes things like
that can go horribly wrong but I'm going
to show you how to fix that so we're
going to go absolute and we're going to
say a top zero pixels from the very top
of the viewport and then we'll say right
55 pixels so 55 pixels from the right
and reload it and you can see there's
our offer code right there but you can
see also that as it is moving around
it's sort of looking terrible so let's
fix that it's bouncing around a lot we
don't want that we want it to stay more
fixed well we can fix that really really
easy by just targeting our wrapper and
then set our position for the wrapper to
be relative so that means whenever this
is positioned absolutely this discount
div that's inside of the wrapper it is
going to be positioned absolutely
relative to the wrapper that surrounds
it reload it boom now you're going to
see whenever we resize it it is not
moving around it is going to stay
exactly where it is so kind of cool they
could also come in here now what you
would never do this you would try to
keep all of your different styling
together but let's say I want to move
that discount over a little bit so that
it's positioned right on the very edge
of the wrapper reload and now you can
see it is its position right there and
no matter how this is sized it's
automatically going to stay exactly
where it is
you're probably wondering down here in
this HTML what are all these puppy
pictures and what am I going to do with
them well what I'm going to do is I'm
going to turn them into a gallery so the
name of these puppy pictures or what
surrounds them is gallery you can see
right here UL class gallery and they're
in an unordered list so I can target
them by going ul gallery like this we of
course want to eliminate all of our
bullets and to do that we go list style
and none our bullets are going if we
don't want to allow our elements to have
anything on the left or the right of our
gallery so that we what I'm saying is we
want this gallery to come down here so
there's not going to be a forum on the
left side of the screen we can just go
clear and both and that will not allow
anything on the left side or the right
side of our gallery and you can say
there see they automatically move down
now what I'm going to do is target each
one of my list items and I'm going to
display them using inline block a lot of
people get
fused about what exactly does
inline-block mean well basically we have
different ways of categorizing elements
inside of our page or inside of our
document inline elements are going to be
elements that are not followed by a new
line and whenever you use inline
elements one of the negatives is that
you're unable to style the margins the
padding the height width and so forth
and so on so if we want to have our
elements act like inline elements
meaning there's not going to be a new
line so that we can have our gallery
items all lined up right after another
however we also want to come in and be
able to style the margins and padding's
and Heights what we use is inline block
we can then position them relative and
what we're doing with this is we're
going to set it up this way so that I
can position the spans like eating stick
and all these these guys are only going
to show up if you float over your image
so I'm going to be working with an
element inside of my pictures which is
just a span and I'm going to have them
show up anytime I float overtop the
image you'll see here in a second I'm
gonna target you our gallery and
specifically target my spans I'm going
to give them a width of 250 pixels
because that's the size of my image I'm
going to give them a height of 35 pixels
I'm going to have them align to the
center of my image and then I want to
specifically position the span on the
gallery images so to do that go
position:absolute so we use relative
here so that these are positioned
absolutely relative to the pictures okay
so just like we did previously I'm going
to have them show up position to
absolutely insan those pictures zero
pixels on the bottom and then start on
the left zero pixels so it's going to
completely cover the bottom of the image
whenever we put our mouse over it you're
going to see here in a second how I do
that let's change our background color
to black but give it an opacity of 75%
so it looks kind of nice in the image
shows through and then to finish off
let's say we want our color to be white
so that the little text shows up on the
image really nice and then go ul
galleries fan and have the default for
our span whenever
it's not being hovered on the margin
left set for something extremely large
like ten thousand pixels so that means
this band by default is going to be off
the screen and then what we can do is go
ul Galerie and whenever the list items
are hovered over we want to target our
span that is there and move the margin
left to zero and boom and everything
lines up and you can see and have a
little bit of a bug make sure that we
spell everything right there is position
and reload and now you can see whenever
we put our mouse overtop of the image
the little span pops up there and gives
us more information on the image there's
a whole bunch of different things we can
do tricks with CSS now what I'm going to
do is focus min on layouts and how to
set up a two column layout as well as a
three column layout okay so you see here
I have a basic little bit of HTML and
what I'm going to do is style this into
a two column layout and show you how
easy is to transfer it into a three
column layout so I'm again going to come
in here and target every single thing on
the screen and I'm going to set my
margin to zero on that and my padding to
zero on that and very often you use
something called normalize to normalize
everything across the entire website and
I normally do use that you can see a lot
about that in my Suzy tutorial which is
on my youtube channel let's come in here
and first off start targeting the
background color for our body now let's
just make this gray again just to keep
everything simple again we're going to
change our font size for the body to 60
2.5% so that we can use EMS and make
them make sense we could then target our
wrapper which is going to wrap around
every single element our web page and
let's change that to 900 pixels let's
change document wide our font size to
1.6 am let's have everything
automatically center there that's how we
do that and let's change the background
color for this guy to white reload that
and there you can see it's sort of kind
of coming together first off what jumps
out is the padding onto the paragraphs
looks absolutely horrendous so let's
change our padding change it to zero
zero one e/m and zero again see how that
works
reload we have our unordered list down
here which is going to eventually be in
the sidebar let's target that ul and
let's get our padding left on that
change that to 20 pixels now let's mess
around with our header section so we
have cute but dangerous let's make that
look a little bit nicer
and let's jump over here and look at
this alright so basically I have here's
the regular head section you can see I'm
going to use another google font here
here's my link to my stylesheet
right there and you can see here is the
wrapper which surrounds everything here
is the header which just has an h1 tag
in it that says cute but dangerous so
let's style that so header do a whole
bunch of things here let's change text
align let's have it automatically
aligned to the right side of the screen
let's target my background color on this
and let's make it brown just to see what
that looks like change our color for our
text white so that shows up nice change
padding across the entire things to e/m
change our font family this is another
Google phone I have it's called
permanent marker or we'll use cursive by
default and then finish everything off
we'll add a text shadow which you saw
previously and two pixels to the right
two pixels vertically and the amount of
blur that we want if we want to define a
very specific color with our alpha let's
just have this be zero zero zero which
is going to be black and then we'll have
it be 50% a couple little minor changes
and you get pretty dramatic results okay
so let's change this again let's focus
in on the main part which is going to
surround all of the article information
so come over here see right here is main
and then I have everything divided into
sections for each one of these guys and
there's going to be h2 tags there's
gonna be a picture is going to be a
couple paragraphs of information and
then you can see there's another section
there so main is going to surround all
of the actual articles on our web page
so let's do a couple little things here
say padding and let's make this two e m
and position:relative that means I'm
going to be styling some things inside
of here absolutely so let's save that
now you can see it fits better inside of
the screen there let's go and Targ
our image and as you can see let's go
here I gave everything a class in this
situation so that I could specifically
target the mean koala picture right here
I gave it to class names so I have mean
koala so I can target it specifically
and then I have art image so I can
target all of my art images so I'm going
to target art image which is going to be
both of those I'm going to float them to
the left so that the text wraps around
them and then I'm going to give them a
margin of 10 pixels you can say
everything's just snaps right together
let's go with our h2 tags let's say that
we want to add a little bit of a margin
to those that and margin bottom let's go
10 pixels and let's also come in here
target that HR tag and give it a little
bit more of a margin on the bottom let's
say 10 pixels actually let's make this
one e/m so that looks reload now you can
see they're divided up a little bit
better actually for the HR tag I'm just
going to target all the margins so it's
reload there it looks a little bit nicer
now I'm going to target my vertical
navigation box over in the HTML here
again vertical navigations down here it
is an unordered list that is in an aside
and this guy is going to go in my
sidebar on the left side or on the right
side of the screen so let's target that
vertical nav first let's go and get
list-style-type set that to none so that
doesn't have any of those ugly bullets
on there
and let's change our padding to zero
pixels on all those if we want to target
the individual list items now and go
vertical nav li and i'm going to want to
display them block in this situation
because i want them to be on separate
lines and i also want to be able to
style them by messing with the borders
and so forth and bottom border bottom
and i want to put one pixel dotted and
let's make that brown reload and there
you can see they are down there I want
to put them over here on the right side
of the screen however and as you can
remember they are on or inside of an
aside so let's say I want to make that
250 pixels wide you can go with 250
pixels
I want to float it to the right side of
the screen so that I have two bars
and let's go and give it a background
color of a light brown and something
else that's kind of cool is very often
it looks really nice whenever well let's
just do this
file save reload there you can see it's
down there on the right side of the
screen let's go in here to the main
section and the reason why it's on the
right side of the screen is because we
have a main section we want to have that
be float:left and let's give it a width
of say 550 pixels and of course you're
going to have to measure this out sale
that works boom and there you can see is
our side bar up there and here is the
main section right there
and the white went away but we're going
to fix that in a second another thing
one is zero and on here is how exactly
can we get the side bar to stretch the
whole way down to the bottom of the
screen even though there's no content
here well there's a little trick we can
do with our side we can go
padding-bottom
and then pick an astronomical number
that you know you won't go by so 5,000
pixels for example and then what we do
is we go margin bottom instead of the
padding bottom like that and set it to
negative 5,000 pixels has to be the same
exact amount and now you can see it
stretches down there out even though
there is no content down there so it's a
neat little trick we're then going to
clean up everything here with our footer
as well and also we're going to want to
hide any of the sidebar see it
automatically goes down here and goes
5,000 pixels so if we want to hide that
what we have to do is get an element
that surrounds everything and in this
situation wrapper surrounds everything
and go overflow:hidden so that will give
us a full length sidebar no matter how
big the content area is here but it's
also going to hide any extra space
reload and there you can see the white
came back and the sidebar is exactly the
same height as your main content area
and then finally we want to go in here
to our footer section which is just a
bar we want to make sure that nothing no
elements go on the right or the left
side of it we just go clear both and
background color just so it stands out a
little bit better let's just change that
to brown just for simplicity reasons and
we can define or height for this to 100
pixels and our width to 900 pixels which
is exactly the same as the header and
margin is going to be 0 and
so that it does exactly the same things
as our header and there's our footer so
that is how we go and create a
two-column website how hard is it to
change this into a three-column website
well it's actually going to be pretty
simple I'm going to go into my HTML
section and I'm going to come right here
right after the header and if I want
something to go on the left side of
screen so I'm gonna have a left sidebar
and a right sidebar gonna come in here
I'm going to create a div and we call it
left nav unordered list just like before
I'm just going to use the same exact
thing here just for the heck of it just
to keep it simple and I'm going to save
that I'm going to jump over into my CSS
file and just keep on adding some
styling to this so I just need to allow
for space so that everything is going to
fit in I'm going to target the left nav
which is the HTML that I just threw
inside of there I'm going to define its
width as 200 pixels so it's going to fit
there on our screen I'm gonna float it
to the left side of the screen because
it's gonna be my left sidebar let's go
and give it the same background as well
as list style and padding as this guy
right here so background color and I
want this and I want the padding so that
it goes the whole way down the screen so
let's just go in there paste that in and
let's also say that I want to now let's
go and also target the list-style-type
let's try it change that to none so that
we don't have any bullets and then let's
go and give it a padding of 0 but we
want to do that before we go and mess
around with a padding bottom right there
reload and there you can see it shows up
but our other sidebar goes down the
right side of screen because we didn't
allow for enough space for that so we're
going to target left nav unordered list
and give it a padding of 0 pixels then
target each of the individual list items
left nav li again we're going to display
those as blocks so that once again we'll
be able to use borders and so forth on
them we're going to need to do a border
bottom exactly the same as we did before
one pixel dotted and brown and then
we'll add some custom padding to these
so 0.5 em0 on the right side 0 right
side padding 0.5 e/m that's the bottom
padding
0.5 p.m. for the left patting we're then
going to have to target the main section
and shrink it down so we have room for
our left and right to sidebar so let's
just try something simple like a width
of 400 pixels and then target the aside
and give it a width of 200 pixels just
like we did with the left sidebar and
there you can see everything lines up
really nice at this rate sidebar is
going mess with that a little bit too so
let's just copy this so that it looks
the same as the other one come in here
paste that in there that's not the one I
want to target let's get rid of that try
that one boom there you go that is how
easy it is to do a two column as well as
a three column layout in CSS and in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you how
to create responsive website designs so
