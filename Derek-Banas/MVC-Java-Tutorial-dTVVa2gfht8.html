MVC Java tutorial my goal here is to
teach you completely how to use the
model-view-controller it is extremely
simple if you have ever had any problem
with it in the past those problems are
going to be over by the end of this
tutorial so what is the MVC I think the
reason why people get confused about it
is the name model-view-controller kind
of confusing not really though you could
instead refer to it as the data
interface coordinator because basically
all it does is separates all data and
calculations into the model class and
separates the interface into the view
class and then the controller class is
going to coordinate all interactions
between the view and the model that is
all it is and I'm just going to jump
right into the code and show you how it
works so let's get into it so here we
are got my Eclipse open and I'm going to
create the model first because it is the
simplest part of this whole entire thing
and the model is just simply going to
hold all the data and perform all the
calculations needed and that is it it
won't even know the view exists so we're
just going to go public class calculator
model and all the code is available in a
link underneath of the video you should
get it because it's heavily commented
and it will help you understand and of
course it is free so what I'm going to
do here this program is just going to
add two values and display them on the
screen and the final value is going to
be calculation value just going to sum
two numbers put them on the screen
that's it so then I need to provide all
the methods that are going to be needed
to perform these calculations on this
data so I'm going to create a method
called add two numbers going to get an
int names first number and another one
second number and guess what it's going
to add them that's all it's going to do
and it's going to store them in
calculation value first number and this
might seem very simplistic but I promise
you this is the basics of an MVC and it
can be applied in any way and this
program could be definitely elaborated
on and turned into a full functioning
calculator if you'd like or whatever you
want to do with it and then we have to
provide a way to get my calculation
value returned Julia should wow you and
that is it there's the model it's done
what does it do it contains the data
which is just calculation value it
performs the method that is needed and
provides access to the data that is all
the model does in all MVC's so now let's
get into the view this is probably the
most complicated part of it calculator
view is the name and the only reason
it's complicated is the interface part
that's it the actual code that is part
of the view is very simple so we're
going to have the capability to perform
and catch events whenever the user is
going to click on things and then that
is and then we're going to import some
swing components so that we'll be able
to make ourselves an interface and then
I'm just going to come in here public
class calculator view extends jframe
and this is the java stuff from making
the interface doesn't really have
anything to do with the Model View
controller or the view in this situation
so we're going to allow the user to
enter a number and let's make it 10 wide
and then I'm just going to build the
interface right here exactly the way
that I would have it on the screen so
there's going to be a block in there
where they're going to be able to enter
a number then I'm going to put a
addition sign new jlabel
you could skip to the end of the
tutorial if you wanted to see what the
final thing is going to look like and
then come back because I haven't built
it yet that's the reason why I can't
show it to you all right then what makes
sense after that is I'm going to have
another block where they're going to be
able to enter the second number easy
enough and then I'm going to need to
have a button that they can click on to
perform the calculation che button and
it's going to have the word calculate on
it guess I could have put some and then
finally jtextfield solution and like I
said before the model doesn't know
anything about the view it doesn't even
know it exists and let's just make that
10 so so there's that now that we have
all our components to find that we're
going to use and like I just said
if that in any way confuses you don't
worry about it this can be applied to
any language this is just job as
specific now I'm going to set up the
interface it's going to display on the
screen its equal to nu J panel and then
you can forget about this altogether all
this is going to do is whenever they
click on the X to close the application
it's going to make sure that the
application is indeed closed I'm just
going to click exit on close and then
let's just set a size I know I don't
need that big of a area I'm going to say
600 pixels wide 200 pixels tall and then
I'm going to add all of my components
that I'd created above to the panel save
myself some time and this is going to be
second number and this guy is going to
be actually I want this to be edition
label she's going to be the Plus on
second number calculate button
everything's just going to be displayed
in a the exact order that I have here
calc solution and then I just want to
add calc panel to the jframe which
that's what calculator view is is the
jframe and that is the end of setting up
components that is all I need to do that
is what's going to be displayed I'm
going to go and provide a way to get
access to the first number and this is
just going to return I'm going to have
to turn this into an integer because it
returns whenever I call get text it
returns a string so I have to do that
get text like that and there we are and
then we're going to do pretty much the
identical same exact thing for the
second number and then we're going to
perform pretty much exactly the same
thing to get the calculation so calc
solution and calc solution which is
going to get me whatever is inside of
the J text fields say J text field is
going to have whatever is entered in
there it's going to return that for me
that is what get text does and then we
have to provide a way to set the value
of calc solution because the model is
going to do that calculation for me but
the model doesn't know about the
existence of the view so the controller
part is going to have to actually set
this I'm just going to name that
solution and if I want to set the
value for that jtextfield I'm just going
to go set text and then it's going to
come over as an integer so I am going to
convert it into a string like I said you
can just get all this code and copy and
paste it if you don't want to type it
out and then this is probably the most
complicated part of the whole thing I'm
going to add a way so that whenever a
button is clicked on my little
calculator here that the controller is
going to be alerted to that fact that's
all action listener and I'm going to
call this listen for calc button
so whenever the calc button is clicked
on it's going to go and call the
controller and say hey controller you
handle this because I'm the view I don't
do anything like that let me go
calculate button add action listener so
it's going to listen for the action
being the clicking of the calculation
button and of course it gives me an
error because that doesn't exist anymore
I haven't created the controller yet and
then let's also say like what are we
going to do if they go and click on the
calculation button without entering any
numbers or whatever though that's going
to trigger an error so we want to be
able to handle that and that is all the
view does is handle what is being viewed
and let's just have a little pop-up show
up here so message dialog
this can be my screen and then whatever
the error message is that they pass over
and that is the end of the view it's not
complicated quite simple all it is is a
view that is it doesn't do much of
anything else so now let's go into the
actual calculator controller and this
guy is going to handle interactions
between everything so I know I needed
action events and all that stuff I'm
just going to let that come up here on
its own calculator controller and since
it is the only thing that knows about
the view person in the view and the
model we're going to store that inside
of it and then we're going to go and
create a constructor for it and then
we're going to pass in calculator view
the view and calculator model the model
just makes much more sense if you just
think of that as data I think this is
the guy that's kind of confusing then
just
this love you is equal to the view that
was passed in here and this the model is
equal to the model that was passed in
now what I got to do is tell the view
that whenever the calculate button is
clicked to execute the action performed
a method that is going to be in the
inner class called calculate listener
below which I'm going to create here in
a second I'm just going to go this with
all of you because I want to refer to
this objects version of the view not
love you that was passed in here and I'm
going to go add calculate listener new
calculate listener when I create that
constructor here in a second so just
copy that and I'm just going to have
this be an inner class calculate
listener implements action listener so
we can listen to what's going on with
our view with our controller and it's
going to give me a message that I need
to implement my unimplemented methods
which is going to be action performed
which I mentioned before and this is
where all of the interaction is going to
occur so I'm going to go first number
second number and then because I don't
know if the user of my view or my
interface is going to enter both numbers
before they hit calculate I have to
surround everything with a try block so
that I can stop any errors from being
triggered verse number and to get the
first number entered I'm just going to
come in here and go get first number and
that's going to get whatever is in the
view and store it in there the value and
then I'm going to do the same thing for
second number and this is second number
there we are then I have to go okay hey
model you perform all my calculations
remember the controller doesn't do
anything except and all the interactions
between the view and the guy that's
going to perform our calculations and
that's going to be first number second
number pass those in there and the model
is going to remember store that in
calculation value right like that and
then I'm going to go to the view all
right well I want you to set my
calculation solution there it is right
there however I need to actually get it
and it is stored in the model because
that's where all the data is and I have
to say get calculation value that is
stored inside of there
right this guy right here get
calculation value that's all and we're
pretty much done I think I had to do is
catch the error that's going to be
triggered and the error that will be
triggered if they do not enter a number
into one part of my calculator and hit
calculate the view display error message
remember and what do I want to say I'll
say you need to enter two integers and
that is that so now I just need to go
create all these objects and I'm going
to do that inside of MVC calculator Java
so just give me in here and go
calculator view with all of you is equal
to new calculator view and then what do
I need to do I need to create the model
just call that the model new calculator
model and as you can see they don't know
each other exists and then I need to
create the controller that's going to
allow those two to interact with each
other without knowing that either one
exists so in this situation I'm going to
have to pass in the model and the views
so it knows what to work with the view
and the model and then the final thing I
need to do is actually make the view
visible on the screen and I just set
visibility to true and that does that
for me and I have one little air add
calculate listener I have the names
wrong that's all I need to call add
calculation listener instead that sort
of stuff that happens sometimes when I
do this stuff out of my head just bounce
in there and the air goes away and then
bounce over into calculator view and
just change this to listener for calc
button and there we are problem solved
and execute and there you can see opens
up on our screen and I can enter one
plus two and hit calculate and get three
and change this to 4 and hit calculate
and get six and whatever you would like
and as you can see you could easily add
a whole calculator interface on this or
most anything you could ever want all
you're going to need to do is add
additional methods to the model or
additional data and everything just
works so that is my tutorial on NBC I
hope it is now completely understandable
