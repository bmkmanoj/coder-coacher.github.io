2 of my tutorial on how to make a
featured content plugin for WordPress
but also along the way we're going to
learn how to create a featured content
tool that you can use on pretty much any
type of website he didn't want to part 2
of this tutorial definitely check that
out otherwise you'll be lost there's a
link in the underbar for all of the code
that is used in this tutorial and over
here on the right side of the screen
you're going to see exactly what we're
going to be creating this time whenever
this page is loaded automatically this
first guy's a pasty is shrunk down or
taken down by forty percent this
information is going to update both here
in the title as well as here in this
description excerpt as we click on these
different guys and you're going to be
able to do it in any way possible and in
later tutorials I'm going to have this
automatically scroll but could keep this
understandable I want to keep this kind
of short so right here what we have is
from the last tutorial what was called
featured content PHP this is all that
was created in the last tutorial so I'm
going to come in here and start adding a
couple things because i'm going to use
jquery basically there's going to be a
stylesheet there's going to be a PHP
file and there is going to be a jquery
or javascript file i'm going to have to
include for now the jquery library and
how you do that and along the way in
this tutorial on purpose i inserted code
that would he answer a lot of the
questions i've been getting in regards
to how to use jquery so this is how you
link out to the source for the jquery
libraries and this is considered
probably the best way to do this rather
than loading it right on your server
because google is going to provide
access to these libraries very quick and
efficiently based off of where you're
located at in the world if you want to
see more on jquery i'll provide a link
to that tutorial as well on the screen
but that's basically all you have to do
right there is add in that code right
there and if you can't see it this is
where you locate that but again codes in
the underbar so now i'm going to have
access to the jquery library and also
want to link out to my source code that
contains my javascript code and this is
how you do that again text or /
javascript and then the location of that
code I have it in a folder located in
the same place as featured content but
the name of that folder is Jas and I
gave it the same name but you wouldn't
have to but of course you'd have to
change it here so that's how we would
link out to that javascript code that we
need and then i'm going to come down
here to this part
MTT article title that is this guy up
here and by default I'm just going to
have this for now again whenever this
becomes a wordpress site this is all
going to change but what I did was I put
the word shark in here because that's
the first thing that loads on the screen
so i had to make that change and then
really there's not that many other
different changes except here in the
article excerpt area which is this guy
right here I'm of course going to want
that to change based off of whatever
informations inside here and it's going
to be real easy to do it's going to
create a punch of paragraph tags and
this is important I'm going to give them
a title so whenever we come in here we
open up our images here on the screen
you can see WordPress what it's
automatically going to do is let's say I
upload something called elephant dot jpg
what's WordPress is going to do is going
to automatically create this thumbnail
for me that's 60 by 60 and any spaces
that I have in my file name it's going
to automatically put a dash and like i
said this thumbnail is going to be
automatically created so i upload
elephant dot jpg it turns it into this
and in situations where i would update
polar bear the image would automatically
have a dash in here if i put a space
inside of there so that's something
that's important for later on but of
course if you didn't quite get all that
don't worry about it we'll get back into
it so basically what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to create a bunch of
paragraph tags that are all going to
have special information pertaining to
what I have here on the screen and save
time I'm just going to do a view source
on this because I'm doing is really
copied and pasted them and I'm going to
come down to here and I'm going to copy
all the information that's in this
excerpt and i'm going to plug it in here
between paragraph tags and then i just
have to do the same thing for polar bear
penguin elephant and eight which are all
my different parts and with heck for
this tutorial I'm just going to cough
this and leave these all do the same
these excerpts will all be different of
course but in this situation just to be
quick i'm going to let them all be the
same so then again i'm going to make
this polar dash bear and remember i have
that dash in there because it's going to
help me out later on whenever WordPress
automatically creates all these files
and the next thing i want to show up is
the penguin and the next thing is the
elephant and the last thing is the eight
got all those in there and whenever we
do this in wordpress this is all going
to be automatically generated based off
the name of the image that the upload
and then i'm going to come down to the
read more section and we can get rid of
this for now because this is going to be
a link that's going to actually take
them to the article so
here we're just going to speed the
process up here and create the link
right now I don't know what it's going
to be for this situation because there
are no articles so I'm just going to put
this little default and side here and
I'm just going to give it an alt tag of
article and then I'm going to come in
here and close off that link all right a
lot of the stuffs done now I got to come
down into the ntt featured pic that's
going to be that's this day of right
here that's going to contain all my
pictures and it's need to make a couple
little changes inside of here which is
the point at all of the images that i
uploaded where that i want a linked to
my featured content barn and i have a
folder called images and then i called
it a pj peg and then alt I'm just call
this aight i like that I'm gonna have to
do that for all five images and this
toolbar or this featured content tool is
going to work no matter how many images
they put in there so if they put in one
or two or three they're gonna be a
maximum of five just because that's the
way I laid it out but there is no
minimum it's going to automatically
adjust based off of whatever was done so
then I got to just put in all these
descriptions there's a polar bear and
here's shark alright so I got that done
really there's not much more to do
except I need to put the thumbnail
images in here in this bottom bar so
right after left button which is this
button right here I'm going to come in
here and create some more classes or
more divs going to copy this for now
right like that then I'm going to change
some of the things inside of here this
is going to be called ntt thumbnail
frame and then my source is actually
going to be taken from up here grab this
guy and paste that over top of that and
then I'm going to give it a class
featured thumb close that off I'm going
to change this alt text right here to a
picture and then on top of that i'm
going to give it a title that is equal
to 80 now i can copy this and add in all
the other thumbnail images with their
special alt tags and all their
information after eight elephant that
fine make sure you put in these quotes
wise it'll mess up a whole bunch of
things and I gotta do the same thing
here for penguin penguin and let's just
copy that in and then we're going to go
polar bear alt is going to be polar bear
and polar bear these quotes and then
finish it off with the shark shark
picture short title and because these
are thumbnails that are 60 by 60 what do
I got to do here I'm going to come in
and use the exact
same formatting that wordpress uses so
it's 60 by 60 again this is all created
automatically for me and then just paste
all those in there right like that and
that is all that we need to change in
regards to the PHP file to make this guy
work now comes the heavy lifting the
javascript file this next file is going
to be a jquery javascript file so how
you call Jai Courtney just start it off
with this ready function and basically
what this says is this is called
whenever the page is loaded and it's
ready for you to add all your jquery and
it always ends right like this so that
we close off all on braces and then what
i'm going to do first off is i am going
to have all of my excerpts all lay on
top of each other and have all these
pictures here lay on top of each other
so i'm going to come in very first thing
and i'm going to target those excerpts
that are put there and i'm going to make
them invisible so in jquery how you do
that is dollar sign and then the class
for the excerpts is called auntie T
article excerpt and if you remember
previously I was putting in paragraph
tags so I just put a pee inside of there
and that will target all those excerpts
then I'm going to change the CSS styling
on them and I'm going to make the
opacity equal to 0 so that means they're
not going to be seen on the screen
that's all that does then when target
the very first excerpt that is in there
if you don't remember what I'm talking
about these are the excerpts that i'm
talking about i'm going to lay them all
on top of each other i'm gonna make only
the first one visible all the other ones
are going to be invisible and i'm going
to say that i want to animate first
excerpt and i'm going to give it an
opacity of one which means one hundred
percent and i could also make it come on
the screen in a fade if I just put that
in there that would take a one second to
load that excerpt or two seconds but I'm
just going to leave that off because it
kind of looks cheesy then in a later
tutorial this is going to come in very
handy and this is also thrown into this
tutorial because I've been asked us a
bunch of times if you want to find out
how many child elements are in a div in
this situation i'm targeting these five
thumbs down here this is what you do you
go ntt thumb box and then we're going to
specifically target the div that is
inside of there and the number of images
that are inside of there and then you
say length and this right here will tell
you how many images are contained inside
of this div this is how you figure that
out what I'm going to do just for now is
to subtract one because I don't care
about this arrow that is right here
later on in the next tutorial we're
going to get into exactly using that but
just want to show you that for now
because I get that all the time how to
find out exactly how many elements are
inside of it div or whatever that's how
you do it and then hear what I'm going
to do is I'm going to dim this first
thumb by default so I got a target that
guy and it's a div and i'm going to say
and child in the div and then this is
another question I get constantly okay
we have first child thumb how do we use
that variable inside a jquery this is
out this is a opening quote single quote
this is a closing one if you want to
insert a variable and jquery that's how
you do it you have to close this front
pour it off put a plus sign then you are
variable I've gotten that question
probably 30 times if not more so that's
how you use variables inside a jquery
you just want to close that off i'm
gonna say that i want to change the
opacity on that first thumb to forty
percent when it's loaded on the screens
and that's how you do that and then what
I'm also going to do is I'm going to
create another class and I'm going to
specifically tie it to whatever thumb is
currently active another question I get
constantly do again and child you know I
just copy this paste and this is how you
add a class to an element when i call it
selected i like that no other reason and
then whenever this thumbnail is actually
clicked on or any of the thumbnails are
clicked on i'm going to need to
dynamically change the title the excerpt
this picture up here the read more tag
all these different things so i'm going
to show you how to do that so we want to
come in here and i'm actually going to
copy this right up to this point save
myself a little bit of time and I
specifically target the image and I'm
going to say if it is clicked I want to
run everything contained in this
function and E is a reference to
whatever was clicked and then I'm going
to do a whole bunch of things i'm going
to set all my thumbs back to their
default meaning that i'm going to remove
selected from all of them i'm going to
remove the decrease in opacity and
everything else that's going on so if i
want to target every single image is or
every single day of inside of that guy
this is how i do it and first I'm going
to remove
class so now you know how to make
something have a certain class and you
also know how to get rid of that and
another thing i'm going to do so i'm
going to do this one the divs and the
images there you are and that comes into
play later on as well and I'm just going
to copy this remember i'm going to set
opacity back to the fall let me get
myself some space so I want to animate
it's kind of like taking the animate off
actually I just want to set the opacity
back to one hundred percent so got that
this is going to be anime and actually
this is all the same so that's going to
make all the thumbs their default real
nice and easy then I'm going to actually
target the thumb that was just clicked
that's where he comes into play so I'm
going to say this which means this
thumbnail that was just clicked on that
triggered this function running all
together I want to add the class
selected to it this I'm going to take
this guy right here copy that paste it
here I want to make the opacity equal to
forty percent so that's going to make
this dim or these thumbnails dim
whenever these images are clicked on
then i'm going to create a variable and
this is when i start changing everything
else that's on the screen i'm going to
say pick title and i want to say this
attribute the attribute for the
thumbnail is clicked specifically title
I want to get that and save that to a
variable it's called pick title and just
so you know what i'm doing here are the
thumbnails down inside of here so you're
going to see i want to grab there's all
there's title there's the source for the
actual image all of these things i'm
going to come in here i'm going to say
okay i want all this information from
this thumbnail that was clicked ok so
that's where that's coming from so
that's where i'm getting the title from
and then I want to find the destination
for the full-size picture that I'm going
to put up here in the featured picked
area I'm going to create another
variable it's gonna be called picked
full size and it is equal to again this
dot the attribute that I want this
situation is source so this is the
location for the thumbnail that's not
actually what I want I want the original
so I'm going to create another variable
called photo preview pics full-size and
I want to replace the 60 by 60 that is
tied onto the end of the thumbnail
automatically by wordpress or if you're
doing this is a straight HTML of course
you have to put that on there or figure
some other way around it
and then I want to change the main title
above the excerpt so how I target that
guy is again this is jquery stuff ntt
article underscore title and if you want
to change the HTML that's inside of one
of these guys this is how you do it this
is also how you use a variable to do
that okay so that's going to
automatically change this based off of
what thumbs picked on that just that
little tiny bit of code and then I want
to also target all the featured pics
remember these are all laying on top of
each other there's five of them there
but only one of them has an opacity of
100 that's why you'll see that so I want
to target all those featured pics this
is the featured pick div and this is the
image here I'm going to make all of them
have an opacity of 0 and this is also
going to change in the next tutorial but
for now this is going to work doesn't
remember i'm going to have these all
automatically change this needs to be
changed but you guys have been sending
me messages saying you'd like to see me
develop applications or develop tools or
whatever and at least whenever i do that
i often just make parts of things work
and then go back and change them later
on it i just find it easier and then
here I'm changing the featured pic based
off of whatever thumb has currently been
clicked so that's what it's doing it's
getting a source and that's how it's
changing all that scroll up and i'm
going to copy this because i'm going to
take the opacity up on the featured pic
and i'm going to do that by calling the
animate jquery function capacity it's
going to be one hundred percent or 1
point 0 and then this time I'm going to
say take a second to do that just to add
a little bit of flair then I'm going to
create another variable variable pick
name for X or that's a little bit long
isn't it and then this is going to be
picked I don't and I'm going to change
it to lowercase this is a JavaScript
function it's just going to make all the
letters lowercase that's all and it's
going to replace all spaces with dashes
because remember the javascript file
automatically creates that image for me
but it puts dashes in there for all the
spaces and then we want to make all the
paragraph excerpts also disappear I just
plug in the name of the div and that's
these guys right here by the way these
are all paragraph tags capacity is equal
to 0 and then I want to specifically
turn the opacity up for the paragraph
associated with the same title as the
main picture so how we do that is
actually kind of neat if you want to
select a specific pair
based off of the title of that paragraph
this is how you do it put a colon inside
here bracket and just say title is equal
to it in close off this single quoted
part because we're going to plug in a
variable and then we want to continue on
bracket puts that on opacity is equal to
one hundred percent so here I'm making
the excerpt that appears over here on a
percent opacity while the rest are 0 and
then this function actually is done so
we can close this song and then what I
got to do is for now I'm going to create
a function that's basically it's only
real reason for existing is it's going
to open the featured pick if it's
clicked on here say I clicked on that
and there so you get up nine up later on
this is either going to open up a movie
or a picture gallery or an article but
for now I'm going to have it do that and
later on when add additional features
featured pick so I'm saying here I want
to target this featured pic right here
it's an image and i'm going to add an
event to it if it is clicked I want this
function to be run I'm going to create a
variable it's going to be called picked
location it's going to be equal to this
which is a reference to the picture that
was clicked and I'm going to get the
source for that picture and then I'm
going to actually force the person to be
sent to whatever page or whatever
contains that source and this is how you
do it you go location attribute and you
change the href attribute in this
situation to pick the location and that
will automatically move them to another
part of the internet and then we close
off that function and that's all your
jquery codes so if you need it it's in
the underbar just go get it download it
whatever it's very obviously and then
the final thing I got to do is come in
and change a little tiny bit of the
style sheet and when I say a little tiny
bit I mean little tiny bit this is from
the previous tutorial again what we're
going to do is the article excerpt I'm
also going to have to target the new
paragraphs that we put in earlier i'm
going to do i'm just going to copy those
come in here we might change this later
but for now this is perfect and the only
thing I'm going to do is I have all
these excerpts lay on top of each other
inside of the ntt article extra div I'm
just going to go top and everything is
going to be zeroed out and nothing else
is going to change here and remember we
change this read more guy here to a link
so we're literally going to come in here
and change that to an A and then the
only other thing I want to do
is I don't want the underline to show up
since it is linked text decoration
change that to none so got that handled
and then the featured pics also remember
they're going to be laying on top of
each other so I need to make some
changes there so I'm going to copy this
inside of the div code ntt featured pic
I want to target the images with jquery
that's how you do that this is all going
to stay the same except this is going to
be changed to 0 and everything else is
going to stay the same so that's how you
make this featured content tool that we
have here on the screen you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comments section below in the next part
of the tutorial I'm going to clean this
up and make it automatically scroll and
do a whole bunch of other things till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
