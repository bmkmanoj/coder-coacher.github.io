people from calling me an apple fanboy
I'm now going to show you the negatives
of the iPad first off within YouTube as
far as I can tell there is no way to
subscribe to anybody through the
interface keeps giving youtube
unavailable also if you want to put a
comment into some of these videos
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
work so maybe this is an issue that
they're fixing right now another issue
I've had is with air video sometimes it
also seems to work in other times
whenever I click on a video see this
time it's working other times it doesn't
so it seems to be that there's some
Wi-Fi issues with the iPad overall and
they also have a tendency to come and go
so not sure if they're going to get
those fixed here's the big guy in the
big problem skype you cannot make
telephone calls on 3g which is what I
got right here or the 3g AT&amp;amp;T with skype
you can only do it over Wi-Fi so there's
another issue this screen gets blurry
just like the ipod so that's the same
another on thing is most of the apps as
I'm sure most people were well aware of
and we're prepared for or just a slight
bit blurry whenever you enlarge them I
know they look pretty good here but they
are kind of blurry you can actually see
here actually it looks clear on my video
but the text is a little bit off I'm
nitpicking here but people want to know
all the negatives and currently there's
not a ipad specific news aggregator also
the big big big issue again in regards
to air video which i absolutely love
there is only one speaker on the ipad so
that messes up the sound quality on
anything that you would want to watch
you can also see here battery life is
absolutely amazing I've had this guy on
on and off for an entire day battery
life is only down to ninety percent
quite amazing another issue can be found
with itunes i personally like coverflow
and with the ipad at least as far as i
can tell there
is no cover flow so that's kind of a
negative as well but overall that is
about the only thing and I mean I was
nitpicking that's about the only thing I
could find that was wrong with the iPad
also really like Safari on the iPad it's
a really really really really a nice
browser works real seamlessly the only
one negative i would say about Safari if
you didn't know this is how you select
text an iPad you actually go and you
have to double click and then release
then you would copy this way well on a
lot by dragging this interface around a
little bit touchy as you can see fit
it's mainly better to copy from the
point you first click and go downwards
because it has an issue when it's going
out and also it has a tendency to jump
over into other parts of the web page
and copy those text areas and so forth
and so on there you are that's my
complete list of everything that's wrong
with the iPad overall I think it's an
absolutely fabulous device just has a
couple quirks or which will probably be
cleaned up in the next update till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
