five of my how to create wordpress
themes from scratch tutorial this is the
final part in this part we're going to
create the archive PHP file and the
fluorophore dot PHP file and on the left
side of your screen you can see this is
the finished blog can't see this view at
full screens be able to see it a little
bit easier and basically what we're
going to do for the archive dot PHP file
is we're going to take this block right
here and display it on the archive page
just in case you forgot archive column
is going to surround all of this on the
screen and then archive container
surrounds just these boxes that you see
right here if you can see my mouse
moving around over here let's just jump
right into it now what are we going to
need first let's just jump into the
archive page here just to see how it's
messed up and then we'll fix it okay
well we need a left sidebar so what do
we do we just type in first because
that's what we called it and we save it
and reload it and you can see that
everything is going to be coming
together real nice already so there that
is that looks good then what are we
going to do well we have to create those
middle containers as we saw on the blog
right here so we're going to do some
copy and pasting I jump over here into
index dot PHP and I'm going to look for
where those are we can see right here is
middle column so that's a div that we're
going to want to copy and we're also on
a copy middle container and middle title
so let's jump back over into archive PHP
and let's paste everything in there the
way that we know we should need to right
after the sidebar we're going to paste
in middle column however I'm going to
have to do some additional editing on it
so i'm going to call this archive column
instead of middle column and we're going
to create two additional divs one is
going to be the archive container and
the other is going to be archived title
so let's just name them right now
archive container and archive title now
we're going to do something kind of need
here with the archive title just like we
had previously done where we were trying
to figure out exactly and let's scroll
and zoom in here when I say archive
title what I'm referring to is this guy
right here well we want to make this
dynamic so we want if this is an actual
article it to say article and if it's a
video we want it to say video we did
this previously in past tutorial all we
need to do is copy this code right here
and it's going to check which category
it is and then place the proper
information and they're based off of the
category so there we are we just
replaced that and of course we're going
to have to
all this archive and call this archive
alright so that's looking good that's
going to give us site a little bit more
of a dynamic sort of look to it then
this guy's going to check if we have
posts to display and leave everything
here because this is going to check
exactly what type of archive file we're
going to be pulling up so we want to let
WordPress do most of the heavy lifting
in regards to that then I decided I
don't want a little navigational tool to
show up with this guy right here it's
going to be a little link that shows up
that allows people to click older posts
newer posts so forth and so on I'm gonna
allow that to be at the bottom of the
page and get rid of that you don't know
what I'm referring to don't worry about
it then what I'm going to do because I'm
mainly gonna be copying what's on the
blog page I'm going to jump back over
into index dot PHP and I'm going to come
right here where it says middle
container and I'm going to copy that the
whole way down where middle container
ends right like that I'm going to jump
back over into archive and right after
Wow I have posts I'm going to create all
those individual containers and paste
that in there and then once again for
middle title because I want all this to
be dynamic I'm going to jump up here and
grab this guy right here and I'm going
to copy that and jump back down into
here and now it's going to give me
dynamic sorts of information instead of
the bland garbage that we got before and
again we're going to change this the
middle little and change this to middle
and everything else can stay exactly the
same way that we used it previously
because it worked before so there's no
reason to change anything and then down
here we're actually going to get rid of
all of this information because we don't
need it I get rid of all of that and
we're going to use a custom way of
bringing our posts into the page and
then after this little navigation guy
right here we're going to have to close
the two divs that we created so which of
those two divs well it's archive column
and archive container so scroll right
back down here I'm in here paste and
we're just going to close those
individual divs so they've don't need
this extra space and we're going to tell
anyone who's looking at this theme
exactly what they're closing well
they're closing archive container copy
base and they're also going to be
closing archive column so let's make
copy of this paste that in there and
type in archive column see a lot of the
stuff I'm doing here is just cut and
paste and all of the code is available
on a link underneath this video a lot
easier to follow if you have the code in
front then get sidebar well we're in
this situation we're not going to put
the right sidebar it as I just decided
not to
it's gone and then the only thing left
to do is to close our content wrapper
which is a div that surrounds every
single thing that's on the page and I
talked about that in previous part of
this video tutorial series we'll just
end off and we'll call this content
rapper that's all the changes you need
to make on the archive page let's jump
over here to the actual part of the
website and see exactly what happened so
let's just click on archive and there
you can see things rely on themselves
out pretty nicely everything's looking
pretty sharp except this part down here
and we're going to fix that using some
CSS code let's jump over in the
style.css and then right here where it
says styling used for archive page we're
going to do the individual styling for
the archive column or in the archive
container and the archive title all
three things that we just created now to
save ourselves some time we're actually
because we heavily borrowed those things
from the middle column middle container
and middle title we're going to copy
that and then jump back down here into
the area where we're going to have to
put in our specific archive of
information and paste that inside of
there and now we're going to make
specific changes to correct what you see
here on the screen mizu them out a
little bit so from looking at this I
know I'm going to need to make couple
changes in regards to the actual size
and also of course I'm going to change
your name so this is archived column
archive container and archive title
alright so got all those change well
this guy's going to have to go up or
increase in size dramatically more than
twice its overall size so let's just say
620 pixels see how that works out and
these margins need to come down pretty
dramatically it's just taking down the
three asal they show up classy reload
okay so it's looking tighter except the
page parts a little messed up well
that's because this needs to be taken up
to 620 as well we're going to make the
height auto so that it automatically
will fix everything and put everything
inside of there where we want it padding
let's take this up to five we don't need
inline-block and I'm believe reload yep
looking pretty tight looking pretty
tight alright so everything is lining up
inside of here and here is what I was
talking about let's jump over in the
archive remember I said nav dot PHP I
was talking about what that is see it
says older entries down here that's what
that link is right there and that's what
pulls inside of there previously I
wanted to put it off the page but I
think that made any sense so that's why
I got rid of it so if we jump back over
into style dot CSS we
see really the only problem we have here
is archives is messed up this is
archived title so we just got to move it
around until it's in the right position
let's move it over here see if we can
get it in right place shrink this down
basically we have to move it more over
to the right so we're just going to
increase the left part of this so let's
just say 400 I don't know if I'll say
reload and it's not quite there let's
say for 25 reload and that is just about
perfect so yeah you can play without a
couple pixels here and there but in
general it looks really really good and
then if we zoom out of this you can see
that everything is laying itself out
really really nice and there is our new
archive page now well you can move this
around take out this archive for August
2011 move it around do whatever you want
with it but in general i'm pretty happy
with the way this is all styling and
laying I don't so now I'm going to move
over into the 404 page now this is often
completely disregarded and let's just
show you what the 404 page looks like
currently on this website theme say it
looks like nothing it looks horrible so
we're just going to jump over here and
open up 404 dot PHP now with my 404
pages couple things I'm going to need to
do I'm going to grab my sidebar I'm
gonna display it and we're gonna type in
first so now this guy's going to have a
sidebar then I'm basically just going to
use the content column and all that
information if you want to see what this
looks like there you go it's starting to
fall in together all right so what I'm
going to use is my actual content divs
that I used previously on single dot PHP
so i'm going to use content column and
content container and this is just going
to surround everything and hopefully put
everything in the right positions so
right after i create my sidebar I'm
going to throw those two divs inside of
there then what I'm going to want to do
here is this is completely horrible so
let's just delete that all together and
let's also throw in my right side bar
and this for a four page is going to say
hey I couldn't find what you asked me to
look for but here are all the articles
on my whole entire site I always found
that that works out as a nice 404 page
and i just threw in my right sidebar
there while you weren't looking so let's
just jump in here and let's just code
this out right here on the screen and
while we're at it might as well close
these two guys down so let's go div div
that end of semi content container and
of content column and then we're going
to ask wordpress to display a whole
bunch of things on the screen one thing
I
really talked about is and I'm going to
break a couple rules here i'm going to
embed a style inside of here but let's
just say font size it's increase size of
this font just in this special situation
now if you want wordpress to
automatically translate everything
inside of your blog or just a line of
text what you do is you do underscore e
and it's going to automatically come in
there and translate that and i'm going
to insert a break statement inside of
here and I'm gonna say sorry i can't
find that page and you can put something
in there a little bit nicer and more
descriptive than that but this all works
for what we're doing here and then i'm
going to close off my PHP block and i'm
going to close off that div then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to issue a
custom query so now let's just say and
then throw it in h2 tag put some
emphasis on this and I'm going to say
PHP and i'm going to create something
called num posts is equal to and i'm
going to do a custom query inside of
wordpress i'm going to go w pdb
wordpress database and i'm going to say
get VAR and then you can just put a
query inside of here so let's say select
counts as many as we've got from this is
the wordpress database again so I'm
asking it how many posts are there in
the WordPress database where post status
is equal to publish so I'm saying how
many posts are there that are published
custom query throw that inside of there
and then I'm going to say if the number
of post published is greater than zero
copy that actually I don't need this h2
tag up here put it down here below I'm
gonna say that num posts just thinking
about the future here where you're going
to have thousands of different posts on
your page I'm going to say no I'm going
to call a function in PHP called number
format what is going to do is it's going
to automatically insert commas in case
of there being thousands or millions of
foes here's where I'm going to throw in
my h2 tag call PHP again I'm gonna say
echo check out the insert the number of
posts that we got articles below it's
going to tell them how many articles
that i have and display it on the screen
hopefully they'll be impressed and take
a look at them and then i'm going to
close off mage to tang and we can just
file save that and reload it just to see
what's going on here and there yarn you
can say sorry i can't find that page and
it says check out the 48 articles below
ok so well i have to
actually go get those 48 articles so to
do that I'm going to create an unordered
list i'm going to call it ID is equal to
I don't know archive list close out that
on an ordered list and then inside of
here I'm going to go get all of them
list them all out so I'm going to go PHP
so to get all of my posts what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go my post create
a variable I'm going to call a function
inside of wordpress called get posts and
I'm gonna tell it to get number posts is
equal to and i'm going to say negative 1
when that kind of defaults to all of
them so that's cool and then I'm going
to say for each post for each my post as
post you just copy and paste this code
if you don't know what I'm doing here
just basic PHP and then I'm going to
create all my list items let's roll this
up so you can actually see it HP and
then now put the time you just call a
function called dot I'm just nice i'm
going to say m dash D dash year clothes
off that PHP section air put in a coal 1
i'm going to put a reference each
reference is equal to and i'm going to
go get the actual link to this article
do that using the Opera link close that
all closed off that that in there and
then I'm going to want to insert my
actual title for the article you do that
by calling the title inside wordpress
and then closed off that PHP section and
then close off the actual anchor link
and then close it off the list item then
we're going to have to call PHP again
and we I need to end our for each loop
and I think I did everything right let's
say reload yep looks like I did
everything right and if we zoom in on
this guy yep you can say that there it
is it listed all the goofy articles that
i have here on my test bed sort of
wordpress thing it's been a lot of fun
creating this theme you can download it
do whatever you want with it like I said
for all the codes underneath leave any
questions or comments below and
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
