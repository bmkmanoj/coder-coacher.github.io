5 of my wordpress news themed tutorial
where i will show you how to change this
basic HTML CSS site that we created
earlier into this wordpress theme that
you see here on the screen I've gotten a
lot of questions from you guys in
regards to how you should watch these
tutorials so if you go on my youtube
channel which is just youtube.com
forward slash Derrick banners click on
playlists and then come over here and
scroll down a little bit until you see
WordPress theme tutorial and you click
on that you're gonna see all of my
wordpress themes all listed right in
order in the way that I think that you
should view them and watch them however
you can jump around do whatever you want
but I've just gotten a lot of questions
in regards to how to watch these guys in
order that's how you do it playlist and
then go over here and look for it in
this part of the tutorial I'm gonna
finish up index dot PHP as well as the
footer so let's get into the code
alright basically we got on the right
side of the screen this is the basic
HTML CSS code that we use to create that
basic guy and over on the left side of
the screen we have our wordpress theme
well just like before I'm going to be
transferring everything from the right
side of the screen to the left side of
the screen order it's gonna get a lot
easier because I'm actually gonna copy
what I created lastly in the previous
tutorial and I'm gonna scroll down here
to the bottom of the screen and I'm
gonna paste it because we're basically
gonna be using exactly the same format I
just have to change a couple things here
one of the things I have to do is I'm
going to change this unordered list into
a div and just like you see on the right
side of the screen it is going to have a
class in this situation of post lists
and that's all we need to do there and
here we're grabbing ourselves a WP query
object and saving it in a temporary file
and then nullifying it and creating a
new one just like we did before and then
down here for the query as you can see
in this guy reavie ously we made this
row of posts now we want to make this
row of posts which is just going to be
the most recent four posts doesn't have
to do anything with categories therein
or anything like that so we're just
gonna create those guys so this is gonna
be real nice and simple I'm gonna come
in here so the previous query that we
had actually I'm just gonna chop this
off boom that's gone and if I want four
posts
just put in for post per page for that's
all I need to do that's all done I can
leave all this the same this is gonna
sort through all the posts or the first
four posts that are available the most
recent posts that are available and then
I just need to look at the right side of
the screen and transfer that stuff over
here so instead of a ch3 class feature
title it's gonna be a ch3 class post
title so just copy that and paste that
in there down here where I'm cutting off
part of the title if it gets too long
I'm gonna change this to 30 so it's
gonna display the first 31 characters
starting at the zero index and it's
going to grab the link to the actual
post just like we did in the previous
tutorial and if somebody clicks on that
title it's gonna take them to the post
here I defined again I'm just leaving
this the same the title and how you get
the title for the post is to call post -
with this little bracket followed by
post title gonna store it in this
variable and I'm going to go and I'm
gonna shorten the title down to 31
characters to make sure that it fits on
the screen that's all I needed to do
there here instead of featured excerpt
I'm going to type in post excerpt and
then down here I want to shorten that
post texture but because I have more
room I'm gonna change this to 135 so
that's gonna list 136 characters and
here I'm gonna be grabbing the images
just like I did previously however this
is gonna be a little bit bigger image so
I'm going to change this to 85 pixels
and change this to 85 pixels class is
going to be post image and then
everything else is going to be exactly
the same as we did in the previous
tutorial so that was really really
simple except after this div I'm gonna
put a break statement in here just put a
little bit of separation to break
statements actually and all I'm gonna do
there just a little bit of separation
between this which is what I just
grabbed and what I'm gonna put down here
in the bottom which is gonna be the next
eight most recent posts so I just have
to come in here and create all that
what's really great about this is I'm
gonna be able to come in here select all
this stuff again there's a link in
underneath of this video that will take
you to all of the code if you want it
alright so I'm just gonna copy this
again scroll down to the screen here and
paste in all of that same information
that I had previously and let's scroll
up and let's roll up over here on
right side of the screen as well until
we get to more posts so what are we
gonna do we're gonna change the div
class here two more posts just like that
and then I got to change the query of
course so post per page is gonna change
to eight and then what I want to do it I
definitely don't want to print the first
four pose so how I tell WordPress that I
want to skip the first four posts
because I've already displayed them its
type in offset is equal to four so it's
gonna skip the first four post because
we have them on the screen and already
everything else here is exactly the same
this is my little generic a loop that
I'm creating here then I'm going to jump
in here and based off of this being
recent posts I'm gonna have to come in
here I'm gonna get rid of this list item
and instead I'm going to create a div
inside of there class is equal to you
soon
oops right like that and then I'm gonna
come over here recent title okay oh just
type in recent I don't that's done now
in this situation for the title I
actually have less space for to be able
to fit this in here so I'm gonna
actually change this to 20 that's just
gonna list the first 20 characters and
on top of that the image is going to
show up in here before the actual
excerpt so I'm just gonna flip that guy
there tab it back over so it's nice and
neat we're going to call the function
catch that image that we created
previously however we're gonna change
this to 150 pixels and this to 150
pixels and this is going to be changed
to recent image okay so that's gonna fit
in there neural nice and then we come
down to the excerpt and if you forgot
this is what I'm creating I'm creating
all these guys right here see there's
the title then there's the image and
then there's the text that's why I'm
changing that so I don't need this down
here otherwise it's gonna print two
images and that's just a little Co
horrible and also while I'm here change
this list item to close the div that we
created above previously and then for
the excerpt we're just going to change
this to recent excerpt and then we're
gonna change here from 135 1200 so that
will be able to show the right amount of
information for the excerpt and then
after WP query because we got rid of our
list we don't need that in there but we
replaced it with a div so we do need
that inside of there and then finally we
have to call for the footer code so how
do you do that PHP get footer and
that'll put it in all the code
to generate the footer on the screen and
of course you want to make sure you get
rid of all the white space because
WordPress hates white space there you go
index.php is all finished so now we're
gonna jump over and create footer dot
PHP okay on the right side of your
screen you can see the footer code that
I have here it's just basic HTML and CSS
all you have to make that more dynamic
what we're gonna do is we're gonna jump
out to the blank theme folder that we're
in and we're gonna open up footer and
then we have to start making changes to
this well we already have footer defined
inside of here so that's great we don't
need to change that however we do need
to put div class footer content inside
of here so that's something that's gonna
have to change for us just jump down
inside of there and you got that there
let's give ourselves some space then
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to call
PHP WP list pages and what this is gonna
do is it's gonna jump out there and grab
me a whole bunch of pages to list
because well there's only one page on
this but we're gonna list as many pages
as we have here so that's what that's
all about and I'm gonna say depth is
equal to 1 and what that's going to do
is it's just gonna list parent pages
it's not gonna list child pages because
that just gets crazy and not stuff and
I'm gonna say that I want a maximum of
10 and then I'm gonna find title and if
you can't see this well you've probably
left already but you can watch this in
high def and full screen it looks a lot
better I'm gonna define div class I'm
gonna borrow from some code that I had
before it's gonna be called sidebar
title because everything is identical to
that type in h4 I've been pages h4 and
then close that div and what this just
did right here is here I'm defining what
I want to surround the title so this guy
right here this title right there that's
what I'm defining with that code that
you saw there and then I'm also defining
how many pages I want listed underneath
of there and I'm saying that I only want
parents by typing in depth is equal to 1
if you take depth is equal to 1 out of
there it's going to show every single
thing which in my opinion looks messy
and that's all you need to do for that
guy and then we're going to close off
footer content because we're going to
create another one called footer content
paste that inside of there and in this
situation I'm going to show you how to
make a custom category if you
want to use this in this format so if
you want to just come in here and go to
div class is equal to and I'm gonna say
footer
title give it the same name make it an
h4 tag then I'm gonna type in categories
close that surround that with a div and
I'm going to create a paragraph class is
equal to sidebar excerpt and then I'm
gonna call PHP and tell it that I want
the list out the categories well how you
do that is WP list categories death so
I'm just going to grab the parent
categories and not two children I'm
gonna put an order by is it gonna be
equal to name so it's just gonna put
them in alphabetical order and I'm gonna
say that I want 10 of these maximum and
for title since I already defined the
title I don't want to list a title I
don't want to list all that stuff so
it's real simple you just put close the
quote and you leave it empty and you
close off the PHP code so that's really
easy div and then close that off then I
decided instead of just putting in more
pages or doing anything else I wanted to
put in like a follow us sort of thing
because that's something that I seen a
lot of themes so that's gonna be real
simple I'm gonna create another div
class is equal to and I'm gonna call
this footer follow and I just have to
create a div class equal to footer you
don't I'm gonna put an h4 tag in there
again follow us another age for Tai Dave
no no create a H reference I actually
created a plug-in that did this
previously but thought I'd write it out
so that you could see it here and here
I'm gonna link to my RSS feed
that's all you need to do is call the
function blog info RSS too and it'll
score a URL and it outputs the location
for your RSS feed it's kind of cool just
stuck that side of a link and I'm gonna
say image source have to link out your
the RSS feed image that I have stored in
my template folder so I'm gonna go PHP
and I'm gonna call whenever that
function is called it's gonna output
that location for me close off the PHP
and if I want to get into my images
directory inside of my theme to get at
my RSS logo this is how I do it and then
I'm gonna define my height is equal to
50 pixels and my width is equal to 50
pixels and I'm gonna close off that so
somebody clicks on that it's going to
take them right then
my RSS feed and if I want to link to all
the other things basically the code is
identical let's just paste that in there
actually spread it apart so it's a
little bit easier to see and hear for
each reference I don't need to call PHP
I'm just gonna hard code in here
ww a dot twitter.com forward slash do
you think tank so that'll just be the
default twitter account that's set up
inside of there don't need to change
much here except for them and need to
change this from RSS to Twitter and
everything else is exactly the same so
let's scroll this up a little bit let's
paste that in there again we're gonna be
linking out the Facebook so we don't
need what we had there previously and
I'm just gonna copy this paste us in
there facebook.com/ and then this is
oops don't need that in there and I
don't need this in here
that's my Facebook page for my site and
then again I just need to change this to
Facebook logo because that's the name of
it and even though I pay absolutely zero
attention to LinkedIn I know that some
of you guys out there into its LinkedIn
and in forward slash I just type my name
in and this is going to change to linked
in and of course if you some other
social network you particularly like you
can use those inside of there no problem
at all well then we have to close off
the day of four footer fall oh man I'm
gonna put in a couple more break
statements so that I have some space at
the bottom of the screen for what is
coming up next and I decided that I want
to do some editing this stuff isn't on
the right side of the screen for the
copyright so I'm actually gonna call
something copyright so there's a div
that's gonna surround this guy right now
and all this other information we're
going to leave the same except after
this I'm gonna link or echo out the
screen designed by a reference is equal
to : so if you wanted to mention your
site at the bottom of the screen just
basic HTML close that off close off the
PHP code and then you're gonna create a
new or close another day of the
copyright day of that you just created
right there and that is all you have to
do to fix the footer and have it show up
the way that I have it over here leave
any questions or comments below and up
next I'll create the sidebar and start
messing around with some CSS code till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
