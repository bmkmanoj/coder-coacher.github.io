11 of my learn to program series and
this part of the tutorial will cover
static methods as well as static
variables I'll show you how to make your
own modules will also get deeply into
exception handling and if you haven't
watched any of the previous parts a
tutorial please website I provide a link
to the playlist on the screen here also
in the description you will find all of
the code that is heavily commented as
well as a transcript of the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so first off we're gonna cover
static methods now a static method is
going to allow access without the need
to initialize a class which means you'll
be able to execute these methods without
creating an object and they are mainly
used as utility methods or also whenever
it doesn't make sense for a real-world
object to be able to perform a task but
you still need to have that method
available and I'll demonstrate it here
so that you understand let's say we
create a class called sum and width you
want to use a static method you have to
use the static method decorator which
we've seen previously so you're just
gonna type in at an end static method
and now it's a static method and here
you'll just type in whatever your name
of your method is I'm gonna call this
get some and it's going to receive a
whole bunch of arguments so there's our
splat again and here we're just going to
sum all of the values that are passed
inside of here so you've seen this
before just wanted to demonstrate it and
some and we will increment all of these
and now we can return that sum and then
of course we will come down here and you
find main and then inside of main if we
want to execute that remember I said you
don't need to create an object of that
type you can just simply come in and
list the class name followed by whatever
the function is or method that you'd
like to execute and then of course we
have to come down here and call from and
execute and run it and you can see right
there was able to go in and execute that
so there it is that's a static method
that's how you create them and this
right here is how you call for them so
pretty cool stuff
now I'm gonna jump over and demonstrate
a static variable and here what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna create a dog class
and inside of it if you want to create a
static variable it's very simple you
just come in here and you just create
one and if you create a field outside of
any other methods it's automatically a
static variable and what that means is
the value of this is going to be shared
by every object of type dog that has
ever created
so let's come in here and let's
initialize our dog objects and I'm just
gonna have it pass in name and I'm gonna
have unknown being here as a default and
then we will of course a sign name and
now if you want to reference the static
variable what you do is just precede it
with whatever the class name is so what
I'm doing here is I'm going to be
monitoring the number of dogs this
should be I'm gonna be monitoring every
single time a dog object is created and
why does that make sense to do as a
static field or static variable well it
doesn't make sense for dogs to be able
to count and so there you go so what I'm
gonna do is just simply increment that
like this and then also I'm gonna come
in here and create a static method so
there's a static method and this is just
going to receive or retrieve the number
of dogs that number of dog objects that
have been created doesn't need to do
anything and we'll just say print there
are currently a certain number of dogs
and we'll put this inside of quotes and
then we will also use format on this and
if we want to get that value once again
we're just gonna go dog num of dogs and
that's going to retrieve that static
variable or field for us and now what
we're gonna be able to do is come in
here and create a bunch of different
type of dog objects so we'll call the
first one spot and that's going to
increment number of dogs as you're gonna
see for all the other ones that are
created and we'll also create another
one and we'll just call this dog Steve
now
dog and you'll be able to see if we call
spot and then follow that up with get
num of dogs and execute that it's going
to say there are currently two dogs and
that is going to stay the same for every
single one of these guys so just to
prove that let's come in here and let's
do the same thing for dog they start in
there and you're gonna say there you go
two dogs so that's a demonstration of a
static field or a static variable now
I'm gonna jump over and show you how to
create your own modules what I'm gonna
do in a separate Python file inside of
the same directory as where you have
Python cut dot py I'm going to come in
here and just define a very simple
little function I'm gonna call this good
sum and it's gonna do exactly the same
things that did last time whenever we
use this so there you go and we're just
gonna save that and then what we're
gonna do you pause the screen if you
want to type that in and now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna come over and
import that directly into my program and
to import it you just list whatever the
name of the file is - the py part at the
end and then to get access to that
function you're just gonna precede it
with whatever the file name is and then
the function that you want so we're
gonna say print and we'll say sum and
then after that you can just type in sum
and the function that you want to
execute do this for any type of function
and you can see indeed that worked so
that's how you create your own custom
little modules another thing that's
important to know however is you can use
from instead of import and what it's
going to do what Fromm's gonna do is
copy specific functions from a module so
we can be main here instead and say from
some some being the module you're
copying from you're going to say import
get some like that another thing you
could do however is if you wanted to
import all of the modules you just put a
star inside of there like that and that
would import everything but I'm just
gonna leave it get some because that's
all that's in there right now and if
there were other functions in there
let's say
getting malt I don't know if you had
multiple different functions you wanted
to get out of there you could just
separate them with a comma right like
that and the benefit of using from
instead of straight import is now you do
not need to list the modules name
whenever you use it so you can just come
in here and there's positives and
negatives to that let's come in and just
say get some like that and run it and
there you go so that's the benefit of
from say you don't need to use that like
you did with import now you can just
list it like that it's a pretty cool
stuff so there you go that's how to
create custom modules as well as how to
use static variables and methods and now
let's jump in and talk more about
exception handling now as a review
exceptions are going to be triggered
either when an error occurs or when you
want when an exception to be triggered
and we use exceptions to both handle
errors execute specific code when code
generates something out of the ordinary
or to always execute code when something
happens for example to close a file that
was previously opened and basically when
an error occurs you're going to stop
executing code and jump to execute other
code that is going to respond to that
error so what I want to do here if first
is I'm going to basically handle an
exception what you're gonna do is you're
gonna put your problematic code inside
of a try block like this and here I'm
going to create a list that is going to
have three individual pieces of data
inside of it and then what I want to do
is try to print an index that doesn't
exist so I'm going to say a list and I'm
gonna say I want whatever is in index
three well there is no index three this
is 0 this is 1 and this is 2 so what is
this going to do well this is going to
trigger an error and it's an error that
I want to be able to handle specifically
that error is going to be called or the
exception that's going to be triggered
is going to be called the index error
and how we're going to be able to catch
that error is inside of an accept block
so I'm gonna type in accept and then if
I know what my error is called I'm going
to come in here and I'm going to type in
the error that I
expect that could be triggered then I
can print out a nice message on the
screen rather than a whole bunch of
nasty errors sorry that index doesn't
exist and then finally if another
exception meaning any exception was
triggered and I want to be able to
handle that in a special way instead of
printing out a mass of different errors
on the screen I just type accept without
any specific exceptions over here and I
could say something like an unknown
error occurred and you're going to say
if I run it it says sorry that index
doesn't exist and that's a nice little
message versus what you would normally
get which would just be a bunch of nasty
codes and things like that to shoot out
all over the screen it's important to
know that you can also catch multiple
different exceptions with except just by
separating them with a series of commas
so let's say I wanted to catch index
error and I also wanted to catch a name
error exception I could do so just like
that and I'll show you another example
to get a little bit more deeply into
exceptions now it's also possible for us
to make custom exceptions so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to create
a class and I'm gonna call this dog name
error now this is obviously a silly sort
of exception but if you want to use this
what you're gonna have to do is you're
gonna have to inherit from the exception
class and to do that you just type in
exception right like this and I just
want to say that it isn't very common
that you would use your own custom
exceptions but just one to cover this
just so you completely understand all
the different options that are available
inside of this I'll initialize this guy
and to do so just type in exception and
I'm gonna call init for the exception
and for this you're gonna type in so and
you're also going to type in args and
keyword args
I'll get more in the keyword
orgs and on tutorial that's coming up so
that's how simple it is to set it up of
course that could do a lot more than
just this but it's just basically going
to handle this exception and allow us to
use a custom exception and what I'm
going to do here is ask the user to
enter their dog's name and then I'm
going to trigger an error if the name
that they enter contains a number so
you've seen this before I'm gonna say if
any and I'll just say character is
digits for character in dog name so I'm
gonna be asking if any of the characters
inside of dog name are going to be
digits make the service dog name like
that
and in a situation in which they do have
a number inside of the dog name I'm
gonna say that's not okay and if I want
to raise my own exception I just type in
raised and I can type in dog name error
and then down inside of here I can just
say accept dog name error and then print
out my custom error message which will
be your dog's name can't contain a
number and if we come in here and run it
what is your dog's name and if I type in
dog everything's fine if I run it in
this side and I say something like or 19
whoop gave me an error sorry about that
for cut to come up here and throw args
and keyword orgs and side of here paste
that inside of there and now run it
again what is your dog's name and I'll
say you 90 and you can see your dog's
name can't contain a number pops up
there on the screen and it's handled
that's how you make custom exceptions
and also how to raise exceptions and you
could also come in here and put in name
air or any of the built in errors that
are inside of Python if you'd like to
raise the errors that are built into
pythons or the exceptions that are built
into Python so now let's take a look at
finally and else now finally is going to
be used when you always want certain
code to execute whether an exception is
raised or not so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say
I'm gonna get two pieces of data I'll
say input and I'll say enter two values
to divide and I'll provide that
information or that division and I'll
put that on the screen and of course
let's come in here and throw split so
there we go so we're gonna get two
numbers and they're going to be split
based off of whitespace first numbers
gonna go and um one second one's gonna
go and um - you guys have seen this
already and then we come in and I'm
gonna say try and I'll say quotient is
going to be equal to and I'll convert
num1 into that into an integer and the
same with num2 and now I can come in
here and print and I think you know what
error is probably going to be triggered
and this is going to be equal to and
call for format to pull in the right
information and what we were
specifically going to be putting it in
there is num1 inside of the first curly
brackets num2 and then quotient inside
of there is the final result now the
error or the exception that I would like
to catch is what we call a zero division
error which means that they tried to
divide by zero
which is a big no-no and in this
situation I'll say print you can't
divide by zero and then let's say that I
want some code to execute if an
exception does not occur while that is
why else is here and in this situation
we could just submit it and say you
didn't raise an exception as the
tutorial continues we'll get more into
more real-world uses of exceptions I
just want to keep this very simple so
you can see exactly what's going on and
if there are certain code that you'll
always want to execute whether an
exception is triggered or an exception
isn't triggered you type in finally and
then you say something like I execute no
matter what alright so let's come in
here test this guy up and our two values
and if we come in and we type one and
two you're gonna see that one perfectly
fine you didn't raise an exception comes
in here that's because else runs if an
exception isn't execute and the reason
why that is the code inside of the else
block is a
secur did if an exception isn't raised
let's come in here and and finally of
course is going to execute no matter
what and you're going to see that if I
come in here and do like 3 and 0 boom
you can't divide by 0 you're gonna see
here an exception was raised so the code
inside else wasn't printed and you're
also gonna see once again that no matter
what whatever is inside finally is gonna
be executed whether an exception was
raised or it wasn't raised alright so
now I think it's time for a problem
basically what I want you to do is I
want you to create a file named my data
- and it's going to be a text file and
just put any type of data inside of it
it doesn't matter what it is and you're
going to use what you learned in part 8
and a little bit of Google to find out
how to open a file without using width
like I previously showed you and you're
going to try to open that file inside of
a try block you're then going to try to
catch a file not found error exception
in else if an exception isn't raised you
are going to print contents of the file
in finally you're just gonna print out
some type of message that is always
going to be printed out on the screen
doesn't really matter what it is and
then you were going to go in and try to
open non-existent file and its name is
gonna be my dad a three dot text and
you're gonna test and see what the
differences are okay so pause the video
and try that out I know you can do it
otherwise I'm gonna write the code for
you right now okay so I went and created
my data - dot txt and I threw some
information inside of there so I got
that done now I'm going to use a try
block to come in here and try to open a
file without using width so I'm just
gonna say my file is equal to and how
you do that is with open my data - dot
txt it's what I want to open up and
you're gonna type in encoding is equal
to
we're gonna use UTF again now I'm gonna
catch the exception and I'm gonna type
in accept and like I told you we're
gonna use file not found error and I'm
gonna also forgot to talk about as what
as is going to allow you to do is access
data and methods in the exception class
so I'm gonna throw as inside of there
and I'm gonna give it the name e X and
I'll be able to come in here and print
something out so let's say something
like that file and of course you didn't
know about as so don't worry about that
if you didn't know I just wanted to
cover it because I'm here and I wanted
to cover it so I'm gonna print on a
message that said that fought was not
found and let's go and call our
exception here and have it print out
some information on the screen let's
just have its arguments print it out
then I said inside of else I want to
print the content so this is going to be
triggered if it was able to find the
file and print that information and I'm
just gonna keep it simple and I'll just
say file and then to print this out I
just go my file read and I'll put that
on the screen and then because this is
not done with with I need to actually
close the file afterwards so I want to
close my file and then finally doesn't
matter what I put inside of here just
something silly that's always going to
print no matter what say something like
finished working with file and there you
go there is all of your code and will
come in and run it dot that out the docs
gonna see some random text more random
text and some more finished working with
file everything was perfectly fine
however if I come in here and change
this to 3 a file that doesn't exist and
run it you're gonna see right here that
file was not found
once again this guy were here was
triggered and right here he printed out
some information about the type of
exception that was met no such file or
directory that's the information on it
and you can see once again that finally
were there there you go guys that's a
rundown on a whole bunch of different
things if you didn't catch it or you did
weren't able to write this code that's
ok most important thing is just to be
aware of and get used to solving
problems
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
