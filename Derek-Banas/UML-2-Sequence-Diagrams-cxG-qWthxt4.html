4 of my UML 2 video tutorial today we're
going to talk about sequence diagrams
and as you can see this is a sequence
diagram here on your screen and what a
sequence diagram does or a sequence
diagram model it models interactions in
your program and provides a logical view
of that they are about showing the order
of interactions between different parts
of your program and what you're going to
do whenever you're laying out this
diagram is you're going to describe
which interactions are triggered and win
with a special focus on the order of
events in all of those interactions now
you can see what are called participants
here as you see a note here that says
participant and then you see the
customer the card reader we scroll over
the account and then down here we have
the ATM now sometimes when these are
modeled all of the participants are
across the top but I just wanted to show
you how it would look if we only showed
the participants after they were created
so let's just move into here and these
participants can be objects or any other
part of your program or system however
you want to refer to it and the
participants names are going to be
structured first with the objects name
and then followed by the class type
however it is possible to have anonymous
participants like an action listener
like I talked about previously that
waits for events and in triggers things
to occur in the situation in which you
have an anonymous action listener you
would just have the colon here followed
by the name of that action listener or
that action listeners class without a
name up here and anonymous and the
timelines or life lines flowed down the
page and interactions are going to be
shown between the different participants
based off of the lines that are drawn
from one participant to another as you
can see here and the time line is based
on the order of interactions and not the
amount of time between the interactions
however I'll also show you how to
monitor time and show that certain
actions need to be taken within a
certain period of time later on in the
tutorial an interaction is going to
occur when one participant like we have
here the customers the participant sends
a message to
another participant now what a modeling
here is an ATM machine like an automatic
teller machine so here I'm saying that
an ATM card has been inserted and that
then will rely upon the card reader to
verify the card so a message is an event
that is sent from a caller to a receiver
now the message arrow itself has a
description or a message signature
whichever you want to refer to the mass
and that is going to sometimes have a
variable out here or attribute followed
by equals with the message name or the
method name that you're going to be
calling then followed by the name of the
argument and the class of the argument
then another column and the return type
and then you can see an example of a
real world example that right here I
however in here just to conserve space
just have the method type followed by
the name of the attribute I'm sending
then the class and I'm cutting out the
rest of that but this is the more
specific way that you can pass these
messages or message signatures and then
this guy right here with this line here
with the filled in arrow is known as a
synchronous message and you're going to
use this type arrow when a message is
sent and the sender then waits for a
response as you can see that they did
right here asynchronous messages on the
other hand and let's just scroll around
here and find one as you can see right
here do not have a filled-in arrow at
the end of them these are messages that
are sent and then the participant
continues to send messages without
receiving a response so like right here
what we're saying is get savings and
then we are immediately passing over an
amount so here we're going to define
that we want to pull money from the
savings account and this is the amount
that we want to pull from it so we're
sending two messages and not waiting for
a reply between them that is known as an
asynchronous message now if we bounce
back up here you can see over here a
participant being the ATM machine is
being created and this is how you would
create another participant inside of
here and like I said before you could
either have it up here at the top or
just put it down here where it's
actually created and then later on down
here you can actually see where a
participant is actually destroyed and
you note that it's been destroyed
bypassing delete and then putting an ex
where the participant previously would
have been now sequence fragments as you
can exceed an example of one right here
our boxes that surround interactions in
a sequence diagram in the top left
corner contains a fragment operator as
you can see right there and this is
going to designate the type of fragment
if you are going to be using now opt in
this situation designates an optional
fragment that is only going to be used
if the guard which is this guy right
here evaluates to true so what we're
saying here is if they enter the wrong
pin number more than three times we are
then going to pass back bad pin and
maybe decide to destroy their code or do
whatever we want to do in that situation
and this guy right here is known as a
guard condition parameter and it's very
important to know that some sequence
fragments use guard conditions while
others do not
then let's move around inside of here
and you can see another sequence
fragment over here remember I mentioned
before that I may want to destroy the
card well whenever you put any G inside
of it let's say that maybe in the future
I might want to destroy the card but as
the system exists right now I do not
want to destroy any cards under any
situation this is going to surround
interactions that won't ever be executed
at least at this time and this is just
set up so that we know that currently
this dies has mated it as something that
should not be done however with a quick
change to the sequence diagram of course
we could decide to destroy cards at the
end or the wrong pin more than three
times this guy right here is known as a
reference sequence fragment so let's say
that you have a really complicated
sequence diagram piece that you want to
put inside of your sequence diagram and
you want to actually create the whole
thing outside of it to conserve space in
that situation you would just put re F
and then you would give it a name and
then over here you would put s D which
just stands for sequence diagram or
referenced sequence diagram followed by
said name same exact name as you can see
right there is used right here and then
inside of this guy we can go and create
all kinds other things and ref is just
going to be used to separate com
flex interactions from your sequence
diagram and another thing is it's going
to allow you to reuse a set of
interactions so let's say I want to
verify funds later on in my sequence
diagram I can always just come over here
and reference verify funds and it's
automatically going to be able to do
that and that's something to choose all
the time then inside of here you can see
how to set up a looping system and
there's actually a couple different ways
to set up loops right here what I'm
doing is I'm saying that I want to
continue to loop through all of these
interactions that are surrounded with
this box and these interactions will
continue to occur until this guard
condition right here comes back as false
so we're going to continue to loop
through this guy until the amount is
less than or equal to the balance
remember false and you could also define
a minimum number of times you want to
loop like you only want to loop once and
a maximum number of loops which would be
10 or if you just put one number inside
of there like I did here with 5 that
means it's only going to loop through 5
times and then you can see all of the
different interactions that go inside of
here then also inside of here
I have PA AR that is a reference to a
parallel sequence fragment and that
declares that the interactions can occur
in parallel however and this is sort of
something when I didn't know if I should
put in here or not whenever you put the
line inside of here this dashed line it
goes across right there that means
technically that we should check funds
in the checking account before we check
them in the savings account but that's
not exactly 100% has to be enforced
however if we would take this dotted
line out of here that would mean that we
could actually check the savings account
before the checking account and that
would be perfectly fine there's a couple
little things here that I'm going
through that are not always enforced but
in any way you'll get a pretty good idea
how sequence diagrams work by just
looking at this like I said before this
is called a parallel sequence fragment
and this whole entire thing can be used
as a cheat sheet and I'll put a link
under the video and where you can get
that so then let's go back through here
again and look at it another sequence
fragment this is the alternative
sequence fragment and what we're going
to say here a member here's a guard
condition we're going to say if
savings withdraw we're asking them if
they want to remove money from the
savings or do they want to remove money
from the checking we are going to
complete completely different operations
or alternative operations based off of
whether savings withdrawal comes back is
true or is checking withdrawal comes
back is true and then we are performing
multiple different operations in that
situation that are then being passed
over into here and remember I said
previously about being able to define
time constraints which means we're going
to send a message and then we're going
to give them ten milliseconds to respond
and then we would declare a response
within five milliseconds just like this
you would draw the line on a diagonal
plane rather than drawing them on a
horizontal plane right like this if a
message is lost and you would like to
define what happens when a message is
sent and lost like for example maybe
send it again this is the notation you
would use it would just be an arrow with
a dot at the end and if you would also
like to figure out how you would
interact if a message that was
previously sent is found at a later date
that's how you would define it just a
big giant dot and an arrow at the end
and then followed with whatever you'd
like to do thereafter assert as you can
see right here specifies the
interactions inside of this fragment
must work perfectly or an exception is
going to be thrown so here we're just
checking the amount that they are asking
for is less than the imbalance and
that's another way that we could throw
an exception if they entered an amount
that is more than they would have in the
bank you can also see another example of
in a loop right here here I'm saying
that I want to loop through this guy
five times and then I'm throwing in a
break statement so I'm going to check
funds a maximum of five times however if
they do come in here and they ask for an
amount that is less than the balance I'm
going to say break out of the loop and
that's what the break sequence fragment
says and then I'm going to perform
operations that are going to be returned
to the participant that started this
loop another thing you can do is use
critical let's say we are checking the
checking account and we want to protect
from someone else checking for funds
inside of a checking account at the
exact same time across town so that we
don't provide
or with more money than they actually
have in a bank in that situation we
might want to use a critical sequence
fragment and what this is going to do is
it's going to lock out operations on
whatever this participant is like funds
in the checking account until the all
the operations are performed upon that
element and pretty much the only other
thing I haven't talked about our nested
messages and nested messages occur when
one message causes the receiving
participant so here's your one message
and here is your receiving participant
so this one message is going to cause
the receiving participant to send out
one or more messages that is known as a
nested message so that is pretty much
everything you'd want to know about
sequence diagrams I'm going to double
check here just to make certain that I
didn't forget anything and as far as I
can tell I did not feel free to leave
any questions or comments below and of
course if you want to go ahead and get
this there's a link to it it's free and
everything
feel free to download it and do whatever
you'd like with it leave any questions
or comments below otherwise till next
