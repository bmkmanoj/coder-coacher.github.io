bootstrap video tutorial in this one
tutorial I'm pretty much going to take
all the documentation from the bootstrap
website and cram it into one video
underneath in the description I have
links to all the individual parts you
can learn exactly what you want to learn
and bootstrap basically just makes it
extremely easy to make responsive
websites it just does everything for you
for the most part and we're going to be
covering containers Jumbotrons buttons
grid systems for creating responsive
websites how to hide and show elements
based on screen size changes tables
carousels icons image styling text
styling drop-down menus input styling
navigation menus tab interfaces pill
interfaces navigation bars pagination
and a lot more so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay just like always
all the code that I have here is
available in the link in the description
and I'm just going to jump in basically
we have everything over here is just
basic HTML I have a little bit of
styling which I'll cover here in a
second and the first thing we want to do
is throw a meta tag inside of here and
what this meta tag right here that i
just put inside here is going to do is
to tell Internet Explorer to use the
latest rendering engine that's something
you always want to include and then
after that I'm going to throw in another
meta tag this guy right here and
basically what this is saying is to set
the page width to the size of the device
and set the zoom level to one as you can
see right there now we need to go out
and get bootstrap and it's quite easy
what we're going to do is go to get
bootstrap com getting started right here
and I'm going to cover how to deal with
downloading all the source code and
using all of that but for now I'm going
to use a CDN because it's going to make
it very easy for us to get bootstrap and
at the same time it is also going to
potentially save us a lot of time if
someone has gone to another web site
that use bootstrap they'll have it
already available on their system and to
link this in here I'm just going to type
in link like this and this is sublime
text here and this is just a Chrome
browser on the right side of the screen
if you're wondering what that is so I'm
going to go H reference and I'm going to
paste that CDN directly inside of there
and as you can see I'm using version
3.3.4
going to talk about version 4 a little
bit and basically one of the major
changes with version 4 which is in alpha
right now which means it's not done is
we're going to be changing from using a
less compiler to a SAS compiler and I'll
provide a link to my SAS tutorial in the
description as well so you'll be ready
for version 4 all right so now we have
bootstrap here installed and now we're
going to go down here and just start
creating a ton of different things first
thing we're going to need to do however
is come in here and put both a link to
jQuery which is this guy right down here
as well as another link to the jst or
JavaScript of stuff that we're going to
use to make bootstrap work and there's
all of that text like I said all the
code is available in the description and
make sure you put that at the very very
bottom right when the body tag closes
now the very first thing I'm going to
create here is what we call a container
and we just go class and follow that up
with container and you're going to need
to use this container div because it's
going to first off provide padding
around itself while you can use another
one it's called container fluid you can
use either one of these but container is
going to put padding around everything
in that it contains while container
fluid is not it's just going to make
everything butt up against the outside
of the screen that's why containers use
most of the time and one of the other
reasons why we're going to use
containers is because bootstrap grids
require a container inside of them now
inside of this I'm going to create
another div and this is going to have
the class of page header and page header
is going to both add space around the
text as well as in large any of the text
inside of it and it's also going to
provide or add an underline after the
text is displayed so we're just going to
throw a simple h1 tag inside here and
just type in bootstrap tutorial and then
close off the h1 tag and you can see
exactly how this is going to work and
you can see right there bootstrap
tutorial it enlarged it and there's also
a line right there we're going to also
be able to use another class and this is
called Jumbotron and there's a lot of
things we're going to be able to use or
do with Jumbotron I'm going to show you
a whole ton of them here in a second
basically Jumbotron is going to enlarge
your fonts and it's going to put
everything inside of a gray
box by default with rounded corners of
course you'll be able to change from
that gray box to any other color you'd
like to use and just so you know if
Jumbotron is used outside of a container
it's going to completely fill the total
width of whatever screen it is splayed
on and of course you're going to also be
able to change Jumbotron as I did right
here I change the background color for
it as well as the text color for it
right there in the styling section so
it's quite easily to come in there and
style it and like I said I'm going to
show you some other different ways we
can style it in here in a moment
but start off I'm going to throw a
paragraph inside of here and save that
and reload this on screen and there you
can see I changed the color for it and
there is the text displayed inside of it
now we're going to display a whole bunch
of other things we're also going to
display some buttons and there are many
different built-in button colors and
sizes and anytime you would like to have
a link trigger page functionality it
actually should be called a button as
well however whenever you want to use
buttons using bootstrap you should
pretty much just call them button
elements and keep it that way to avoid
any type of confusion so now I'm going
to create another paragraph inside of
here still inside the Jumbotron then
inside of here
I'm going to put a link and let's just
have this point at absolutely nothing
and then I'm going to create another
class inside of here and I'm going to
put inside here the button class as well
as button default and then button large
and I'm going to cover all the other
different things and what those classes
specifically mean I'm going to give it
the role of button and then I'm going to
give it specific text file more info and
then close off that link like I said you
can use links to refer to them as
buttons but it's better to use buttons I
just like to cover everything however so
let's come in here and let's create
another button using the proper button
tag and to do that we would just go type
and let's just have this be a submit
button class again we're going to call
it button this time we're going to
change the color of it and that's going
to be called button danger that's all
that's at and there's a different color
close that off and just give it the name
of button just to keep that simple
you're also going to be able to come in
here and use and
type with the type being equal to button
and a value being equal to whatever
let's just have it be info as well as
class and you can see here that
nothing's going to change we're still
going to put button inside of there and
just to give it a different color I'm
going to go button info and just so that
we can see all the different colors of
default buttons we can have I'm just
going to create a whole bunch more
buttons inside of here if we save and
reload it you're going to see all those
buttons on the screen there you can see
exactly how they line up and like I said
all the color changes are going to be
changed based off of these guys right
here button info and button danger and
you can see how those line up you can
also see here that I was able to get rid
of the button part right here and that's
the default button size that we would be
using we can also use a button small as
well as a button extra small as well as
a button large and you can see right
there there's a button large there's a
button extra small and there is a button
small so there's all kinds of built-in
different ways of styling buttons inside
of bootstrap you're also going to be
able to create buttons and disable them
and then re-enable them if you'd like to
so let's just create another button
inside of here type button and let's
give it a class button which is the
default button size and button and then
we'll go and say that we want this to be
a large button and we want to use the
primary color for buttons and then if we
want this to be disabled by default we
would just go disabled is equal to
disabled and that button will be
disabled of course and which is call
this primary you can see that pop up
here and there is the button and you can
see right there that it's disabled it
can't be clicked on you're also going to
be able to disable links so let's just
throw in a simple link inside of here we
can go class and let's make it
button button default button large and
the only difference is you're going to
put disabled directly inside of there
and we can have the role for this also
be button link inside of there and you
can see there we have a disabled link
saying in this situation the little
warning doesn't pop up but you still
can't click on it another thing we're
going to be able to do is come in and
group our buttons so let's go and create
an
they're div inside of here and let's
give this the class name equal to button
group and let's have these B button
group large you would also be able to
come in and make this small as well as
extra small so there's just tons of
things you're going to be able to do but
they're pretty easy to remember
of course cheat sheets always nice and
that's why I provide one this situation
will make the role equal to group and
then we'll just go and throw a whole
bunch of buttons inside of here and
there we go save them and you can see
here let's say we wanted it to have
sizes for our shirt or something they're
small medium and large and if we reload
it you can see how they line up however
they are all individually connected and
you're only going to be able to select
one of those items at a time so it sort
of works like radio buttons or
checkboxes or something like that and
those are button groups so now what I
want to do is jump over and take a look
closer look at the grid system then
we'll come back and take a closer look
at all of the different interface tools
that we have available to us alright so
now let's come in here and take a closer
look at exactly how we're going to be
able to create responsive websites very
easily so I'm going to come in here
throw a container inside of there and
inside of it if you want to create a
responsive site that is going to scale
we're also going to have to create
another div inside of this and this is
going to have the class name of row and
then we're going to be able to come in
here and go and throw in a whole bunch
of data now how we're going to be
structuring everything is bootstrap uses
what's called a twelve column system
which means that we if we want to have
all of our different elements line up
properly on our screen we're going to
have to section them off in two versions
of twelve and let's just jump in and
just do it I'm going to create another
div inside of here and here is where the
magic happens I'm going to create a
class and we're basically going to be
working with large screens which is
going to be 1200 pixels or above medium
sized screens which is going to be from
992 pixels to 1200 small screens which
is going to be between 992 to 768 and
extra small screens which would be like
mobile devices which is going to be less
than 768 pixels now to define all
these I'm going to have four separate
columns so what I need to do is divide
up all of the twelve segments so that
all this information fits on our screen
and how you do that is just type in
column because we're going to be styling
columns and in a situation in which we
are on a large screen which is going to
be 1200 pixels or more I'm going to say
that I want this to take up three of the
total twelve columns on our screen on
medium sized screens which is going to
be 992 pixels I'm going to say that I
want to use MD that's the medium size
screen and I still want to take out
three of the total space on smaller
screens I'm going to say that I want to
take up six of the available twelve
spaces and on small or extra small
screens I'm going to say that I want to
take up all of the twelve spaces and
that's exactly how that's all lined up
so let's serve some text inside of here
and there we go
I'm going to throw a header inside of
here as well as some just regular old
straight text and then I'm going to do
the same thing for four additional
columns and then we can see how the site
just automatically responds okay so I
threw in a whole three additional
columns for a total of four you can see
column three and there's column four and
of course column two and you can see
also that I defined that they will tape
up exactly the same amount of space at
three three six twelve thirty three six
twelve thirty three six twelve and there
you go once again now if I save this on
purpose made an error so that I can show
you how to fix it let's reload it and
there's the error you can see right
there you can see right here whenever we
are in a large format 1200 pixels it
takes up all the space individually and
put spaces between all the different
columns as I shrink it down there is the
medium range you can see that it went
automatically scaled there it got messed
up I'm going to fix that in a second and
here whenever we get to smaller screens
you can see that it automatically went
and put each of the individual columns
on separate lines so now how do we fix
this problem right here see right there
basically the reason we have the problem
is because this has more text than this
guy right here so it jumps up that it's
very easy to fix it all you're going to
need to do is to throw a div with a
specific class right before where the
column messes up so the column messes up
on column three so we're going to find
column three right here and what we're
going to do is just go in and throw a
div inside of here and then give this
the class name equal to clear fix and
we're going to say that this is only
going to be visible whenever we are in
the small section which is this guy see
right here right there we're in the
large and right here we're in medium and
there is small so we only want this to
occur whenever we're in the small part
and that's the reason why that's there
and that's literally all we need to do
and if we reload it you can see
everything lines up perfectly and if we
scale you can see that everything scales
perfectly so ridiculously easy to make
responsive websites as you can see right
there now I'm going to come in here and
show you what how it works whenever we
have different sized columns all of
these were exactly the same so let's go
and delete this and instead let's come
in and let's create another div and this
is going to have once again class
however this is going to have column
large equal to 2 column medium is going
to be equal to 2 column small is going
to be equal to 4 and column extra small
is going to be equal to 12 and while I
am inside here might as well show you
how to very easily set it up so that
we'll be able to collapse or hide data
on our screen so we're going to come in
here and have h4 which is going to show
on our screen and then let's go and make
this a link H reference and in this
situation whenever this is going to be
clicked on it is going to show or hide
the column of content on our screen and
to do that we have to go data toggle and
the toggle that we will specifically be
aiming at is collapse so it will either
collapse or uncollapse so we want to
show that or show whatever and we're
going to call this column 1 and we'll
close off that link tag and we'll close
off the h4 tag as well now we're going
to come in and create a div which is
going to collapse or not collapse
depending upon what we have here and
it's going to have the same name as what
we have right there so
there we are paste that in there and
then we're going to say that whenever it
first loads on our screen it's going to
be in collapse mode so there that is and
if you want it to show by default you're
going to say collapse in instead so it's
not going to be collapsed when it first
shows on the screen but then it's going
to collapse thereafter and then we'll
throw in some text inside of here and
there that is and now let's create some
more of these different containers so
that we will be able to see exactly what
looks like whenever these change so I'm
just going to copy this guy right here
paste that inside of their clothes off
that div and for this guy I'm going to
change this to take up four columns and
this is going to take up four columns
and this is going to take up eight
columns and this is going to take up the
total of twelve columns and I went in
threw in two additional columns and you
can see here that the only difference is
this is in collapse in which means it's
going to show by default and these is
collapse and this is collapse so let's
save that reload it see how it works you
can see collapse in that's the reason
why that's showing by default however if
we come in and click on this it's going
to collapse and now it's going to show
and let's make all these show on screen
you're going to be able to see exactly
how they go and structure themselves so
when they're in large mode you're going
to see that they equally divide up all
the space by four so they'll be able to
show up right like this this first
column is going to take up two of the
twelve spaces this is going to take up
four of the twelve spaces and this is
going to take up the remaining six see
how they all add up to twelve then when
we're in medium mode it's going to take
up two this is going to take up four
this is going to take up six whenever we
get into small mode this is going to
take up a total space as you can see
right there see it's taking up all the
different space that's available while
this is going to divide between eight
and four and then here we have when
we're in an extra-small mode we're going
to take up all the spaces and they are
all going to be on separate lines it's a
pretty simple very easy way to hide all
that content show all that content and
so forth and so on
another thing that's neat is very often
I'm sure you've seen websites that will
literally take elements off the screen
based off of screen sizes so let's go
and take a look at exactly how that
works I mean here make sure that we
always have a closing div for the row
part there remember anytime you use grid
you're going to have containers you're
going to have row and now this time we
don't even need
the RO part here but I'm not going to
delete it because I'm instead what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use well
here and I'm going to say that this guy
is going to be hidden whenever it's in
small mode hidden whenever it is in
medium screen mode and hidden whenever
it is in large mode we close off that
div and then inside of here inside of
paragraph tags I'm just going to go in
and I'm going to say that the screen is
less than 768 pixels so we'll be able to
see this change on the screen and I'm
going to create a whole bunch more of
these one for each of the different
screen sizes and then for this one I'm
going to say that this is not going to
be hidden when we're in small mode and
this guy is not going to be hidden
whenever we are in small or medium mode
and then this guy is going to be hidden
at all so we'll just let that be well
and I threw in some information about
the different screen sizes here just to
make it a little bit more interesting
and here you can see if I go and reload
it how they change and as I go and
shrink the size down how all the
different elements are going to show
based off of the screen size changes so
that's how easy it is to go in here
based off of screen sizes to
automatically hide elements or show
elements some pretty neat now for the
final demonstration in this part anyway
now I'm going to come in here and go
container I'm going to show you some
things you can do with tables as well as
how you can sort of show different
things or move things around on the
screen so let's go class let's equal to
row and then close that off and then
we'll go and paste in all of our
different table data and I'm going to
show you two different ways to move
things to the right of the screen so
that you can have blank spaces on the
side if you'd like to do something like
that we could come in here first off and
create a div and give this the class and
let's say that we want this div that's
going to be blank to take up half the
screen when we're in medium mode so when
you go six like that and then just throw
nothing inside of there then in the
second situation where we're going to
have our table we're going to have class
equal to and call them and it's going to
be exactly the same it's going to take
up six of the space whenever it's in
medium mode and close that off and then
inside of here we'll just throw in all
of our table data and there that is
let's go and save that and reload this
and you could say that all that
shows up on the screen however whenever
we switch it to medium mode you can see
that it jumps over to the right side of
the screen now we don't need to come in
here and go and throw in this dead sort
of div inside of here we could get rid
of that all together and get the exact
same results where it shows on the right
side of the screen by just coming in and
go and call them medium offset 6 and
you're going to get exactly the same
results and all that means it's going to
offset or leave blank 6 columns to the
left side of the screen and display all
that now I want to focus in on some
things that I did here with the table
now we can come in and label this as
table bordered and what that's going to
do is go and throw a border around the
whole entire table pretty simple table
striped is going to go in here and put
these stripes inside of our table right
like that of course we would be able to
go into the CSS and change all that I'll
show you that in a minute and table
hover whenever that class is used
anytime we would hover over any of the
different parts of the table it's
automatically going to change color
another thing you can see right here is
I'm saying with columns fan that best
baseball players this guy up here is
going to take up four of the total
spaces or columns on our web page well
here what we're saying is this blank
space where we have our names we only
want that to take up two of the total
six columns that we have here allocated
for this table the thing that I did
right here is I went and put text Center
inside of here it's text left by default
and that's the reason why you see
average and RBIs and home runs right
here in the center of the table
of course you could also put text right
just to show you how that works and you
can see it's on the right now looks ugly
but just when to cover that and that is
pretty much all the different things you
can do with tables as well as how to
offset and move different elements on
the screen now I want to show you how
you can download the source for
bootstrap go in and change CSS styling
inside of it lemon is specifically
target jumbotron and how to style it and
I'm also going to show you all the cool
things you can do with carousel inside
of bootstrap now to get the source for
bootstrap again you're going to go to
get bootstrap calm getting started and
in this situation you're going to
download the source code right here then
whenever you download the source code
you're going to go into the D is T file
and you're going to copy all of these
guys every single one of them
and then you're going to paste them in
as you can see right here CSS fonts and
J s into whatever directory you're using
for your website now we're going to come
in here and specifically link directly
to those downloaded versions now I've
went and put them in directories that
you saw right there and if I want to
link to them I'm just going to come in
and go link this is going to be
stylesheet type text/css everything's
fine right here
the H reference however is going to be
CSS bootstrap dot CSS because I want to
change that CSS here I'm not using the
men version of it I'm using the regular
CSS file I'm also going to be using a
Google font that's what this is if
you're wondering what that is Google
provides a whole bunch of web fonts that
are free then down here you can see that
I went and also installed jQuery just
like I previously did however down here
I'm linking to the jsr javascript
directory that I have right here and I
am using the min version in this
situation so that's how we would be able
to come in there and use our own
versions of our downloaded source with
bootstrap and go in and customize the
styling for it alright so down inside of
the body section I am just going to
throw in some dummy text and images and
so forth just so you can see what those
look like on the screen again I'm going
to be using Jumbotron so I'm going to
have a class inside of here which is
going to be the container because I want
it to have padding around the outside
and now we'll go in and throw Jumbotron
inside of this class is equal to and
Jumbotron and then I'm just gonna paste
in some junk images and so forth there's
a logo that I went and threw inside of
here here is a website title and here's
website slogan that I threw inside of
there if we come up inside here this has
nothing to do with bootstrap and you can
see right here I have my font size and I
have my default font family I have the
logo which is hundred pixels by 100
pixels website title and all that this
is how you link to the Google font that
I have up here there's Pacifica stay
right there
Pacifica and we can go and save this and
reload this guy over here I'm in
bootstrap 3 right now you can see
exactly how that shows up on the screen
the only reason I did this however is to
go in here and show you how you can
change the color on Jumbotron and change
the styling for everything for the most
part and to do that you're going to open
up the bootstrap CSS file this guy
right here which is in your CSS
directory and if you just open that guy
up and you go and do a search or a fine
for Jumbotron you're going to see right
here well we'll be able to come in and
change the background color so let's
just change it to default background
color and save it and reload it and you
can see that it changed just slightly
let's go and change it to something more
defined
let's go like this reload and you can
see it changed to black and here we
changed it to white and there we go so
that's how easy it is to come in and
there's a bazillion different things you
can change style wise inside of here
just want to show you exactly what that
looks like in a real life situation now
I'm going to show you carousel which is
a ridiculously cool slider and to create
it all we're going to have to do is come
in and create a div and I'm going to
give it the ID of the carousel doesn't
matter what this name is right here
we're going to be referring to it
however and this is going to have a
class and we're going to call this
carousel and slide and then we're gonna
go data ride equal to carousel close
that off now here what we're going to do
is define how many slides that we want
to put inside of our carousel inside of
an ordered list and this is going to
have the class name of carousel
indicators and then we're going to put
list items inside of here let's close
that off so list item data target is
equal to the carousel and then we're
going to define what slide this is so
data slide 2 is going to be equal to 0
we're going to make this class equal to
active which means it's going to be the
active slider whenever the slider first
shows up on the screen and then we're
just going to close off our list item
then we're going to do exactly for the
most part the same thing for all of our
other different list items so let's just
go and throw that inside of here the
only difference is it's you can only
have one active or one first slide to
show at a time so we're going to get rid
of that we're going to change this into
slide 1 and this is going to be slide 2
and nothing else needs to change there
so there's our list of items we have
three different slides then we want to
define the text that's going to be
placed over top of the images in our
slider let's go and create another div
class is equal to and we're going to
call this carousel inner put another div
inside of here
do this is going to be class is equal to
item active closed off that div throw in
another div this is going to have the
class name of slide one and then each of
these different items can have a caption
so we're going to go do class equal to
carousel caption and inside of here will
define all of the different text that we
want to put inside of here so here what
I'm going to do is throw an h1 tag
inside of here a paragraph and also a
button that's going to go inside of
there and then I'm going to do the exact
same thing for the other two slides so
once again we're going to put item
inside of here this is not the active
one this isn't the first one showing so
that's the reason why active isn't
inside there there I have slide two
instead of slide one carousel caption
exactly the same and the only other
difference between them is this guy is
going to have a button and none of the
other ones are going to have a button
but you can put buttons inside them if
you'd like to then after all of that
closes off what we need to do is set the
actions to take whenever the arrows are
going to be clicked on let's scroll this
up when you go a class is equal to we're
going to target the left
carousel button or carousel control
whatever you want to call it and the H
reference on this is going to be a
reference to the carousel and then we go
data slide previous so if they click on
the Left button in our carousel it's
going to take them to the previous slide
and here we couldn't define I'm going to
show you more about icons that are
available inside a bootstrap but that's
what this is you're going to see a ton
about icons here in a second and these
are called glycans and glyphicon chevron
left is a left button close that off
there's that span and now we're going to
do pretty much exactly the same thing
for the right arrow you're going to see
here in a second what looks like this is
going to be changed to right carousel
control still targeting the carousel
data slide however is going to be
changed to next and the chevron is going
to be changed to right of course and we
just file save that and reload it and
you can see right there is our little
slider we can jump backwards and
forwards that's what the different
arrows were doing for us you can see
here is the h1 tag with your own side
there there's
raph there's the button and as you can
also see it automatically scales to the
screen depending upon whatever
real-estate is available to use it
there's a whole bunch of different ways
using carousels and all kinds of grid
layouts and so forth now I'm going to
jump over and show you a whole bunch of
other different components that are
built into bootstrap okay so I told you
I was going to talk about icons and now
let's talk about some icons I'm back
over inside of bootstrap dot HTML if
you're looking for where I am inside my
code sorry I'm bouncing around a lot
because I'm trying to cover a lot
basically bootstrap comes with hundreds
of different icons that you're going to
be able to use you're going to be able
to find those at get bootstrap comm
components glyphicon straight like this
let's just come in here and throw some
icons on the screen geez so you can see
exactly what they look like to get the
icon show you just go class and then
you're going to go glyphicon like this
and then you're going to type in
whatever the glyphicon x' name is you
can see right here these are the
glyphicon names so let's come over here
and let's just grab one of them doesn't
matter what it is I'm going to grab the
film one that we have right here so I'm
just going to copy that over here paste
that inside of there well I can get rid
of this one there we go we go like this
and close off the span jump back over
here reload it and there you can see the
little film icon shows up there on the
screen let's come in here and throw a
little container around this and
Jumbotron as well and you can see there
is the film and you could also see that
the color went automatically change for
us there now you're also going to be
able to use these icons with links or
inside of buttons or whatever you would
like to do with them so let's go and
create another one here I'm going to
create a link course doesn't go anywhere
and here I'm going to have this be class
button use the button primary for the
color and let's make it a large button
so we'll be able to see everything and
here I'm going to say trash put a space
at the end of it and if I want to put
inside of that guy a button I'm then
going to go span class is equal to and
here I'm going to get the trash icon
throw that inside of there and then
close off our span and close off our
link I'm going to go
create another one let's create a
regular role button type 'button here
I'll have class button button default
make this large as well and then inside
of the button section I'm going to
create a span and once again class and
then I'm going to put a glyphicon inside
of here
let's see if I can get one do a little
search for phones see if there's a phone
icon and here I can see is a phone icon
so let's go and copy this jump over here
inside of the span paste that icon
inside of there and another thing that
is good to do is to come in here and go
area hidden like this and set this to
true and what this is going to do is
just hi decorative icons like this that
don't really have any meaning from
screen readers so that it doesn't cause
confusion then after the span closes out
I'm going to put a space and let's say
call me and I'm going to close off our
button now let's go look and see what
that looks like reload and there you can
see there is using the link type of
button and there's a trashcan and here
we use the phone for our regular button
so that's how we can use different icons
inside of our buttons or on their own or
with links or with whatever now I want
to jump over here and talk about Wells
and basically a Wells going to surround
the text with a rounded border as well
as a gray background by default of
course you can change that and what's
really neat about it is you'll be able
to change the size of the well you from
well small to well large and so forth
and so on so I'm going to show you
exactly what those look like so to
create one you just go div class is
equal to and you already saw Wells in a
previous part of the tutorial just want
to cover them again because they're very
often used close off that div and throw
that inside of there inside of a
paragraph tag and then let's go and also
throw another one outside of the well so
you can see how they both look and
reload it and you can see right there
that's the difference between using a
well and not using the well another
thing where I'm able to do is round our
images I'm doing all this inside of a
container div as you can see right there
so let's go and get ourselves an image
and source is equal to and
have entity logo dot ping like this ID
is equal to I'm going to give it the ID
of NTT logo class is going to be image
responsive and anytime you mark an image
as responsive it's going to have a max
width equal to the screen and you're
going to be able to add things like
rounded corners with image rounded image
circle to throw the image inside of a
circle or thumbnail you're also going to
be able to pull left and pull right to
float your images and center block will
place the image in the center of the
screen so it provides a whole bunch of
different tools so in this situation I'm
going to go image and thumbnail like I
said you'd be able to come in here
instead and type in rounded for circle
so try those out for homework and let's
say that I want to have it be pull left
or float left that's how we would do
that and all I'm just going to have this
be responsive image and reload it you
can see it puts a little border around
there for the thumbnail and it's also
floating on the Left another thing we
can do is add contextual colors like we
did to the buttons above to regular old
text and all you do is just create
yourself a class and just give it names
like text muted or text same exact sort
of names as you saw before text primary
text success text info text warning and
text danger and if we reload you can see
exactly how those different colors show
up there on the screen it just provides
you with the very easy way of keeping
everything consistent throughout all the
text on your webpage and in a similar
way you could also cut it change the
backgrounds and all you would do is just
change this from text to BG for
background you're going to use all of
the exact same names just like you did
before and reload and there you can see
how the background has changes just like
I said it just provides you with an easy
way to draw attention to text using
things like success and info and warning
and danger so that you have consistency
across the page
bootstrap also has a whole bunch of
built in menus that you're going to be
able to use and we would just go and
create these once again inside of the
container area and I'm going to create
inside of this a div here I'm going to
create a drop-down menu so it's
just like before and it's dropped down
just like you would think that it may be
and then inside of here I'm going to
throw a button class and then we're
going to put button I'm gonna button
primary for the colouring however now
we're going to say drop-down toggle and
we could come in here and define button
large button smaller button extra small
which would just be excess or SM for
small we're going to put our type inside
of here being button let's go and give
it an ID of drop-down menu one and data
toggle you're going to go from being in
drop-down position to not being a
drop-down position as all that means
then we can use Aria again I had
mentioned it previously what Aria stands
for is accessible rich Internet
applications and they're basically used
so that different elements on your site
can be accessible for people that have
disabilities so for screen readers and
things like that so that certain
information doesn't come up in a screen
reader if it doesn't make sense like
icons and things like that and other
things would like basic text well one
thing that we can do here is go Aria has
pop up and make this equal to true and
if you want to see what all of them look
like just go to this website right here
it's this great big giant thing w3.org
TR like I said this link will be
available in the description but you can
see all of these different guys here
there's tons of them
it's just ways to make here's the main
ones that we have here you can see
there's has pop up and you can go and
click on those and see what all of them
do and what all of them mean make sure
you spell this right though
aria-haspopup true' and what
aria-haspopup means is it's just stating
that the element has a submenu to it and
then aria-expanded is equal to true it
just means it's going to be expanded and
then at the end of this we can put
something like favorite hero all this
will make sense once you see it here on
the screen we could then come in here
and display a button if we'd like so
class is equal to and here I'm just
going to use the caret symbol and I'm
going to close off that button area and
now what I'm going to do is create an
unordered list and this is going to have
class which is going to be drop-down
menu you can put things in this list
unselectable headers if you want to put
information so I'm going to do here is
have like a list of superheroes and some
of them are going to be in marble and
some of them are going to be in DC so
I'm going to have this be something
that's a header but it's not going to
allow you to select it because it
wouldn't make sense and then here I'll
say Marvel and then close that off and
then I can actually put my list items
inside of here and I can also of course
have them be links have this be linked
to nothing and then we can go to
spider-man Captain America and Iron Man
another thing we can put in this
drop-down menu is a separator like I
said it's just another list item nothing
other than that and you just put
separator and clasp is going to have the
value of divider and then just close off
that list item and then we could throw
in another header for DC like I said it
was going to do and then a couple other
different heroes for Superman Batman and
flash in the DC Universe and if you want
to have one of your list items actually
not show on the screen or have it be
disabled just put class disabled on it
if we file save that you're going to see
exactly what this looks like
there it is favorite hero we click on it
it's going to show everything there's a
header there's a divider and this is
disabled so that's a really cool-looking
drop-down menu and like I said it's very
easy to change the styling on all of
this so now let's take a look at input
groups
now the input groups are basically going
to allow you to put your labels right
next to where you would input your
information which is really cool and you
can put them on the left or the right
side or the left and right side and to
group inputs together we're going to
come in here and go class and we'll go
input group and we'll say input group
large and again you could have small and
extra small as well and now those are
grouped together so the input and the
and the label so we can actually come in
and go span class is equal to and input
group add on and your name it's just a
neat way of doing this you'll see here
in a second what looks like and then
just do a regular old input so input
text just like you always do class is
equal to go form control place older is
equal to full name close that off and
you can see right there how the label
goes directly inside of there it's like
the two of them are connected so it's a
nice little style element throw a break
statement at the end and then do pretty
much exactly the same thing
so let's just copy this here we can
change this small just to sue you can
see the difference between large and
small and in this situation we'll just
put the input before the label that we
have inside of there just so you can see
how that looks and then inside of the
span input group let's say we want it to
be a button instead of just a regular
old label so you'll be able to click
catch a an event that would be clicked
on whenever you clicked on that button
and then what you could do is actually
throw a button inside of it so we'll
just go button and give this a class
name of button and let's just use the
default button in this situation and
then enter and you can see it's a little
bit smaller because that's how we
defined it and now this is a button that
we can actually have events triggered on
this is just a label this is a button
and you can put those on right to the
left side of the screen just depending
upon how you want to do it or a little
right and the left side of the screen we
could also come in here and create input
button dropdowns and in this situation
we're going to have a div once again and
this is going to use the class of row
course put this inside of quotes this is
going to have another div inside of it
which is going to have a class of input
group I'm showing you it pretty much
everything you can use here with
bootstrap tons of neat tools and then
put another div inside of this and this
is going to be an input group button and
then finally throw our button inside of
it class is equal to button let's just
throw a default button inside of there
the type on this is button bounce back
inside of the class let's put the drop
down toggle so that it toggles from
being on in to being off and then we're
also going to go data toggle is equal to
a drop down and then once again just
like we did with our other drop-down
will have aria-haspopup equal to true
and aria-expanded meaning that it's not
going to be to spin expanded whenever it
opens up set that to false and we can
throw something inside of here like user
ID and then after that we could throw a
span inside of here
which is going to have a caret so span
and give this the class of caret so it
will show a caret symbol you would
expect with a dropdown and then we could
put in
unordered list items and this is going
to have class of drop-down menu because
that's what it is and then we can have
our list items inside of here as well
and let's make these links go nowhere
let me do something like Facebook
Twitter and Google+
now after that closes off well first off
take this span up here this is a carrot
symbol right here so you don't want it
down there you want it up here
that's just going to put the carrot in
there for the drop-down and then we come
in here and put in an input box so let's
say we're asking for like a user name on
Facebook Twitter or Google+ and they're
going to put that in then choose
Facebook Twitter or Google+ you'll see
here in a second when it looks like type
this is just going to be a text input
class is equal to form control and now
you could see if I save that we can
click on user ID Facebook and then they
could type in whatever their user ID is
on Facebook or whatever you'd want to do
you also have some special tools we can
use for radio boxes as well as
checkboxes inside a bootstrap so we're
going to put this inside of a div with
the class of row once again and we're
also going to come in and create a div
class this is going to be an input group
we could throw a span inside of here
class is equal to and put input group
add-on and then put input and this guy
is going to be a checkbox if you'd want
it to be a radio button instead just put
radio button or just put radio instead
of checkbox inside of there and then we
can group this up with the just a basic
old input box right like this and it
just provides a way for us to group
different interface elements together as
you can see right there so they could
put the check inside of there and then
write some sort information inside of
there and do whatever else you'd like
another thing we can do is create a
bunch of other different types of
navigation elements again I'm going to
do this inside of a div with class name
of container and let's say we wanted to
create a basic horizontal menu well
we're just going to create an unordered
list and give it the class name of list
inline and then inside of this you're
just going to put all of your list items
so list item and then you can put links
inside of here let's just have that go
there
and you can do something like home
clothes off your list item let's make a
couple of these could also come in and
do an about we could also come in and
add a drop-down menu so we could do a
list item again and all we need to do is
trim in and change the class name to
drop down and put some different
information inside of it so we could
have a link here and a couple things we
need to change however we can still
leave that be H reference be nothing Oh
everywhere we want to come in and have
our class be drop-down toggle that's how
we can turn the drop-down on and off and
then of course we got to go data toggle
just like we have a bunch of other
different times and type in drop-down
and then this guy right here could be
contact or something like that we could
go and throw a span inside of here again
if we would want to put a carrot symbol
inside of there and then just close off
that span and then inside of this we
could put a whole bunch of different
list items so we need to put in an
unordered list once again class is equal
to and this is going to be a drop-down
menu and then you'll put in your list
items for that drop-down menu for your
horizontal bar so let's tie them feel
simple close that off and then you could
throw in all of your different links
inside of there so let's say we wanted
them to be able to contact us by phone
or email or have another option where
they could set an appointment or
schedule an appointment it's going to
automatically scale everything so you
don't have to worry about any of that
and save that reload it and you can see
right there exactly how that works out
if we click on that contact that
drop-down right there will show you all
the different options you have available
it's really easy to add those horizontal
menus as well and then go in and style
them just like before could also come in
and create a basic vertical menu in kind
of a similar way so let's just go create
an unordered list and we just give it a
class name here what I'm going to do is
use pills for the vertical menu so I'm
going to go nav navigation and I'll go
now pills and nav stacked since its
vertical and its side of it we just put
all our list items again so Li and here
we'll just say class is equal to and
let's have this be the active pill or
navigate
element on the screen which means it's
just going to be selected each reference
and then we'll throw in home like we did
previously close off our list item and
let's do it just like we did with our
previous menu that we had here we could
throw this inside of here and throw a
bout inside of there we're also going to
be able to use dropdowns if we want so
we'll go in and throw our next list item
inside of here however this is going to
be a drop-down so we're going to call
this drop-down it's automatically going
to work for us and inside of there we
can just go throw a link inside of there
give this a class name which is
drop-down toggle again doing the same
thing in the same sort of ways again
data toggle to make it show up there and
this is going to be dropped down that's
not going to do anything and then after
we have the end of this link that we
have here we'll do contact just like we
did with the other menu we can still
throw in different span elements to
create our carrot symbols for us for our
drop-down to make it look a little bit
better and then we'll go and get this
link right here and throw that at the
end and after we have that set up then
all we have to do is throw our another
unordered list inside of there to have
all of our different options that are
available so unordered list class and
this is going to be drop-down menu and
if we throw in our different list items
a list item and then just like we did
previously
well let's close off that list item
email and schedule and reload it and
there you can say now you have different
ways of selecting all these different
guys and there you can see that we can
also go and click on these also so
pretty cool stuff so let's go and since
we talked about pills why don't I go and
talk about other different tabbed
interfaces as well as pilled interfaces
now what this is going to allow us to do
is to create like tabs on our screen
that's going to change information in a
div based off of different buttons that
are clicked so I want to have across
horizontally across stop the screen I'm
going to have a list of different
options and I'm going to use navigation
just like previously and nav pills which
are going to be like the little rounded
off edged things you can also put tabs
inside of there just to change that from
pills to tabs
close that off and then we'll put in
our different options we have so we have
class is equal to let's go and make this
the active tab on our screen whenever it
first loads up and the difference here
is since we're going to be changing data
inside of a div down below we're going
to reference that div being the one that
we want to show on the screen and by
default it's going to show up there so
we'll just have Superman whenever this
is clicked on it's going to show
Superman's information on the screen and
we can close that off and let's go and
have a couple different superheroes
inside of here so we could also have
Batman but this isn't going to be active
though you can only have one of them
active so get rid of that and this one's
going to be changed to Batman and change
this to Batman for this guy right here
we're going to change the class for this
let's go and show you another drop-down
so let's just say it's a drop-down
because that's exactly what it is then
whenever we do that for the link inside
of it we're going to change this class
to drop-down toggle and what do we do
every single time we have drop-down
toggle when we go dad a toggle is equal
to drop-down we're not going to have
this link to anything whenever they
click on that there's actually going to
be two different types of flash so
whenever they click on flash it's going
to show a couple different things right
after the flash however I'd also like to
come in here and throw a span class
inside of it so that I can show a carrot
on the screen so that they know that
it's a drop-down just by looking at it
there's that span and then that'll be
the end of that link but it's not the
end of the drop-down yet because we want
to put different options inside of it so
an unordered list class and this is
going to be a drop-down menu and then we
could put our different items inside of
here let's close off that unordered list
so that we know where that is and that
will just list all of our different
items inside of here if we'd like to
have one of those items disabled once
again you just type in class disabled
and automatically disables it that works
on tons of components inside of this
list item we can go ate reference and
this one's going to point at the
information on flash and we're just
going to call him the flash and then
we're going to do another one that's
going to be kid flash so let's just go
like this and as soon as this link ends
right here throw another one inside of
there come down here where it says
Batman and it said change this to Kid
Flash
change this to Kid Flash change this
link here to data toggle is equal to tab
all the rest so that's fine so now what
we need to do after we have created this
on ordered list of things we can click
on across the top of the screen we then
want to list all of the information we
want to show whenever those different
tabs are clicked on and to do that we
create another div and give it the class
name of tab content and then we'll just
separate all of them so we'll go div
this is going to have the ID of Superman
which is what we'll be referencing
whenever the on the tabs like these guys
up here say Superman right there
Superman that's what we're referencing
right there class is going to be equal
to this is going to be a tab pane which
is what we're using and we could say
that it's going to fade off the screen
and we'll say that it's going to be
active that's by default it's going to
be the active thing on the screen
whenever it loads close off that div and
then put information in here that you
want to show and I just threw in
paragraph tags for all of our different
superheroes and if I reload it you can
see Superman is active by default if I
click on Batman Batman's information
shows up if I click on flash the flash
and Kid Flash drop down show up this is
disabled like I disabled it in Kid Flash
shows up Kid Flash information so
there's tabbed interface as well as
pilled interfaces now let's take a look
at collapsible navigation bars which are
ridiculously cool now I just went ahead
and copied and pasted this in here
because this is the way you always will
do navigation bars I'm going to walk you
through what every single thing means
however this is a copy and paste thing
this isn't something you memorized by
any stretch of the imagination and as
you can see over here it's a very
functional little navigation bar throws
it inside there as an icon has different
options we can select has dropdowns that
we can also click on and as you can see
I went and copied and pasted it in the
navigation bar I'm going to explain
every single line here but as you can
see it is very useful we're going to be
able to shrink this down automatically
scales and also it's going to create
this little menu here depending upon
smaller screen sizes directly for you so
it's extremely useful it's also going to
allow us to add in both buttons and
dropdowns as well as a search bar as
well as a submit button so basically I'm
going to go through all the different
options we have here so this is
container
which means it's going to completely
fill the container part that we have
right here navbar and navbar default or
the ways that you define that you're
going to actually use a navbar then
you're going to put in a div with the
class name of navbar header another
option you can have here is instead of
navbar default you could come in input
navbar fixed - top and that's going to
always keep it on the screen or navbar
fix bottom which is always going to keep
it at the bottom of the screen bottom
there we go and so go and play around
with that for homework to see how that
looks but I'm just going to keep it nav
bar default which means it's going to
scale so as the screen is scrolled it's
going to disappear and come back and so
forth and so on this button right here
is going to be the button that toggles
the nav bar on and off whenever you're
on smaller screens so that button is
actually this button here with all the
dashes inside of it and it uses data
toggle collapse and just like you saw
previously with the other different what
guys that we were playing around with
and there's the re-expanded false and so
forth and so on this span right here is
only there to hide information from
screen readers this guy right here is
actually the bars that are drawn inside
of this button right here so these three
bars that you see right there that's
what these three bars are so yes indeed
you do need them or you could throw
something else inside of that span some
other icon or something if you'd prefer
right here is where we have our logo and
you're going to have to play around with
the logo that you have pull left of
course is going to just works exactly
the same way as float left it's going to
put it on the left side of your bar and
whenever you're working with the image
you're going to place inside of there
your logo you're going to have to add
padding in your image on the top and the
right until it fits in there just right
and that's something you're going to
have to do in some sort of graphics
program like Photoshop something like
that and then down inside if this div
we're going to collect the nav links
forms and other content that's going to
be toggled on and off on the screen
whatever the screen is too small to
display all that information and then
down inside of here you can see that I
have all of my links so there is my home
there is the about there's dropdowns
we're going to create dropdowns in
exactly the same way that we've gone
over many other different times here you
can see there's the drop down part with
the email and set appointments and all
those other different things you can see
right here is where we're going to have
our search form you can see that we
grouped those items together there is
the input box that we have right there
and then here is our submit button and
then this is closing off all the other
different dips so that's how we would
create a navbar that's going to
automatically resize and shrink and show
up different menus depending upon the
screen size so really neat pagination is
also going to be very easy to implement
again we're going to throw this inside
of our container area and then we're
just going to create a nav element
inside of here inside of that will then
put it in an on word list and our class
here is going to be pagination close
that off close off our unordered list
and we're going to list all of our
different elements that we want to show
up inside of here so list item of course
and then we're going to put in our
different links and it's done a little
bit different we'll go H reference we're
going to have this go into nowhere
because it doesn't really matter or a
label and this is going to be previous
for screen readers like we've talked
about previously and then we can throw
in another icon area let's hide this
icon from screen readers so it doesn't
cause confusion and that's what that
does
I'm going to go laq UO which is going to
draw that little arrow and then we're
going to close off our spam and then
close off this list item and then we're
going to put all of the other different
pages that we want to show up in our
list so just create a whole bunch of
list items with a whole bunch of links
inside of them so if you want to show
five pages well let's just go in here
and put one close that off and then of
course you just have to come in and
change these to all the different page
items and of course the links would have
to go to some page somewhere and at the
very end you're going to create pretty
much exactly the same thing as you
create it here for the previous and this
is going to be changed to next so let's
just change this the next this is going
to be right or aqu o instead of la qul
and everything else should be all set up
and reload it and you can see the
pagination automatically works for us
we'll be able to
in there so another nice little
component now let's take a look at
thumbnails here what I'm going to do
inside of container and then inside of
the div for row is create four columns
of it's going to have an image a header
it's going to have a description and
it's going to have the option for the
user to click on it to add to card or
something like that so it's just a basic
sort of shopping cart type of thing so
since we're going to be working with
columns that means we're going to have
to come in and mess around with the
different classes on how this
information is going to be divided off
so we're going to say that whenever it's
in large mode we want each of these to
take up three spaces and medium is going
to be three and let's just have them all
be exactly the same it's three so under
all situations they're going to take up
or divide up the three different columns
between the four different elements that
I'm going to display on the screen and
inside of each one of these guys I'm
going to throw a thumbnail as well as a
caption so I'm going to go div class is
equal to some nail throw an image inside
of it and I already went and created one
of these so go thumb one and this is
ping file let's just go and have the alt
be just nothing and then inside of this
where you want to put your text you're
going to get a div class is equal to and
caption and then inside of there you can
put in your header file as well as
paragraph and then a button if we look
at it you can see there's hamburger with
a little image inside of it and then
we're just going to throw three more of
those inside of there and we did exactly
the same thing if we reload it you're
going to see all four of them show up
inside of there if I went this changed
the meatball sub we can mess around with
that but you can see that they all line
up pretty nice there it scales a little
bit better and they're automatically
going to get a little bit funky right
there in that situation these should
have been moved down so that they were
stacked on top of each other for smaller
screens but either way you get the idea
and I'll show you how to set up for a
progress bar and it's basically just
going to provide for an easy way for you
to provide feedback to users by changing
a value for a progress bar and to create
one again inside of a container we're
just going to say div and class and
progress and then inside of that div
we're going to create on
another div and it's going to have the
class of progress bar and you can either
have it be a basic flat colored progress
bar or have it be a striped progress bar
I like destroy the striped version a
little bit better so I'm going to keep
it that way
and the role in this situation is
progress bar and then Aria value now
this is going to be something you would
change so let's say we want it to be 60
just put 60 inside of there and that's
what it's going to demonstrate on our
progress bar and then inside of here we
can say the minimum value on our
progress bar is going to be zero and the
maximum value on our progress bar is
going to be 100 and the let's go and
style this then to have a width of 60%
and you can see it would be very easy to
change the progress bar value on the
screen and then we could do we could
also come in and throw a span at the end
of it that would say class so only I say
something like 60% complete something
else we could change with JavaScript and
save that reload it and you can see
right there is the progress bar and you
can see that it's striped the way that
it I happened right there now let's go
and take a look at media objects now a
media object is basically going to allow
us to structure information on the
screen sort of like in a blog format and
we could also set it up to make it look
like a commenting system where one
person is commenting to another person's
response again we're going to put this
inside the container and then we're
going to create another div and it's
going to be class of media and whenever
we're talking about media we're going to
be talking about an image that we're
going to be showing on the screen and
we're going to decide on the placement
of that by surrounding a an image with a
div that's going to have a class and
we're going to say that we want the
image to be on the left and that we want
it to be on the top so the upper
left-hand corner of the display of
information on our screen and then
inside of this we could throw in let's
just make it a link and this is--that's
is going to allow them to click on a
thumbnail and display some type of
information if they'd like there's going
to be an image inside of it and I'm just
going to say
one thing I'm going to use the same
images that I used previously except
here I'm going to say class is equal to
media object and then we'll just throw
alt in here of nothing again then
outside of the div that's going to
surround our thumbnail I'm going to
throw another div inside of this however
this one's going to have media body and
this is going to be the text that's
going to accompany that image and inside
of here we can throw in a header tag as
well as a whole bunch of paragraphs of
information if we reload it you can see
exactly how that shows up on the screen
it's automatically going to scale and do
all those different things that we'd
like and then of course right after that
we could throw in exactly the same type
of thing again media there's a different
thumb there's different media body
there's more information and you can see
how they line up like a blog formatted
type of thing and you could also have
these be nested and so forth I'm
actually not going to cover that I'll
just let that be in the code that's in a
link in the description you can go take
a look at how to do that it's very
simple
that would just allow you to indent all
this information and then to round off
everything I'm going to cover some
information on lists and how we can mess
around with them let's create a list
group right here so unordered list class
is equal to list group close off the
unordered list of course then we're
going to throw in some list items class
is equal to we'll go list group item
because that's what it is if you want to
have one of the items in your list
disabled you just put disabled inside of
there let's just go put something like
Verizon email throw in another list item
give this the same class name class is
equal to list group item just like we
had previously and then for this one we
could also add badges to these guys so
for this list item what I'm basically in
a try to mock up here is like an email
type of system so we could say span
class is equal to you can use badges
which is another bootstrap little
interface tool say we're going to have
123 emails from our gmail account you do
like this and it close off that list
item which is this guy right here we
could also come in and throw in another
list item let's go in here like this
class is equal to and this is a list
item group
and group item could also go list group
item warning this would represent our
junk folder close off that list item and
then after those list items we have
there and our unordered list we could
also add a list of links so let's just
throw that in and this is going to have
the class equal to list item group just
like the other one or list group item we
call that add account we could also add
any HTML elements we'd like to our list
so there's that and guess what the class
is going to be again this group item but
just to show that we can put some more
random things inside air let's go and
throw in each for tag inside of here
class equal to and we'll put this as
list group item heading and let's say we
want to give them the option to click on
this guy to delete their account those
off the h4 tag and then we could also
throw a paragraph tag underneath of it
that's going to provide some information
on what happens if this is clicked on so
this group item and this is going to be
listed as text and we could say
something like a warning like the
account will be permanently deleted so
I'm just showing you all the different
things you can put inside of a list you
could also put buttons in your list you
put anything in your list I'm just
showing you how to set up all of them so
there you go there's a button and for
those you're going to go class equal to
list group item just like before and you
could do check for mail and then close
off that button and that's basically it
so let's go and save that reload it and
you can see right there I pretty much
knocked off the type of interface you
would see with an email client so you
could Harris Verizon email doesn't have
anything or it's disabled and it is
disabled there's Gmail that's how we set
up our badge this is our junk folder add
account that's a button we can click on
to add a new account delete account
that's the way we can delete it and
check for me on another button so there
you go guys that's pretty much all
little that you could ever want to know
about bootstrap and please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
