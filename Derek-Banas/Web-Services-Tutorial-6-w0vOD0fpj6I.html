6 of my web services tutorial originally
I didn't plan to make this video but I
thought what the heck so what I'm gonna
do is I'm actually going to completely
completely meaning go live with the
translation web service it's up right
now and I'm going to show it to you in a
second so I'm gonna build the whole
entire thing finish it completely 100
percent off and why don't we go and take
a look at exactly what it does okay so
what I did was I took an old defunct
sort of website that I used to have and
I installed the web service there now to
use it all you're gonna do is you're
gonna go to new Justin com translate it
dot PHP action and it actually does two
different things
if you want to be able to translate just
to one language in the action part we're
gonna type in translate right like that
and then here you can see English words
and let's say that I want to say I like
cats and I want this converted into
Chinese okay all of that is right there
hit enter and it's gonna pop back just
the Chinese characters for I like cats
alright so this is a transliteration
remember it's not a perfect translation
it's a one-for-one translation another
thing that it does that's pretty cool
is if I want to go and automatically
convert every language that I have for
my web service instead of translate I'm
gonna type in translations like this and
this is gonna be able to use with any
programming language that's what's great
about this web service you're just gonna
be able to call a URL and it's gonna pop
back the information and in this
situation I don't need Chinese here it's
not gonna hurt if it is there and if I
hit enter it's gonna pop back
translations and Arabic Chinese Danish
everything and this is in JSON format so
you'll be able to use this in multiple
different ways and I'm gonna be using it
in my android tutorial so now I'm gonna
go and show you exactly how I changed
the code from the last tutorial into
this one okay so previously we had a fob
called translate me dot PHP and this is
what we're gonna be changing we're gonna
make minor changes to translate test but
really that's not going to be needed
unless you were on localhost
so what I could do here just to check
that this works is I could
bounce over here and let's just copy
this right like that
and then we're gonna paste that in right
here where I have get file contents to
check that everything is working with
our web service and we could use encoded
words and language if we wanted but in
this situation I'm just gonna paste in
the whole URL that's gonna work
perfectly fine and that is all we're
going to have to do to test our web
service now if you want to use the
encoded words of course you just come in
there and put them in instead of I like
cats but this works fine so that's all
we're gonna do a translate test and
everything else is gonna be done in what
I'm now calling translate it dot PHP
just wanting to change it up a little
bit now basically what I'm gonna have to
do here since this does pretty much
everything I already want it to do is I
need to solve the issue in which it will
decode into multiple different languages
if you remember from the last tutorial
that only decoded to one different
language this time-warner decode to
multiple different languages so i'm
gonna create a new function I'm gonna
call this get all translations and I'm
gonna change this get action stuff down
here as well and what it is gonna do is
it's just gonna get the English words
sent to it as you saw and then it is
going to convert them into all the other
different translations so what would I
need here well I'm gonna be working with
these different languages so I'd like to
create myself an array that is going to
store all of those languages in order so
I'm going to have Arabic inside of here
Chinese Danish Dutch French German
Italian and I could add more languages
here and might just do that someday
Portuguese Russian and then finally
Spanish ok so we got that and that's
going to be used to basically go in and
get all those different translations I'm
also going to create a translations
array which is going to hold all of
those translations meaning either the
Arabic version 2 Chinese version the
Danish versions and all does and in this
situation that's gonna be built here in
a second so I'm just gonna define that
as an array then what I need to do is go
through all of these different things if
anything confuses you here it's probably
because you didn't watch the previous
tutorials because basically I'm just
using the tools I made in the last
tutorials the last two tutorial
and I am using those in a new way so
nothing that complicated here so it's
gonna cycle through our language array
which is this guy right here and it's
gonna pull in all those then women to be
able to do is call get translation which
is way up here get translation which is
going to convert the English words into
the IDS that they represent in the
English part of the database and then
it's going to call go into this guy
translate which is going to receive
matching IDs and as well as the language
to translate to and it's going to pass
back those finished translated words
okay
fanni thing doesn't make sense please
leave a comment below and I'll be happy
to explain anything so then what I'm
gonna do is take my translations all
right god we just created here and to
add a new value or a new translation to
this array we just type in the regular
brackets and equals and it automatically
does that and then I'm gonna go
translation and then I'm going to pass
in the language that's what's going on
here with this for each block and then
after that I'm also going to pass in the
English words and that's it it's gonna
get all those translations and store
those in the array so pretty good then
after that I need to create the JSON
part of this so I'm gonna go all
translations is equal to and then just
go in here put the JSON part and I'm
gonna call this translations like that :
inside of there and then our opening
bracket like we've talked about
previously when I talk about JSON there
and get rid of that extra stuff now I'm
going to create an index and set it for
0 because I'm gonna be cycling through
an array again and inside of another for
each block here I'm now going to cycle
through my language array that I just
created so the language array is going
to contain all of the translations for
each of the languages and then I'm just
gonna add those to all translations is
equal to all translations and then put
the rest of the JSON sort of tags inside
of here get rid of that don't need that
right now and then put the language
itself in there as
of the key for this and then the next
thing we're gonna do is put our quotes
inside of there and import one of this
tutorial series is where I describe JSON
so if that doesn't make sense and then I
can get the translations array and the
proper index for where each of those
translations is located and then close
off the JSON part and put a comma inside
of there and close this off and now of
course I'm going to have to get our
index and increment it and then after
we're all done with that what I can do
is go to all translations and trim off
the extra comma that this is gonna leave
whenever it gets to the last one and we
can do that with right trim and then
pass in all translations and then what
we want to trim off the end of it and
then I just put the final part on here
for the JSON part and that is a closing
bracket closing curly brace and a
semicolon and then finally what its
gonna do is return all translations okay
got that all set up well that brings us
down to this part remember we're gonna
have two different types of actions one
in which we convert from our English
words to a very specific language and
another one in which we convert to every
language so what I'm gonna do first off
I'm gonna change this to an echo so we
can echo out to screen our information
or whoever calls for this so there we go
got that solved and in this situation
I'm just gonna delete all of this and
then I'm gonna say if the action is set
well then I'm gonna use a switch
statement to decide which of these are
gonna be used and I can use get again
with this and I can just put the action
directly inside of there and then I'll
say case they passed in translate well
in that situation
I want to go translate to get that out
of there and I get that by asking for
what was the language that was set
inside of it and then again I want to
get the English words that they passed
over and they are going to be URL
encoded so I want to decode them and to
get them I'm just gonna call forget
again except in this situation I'm a
call for English words and then I'll get
my translated text
I'm gonna call get translation with this
because this is only gonna get one
translation so we can use what we
created in the last part of the tutorial
and with good translation I need to pass
in translate to what language we
translating to and then I also have to
pass into it the English words that we
want translated and since we already had
all that setup that's what we're gonna
do then we'll break out of this
otherwise if they typed in translations
like this well then we're going to get
our English words we of course are going
to URL decode them I can just copy this
right here I'm also going to create
something called translated text which
is going to be the final translated text
and then I can call the method or the
function that we just created the
beginning of this tutorial and all it
needs since it is going to translate
English words to every single possible
language it's going to just need English
words passed to it and we throw a break
in there if we'd like and that is it so
there is the completed web service okay
and now that you have all of your code
together you're gonna be able to upload
it to the website I'm just using GoDaddy
here everything's gonna be very similar
because I'm using PHP myadmin and most
hosting companies allow you to use that
basically you're just gonna pick your
MySQL version the name for your database
this was going to be the database name
as well as a user name put in a password
you can decide if you want to use a
read-only user or not if that's an
option for you it doesn't really matter
because we're not going to be using it
in this situation hit OK and then this
is going to be PHP myadmin you're gonna
enter in the username you just defined
as well as the password and then inside
of here this is what PHP myadmin looks
like what we're gonna do is go over here
to the left side to whatever your
database is named to click on that and
then before we do that of course we're
gonna have to go into the terminal or in
the command line or whatever you're
using and do a full dump of all of the
files in your language database if
that's what you called it and to do that
MySQL dump - you
whatever user name is - P and then
language is going to be the database and
then your over here you're gonna put
whatever you want the file to be saved
as and it's gonna save it in whatever
the current directory is and if you want
to know this is basically what that dump
file is gonna look like and then you
jump back over into PHP myadmin you go
and choose file and you pick the SQL
file that you just got that's your dump
file don't need to worry about anything
else here and this is under the import
tab of course and you come down here and
you're gonna click on go after you do
that you're gonna see that an import has
successfully finished if it didn't
something went wrong you can leave a
question below if you have an error or
something like that and then of course
you could go in and just come over here
on the left side and click on one of
these tables and it's going to show you
all of the different words in those
tables and that is basically it after
you have that all set up your whole
entire web service is gonna work and
it's gonna provide for a pretty nice
translator so please leave any questions
or comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
