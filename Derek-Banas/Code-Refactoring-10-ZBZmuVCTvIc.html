of my code refactoring tutorial today
I'm going to revisit a design pattern
that for some reason I received many
questions about and that is the Builder
design pattern and the reason why I
decided to do this not only because I
get questions about it all the time but
also I'm gonna show you in the next part
of the tutorial how to use the Builder
design pattern to design composites
which is what we talked about in code
refactoring part 9 so just to briefly go
over this the Builder design pattern
allows you to build complex objects in a
series of steps what you're gonna do is
you're gonna define an object class and
in this tutorial we're gonna talk about
the sandwich class then you're gonna
create an abstract class that's gonna
contain all of the methods that you want
each class of type sandwich to then
implement in their own way then you're
gonna have another class that's known as
the director and it's gonna be asked for
a specific type of sandwich
whenever it's asked for that it is then
going to initialize that sandwich object
and then provide it so that's enough
talking let's get into the code now all
of this code of course is available in a
link underneath the video and you should
take a look at it cuz 7li calm at it and
it will help you learn this stuff so
here is our sandwich class like I said
the Builder pattern is gonna allow me to
build complex objects in a series of
steps that is just what's gonna go on so
what we're gonna do here is define all
the different things we want our
sandwich to have so let's say private
string and every sandwich is gonna have
a specific type of bread and we're doing
to find a couple other things here this
is gonna be true for all of the
different type of sandwich objects you
want to build and let's say we also want
vegetables and let's also say we're
going to have a certain type of meat and
maybe a certain type of cheese and then
condiments then after that we're like
they're really gonna do much else with
this guy we're just gonna come in here
and create all of our getters and
setters so inside of Eclipse I'm just
gonna go to source and then I'm gonna
come down here to generate getters and
setters and I'm gonna say that I want
bread cheese meat and vegetables all of
those to be created and
I want them to show up after the
connivance and hit okay
and there we go now we have our basic
sandwich class defined and the only
thing I'm going to add to this which is
a pretty simple definition is the two
string method and it is gonna return all
of our information on to the screen so
just get bread get vegetables get me
good cheese and then get condiments so
that is all our sandwich class is gonna
do so now we're gonna jump over into
sandwich builder and build some more
things now the very first thing we're
gonna do is create our builder abstract
class like I said before it's gonna
define all the methods that each
sandwich object then must contain and
what all these methods do is completely
up to the subclass that is going to
extend this builder so that's why it is
flexible so we're just gonna call this
sandwich builder and it is going to
contain one of the objects that we are
going to be working with here and then
we're gonna go public sandwich provide a
way to get access to our sandwich of
course and it's just going to return
sandwich and then we're also going to
create a way to make a sandwich sandwich
is equal to new sandwich and then we're
going to define all of the different
classes that the subclass must create
but we don't really particularly care
how they do it so build bread build
vegetables build meat build cheese and
condiments and that is it that is going
to be our builder class then after that
is all set up we're now going to create
a very specific class of type builder so
it's gonna be BLT bacon lettuce tomato
sandwich and it's an extend sandwich
builder and then of course gonna tell me
all the methods that I need to implement
so just add on implemented methods and
there's a whole ton of them and then I'm
gonna come in here and just define
exactly how I am going to create these
and by doing that I'm gonna go sandwich
and this one's going to be set bread I
could have this do numerous different
things but in this situation that's what
I'm doing and I can say white bread and
then
for build vegetables this of course is
going to be set vegetables and let's say
that we want this to be lettuce and
tomato build meat is gonna be set meat
and that's gonna be bacon of course
build cheese it's gonna be set cheese
and I can have any methods you can
imagine fire in here of course and in
this situation I'm just gonna put
nothing and then build condiments this
is gonna be set condiments and here I'm
gonna put mayonnaise all right so that's
all set up so that is a very specific
type of builder the bacon lettuce tomato
builder of type sandwich builder and now
I need to create what is called the
director which is like I said before
gonna assign the type of sandwich to
build and then it's gonna call and
initialize all those methods that we
have up there so I'm gonna call this
sandwich artist and I'm gonna go private
and this is gonna contain a sandwich
builder and then I'm gonna have to
provide an option for setting the type
of sandwich builder let's I have a
sandwich we want to build and sandwich
builder is gonna be passed inside of
that and then we're just going to a sign
on here there we are and we're gonna
provide a way for them to get our
sandwich returned and then we're gonna
call sandwich builder get sandwich which
is going to return out for us and then
we want to provide a way to initialize
everything in the sandwich and I'm gonna
call this take sandwich order and then
we're just gonna call sandwich
the older whatever it is and we know all
these methods are going to exist inside
of this so we're gonna go make sandwich
and make sandwich up here is just going
to assign the type of sandwich just like
we have there and then we're gonna have
it initialize everything so we can just
come in here and go build bread build
vegetables build meat build cheese and
finally build condiments and that is all
set up and now we can test it with test
builder to make sure we set everything
up right so we're gonna call sandwich
artist which as you just saw is also
known as a director has all the methods
for assigning the sandwich to build
initializing it and then providing the
object
once we ask for it again and I'm gonna
call our sandwich artist Paul we're just
gonna get a new sandwich artist then we
want to designate the specific type of
sandwich object we want to build and as
you can think there are numerous
different types of sandwiches this thing
could make BLT builders what I'm going
to call it and it's new BLT the older
like that then I'm going to have Paul
assign a specific sandwich to build sosa
sandwich builder and then pass over the
LT builder inside of it like that that I
need to initialize everything and I'm
gonna do this by calling take sandwich
order like that then I need to provide
the specific sandwich object so I'm
gonna go sandwich the LT sandwich and go
Paul get sandwich and he will return my
sandwich to me and then if I want to
print out everything here to make sure
that everything went in and came out the
right way because I have to string in
there I can just call that and it will
print and there you go
white bread lettuce tomato bacon and
mayonnaise so there is another example
of the Builder pattern I provide a link
to yet another example just to make sure
you completely understand it because in
the next part of the tutorial we're
going to use builders to create
composites please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
