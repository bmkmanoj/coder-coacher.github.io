nutritionist but I lost 35 pounds in two
months and in this series of videos I
plan on trying to answer everything you
want to know about dieting I got on a
scale October the 20th it was shocked to
see that I weighed almost 250 pounds I
weight 248 pounds to be exact and I
decided I was ready to lose weight now
all the diet books I read were either
too vague or proposed I go on a diet
that was either very expensive time
consuming or just plain disgusting I had
lost weight in the past but I knew I did
it in very unhealthy ways so I decided
to look at how my diet and College
different from my current diet during my
years in college I decided I really
wanted to lose weight so I basically
just tried to eat almost nothing this is
not what you want to do by the way I'm
not sure that you understand the text
true I ate these foods almost every
single day and like I was saying I was
serious about losing weight but I was
disregarding health which now at the age
of 35 definitely much more aware of so
then we'll move on to the diet that
actually may be fact this is what I ate
basically and it's worst and during this
period of time I had a job that was very
physically active so I do not believe
that you can necessarily just exercise
bad health or bad food off of your body
many people thought I was healthy
mainly because I didn't eat beef or pork
but I did eat scrambled eggs and cheese
and so forth and so on as you can see
here even at my best I was eating
biscuits vegetarian sausages vegetarian
burgers so forth and so on and I thought
what was eating very healthy
this is the diet or the basic stats
behind my supposedly healthy diet at
that point in time I was eating on
average about two thousand five hundred
forty-four calories I was eating 32%
more calories than my body needed I was
eating forty six percent more fat than I
should I was eating three times the
recommended amount of sodium I was
eating three times the amount of
recommended cholesterol and nearly twice
the recommended amount of saturated
faculty and that was my average diet and
this is probably very similar to you and
actually from what I've seen I think
this is under the normal American
standards so what do I promise you if
you go on this diet I have gone on it
myself it's something that was built
surely from reading about products from
like 16 nutrition books like I said I've
done a nutritionist but I studied this
and I really truly believe this diet is
extremely healthy and I did lose the leg
actually it lost 13 pounds at this point
I'm sorry from what I the results I have
seen I definitely believe you can
continually lose weight on a consistent
basis you will eat food that tastes
better than what you're currently eating
you will be eating healthier that you've
ever had you will not have to exercise I
do not exercise you will be able to cook
all of the meals that I present in under
20 minutes you will spend less on food
per month you will never be hungry I
will detail everything in this series of
articles you will know exactly what to
do every step of the way you won't need
to buy vitamin supplements or anything
off of me
or anyone else at all this I'm going to
lay out everything that I can possibly
lay out so that I can help people like
myself so I don't have to read sixteen
books and you don't have to read sixteen
books what you must promise at this
point in time I do not believe you can
eat beef and pork and get a wet the
results that we're neighbors receive
with this diet you're going to give up
fried foods however I have very
the alternatives that taste like food
has been fry and you're going to give up
eating cake pie and sweets but again I
have healthy alternatives to most of the
cake spots and sweets the rest of this
series will explain exactly how many
calories you should eat in a day the
best foods to eat based on your goals
fiber per calorie low fat low
cholesterol low sodium high protein
vitamin A vitamin C there are thousands
of nutrient new trend charts on the side
of products and I have laid them out and
graded everything I'll tell you the 100
best foods and they will come with all
nutrient data and I'll give you a
specific meal plan along with recipes so
I hope you enjoy this and to take a look
at the next video in the series thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
