Swift video tutorial you guys requested
it and here it is in this one video I'm
going to pretty much teach everything
you want to know about the Swift
programming language we're going to be
covering data types math conditionals
arrays dictionaries tuples looping
functions closures structs classes
protocols extensions generics enums and
a whole bunch more and to help you get
to exactly whatever you want to learn
rather than watch the entire video in
the description underneath the video
you're going to find lists of every
single topic that I cover in this whole
tutorial and you can click on those and
jump directly there to learn whatever
you'd like to learn and I have a whole
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
I'm going to be using Xcode in this
tutorial I'm just going to skip this
part here and I'm going to come over
here to open our file and go file new
and go file this is going to open up and
I'm going to click on iOS and source and
playground and click on next now it's
going to ask me to create something we
can just call this my playground doesn't
really matter click on create and if it
says do you want to replace this yeah
I'll say replace and this is basically
what you should see on your screen of
course your fonts aren't going to be as
big as mine what I want to do also
however is this is the playground area
right here which is going to print out
everything on the screen I'm going to
instead use what they call the assistant
editor and you just go view assistant
editor and show assistant editor you can
see here you can put it on the right
bottom horizontal or vertical I'm going
to say I want it on the right and over
here is where all of the output for our
program is going to show over here on
the right side of the screen you can see
right here this is a basic one line
comment and I'm going to go through
everything and here is a multi-line
comment pretty simple pretty much like
every other programming language you may
have seen see here where it says UIKit
this is for developing iOS applications
and those are for the UI part of that
I'm also going to come in here and
import another library called Darwin and
this is going to contain a whole bunch
of C libraries that we're going to want
to use and basically right here what
we're doing is creating a variable now
you see here where it says var that
means that this is a variable value that
can be changed if we typed in let
instead that would be a constant little
bit strange but
the role and that's the way it goes now
your variable names must start with a
letter however they can contain most any
unicode character except for whitespace
mathematical symbols or arrows now if
you do not provide information in
regards to what exactly this is in this
situation it would be a string and
that's how we would define a string by
putting a colon and the datatype right
there and I'll go through all the other
different different data types but if
you didn't put that there Swift is going
to use type inference to guess the data
type based off of whatever data you were
going to be storing it so this would be
a string whether this was here or not
but I personally like to define the data
types for everything another thing
that's important to know is even though
remember we change this devar instead of
lat so that means we can change the
value here that doesn't however mean we
can go in here and then jump in and say
STR is equal to 1 that would be an
integer and you'll see over here it
gives errors and it says cannot assign
value of type int to a value of type
string say it knew it was a string so it
does use data types and will keep you
from entering certain data in there but
that's just the way it is all right so
let's create a constant just so we can
put this on the screen so I'll go pi is
equal to that's a constant and this is
not a constant if we would like to print
screen we could go print line like this
and then inside of here we could say pi
is equal to and then if we wanted to
insert the value of pi inside of there
we put a backslash and then we put
whatever the variables name is inside of
there and you can see over here in the
output window that is printing all that
out for us and of course we could also
come in here and specify the data type
so let's say we wanted to track the
number of steps that we had we would
just put a colon and uppercase int like
that is equal to and then we'll just put
450 in there just to put something in
and the different data types that are
going to be available for us are going
to be int which of course are going to
be integers doubles or floats which of
course are going to be floating-point
numbers or numbers with decimal places
strings of course which is just a whole
bunch of characters between quotes bull
which are going to be boolean and then
there's characters and a whole bunch
other different types that we'll also
get into here in a second now of course
like any other programming line
which there's going to be limits in
regards to the size that they're going
to be able to hold and we're an integer
that size would be equal to that
gigantic number right there however you
could actually store a bigger number
let's say that we would go max unsigned
if we throw out the sign part of our
variable and how we would get that that
maximum value is we would go you int 64
that's an unsigned 64 bit number and
then we could go you int 64 max like
that and that is how we would store that
also you may have noticed there's no
semicolons and Swift if we did this we
could then go print line and then we
could go max unsigned you only need to
backslash and all of that if you are
going to be printing out everything
inside of quotes and in that situation
you can see the maximum unsigned int
that we can use inside of Swift another
massive number you could also find the
maximum float value just by typing in
backslash and put that bracket there FL
T Max and make sure you close this off
and the maximum double changes the
double and then type in double max you
can see over here exactly the maximum
size is for the floats as well as the
doubles it's very important to know that
there are precision issues inside of
Swift just like everything else you're
basically going to have accuracy to six
digits so we could test that out if we
would go and create a float in this
situation say one point and then throw
in a whole bunch of nines or six nines
and then plus and zero point one two
three four five six and then a five at
the end there and then have it go in and
print the difference and you're going to
see right there that it actually
converts that to two so there are only
accuracy in regards to floats up to six
digits nothing more and you're going to
see that with doubles they are going to
be precise up to fifteen digits and we
can test that out by come over here and
looking at this you can see it also went
up to two however if we take out one of
these numbers you're going to see that
we have accuracy so for floats you're
going to have accuracy two six digits
and doubles you're going to have
precision up to fifteen digits in
regards to your floating-point numbers
or your decimals boolean which are
created with
b LOL are going to store either true or
false so we could create one is over 18
and we're going to assign a value of
true
there's your boolean your strings like i
saw before are going to store a whole
bunch of different types of characters
between quotes you're going to be able
to combine your strings or concatenate
them by just saying something like my
name is there's your quotes put a plus
sign in there and you can put my name
and just remember that whenever we use
let here that's strip in this string in
this situation is going to be immutable
which means that it cannot be changed
and you can see if i went in here and
got statement and then tried to add an
exclamation mark at the end of it right
like that we're going to get an error
however if I change that to var you're
going to see that that error went away
okay so now let's talk about casting
which is just converting from one data
type into another and in this situation
if we would want to cast a float into an
integer we could just type in int and
then our brackets and then whatever we
want to convert into an integer just
like that very simple if we then wanted
to come in here and convert an integer
into a float and just pay attention that
the intz and the floats are all
uppercase we would just come in here and
instead type in float and then of course
we'd have to put in some type of integer
value inside of there and yes indeed we
could also come in here and convert
different things into boolean and we
would just type in bull again and this
would convert the maximum integer into a
boolean and you can see over here
exactly how those work and pretty much
anything except for zero is going to
result for true in regards to boolean x'
if you'd like to turn a string into an
integer we go let my age now of course
it's going to have to already be a
number but we're defining this right now
as a string and if we would want to
convert it into an integer let me go to
my age int my age and then to int right
like that and now if you'd like to
convert a string into a float we could
just go my age float there you go my age
as NS string this is something you kind
of
have to remember and then follow that
with float value and that's pretty much
all you need to know about casting and
converting into different data types
let's take a look at the different math
functions that are available to us I
just went ahead and did these all ahead
of time and you can see here exactly we
can of course add subtract multiply
divide this however rather than being
called the modulus is known as the
remainder operator inside a swift and
the reason why is normally whenever you
would do five point three divided by
three with the modulus you'd get an
answer of two as a remainder in this
situation you actually get two point
three so that's just something to pay
attention to
along with these math functions there's
a whole bunch of different shorthand
notations that we can have here so let's
just create an integer now if we would
come in and go num plus plus which is
shorthand notation for add one to
whatever num is I'm going to see here
that you may get results that you're not
expecting
so we'll go num plus plus right like
this and if we type that in here see
Nome has a value of one however whenever
we come over here you see that it has a
value of one wait a minute I thought we
added one to it well the reason why it
shows up that way
is because whenever you put the plus
plus after or the plus plus after right
here what it's actually doing is getting
the current value of num putting that in
there which is one and then after it
leaves the print line statement it then
adds one to this and you're going to see
here if we put in plus plus and get rid
of this instead this does the absolute
opposite it first adds one to the value
and then prints it out to the screen and
that's the reason why it has a value of
three instead of one there's also
shorthand notations known as compound
assignments and you can see right there
all of those and all this is going to do
is it's going to take five and then add
it to whatever the current value of num
is and then save it back to the variable
num you can see or hear how all the
results work out here for you and of
course we're going to be able to do this
with plus minus multiplication division
as well as the remainder operator
there's a whole bunch of different math
functions that are available and that's
one of the only things I'm not going to
cover in this tutorial all the different
libraries because literally there's no
end to them but I think it would be very
important to come in here and talk a
little
about the random number generator if
you'd like to generate a random number
you're just going to come in here and
you're going to type in arc for random
right like this and then the maximum
number you want to generate between 0
and but not including this this
basically just means I want to generate
a random number between 0 and 10 see 1
less than whatever you put inside of
there and here you can see the random
number generator is 0 if we change that
you're going to see a new random numbers
generated and then we can change it back
and you're going to see that it
generates another random number now
let's take a look at conditionals now
the conditional operators that we have
available to us they're going to be
greater than less than greater than or
equal to less than or equal to equal to
and not equal to and the logical
operators we're going to have available
or and or and not now I'm going to go in
here and show you exactly how they work
and also take a look at ifs else's and
else ifs and all that stuff so let's
come in here and let's create a constant
for age making an integer and give it
the value of 13 we can then do some
different tests here so we could say if
age is less than 16 in this situation we
could say you can go to school and then
we're going to be able to do another
conditional statement saying else if and
yes we can use brackets if we'd like to
and let's use a logical operator as well
we'll say if age is greater than or
equal to 16 and which means the only way
this is going to come back as true is if
both these statements come back it's
true
age is less than 18 in that situation
we're going to say you can drive and
then of course as a final default value
or final default action we're going to
be able to come in here and say you can
vote and use the else statement so if it
goes through this condition in this
condition this condition is definitely
going to be handled right like that the
other logical operator I'd like to take
a look at is or so we could say if age
is less than 14 or this just means that
either one of these can be true and it
would come back as a positive reaction
and we could say something like you
shouldn't work something like that and
then finally we could take a look at
naught and how that works it's just
basically going to give you the opposite
of whatever you give it so in this
situation if we go not true then we can
just come in here you can see that that
comes back it's false and you can also
see the results of our other
if-then-else statements another thing
that we have available is what's called
the ternary operator which is basically
going to have a condition and then sign
a value based off of that condition so
willsez legal to vote and we'll create a
boolean and this can be anything it
doesn't have to be a boolean and we'll
say if age is greater than 18 then we're
going to put a question mark in and if
this condition right here comes back as
true we're going to assign a value of
true to this boolean called
is legal to vote otherwise we're going
to assign false right here and just like
I said this doesn't have to be a boolean
this could be an integer and you could
type in some other number here 12 18 it
doesn't matter it's just a way of using
the ternary operator and just the gist
of understanding of this is based off
this condition this value right here
this variable is going to either be
assigned this value if it's true or this
value if it's false and that brings us
to another way of testing conditionals
and that is going to be the switch
statement now the switch statement is
Swift unlike many other languages is
going to work with int doubles floats
boolean strings and a whole bunch of
other different things so let's just say
we have a program here that is going to
make suggestions based off of
ingredients that you have available so
let's just say we have pinto beans as
our ingredient we can then go switch and
then we're going to check the value of
this guy and then perform different
actions based off of whatever that value
could be so we could say if the value of
the ingredients is equal to pasta or
tomato put a colon right there in that
situation we could make the
recommendation of saying how about
spaghetti now by default
unlike most languages whenever you hit a
condition and that comes out as true and
you perform the actions here we are
normally in Swift going to leave the
entire switch statement in other
languages you would actually fall to the
next
case statement unless you put a break in
here switch doesn't work that way so
which works the opposite way inside of
Swift sorry about that so in this
situation if we would actually want to
check the other ingredients we would
have to type fall through right here so
what it would do in this situation with
fall through here is if we had case
potato this wouldn't actually happen but
what it's going to do here since fall
through is here even if ingredients had
a value of paste like this actually this
should be pasta even if this had a value
of pasta meaning ingredients since fall
through is here it's going to come down
and check to make sure that it also
doesn't equal potato and that's just as
the way that Swift works it decides that
it in most situations we're not going to
want to say in the switch statement in
situations in which we do we want to put
fall through right here otherwise it's
just going to leave as soon as it hits a
match and in a situation we could say
how about a baked potato and then
finally to match exactly the results
that we have here will say pinto beans
and we'll just say burrito and also
you're going to have a default option
with a switch statement and this is
what's going to be triggered if nothing
else hits and in this situation we're
going to say something like I don't know
so that's how switch statements work and
I might as well go in here and show you
another situation which we can use
switch statement switch statements are
pretty powerful inside of swift we could
use something else called a range what
I'm going to do here is just come in and
go let meaning this is going to be a
constant and we'll use a test score here
and we'll give it a value of 89 just to
put something in there now what we can
do is come in and go test score and we
could actually come in here and say case
let's say we wanted to track from 93 1 2
3 to 100 as a potential value for the
test score and in this situation we
could say we could then continue to go
85 1 2 3 and this would allow us to test
a range of potential values that we
would have here and of course all the
code that I have here is available in a
link in the description and we could
continue going on and on and on until we
got to a default value and in that
situation we'd say something like you
got it now you can see that it's pretty
powerful now let's take a look at a
raise now really the only
all you need to know about arrays is
whenever you are going to be storing
data inside of them they have to be of
the same type and we're going to be able
to make arrays of type int floats double
strings boolean z' as well as just
pretty much any type of object which
we'll get into here in a second we can
create an array in a couple different
ways we could go in here and say we want
to have an array of friends an array is
just a bunch of boxes that contain data
and each one of those boxes is going to
have a label or what is more commonly
known as as an index the first index or
the first value inside of an array is
going to have the index 0 and it's just
going to continue going 1 2 3 4 5 so if
you've seen other languages you know
exactly how that works and here we're
going to create a string array and then
we can go and place values inside of it
whenever we're initializing this so
let's just say we go Bob and that is how
easy it is to create that however we
could also have swift go in here and
automatically figure out the data type
for us and that will work in most
situations so we can go 3 6 &amp;amp; 9 and know
that that's going to create the proper
integer array like I said we're going to
be able to reference these different
values based off of using indexes so
we'll say R and num1 if we want to get
the first value that is stored inside of
our random array just go R and nomes and
the first value is going to have the
index of 0 you can see right here it
shows up and there's 3 and you can see
right there there is 3 we could also
come in and create empty arrays of
course you're going to want to start
those off with var because otherwise it
would basically just be worthless and in
that situation we're going to say that
we want to have a string array and then
put these two parentheses there and
there you go you just created an empty
array that can is going to hold strings
now that you have this empty array
you're going to want to add values to it
and you're going to want to do that with
a pend so let's say we want to come in
here and type in tomato and let's throw
a couple other different things in our
groceries array we could then find out
how many different items we have stored
inside of this iraq just go print line
and print line at what it does is it
basically prints out everything that is
in between the quotes and then puts a
new line at the end of it you could also
use print and that would
exactly the same thing except it would
not put a new line after it outputted
everything on the screen so there's that
also will say numb of groceries and then
if we wanted to get the number of
groceries we just go groceries dot count
and you can see number of groceries
comes back it's three we would then be
able to come in here and insert an item
at a specific instance or index but just
by just going groceries insert let's say
we wanted to put flour inside of here
and put it at index number one that's
going to do that it makes a lot of sense
to come in here and print groceries then
to see exactly how this is going to
change it and you can see right there
index one remember this is index zero
it's going to insert it at index one and
then it's going to move over rather than
deleting what was previously inside of
index one if we would want to replace an
item we would just go groceries and then
reference whatever the index is that we
wanted to replace so let's say we wanted
to be healthy and we want to eat whole
wheat rather than regular old flour we
could do that like that and you can see
flours been replaced with whole wheat
flour we could also come in and remove
an item groceries remove at index and
then let's type in zero here maybe we
decided that we no longer want to have
Tomatoes and you can see that that's
been moved and all the other different
parts have all been moved over to the
left we could also come in and remove an
item by its value so let's say we go if
let's match is equal to and we could say
that we want to find inside of the
groceries array the value of beans and
then whenever we find it I'm going to go
groceries remove at index and then get
our match and that is going to cut beans
out of our array you're going to be able
to sort the array pretty easily and neat
way is sort of so let go groceries is
equal to sorted and then you're going to
type in groceries like this if you want
to go from lowest to highest you go less
than otherwise you would do greater than
you can see sorted it potato or wheat
flour you get also in a very similar way
go groceries reverse to reverse every
single thing that's inside of the Iraq
and yes we can also create arrays inside
of arrays or multi-dimensional arrays we
can go
arrey let's say we want to put an array
inside of an array I only just go like
this instead of one brackets we're going
to put two inside of there and then we
could go in and assign the different
values so we're gonna have our one big
array and our array inside of arrays now
let's put it 0 0 so we'll be able to
maybe a little bit easier to be able to
see exactly what's inside or here and I
just went through those into strings
yeah change this from int to string to
make a string array just so that we keep
this being 0 0 and instead of just
switching into regular 0 and I'm setting
this up so that we basically see that
the first integer array or first string
array is first going to increment the
columns going down and then the second
one is going to increment the rows going
across and we'll be able to cycle
through these using a for loop we'll get
more into for loops here in a second but
basically what we're saying here is we
want to cycle through these columns in
an our array in our array which is the
name we have here for it as long as
columns exist and then we can say for
row in column we're going to cycle
through all of the columns or the rows
as long as they exist in our column then
we'll be able to go print line and then
of course output whatever the value is
for our row as well as the value for our
column and if we close that off you're
going to see that it went out and
printed all of that information out on
our screen that's a brief explanation of
exactly how rays work as we go on we're
going to be looking at them a little bit
more now let's look at something very
similar which is called a dictionary now
a dictionary is very similar to write
except it's going to hold key valued
pairs and the key is basically going to
be the same thing as the index with
arrays however instead of just be using
0 through 1 2 3 4 5 and so forth and so
on we're going to be able to use
integers double strings or even enums
which we're going to look at here in a
moment now let's create a dictionary and
we'll just go for superheroes and
camelcase is very commonly used whenever
we generate or define our variable names
then we're going to say what do we want
the datatype for our key to be as well
as the actual data that we're going to
be storing inside of here and that's how
we create a dictionary and then we can
come
and add-in values by just going
superheroes and then providing whatever
we want the key name to be I'm going to
make this Superman and then we can
assign whatever we want the value to be
right like that we can then check how
many heroes we have stored inside of our
dictionary using count just like we did
with arrays the superheroes
count and you can see the output there
just shows us one and we'll also be able
to come in here and remove items by just
referencing the dictionary by name again
remove value four and then type in
whatever the key name is for the thing
that we want to have deleted so there's
a rough overview of exactly how
dictionaries work now let's take a look
at tuples now two pools are normally
used when you want to be able to return
many values from a function all at once
you can store a whole bunch of different
values inside of a tuple and then return
it all at one time where you would
normally only be able to return one
value at a time and we're going to look
more in that and how we're going to
create a tuple is let's say I want to
have height I can define that at 65 and
weight let's define that as 179 and name
and let's assign this to my name there
you go just created a tuple we're going
to be able to go in here and get the
value just by referencing the tuples
name and then whatever type of data we
want to pull out and of course we could
do the same thing for weight and name so
that's just the basic gist of how a
tuple works and like I said I'm going to
give you more examples of tuples using
real-world experiments as we go on but I
have to cover a couple other different
things before I can get into those
examples and one of those things that is
very important are for loops
talked about them a second ago basically
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to create a value here that is going to
increase in value and it is eventually
going to throw us out of the for loop
what we're going to say is we want to
continue cycling or executing code as
long as I is less than or equal to 10
and then we're going to increment the
value of I let's think about what we
could do here let's say I just want to
print out a list of numbers and skip a
couple of them based off of a couple
different conditions well we could say
that we only want to be able to print
out even numbers
how would we do that well we could say
if and we could go boolean and convert I
and the remainder operator from to what
this is going to do is give me back a
value of zero whenever it's an even
number which means it's going to be
false so in that situation that's why
the boolean seer converting the 0 into a
false and it's going if false that's
what that means well then we're going to
say continue
what continue means is we want to skip
all the code that comes after this and
jump back up here increment the value of
I and then continue executing through
the code so that's going to effectively
allow us to skip odd numbers and not
show them now in a situation which this
is false that means it's going to
continue down here what we say now is if
the value is equal to 10 let's jump
completely out of the for loop and let's
do whatever comes after this curly
bracket down here how we do that is we
would say if I is equal to 10 well then
break and that's going to jump us out of
the for loop so continue is going to
jump us back up to the beginning of the
for loop and continue execution break is
going to jump us after this curly
bracket and that is the only way that
they really differ and otherwise it's
going to print out the data on our
screen and you can see that it printed
out two four six and eight and it didn't
pronounce ten because of this guy right
here now there is a whole bunch of
different types of for loops inside of
Swift also use what's called the for in
loop so we could say for J in and then
we could use a range so we could say the
range of values that J is going to have
or negative 5 the whole way through 5
and it's going to increment those by 1
each time and we can come in here and
print that out and you can see it
printed out negative 5 negative 4 the
whole way through to 5 could also come
in here let's throw in a quote and then
let's cycle through this quote and see
if we can match the total number of A's
in the quote so you could say var num of
A's like this and start it off with zero
and then cycle through single character
is going to be the temporary holding
cell each time it cycles through all of
the letters in quote and each time it
goes through there it's going to say hey
is the single character that you pulled
out of this string equal to a and this
is going to match only lowercase a is
not uppercase A's and in the situation
in
don't forget to put your curly bracket
inside of there very important and also
don't forget to close off your curly
bracket so in situations which we have a
match for na s we'll say a number of A's
and n shorthand notation and then after
the for loop we could put in our results
so you can see we can cycle through
ranges we can cycle through arrays we
can cycle through a whole bunch of
different things so let's will cycle
through arrays here in a second so a
number of A's of a is you can see the
total number of A's and that quote comes
out as six I was talking about cycling
through arrays let's come in here and
cycle through one so it's create an
array called people and this is an array
string she has the tutorial continues I
keep coming back to all the things that
I was skipping previously there we go
create our array when I cycle through it
will go for individual person and people
right and here we'll just keep it nice
and simple and print that on a little
screen and you see Bob Fred and Paul
bounced inside of there we can also
cycle through dictionaries so let's go
and let's do that
let's create a dictionary called heroes
is equal to and we'll have Superman
which is going to be the key and then
Clark Kent is going to be the value
we're going to separate these with
commas there we go we created a bunch of
dictionary values we can now cycle
through them with a for loop and we'll
have public name and then secret
identity in heroes we can get the keys
and the values and we're just going to
say Heroes is the dictionary that we
want to cycle through and then if we
want to print them out on the screen of
course we just use public name is and
our secret identity after that hey you
can see I made a little bit of an error
I need to come in here and get rid of
that comma put a colon in there instead
and you can see it's cycled through the
dictionary and printed out Batman is
Bruce Wayne flash is Barry Allen and
Superman is Clark Kent there's a whole
bunch of different ways we can use for
loops going to introduce a couple more
as the tutorial comes on let's jump into
while loops while loops very similar of
course to our for loop except we're
going to create our initialized value
that we're going to increment outside of
the while loop then we're going to say
that we want to continue cycling through
things as long as K is less than or
equal to ten
and we can just come in here and print
the value of K in that situation and
then you just need to increment inside
of your while loop and that's going to
cycle through and print 1 through 10 or
0 through 10 and then we also have the
do-while loop again the value you're
going to be incrementing you want to put
outside of it and the only difference
between the do-while loop and the while
loop is the do-while loop is going to do
everything that is inside of here at
least one time whether the condition is
true or not there we go we can increment
the value of L in that situation and the
reason why is it goes through that whole
entire list of code and then it checks
if L is less than or equal to 10 at the
very end of it and you can see that it
printed that out right there and you can
also see that no there is no semicolon
there but you could put it in there so
either way just depends on if you want
to use semicolons or not and that brings
us to functions now functions are going
to allow us to reuse code as well as
better organize our code so let's create
a couple simple functions let's create
one that just says say hello and what we
can do is say that we're going to be
receiving a string in this situation
which we're going to give the value of
name and that's the only attribute it's
going to be receiving and whenever it
gets that name sent over to it it's just
going to print out hello name so little
interaction if we want to call say hello
to have it do something on the screen we
just say say hello and you can see right
here if we don't pass the argument it is
going to give us an error however if we
put our little name inside of there it's
going to jump back and spit out Derrick
there on the screen now let's ratchet it
up and make more and more complicated
functions let's say we wanted to create
a function that's going to sum two
numbers let's call it get some again
we're going to type in whatever we want
the name for or the attribute that's
being sent in we're going to give it a
data type if we wanted to give it a
default value we could also do that by
just typing in equals to 1.so it's going
to have a value of 1 if nothing's passed
in int and then we'll also give this a
default value if we want to return a
value we're going to put a little dash
like that making it look like an
arrow and then we're going to type in
the data type that we're going to be
returning from our functions that's a
little bit odd and then to return a
value we just go num1 plus num2 and then
we could pass in two values inside of
here as the attributes but if you do
that without saying what variables they
should be assigned to you're going to
get in a little bit of an error here and
in that situation to correct that you
would say num 1 :
and num 2 : if you do that it's going to
add those up we're also going to be able
to use something called very attic
parameters which is what we're going to
use whenever you don't know how many
attributes could possibly be sent into a
function so we'll say function get some
- let's create a new one and we'll say
that we want to call this it's actually
going to be an array of integers we're
going to put dashes inside of there
because we don't know how my we're going
to get and then we're going to pass back
an integer after the sum has been
calculated now what we can do is go
variable sum create an integer start it
off with the value of 0 and then cycle
through this integer array so num is an
email of the integer alright and then
some like this use shorthand notation
and then after it's done with all that
we can say return sum and then we can
just come down here and go sum and
impasse in as many things as you want so
we'll go get some - and it doesn't
matter as me as you want it's
automatically going to calculate the
results of that it's also very useful
thing now let's go over how we can
affect values even outside of a function
so we're going to do that we're going to
create some strings here so make it
simple say something like happy and
string 2 is equal to sad now normally
whenever you pass a value inside of a
function and you change it you're
actually passing the value you're not
passing a reference to the actual
variable so any changes you make inside
of that function are not going to have
an effect on it however you can change
that quite easily so let's say we want
to have these be uppercase so to make
uppercase like this and then we're going
to go in out and that's going to allow
us to change the value both inside of
the function and then have it affect the
value outside of the function it's going
to get to a string value and in out
again string 2 there that is curly
brackets and then we can go to string 1
is equal to string 1 and
if you want to actually make a string
uppercase that's what you do
and then we string - same thing with
that then we'll be able to go make
uppercase exactly like this you can see
it automatically put that and symbol in
there which means it's passing a
reference and not a value and we'll just
go string one and string - you can
actually see that it worked right here
inside of this little playground area
there's no reason to print that out
we're also going to be able to come in
here and actually return multiple types
from a function and this is the tuple
thing that I was talking about before
we'll go get multiple and we'll go
number it's an int and it's going to be
returning x2 which is an integer also as
well as x3 which is also going to be an
integer so you can return multiple
values which is very useful so we'll go
variable x2 and we'll say whatever is
passed inside of this we're going to
just multiply that times 2 and then
we'll do the same thing for the x3
variable so if we'll multiply it times 3
and all you have to do after this is go
return and say that you want to return
both of them and this actually returns a
tuple we can go answer is equal to call
get multiple and then pass in whatever
number we want let's say we want 50 and
we'll be able to reference them by going
answer dot x2 right like this and we'll
be able to do the same thing with x3 and
like I said before what's actually being
passed back here is a tuple and they're
being stored in these two variable types
of the tuple and you can see 100-150
comes back another thing we can do
inside of Swift which is a little bit
weird if you don't quite get this just
don't worry about it continue and come
back to it you can actually return a
function so what we're going to do is
we're going to create two functions and
this is going to get numbers and it's
going to be just a series of integers
being passed inside of here so that is
the attribute and then it's going to
return a double everything simple here
don't worry yet so we're just creating a
function so we're going to say sum is
equal to zero just like before and then
to find this sum we're going to go numb
in ohms and cycle through that array and
then we're going to add the value of num
- whatever nums is or whatever sums is
and then after we're done we're going to
say return and we're going
cast some into being a double okay very
simple this is just a simple right we
haven't gotten to the complicated part
yet or the weird part so what we're
going to do here is we're going to be
able to call either average or some
based off of a condition so let's create
a some function here again it's going to
receive a series of integers don't know
how many it's going to return a double
actually the average in this situation
we're also going to come up here and go
double numbers count that's how we get
the total number of that and that's
going to return an average and this is
just going to return a simple sum now
the weird part where we're actually
returning a function is going to happen
right here to do this we're going to say
function do math and they're going to be
able to pass in a math option which is
going to be a string then based off of
that it's going to return the integers 1
2 3 like this that is going to be passed
into either the sum function or the
average function and then we have to say
finally what is going to be returned
from those functions which we know are
going to be doubles that's that guy
right there now what we can do is say if
math option like this whatever the
string is they passed in is equal to
average well in that situation we want
to return the average function which is
this guy up here that guy this is going
to be called in that situation else if
they enter anything else we're going to
return sum now we're going to call this
is by creating a variable called math
func like this and then we'll say do
math this guy right here and then pass
in average then after we do that we
could go print line in this situation
and go math function which is a
reference to that and then pass in how
many other different digits we want to
put inside of there it doesn't really
matter and make sure this is a lowercase
n and the same with this one
and whenever we do this being that we
say we want to use average for do math
and then call math function we're
actually going to be able to call
different functions depending upon
whether we type in average or nothing
and then pass values into them and have
them automatically jump to the right
function and perform the right
calculation it's like I said that's a
little bit weird but like I said I also
wanted to be able to cover mostly
everything here and that brings us to
inner fun
we're going to do here is return an
inner function that's going to receive
two integers and return a string so
we'll go function and like I said if you
don't quite get these these are a little
bit more advanced but I just wanted to
cover them so I'm going to call this
multiply it it's not going to receive
anything going to be passed in an
integer for our inner function which is
then going to return a string right like
this and here is our inner functions
just a function inside of a function and
we can say multiply it's going to
receive number one which is an integer
and num2 which is also an integer so
this integer integer that's what you see
here in the inner function that's how
you call an inner function and then it's
going to return a string which you can
see that also was defined above just
inside of brackets and then just have it
return a string which is going to be
whatever the number one that was passed
inside of here in the number two and
it's just perform our calculation right
here inside of here and then outside of
the inner function will say return
multiply right like this and then we can
get a reference to a function that we'll
be able to use to execute our inner
functions we'll go get value is equal to
multiply it which is the name of it put
those brackets inside of there and then
we'll be able to say get values and pass
in five and three or whatever you'd like
or get value and you can see five plus
three is equal to 15 that's not quite
right I put a plus inside of there there
you go
five plus three is equal to eight so
those are all the different weird ways
we can work with functions now let's
take a look at closures okay so now
let's talk about closures
now closures confuse people a lot but
they're just basically self-contained
code just like a function and the only
thing that is a little bit hard about
them is that they can be anonymous and
have no name where a function has to
Avenue and the basic layout of a closure
is basically what you see right here
you're going to have your parameter
types do like this and your return types
and then you're going to have the
keyword in you're going to have whatever
your code is the statements there and
you're going to have a return value now
let's create some closures let's create
a really simple one that's just going to
accept and then return an integer I'm
going to call this Bare Square this
going to receive an integer and
and it is going to return an integer I
have this equal to and then we're going
to say num in make sure you have the end
there and then on the next line we're
going to say return num times num so
pretty simplistic and you can see it's
going to be very easy for us to pass in
15 to that function and then over here
you can see the final result so that is
a very simple closure now we're just
going to ramp it up and get more and
more complex as we go on here but before
we do just want to point out something
remember previously we were able to
assign a function to a variable we're
also going to be able to come in here
and assign a closure to a variable in
exactly the same way there we go that is
assigning this closure right here over
to this variable so just like we did
with functions we can definitely do it
that way as well
let's create another closure here this
one's not going to receive any
attributes and it's not going to return
anything so I'm going to go for say
goodbye :
we're going to define that it receives
nothing and that it returns nothing
equal to theirs your brackets right
there and we could just have it just go
goodbye that's all it does is print out
goodbye on the screen and we could see
if we called it that it's going to
execute and say goodbye there it is we
could also have a closure that has no
attributes but does return something
so we'll say say happy again receives
nothing and it returns a string equal to
say something like happy birthday and
then call it from inside of print line
and you can see it says happy birthday
over here another thing we can do that
is kind of neat with a closure is we're
going to be able to reference variables
that are outside of it so let's create
one let's call this number 3 and give it
a value of 3 bar increment num is equal
to I'm not going to be able to do this
with a function but you can do it with a
closure and then just to prove that it
can be done we'll just go print line
number 3 and it will increment it on top
of that and then have that execute you
can see that it incremented it and it
also went and printed it out there on
the screen now let's do something a
little bit neater still let's create an
array and we'll call this numbers 2
square is equal to just throw a whole
bunch of random values inside of here
what we're going to do here is we're
actually going to be able to use an
array and a map method that comes with
an array and what it's going to do is
accept a closure that's going to perform
an action on every item inside of our
array and to do that we'll just go let
squared
nomes is equal to gnomes - square map
and that will allow us to cycle through
there
then we're going to put our closure
inside of here again it's going to
receive an integer and return a string
there's the end part and then we'll just
be able to come in and go numb times
numb and then we can call print line on
this guy and call squared gnomes see
what we're doing is just creating a
reference to that closure right there
and just make sure you put quotes around
this so that it is actually a string
that's being returned and you can see
that it prints that out there on the
screen there's a whole bunch of
different ways we can use closures now
let's take a look at Struck's which are
very similar to classes now basically a
struct is just a custom datatype and
they're mainly used when you don't have
the need to inherit like you would with
a class and they're also used whenever
you are wanting to model simple data
structures so let's say we create one
this isn't going to be that simple of a
struct I'm going to do something a
little bit interesting here I'm going to
create a struct called Runner and I'm
going to create a variable inside of it
called name which is going to hold a
string and then I'm going to create
another one called mile pace and it's a
double now something that's neat we can
do with Struck's
is we can actually put methods inside of
them so we have the mile pace of this
runner let's say that I wanted to be
able to generate the marathon pace for
the run and return a string from that
let's do something like get the absolute
value of pace I'm doing this just so you
can see some math functions so we're
going to convert self is a reference to
the runner itself and anytime you want
to reference an individual item or
instance of the struct so that we can
get the mile pace for this specific
runner we would use self you're going to
see more about self here in a second and
then go and get the % by doing the mile
pace - and then double our absolute pace
and then this is going to calculate
late the hours by multiplying that times
60 and then it is going to return
absolute paise minutes and seconds hey
this will make more suns here in a
second that bracket in there so let's go
and create some struck so that this
makes a little bit more sense here is
our runner there's the name this is the
mile pace that that runner runs a
marathon which will be four minutes and
then 68% of a minute and then there's
another runner that we created inside of
here so what we're going to do up here
if we wanted to calculate their total
marathon pace based off of their mile
pace and the marathon is we would get
this absolute value right here that's
how we're using int to convert to the
mile pace let's change that into pace
like that so that's going to cut off the
four and then to get the percentage part
we're going to go in here and get the
mile pace once again and then cut off
the four from it and then finally
multiply that time 60 to get our final
result and we'll just commit here and
call for that function to run and you
can see right here based off the data
that's passed in there that Dennis
cameto or however you pronounce that can
run a marathon in four minutes and forty
point eight seconds so that is the basic
way you can interact with the value
stored inside of a struct and also call
functions inside of the struct so now
let's take a look at something that's a
little bit particular to Swift which is
what we call computed properties now a
computed property is going to return
versus store a value so let's say we
wanted to go in here and get the
marathon time which is going to be a
double what we could do is then say get
and then put inside of here
whatever calculation we'd like to make
so we could say whatever the mile pace
is for this runner we're going to
multiply that times 26.2 and then divide
that by 60 to get our final marathon
time we could then come down here after
we went and call these other functions
and easily see that the marathon finish
for this specific runner would be 2.0
for 36 hours so that is what a computed
property looks like inside of a struct
and pretty much the only other thing we
could do here inside of a struct is
create a static constant let's say that
we also wanted to store marathon
distance inside of here just for the
heck of it
because we thought it made sense we
could do in there and type that in and
then that is going to allow us to
anytime call the struct specifically and
get marathon distance and print that out
if we'd like to do that or just work
with the marathon distance so he just
could go print line and then in this
situation we'd use the structure name
followed by marathon distance and you
can see that it prints that out for us
so that's pretty much everything you
need to know about strux so now let's go
and take a look at classes I'm going to
use a pretty simple class here I'm going
to call it animal because I use this all
the time and basically what we're doing
with classes is we are trying to model
real world things in computer
programming language so a real world
animal very well should have a name and
what you're going to want to do here is
give everything a default value whenever
you're defining it and you could store
anything inside of here let's go and
create a double that's going to also
have the animal's height give it 0.0 to
start off let's say that we also would
like to come in here and store the
weight for our animal and then let's
also say that our animal is going to
have a distinct sound now what you're
going to want to do is define a function
that is going to be called every single
time you create an animal object and
that is called init and let's say that
we get past a name for this and there's
a default and knit which can be called
if nothing's been passed inside of it of
course we need to define all the
different data types that we can be
passed inside of here like I said before
if you want to actually assign a value
to an object what we're gonna have to do
is use self because we don't know the
name of the object outside of here the
class gets created before any objects so
there's no way of knowing the name so
self is a nice easy way for us to be
able to refer to it it's going to store
this value for each object that we
create and I'm just going to come in and
do the same for all the other attributes
that our animal will have and there we
go and that's all we need to do to
initialize all of our animal objects now
of course every object is also going to
have things that it can do and let's say
that one of the things we want our
animal object to be able to do
is to be able to provide information
about itself maybe there's a tag on it
or something like that we'll just throw
in a print line here and you can see
that it's going to be able to get the
different attribute values just by
reusing self here again and why don't we
go inside of here and actually create an
animal object so we're going to say
Rover it's going to be the name of our
object and if you want to create an
animal object you start that off with
animal then you're going to jump through
here and actually put in all the
different values you want to assign to
it and there you go you just created an
animal object called Rover and we could
call the get info on this guy just that
easily and you're gonna see it prints
out Rover is 38 centimeters tall weighs
12 point 7 kilograms and likes to say
ruff see very simple let's throw a
couple other different things inside
here like I said you can have different
functions to represent all the different
things Rover can do like for example you
could have one that says make a sound
and it prints out the sound on the
screen and all those other different
things
I'm going to focus in here on how we can
overload methods as well let's say we
have a really smart animal that can
perform addition well overloading a
function is going to allow us to receive
different types of numbers even though
the function name is exactly the same
and it's going to just easily go and use
the correct function so this one's going
to receive two intz and return an INT
just like that number one plus number
two while this one it's going to have
exactly the same name so I'm just going
to copy it like this you see errors are
popping up and the reason why is this
guy is going to receive two doubles and
perform that calculation so this is what
overloading means we have two functions
with exactly the same names but they are
going to work with different attributes
here we're getting two ents here we're
getting two doubles and you can have as
many functions as you would like that
work this way you just have to make sure
that you have different types of
attributes being passed in by different
types I mean the data type has to be
different and you've already seen how to
pass in those values into those
functions so I just let you do that
there on your own dot operator of course
so now let's take a look at inheritance
so we went and we created our animal
object now all of these attributes in
here and all these functions inside
here let's say we wanted to create
another type or class such as dog that's
going to inherit from animal all we do
is put a colon an animal and just like
that now the dog has all the attributes
and all of the methods that we defined
inside of animal by default and dog is
going to be able to come in and either
override methods inside of animal or
create brand-new methods if you do not
want a function to be over I double buy
another class that might try to inherit
from this let's say we only want there
to ever be one way of digging holes we
just put final in front of it and in
this situation again if we want to
reference the name we just go self name
like that digs a hole and if we would
like to override a function that is in
the superclass or in the animal class
just type in override function and get
info let's just say we want to override
that function right there and there we
go
if we would still like the code to
execute inside of the superclass we can
actually call it by just saying super
and if we do that it's going to
automatically execute everything that is
inside of this function but indeed we
are overriding it so let's say that we
would also like to come in here and
print some additional information print
line and we could say something like and
dig holes that now is going to allow us
to come in here and create another
object this time it's going to be a dog
but it's also an animal because it has
everything that that had give this the
name of spot and let's just leave the
everything else be exactly the same and
we go wolf just to change that up a bit
we also inherited the init function from
the animal class so we're just going to
use that by default here and now we're
going to be able to come in here and
call get info on this and though that's
going to call the correct thing and also
call dickhole and you can see it printed
out all that information that was in the
animal class and then tacked on and dig
holes and then down here you can say
that it called the function that just
shows that spot can dig all the thing
that's kind of neat is we're going to be
able to pass any of these different
class types whether it's a dog or an
animal into a function and it's
automatically going to call the correct
function
execute so let's create a function let's
call it print get info and let's say
animal of animal type because the dog is
still of the animal type and then go
animal get info like this now we're
going to be able to do is call print get
info like that and pass in Rover and
then do exactly the same thing with spot
and know that it's going to
automatically print out the proper
version of get info here on the screen
even with the spot part having the
addition of dickholes you're going to be
able to set and get the different values
using a dot operator so let's go spot
name is equal to say spots name go
change the dog that's how easy it is to
change that and if I wanted to go in
here and check the overridden methods
that we have right here might as well
just do that there we go
you can see passing all that information
in there all I'm doing is adding on the
num2 so it knows exactly where this
value is sent and you can see there that
it performed those different
calculations based off of different
numbers going in there automatically and
like I said before this is just a test
or overridden methods another thing you
might want to do whenever you are
working with classes because they're
very similar to most other languages
let's say that you wanted to come in
here and check the class type so let's
say we want to say is spot a dog all you
need to do is just go spot is animal
right like that it's automatically gonna
plop back true and of course you could
use that in a conditional and you could
also come in and check is spot a dog and
that also comes back as true so spot is
both an animal as well as a dog if
however you would go in and type in
Rover you're going to get an answer a
false because it doesn't work the other
way the dog is the animal but the animal
is not necessarily a dog and that brings
us to protocols now protocols are
basically like interfaces in other
languages and basically whenever you are
saying you want to adopt a protocol what
you're saying is you agree to define the
behavior that is described therein so
let's create a protocol here's a
protocol and we're going to call this
protocol flyable say we're going to
create a class it's going to be a
vehicle and we're going to define if it
can fly or not basically now you saw
previously whenever we were
creating attributes inside of our class
that it automatically allowed us to use
the dot operator to set as well as get
the value from whatever was set inside
of there let's create one now called
flies it's going to be a boolean if you
want to get errs and setters by default
they're created but if you wanted the
getters and setters to be generated you
could just go get and set inside of
curly brackets if you didn't want the
get to be available you just put set and
otherwise you could type in get and get
rid of the set and that's just a way of
encapsulating or blocking different
values from being settle for your
variable types to protect them and with
the protocol you're basically going to
define the variables that you want set
inside of here but you're not going to
initialize or give them a value and that
is inside of protocols and you're going
to do the same thing with all the
functions you create you're going to
define exactly what is going to be
passed inside as well as what is going
to be returned but you're not going to
define anything that it does those
initializations of these this variable
right here and this method or function
right here are going to be set in the
class that you create so now let's
create a class that's going to inherit
from this protocol let's just call it
class vehicle if you want to inherit
from the flyable protocol we just
created just type in flyable if you have
multiple protocols you can just put a
comma inside of there and keep adding
them but you only have one here so
that's all we're going to have and now
what we're going to say is this actually
going to give you an error if you don't
define this attribute and this function
so we need to come in here and do that
so we're going to create flies and it's
going to be a boolean now it's going to
have a default value of false here we're
going to set all these guys and let's
give it a name also string give it a
fault value of no name and then we also
have to come in and create the function
for fly and it's going to receive a
distance in miles that it wants it to
fly and it's going to return a string
and what we're going to do here is going
to say if self flies like that then
we're going to return the name for this
object this vehicle object and we'll say
flies distance in miles and input miles
after otherwise we know that it
can't fly and in that situation we're
going to say that it can't fly so self
by name
can't fly let's come down here and
create some vehicles and test out the
protocol see exactly how that works is
equal to let's create a vehicle it's
just that simple if we don't have any
initializations we want to do just do
that we can then go forward f-150 and
set its name this is not a Ford f-150
commercial and then we can set if this
Ford is going to fly just by going flies
equal to false like I said it has the
setters and getters already defined
inside of there and then we can say hey
we want this car to fly 10 miles tell me
what you think about that and it's going
to spit back that it can't fly so
there's an example of how we can use
protocols inside a swift now let's go
and take a look at extensions ok so now
let's talk about extensions now
extensions are really cool because they
have provide a way for us to add
functionality without overriding
existing functionality and this can be
applied to our own objects as well as
even in double strings arrays anything
so this is really neat so why don't we
come in here and create an extension
there you go just create it one and then
you're going to type in exactly what you
want to override and let's say that I
want to output a string as an array so
I'm going to create as array J like this
and it's going to pop out a bunch of
characters then we're going to put a
curly bracket and then just define
everything so I'm going to go get our
result equal to and it's going to be
character array and create that guy
there we are created a character array
and now I just need to cycle through the
string and store each character in on
our race so I'm going to go for
character in self self being a reference
to the string and then I can just append
all of the characters from our string
onto that and then return our result
when it's finished and that's all I need
to type so now I can come in here and
create a just a whole bunch of
characters and then just type in as
array because this is a string and this
is a call to this extension right here
and then I
and print it out on the screen and you
can see that easily it took that string
and converted it into an array and we
print it out on the screen
we could also come in here and add
additional functions so we could do our
letter occurrence type of thing so
letter occurrence to test how often a
character appears so we'll go the
character character and it's going to
return an int which is going to
represent the number of characters that
match num of characters and start off
with zero and then just cycle through
all these so get the individual letter
in self which is going to be the string
again reference to the string if letter
is equal to the character that I'm
supposed to be searching for home I'm
going to go numb of characters and then
after it searches through all of them I
can just return the number of characters
then we come out of here we can do
number of A's again which is an int
equal to a random string just like this
and then we can call that method just
like we did previously and the character
we want to search for is lowercase a
number of A's and there you can say
number of A's comes back as two so
there's two examples of how we can use
extensions why don't we go and take a
look at something I get asked about all
the time which are called generics now
basically a generics going to allow us
to avoid repetitive code that's mainly
going to exist because of type
requirements
so let's come in here and create print
elements random string receives a string
and then we have our function now
basically in this situation all we're
trying to do here is come through and
print out each of the elements in this
string and separate them with commas
that's what the goal is but the problem
here is if we ever want to print
anything other than strings we're going
to have to create a whole bunch of these
guys and that's going to be a major pain
so let's go in here and make a couple
changes using generics to show how we
can use generics to avoid this type sort
of issue that we have here so let's
start off first off and I'm going to say
print any array and now I'm going to put
a t inside of here and the T is going to
indicate that
is a generic function that's going to
accept an array of pretty much anything
now so we're no longer going to be tied
to our strings so we could just put
anything in here I mean doesn't matter
what the name of that is and now we know
we'll be able to accept any type of
array and be able to cycle through it
and work with it it just changes to
anything and then we could just go print
any array and then pass in anything into
it so we can say Paul so we're going to
be able to work with string arrays or we
could go print printing array and we
could pass in integer arrays anything
and we know that whenever we pass in an
array with this generic using this guy
right here we're going to be able to
accept any type of array and we're going
to be able to cycle through all those
elements and put commas between them the
only problem is is this is going to work
for a raise but it's not necessarily
going to work for anything else
so let's come in here for example just
see what happens random put that in
there uh-oh say now we have problems so
now what we want to do is we want to
make this work so with sequences
anything that's a sequence of anything
so it's going to work with both arrays
as well as strings which are just a
sequence of characters how can we do
that well we'll say print any just
change the sequence just to
differentiate this a little bit leave
this as T but we're going to also come
in and go sequence type right like that
and leave this as anything and it's
anything so we no longer are going to be
tied to the array part and now if we
come down here and type in print any
sequence instead you can see it works
for both the array but let's go print
any sequence a random string and we're
going to see that it also is going to
work for Strings
so we're going to be able to use any
sequence of anything get all the
individual elements and separate them
with commas so pretty cool another thing
we can do however is also test equality
and equitable is going to be able to
provide us that functionality so we'll
go are equal and it
and T we equitable like this and we're
going to be able to get to different
values and test equality so we go volume
one to two doesn't matter what the type
is and boolean and then we could just
come in and go return one valve to let
me go are they equal and we wouldn't be
able to do and do something like 1 plus
or 1 and B to test equality there
because these T values are exactly the
same
however we could come in and test
equality between letters which is very
useful and you can see that comes back
it's false but then we could also come
in here and throw in numbers and that's
automatically going to work so we're
basically going to be able to taste test
equality for any data type as long as
they are the same data type and it's
going to work which is really cool
another thing we could do is do
comparables which are very similar to
equitable we'll say compare them T and
then we'll say comparable here instead
and it's going to receive two values
let's just go and steal this whole
entire thing up here throw that in ER
and now we'll be able to go return and
let's say we want to check if value 1 is
less than value 2 copy that
throw that in there change just to
compare them and it's going to come back
as false and we'd also be able to throw
in a string so let's go a strings
characters whatever and you see that
comes back as true so there's generics
and a bunch of ways and some really
awesome things we can do with them now
let's take a look at enumerator types or
in ohms or whatever you want to call
them and basically enums are going to
provide us with a way to structure
related values and they're going to be
very useful whenever you're going to be
working with a limited number of options
basically and the one thing that is done
differently with Swift is that Swift in
ohms are not integer based like other
languages and they can actually store
multiple different data types and to use
those different data types you're just
basically going to need to map an enum
to whatever value what you want it to be
associated with so let's create an enum
so you know say we create a color you
know and this time I'm actually going to
be boring and just keep this as an
integer then what you do to define all
the different parts you just go case
blue case whatever green
and you could come in here and assign
the own your own values if you wanted
just by putting an equal to one or
whatever it's going to start off as zero
I'm just set up whatever just a bunch of
random colors we could also come in here
something else that's different than
many other languages you can initialize
so let's say that you want whatever an
enum is created if you want to give it
the default of blue that's what you
would do right there
you could also come in and create
functions inside of it so let's say we
want to create a function that's going
to return the value so a function get
data like that and it's going to return
a string there we go and in this
situation we could say something like
switch and in case self self is a
reference to the enumerated type that
we're working with here say something
like case blue on that situation we want
to return the string of blue we do the
same for green red purple and yellow and
the fault in this situation if they
don't match is going to come back as not
found that's never going to happen
because remember we initialized it to
blue unless they you know created an nil
value but whatever pretty the way after
we created all that we could then come
in and go variable some color is equal
to and just call color which is the
enumerated types name and to check that
our initialization worked we could go
some color we could get that value to go
raw value ah see that zero comes back Y
to zero come back well because of this
this is zero one two three four we can
come in and go one and it's going to
change the one and whatever but that's
going to get you the value that's
associated with that you could also come
in and find favorite color and reference
purple for example directly like that
and pretty much do the same exact thing
here let's go print line and let's put
favorite color inside of there and get
the raw value for that which is going to
come back as four we're also going to be
able to go and reference them in
different ways so we could say if every
color test for equality so color is
purple and then we could say it's purple
however his purple is going to show up
there see it's purple and then finally
finish off everything we go print line
and get
favorite color and also go get data like
that and it's going to be able to call
that custom function inside of the
numerated type and print off purple so
there you go guys
that is a ton about Swift with a special
emphasis on a lot of the more
complicated things that seem to confuse
people about Swift please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
