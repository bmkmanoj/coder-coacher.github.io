17 of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm going to continue
showing you how to perform queries
inside of MySQL and definitely if you
haven't seen the other tutorials check
those out what I'm gonna do here is I
actually have a database that is by no
means optimized but it is absolutely
full of strange data and information so
I'm going to query a lot of the
information in it just because it is
absolutely full of information it's over
I don't know tens of thousands of
records okay so what I did here as I'm
showing you all the tables inside of
this database called ham DB and let's
say that I want to specifically see some
more information on this manufacturer ID
record we have here and you can see here
it's made up of a primary key and then
information specifically on
manufacturers now I'm just gonna scroll
up here let's say you wanted to see
everything available you would use the
Select command followed by a star which
can represent everything and if we just
type that in it's gonna show us
everything that is currently in the
record called manufacturer ID and you
can see there's two hundred eighty four
rows there's a lot of information and it
is not alphabetized it's just sort of
thrown in there like I said it's not an
optimized perfect little table let's say
I just want to pull in the information
stored in a column titled manufacturer
if we scroll up here see at the very top
this is the column called manufacturer
if I just wanted to pull information
from it specifically I would type in
select you.thank sure from man ID which
is the name of the table so this right
here is the column and this right here
is the record name if I click on that
it's just gonna show you the
manufacturers names like I said before
this is an alphabetized it's very easy
to have put eyes in it I'm just typing
in exactly the same thing that I typed
in before whoever I'm gonna type in
order by manufacturer which is the name
of the column and it's all I did order
by manufacturer enter and now you can
see that this information is
alphabetized and if I'd want to put this
information in descending order or
reverse alphabetical order just put in
order by again Mac
manufacturer descending boom and you can
see here that now all that information
shot out here on the screen in
descending order and if I wanted to
specifically I'm going to show you here
again I'm going to do for the rest of
this tutorial everything that is an
actual SQL command is going to be
uppercase letters so that you'll be able
to differentiate from those things that
are commands and those things that are
columns or tables somewhere and here I'm
gonna put a stipulation in that man ID
is equal to five and if I put that
stipulation you can see the man ID comes
up here
as five manufacturer and then the
manufacturer associated with that ID all
brought up here and you have to
understand these basics to be able to do
even more complicated things with SQL
it's really simple I mean you're
basically saying you you want specific
information in a very logical way and it
is providing it to you where man ID is
between five and ten what this is gonna
do is just show me all the information
in regards to the manufacturer's name
and the manufacturer's ID if the
manufacturer's ID lies between the
number five and ten just like that and
you can see that it pulled up exactly
what you would think that it would pull
up of course you can change any of these
other different things that are
available here to you and I'm just gonna
copy this paste it down here and again
I'm gonna search for anything in which
the man ID is equal to two or here's
another command man ID is equal to ten
and you could continue doing these or
statements over and over and over and
over again
and you can see it brought up the
manufacturer associated with the
identification number two as well as ten
so that's just a way that you can
combine multiple different commands
inside of SQL and of course if we come
in here we could also say I mean factor
ID is greater than or equal to 280 and
it's gonna show all those manufacturers
IDs that meet those restrictions and I
could also say manufacturer's ID that
are greater than or equal to 100 and
manufacturer's ID that are less than or
equal to 110 and you can see that's
another
way to pull up all those manufacturers
ids and manufacturer names that are
associated between the numbers 100 and
110 you can also perform different
searches again I'm just keep putting
down the same information here over and
over again based off of whether the data
is like and like is another way to
search so let's say that I want to look
for any manufacturer names that are like
again like is another term data and then
whenever we put in this % what we're
saying is we want returned all the
manufacturers that begin with the
letters da ta and any number of other
letters they're after that's what the %
stands for in this situation and you can
see that it did just that it brought
back every one that equaled data
followed by anything else remember
that's what the percent signs they're
for and you could also represent
individual characters with an underscore
inside of the light command just like
that so let's say that I wanted to
return this same information here except
I only want to return data followed by
five individual characters how would I
do that it's actually quite simple come
in here I'm gonna copy this scroll up
paste it down and then I could say like
and then come in here and put one two
three four five underscores inside of
there and you could see it's only gonna
return information if it starts off with
data followed by five letters there's
another different way and I could also
come in here and go select for
manufacturer ID which again remember E
is the table and this manufacturer is
the column if the information is one of
the following or we're using the in
command but you could say if it is
either Alden or ad master okay so it's
gonna return anything if that value
equals Alden or AD master and you can
put multiple other different things in
here as well and you can see that it
returned to ad master in Alden and I
could also come in here and again do
this actually I'm gonna scroll up paste
this in here and show you another way to
use the like you don't have to just put
the percent sign at the end you could
also put it at the very beginning and
since this database contains a lot of
Technology company it's common for
technology companies to end with a
letter and I
see s so let's put an in there and what
this is gonna do is gonna return all
manufacturers names that end with an ICS
and you can see that it just did that
for me so there's another way to work
with them now I'm gonna work with
another totally different table inside
of this database called model numbers
and here it is it's a lot more
complicated than you saw previously and
show you another thing you can do yeah
what I'm gonna do now is I'm actually
gonna play around with the model numbers
and I'm gonna perform regular expression
tests on those model numbers so here's
the model number it's a carrot series of
characters 30 in length so let's scroll
up so it'll be easier for you to see it
so I'm gonna say I want to select
descriptions from the table called model
numbers where the description if you
haven't seen my regular expression
tutorial you should definitely check
that out otherwise this might not make
sense to you what I'm doing here is I'm
gonna select from the column name
description and the table called model
numbers where the description is going
to match this regular expression that
I'm going to define and what I'm gonna
say here is what I'm looking for is
gonna start off with the carrot symbol
the carrot symbol represents the
beginning of the string of information
and then it's going to be followed by
any number of series of characters and
then it's going to be preceded by that
by either 8.5 or 11 close up racquet off
and it's going to match again for any
one or more of any of those characters
that I have right here either 8.5 or 11
it's then gonna be phoned by any number
of characters and then it's going to be
followed by u ni v r SI l don't know why
they use that abbreviation of just one
letter but they did and you can see that
it brought that information back to me
and if i scroll up here again to explain
this carrot represents the beginning of
the string okay so that would be this
space right here before the B before all
these B's this represents any number of
characters this represents a character
this represents any number of characters
so this in essence says any number of
characters whenever you put brackets
around something
like I did right here what it's saying
is I'm looking for the string to then
have eight point five or the number
eleven to be followed and you can see it
fits those constraints every single time
and by putting this plus on time in here
we're saying that we expect to match for
one or more of any of the characters
that precede it which would be these
guys then we were going to be followed
by any number of characters just like I
explained here and then we're going to
be followed by this very specific string
and you can see there is that very
specific string and then this guy's
going to end
all right now if I scroll this up I'm
gonna give you a couple other examples
here so again select from the row called
description from the table called model
numbers where description the column and
then we want to do a regular expression
test here and this time we're going to
look specifically for a string that
begins with between again there's the
period it represents any single
character except for newline actually
and we expect to have one two three
whenever you use these curly braces
right here what we're saying here is we
expect that there's one two three
characters are gonna start off the
string and then those one two three
characters are gonna be preceded by an
eight meaning two potential AIDS again
that's what you're doing there with the
curly braces if you only put one in it's
gonna look specifically for 88 is what
this it right here is looking for I
could type in 88 but what have you I'm
trying to explain this then any number
of characters and then by putting a
dollar sign here we're saying that we
expect this string that we're looking
for two and dollar sign just like the
carrot represents the beginning of a
string the dollar sign represents the
end of the string and if we hit enter
you can see that it brought back that
information right there remember we were
looking for one two three characters
followed by two eights followed by any
number of other different characters
followed by nothing being the end of the
line let's say I copy that in there and
let's say that I want the word
description to show up in the results
instead of what we had before if you
want a different word to show up than
the actual name of the column what you
need to do
come in here and after the column name
what it's really named in the table you
want to put in the command as and then
type in what you want it to be called so
if I want the word description to
actually show up instead of the
abbreviated to scrip in the output that
comes out on the screen well I would
just do this and if we scroll up you can
see now description is in there instead
of the script this is called an alias
and this is another little trick you
could perform with commands inside of
minus QL and these are specifically SQL
commands if you're not quite getting it
don't worry after a gazillion tutorials
you will totally get it and just to
review all right so if we have our
regular expressions we're defining star
is going to represent zero or more and
in this situation if we put a dot which
represents any single character this is
gonna match zero or more of whatever
precedes it which is the symbol any
single character so this in essence
means match for any single character we
put a plus sign behind it that means one
or more of any single character and if
we put a question mark after this that's
gonna match for zero or one of anything
that precedes it again you're probably
better off watching my regular
expression tutorial if you're confused
by this at all and for further review if
you wanted to match for the result of
eight point five or eleven you would put
that little pipe in there and that would
do just that and if you want it to match
for the number eighty-eight you could
either put 88 in there or you could put
eight followed by two inside of these
curly braces if you wanted to match for
two or more eights you would just put
the two being the minimum and then
nothing or if you wanted to match or two
to four eights you would do just that
right there beside your regular
expression or if you wanted to match up
to a maximum number of eight this would
actually match for the number eight the
whole way up to 8888 and now i'm
actually gonna come in here show you
another table let's look at the
manufacturer identification table that
we have inside of this database it's a
little bit more simplistic and again and
if you want to see everything from this
table right here peace
all the different results now let's say
I'm gonna do it another regular
expression example so let's say I want
to select everything from the column
name manufacturer from the table called
manufacturer ID where the manufacturer
column fits this regular expression
which is going to be that this match is
going to start and then is not this is
one other regular expression I didn't
teach you if you put anything inside of
brackets starting off with a carrot the
carrot stands for not when it's inside
of brackets so what this is specifically
saying is I'm looking for a string of
characters or a result that does not
contain the letter A so it's going to
shoot out regular expressions and the
star is going to say one or more
characters that are not the letter A and
then we're gonna say end of string butch
quote now hit enter and you can look at
the results here and you can see that
none of these results contain the
character hey so that is specifically
how you would do that little guy right
there and just a copy this guy right
here and print him back out here on the
screen let's say that I wanted to get
results that did not contain the letters
a or E you just do just that and you can
see that the list is longer because now
we're restricting the manufacturers
names from the letters a or E and now
I'm going to actually come in here and
say that I don't want any of these
manufacturers to have an AE or an i
inside of them put my star symbol in
there and that bring this in here yeah
and just to make sure that you get it
order by and you factor right like that
and you can see that none of these
contain a ease or eyes and let's say
also that you would only want as the
final example here are the first five of
these to show up that's easy enough come
in here E I close that off what you do
is just type in limit five right at the
end there it's only gonna show you the
first five results and then let's say
that we want to limit our results let's
just say we're looking for results that
don't contain a letter A and we want a
limit to just the fifth result through
the tenth result just like that and you
can see that it did just that so there's
a whole bunch of different ways to use
my SQL statements inside of MySQL and
again we're gonna be using these in PHP
