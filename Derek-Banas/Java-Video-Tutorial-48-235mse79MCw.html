my Java video tutorial series today I'm
going to show you how to do something
really cool today we're going to make a
paint application using Java we're going
to be able to come in here and change
the different colors for any of these
rectangles that we draw on eventually
we're going to get into brushes and
lines and ellipses and all this other
cool stuff so let's get into the code
alright so I'm just going to jump right
into it because I got a lot to do here
and all of the code here and pictures
and everything else is available in a
link underneath of the video so go get
it and play around with us because this
is a fun project for once so I'm just
getting swing in here because of course
I need swing and I'm also going to get
my events as I'm going to be handling a
lot of events I'm going to be doing a
lot of things that I've gone over in the
past parts of the tutorial of course
it's going to need Java aunt and we're
also going to be needing Java
Jama tree because we're going to be
drawing shapes and also we're going to
be revisiting array lists because I've
had a lot of questions about that and of
course I'm gonna need the utility
library if I wanted to handle that guy
so public class Java lesson 48 and then
I'm going to extend the jframe just like
I did in the last part of the tutorial
and I'm covering countless numbers of
things that I've done in past tutorials
so this should be a fun one so I'm going
to have a brush button and I have a line
button ellipse button rectangle but and
that's all the things that you saw at
the bottom of the screen there I'm not
going to bounce back and forth between
that and this because if you want to see
that thing just go download and play
with it then I'm going to create an
integer and it's gonna help me monitor
which type of shape that I'm going to be
drawing and I'm just getting a default
value of one at this point and then I'm
going to come in here and go and define
my default stroke colors and to define
the color just call color and black just
like we did in last tutorial if you
didn't see that you might want to watch
it because I go over all this shape
stuff but it's nowhere near as exciting
it's this tutorial some default and
everything is black and of course
everything has to be in uppercase
letters here and there you go and then
I'm gonna come in here public static
void main string just like we did a
hundred times and create a new lesson 48
object here now we'll do some fun stuff
okay so public it's Java lesson 4
38 in here create my constructor then
I'm going to define all my defaults for
my jframe so I'm going to set my size
equal to 500 by 500 this can be anything
you want it to be set my default title
and you could make this into a
full-blown paint application I'm going
to show you it pretty much everything
you need to know to do it and go out
there and make the next Photoshop pull
clothes operation jframe exit on clothes
it's just going to close everything
after I'm done with the application then
I'm going to create my J panel and this
is going to be the button panel and hold
all those buttons you saw on the bottom
of the screen then I'm going to create a
box or a box layout which I've covered
in past swing tutorials you have any
questions just leave a comment below
I've pretty much covered everything in
one tutorial or another so I'm more than
happy to do that and that's just going
to create a horizontal box so I can lay
on the buttons into it and then I have
to go and get all my buttons let's just
scroll up here and save himself a ton a
time paste that there and I'm going to
be calling a method that I'm going to be
making here in a second so it's going to
be called make me buttons and all I need
to do to make a button is pass the name
for the image file and then one is going
to represent the type of shape that's
going to be drawn and one is going to be
based off of current action so that's
all I'm going to be monitoring all that
stuff and I'm gonna need four of those
and this is going to be line button this
is going to be a lips button and this is
going to be rectangle but which you
already saw what that does then I just
need to change these image files and
these are the icons that are going to
show up on top of the button that's it
nothing that fancy I guess it is kind of
fancy because I've never done it before
but that's how it works if you ever
wondered how to put an image on top of a
button in swing now you're going to know
and there we are
so there's all those guys well then I'm
going to have another different type of
button method again I'm going to make
these in a second these are customized
methods this isn't something that's
built into Java to create buttons like
this
okay so one's going to be the stroke
button and the other one's going to be
the fill button and then I change this
to make me color button which isn't the
best anglish on earth but that's okay
then the hang file this is associated
was called stroke and this one's going
to be called fill then in this situation
this doesn't even matter
I'm just going to throw five and six
inside of there and then the way I'm
going to have this built is if I want a
stroke defined I'm going to set this for
true and if I want it to be a film when
I set this false so those are just
boolean values gonna I'm going to be
passing over there all right more on
those guys here in a minute because I
still got other work to do after this
buttons have been created I need to add
them to my box it's going to be put in a
panel and then thrown on frame and so I
got a go brush but right like that
there's gonna be six of these guys there
you go and one of you guys actually
asked me to do this tutorial so thank
you for that but you didn't want your
name out there
thank you either way because it's fun to
do tutorials like this so if you have an
idea for a fun tutorial leave it below
because I like doing fun tutorials sorry
our just added all our buttons to the
box now I'm going to go button panel and
add the box with all the buttons into my
panel that's going to be going into a J
frame then I have to define exactly how
I'm going to have this set up because
I'm going to use a boarder layout so I
just need to go button panel like that
and then I need to say where I want it
to be located at and I want it to be in
the south as you saw it bottom the
screen and that's a border layout inside
a swing and then I'm going to have
another one and this is going to be my
drawing area and I'm going to be
creating that in a second so this is
going to be drawing board which is a
method I'm going to call down below and
then here I'm going to say Center which
means it's basically going to take up
the rest of the screen there you go and
then the final thing is to say hey frame
yet visible and they're your honor to go
true and there we go so now it's time to
go and create all these other methods
that I've been referring to the first
one I'm going to make is make me buttons
this guy right here copy that or that
there and it's going to be public J
button is what it's going to be spitting
out after it's all done and then this
thing right here is going to be a string
because that's going to be the location
for the icon and this guy right here is
going to be an integer that is going to
refer to whichever type of shapes going
to be drawn whenever this guy is clicked
on and the reason why this is final is
because any local variable that's used
inside of an inner class but is not
declared inside of that inner class must
be marked as final okay so that's just a
rule to remember I'm going to be doing
design pattern and object-oriented
toriel's here real soon and we'll get
more into that stuff then
remember at this point that's what you
got to do so then I'm going to create
like a temporary holding cell for our
new button and then I need to define an
icon object and it's going to be image
icon and an icon file so the location
for my soon-to-be icon for this button
and then I'm going to go the butt and
set the icon equal to what icon then I'm
going to add an event listener to this
so that whenever my button is clicked on
somebody is able to handle that do
something with it I'm just gonna build
this guy directly inside of here because
it's easy to do it that way I'm gonna go
public and this is why we need funnel
because I'm doing all this shenanigans
that you see on the screen but I like to
keep everything all nice and order here
so so event and then current action
again this is just going to say what
type of shape is going to be created and
this is going to be action number the
number that was passed over there and
all this is all defined for me just got
to put a semicolon there and close this
area off this is what I'm closing off
right there see there's a closing curly
brace the net curling brace like there
and that closing brace right there for
that function then after this just go
return the button that was just created
with all those cool little things and
we're all happy oh and this guy up here
I need to add this to the button of
course file safe awesome ok now we're
pretty much going to be doing the same
exact thing here in a second remember
the this one's going to handle all the
shape buttons and then the next thing
I'm going to be creating here is going
to handle the stroke and the fill
buttons they're going to be a little bit
different still going to be buttons just
gonna be a little bit different and this
is going to be make me call order button
technically I'm not going to need this
but I'm gonna leave it in here just for
the heck of it and I'm gonna go final
boolean and then I'm gonna say is this a
stroke or not okay that's what the
bowling it is because it's going to act
different depending upon if it is a
stroke and then all this stuff's going
to be the same except this is just going
to be completely disregarded just get
rid of that and I'm gonna say if it is a
stroke then I'm going to use the J color
chooser which is going to be a pop-up
that you saw earlier it's going to pop
up on the screen and allow them to
define what the stroke color is is equal
to J color chooser and then just go show
dialog now I'm just going to say null
I need to find the message that you want
to show on the screen I'm gonna say pick
a stroke and then you have to define the
default color that's going to be used
inside of it num believe as black so
that's the default when
the chooser pops up I'm going to copy
that type in else paste that in there
and change this to fill color that's
going to handle the fill this is going
to be pick fill and let everything else
here be exactly the same so that's a lot
of fun yeah I'm going to bounce up here
and change this to stroke color to add
it set a stroke before all right so
that's going to make all that wonderful
okay good next thing I got to do is
create my little drawing area and I'm
going to call this drawing board and
it's going to extend J component just
like we did in the last part of the
tutorial then I'm going to create an
array list for both each of the shapes
that I create which is going to be a
shape object I'm gonna call it shapes is
equal to new ArrayList and what's so
great about this is I'm going to be able
to save these array lists out to a file
I mean it's a really cool stuff then I
got to do the same thing for the fill in
the color so copy that and these are
just going to be colors there they
aren't rate lists for colors
instead of shapes this is going to be
shaved fill and this is going to be
shaved stroke and we were able to save
all those things and then pop the room
and repaint on the screen it's going to
be really cool and then also I create a
point which is just going to hold an XY
position for the starting area where
they click and then move on from there
and then we need a public drawing board
create this guy and we're going to start
adding listeners here event listeners so
this is going to be a mouse listener I'm
just going to track with users doing on
the screen so that we'll be able to rack
to it start drawing stuff - adapter I'm
going to define these methods inside of
here Isobel
so public void and then we're going to
say okay what are we going to do when
the user presses the mouse and then
we're going to figure that out so it's a
mouse event you roll this up and then
we're going to go okay well what was the
position of the mouse whenever the mouse
was first pressed we want to get that
information you just go e do I get X and
then we want to go you dot get Y and
it's going to get us the x and y
position for the mouse whenever it was
first pressed draw and it's going to be
equal to draw storage which is going to
handle drawing like a dot on a screen
and then we're going to repaint the
screen afterwards bounce tones out of
here now we're going to go and figure
out what we're going to do whenever the
mouse is released because we want to
draw a square or something on the screen
we're going to figure out both where the
mouse was clicked and where the position
of the
was whenever it was released and we're
going to create our shape here and I'm
just going to call it a a I'm going to
call draw rectangle which I'm going to
create the bottom here after I get all
this done and I need to pass over what
was this starting exposition when they
first clicked on the mouse and a
starting Y position and then I'm going
to go a dot get X which is going to give
me the position when the mouse was
released and then e dot get Y which is
going to give me the Y position when the
mouse is released and both of those come
from this guy right here this event and
then we're going to go shapes add our
new shape to our ArrayList of shapes so
that we'll be able to grab them and
cycle through them later on and then
we're also going to get the fill and
that's going to be whatever the current
value of fill color is and we're going
to get the current stroke that is set
save that to the ArrayList as well you
probably never thought ArrayList could
be so useful and then we're going to
just nullify draw start and draw end and
the reason why is because of a little
test that we're going to do below here
and after we're done with that repaint
the screen so that the images and shapes
and all that stuff I'll show up real
nice below and then this guy right here
is going to come up here and close that
off and you could come up here and do
something this would be a better way of
doing this you could say and of and then
paste that in there so that you're able
to track what's going on with the screen
and then directly after that I'm going
to go this add Mouse motion listener and
go new Mouse motion adapter to track the
movement of the mouse and then we're
going to define again exactly what we
want to do with this guy where you go
public void Mouse dragged Mouse of me2
get the final X&amp;amp;Y position which it's
going to be the final because at the end
of the drag is whenever whatever the
position of x and y is at that point in
time that's what value it's going to
have and then you go e get why they're
you x and y position semicolon after
that and repaint the screen again and
then we'll put semicolon after there and
this wouldn't be needed but if you
wanted to comment face that in there
keep everything is neat as humanly
possible then after this guy we're going
to go public
avoid paint graphics and this guy's
going to handle setting up
all the different rules for our drawing
pad we have here on our screen and this
is going to define how the shapes are
going to be drawn on the screen and
rendering and all the other things I
talked about in the last tutorial then
we're going to handle the anti-aliasing
graph settings is just going to be my
graphics settings I mean I saved three
letters and made it a lot less
understandable I probably should have
called that graphics settings but either
way so set come down here rendering hint
I like that then we're gonna go render a
ring hints and just go key anti-aliasing
like I said before that just handles
smoothing of the graphics on the screen
then we're just going to copy this and
pretty much type in the same thing here
and then this is going to be value
anti-alias and it's going to be
underscore on now we'll define some
information in regards to our stroke so
graph settings and set stroke and I'm
just going to define here with basic
stroke the line width for my stroke on
the screen so you see how easy it is to
change the line width you just would
come in here and make a change to that
right there and then I'm going to create
an iterator to cycle through my array
list for my strokes that are defined
each one of those array lists is all
going to line up and I just need to go
shape stroke and I call iterator right
like that save that and copy I'm going
to do exactly the same thing for fill
like that and this is stroke counter and
fill counter and then I just have
changes to shape fill and then later on
I'm going to do a really cool thing with
transparency but for right now I want to
make sure that my transparency is turned
a hundred percent off so that all the
images that I paint on the screen are
not transparent see how easy it is if
you'd want to go in and start doing
transparencies there's a whole bunch of
things I'm giving here to play with and
whenever I set this to 1.0 F that means
that it's going to have zero
transparency to it so if you want it to
be different what you're going to see in
a minute then I'm going to cycle through
all my shapes that I created so shapes
I'm going to grab the next stroke color
from my ArrayList so I just go graph
settings set paint equal to whatever the
stroke is for the shape that was saving
the ArrayList or all saved right next to
each other and next is going to give me
the next iteration that's inside
then graph settings and I'm going to go
draw the shape on the screen using that
new definition for the stroke I'm going
to copy this paste that in there and
here I'm going to set pain again but I'm
going to use the fill counter right like
that leave it as next again it's going
to cycle through all those things and
I'm going to change this to fill this
one handles the stroke one handles the
fills and this guy's going to come to a
close and then I'm going to define my
guide shape and this is basically going
to be what is on the screen as I'm
drawing the shape so that can use it as
a guide you'll see here at the end it's
like light gray so that I can see what
the rectangle looks like on the screen
as I'm drawing it so what I want to do I
want to take my transparency remember I
said I want to make it have a
transparent so that it looks kind of
professional on the screen as I'm
drawing it and let's just knock this way
down let's go 0.4 K so there that is
Graff settings and just set my paint as
a gray and then it's going to draw a
rectangle on the screen some of this
code is going to change in the next part
of this tutorial so I'm going to go to
shape a shape is equal to draw rectangle
and it's going to be draw start the X Y
position draw start the Y position draw
end the x position and draw and the Y
position then I have to create the draw
rectangle method down below close that
off let's just copy this guy right here
and then I'm going to go private and
this is going to return rectangle to d
dot flute paste draw rectangle in there
and then it's going to get past those XY
positions you just saw and then I'm
going to figure out which x and y
position are closest to the upper
left-hand corner because when you draw
this rectangle we want to figure that
out in the upper left-hand corner of the
string is 0 0 and X Y terms so to figure
that out
I'm going to go into X is equal to and
call math and it's going to kick back
the minimum value which is going to be
the one that's closest to the upper
left-hand corner so that I know how to
draw that rectangle and I'm going to do
the same thing here for the Y this is
going to be Y this is gonna be Y and
this is going to be Y of course there
you go hopefully that makes sense now
you just have to figure out the
difference between the coordinates so
that I know how wide my rectangle is and
I'm just gonna go absolute value and get
x1 minus x2 and then we're going to do
the same
thing for why except this is going to be
height and this is y1 and y2 and then
after that's done
I got a return my new rectangle that I
just created here which is going to be
this guy right here X Y width height
I'll save it and there you go there is
our little application so go ahead get
the code play with it learn this stuff
and next part of the tutorial I'm gonna
add even more features leave any
questions or comments below the last til
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
