4 of my android development tutorial for
beginners today we're going to finish
off the application that we started in
part 3 we're going to be focusing in a
lot on how to use activity starter so I
thought a really good way to start this
off is to look at the finished app so
let's jump into it
okay and here you can see the final
application if we click on test button
it's going to make a zombie noise and
vibrate if we click on the check box
you're going to see up here that the
event was triggered and there it'll be
triggered again we can also come in here
of course and change our favorite color
there we go we can add and delete colors
as well if you look up here as I use the
slider you're going to see that the age
is being changed but it's not showing as
a fraction we're also going to be able
to come in here and our password so just
anything and hit enter
you're going to see right there that the
notification pops up and hit OK on that
you're also going to see here if we hit
open website that the website is going
to automatically open up here on our
screen for us and there it is it's out
of focus though but either way let's
just go back also we're going to be able
to send emails just click on that and
it's going to give us an option for what
to use and if I just hit this if you
have a default it's going to jump
immediately into it but you can see
right here help please is in there and
all that stuff and we can just delete
this you can also go and use Google Maps
to go directly to the white house and
there that is and we're also going to be
able to open up YouTube remember if that
was default it would automatically open
and there is one of my videos and jump
out of that and then finally we can hit
camera and the camera app is going to
open up for us so you can see and it's
black because it's on my desk so you can
see this app does a whole bunch of
different things so let's go in there
and figure out all the things we haven't
covered yet okay so now you saw the
finished application so now it's time to
come in here and add a couple more
things to our layout and one thing that
sort of came up whenever I started this
originally meaning before the video
started the components part was over
here and the media part was over here
and just so you know how to fix that if
that happens to you come in here and log
out of your App Inventor system
rhe login and everything will go back to
the way it was that's actually kind of
fortunate its first time that's ever
happened so what we need to do here is
add five more buttons so what we're
going to do is go into layout get
horizontal arrangement drag it over here
drop it inside of there
then we're going to get ourselves three
more buttons so come back up here to
user interface get a button and let's
drag it over and drop it inside of there
and we might as well just get all the
buttons at once and these are going to
be the different activities that we're
going to have fire whenever we click on
these buttons so there we go and there
it is and of course I have to still get
the slider to work and also open zombie
which is going to open our zombie
application for us and I'm also going to
come in here and get another layout
horizontal arrangement which is going to
open up YouTube and a couple other
different things user interface get
another button drag it down here drop it
in and get another button and drag it
down and drop it in okay so now we have
those all set up now let's go and give
these good names so I'm just gonna call
this open web site is what it's going to
say over there open web site and in the
block section I'll actually make all
this stuff work and we can also come in
here click on rename and rename this web
site button there we go click OK you can
see open web site web site button let's
click on this one and let's give this a
name of email button there that is and
then we can click off of that and go
rename and call it email button actually
probably make sense here call this send
email rather than email button okay so
that's a send email click on this and
this guy is going to open up a map and
we're going to give it latitude and
longitude so let's call this geo map
just to give it a name click on rename
come over here and call this map button
it's going to open up the Google Maps
application click on this one this is
going to be the YouTube button so let's
just call it YouTube and then click on
rename
let's just call it YouTube button
remember there can't be any spaces here
and then the final one whenever we click
on that is going to open up the camera
which means we also have to put the
camera component inside of here but
first we're just going to call this
camera and I'm not going to get into
returning the picture that is taken with
the camera do that in the next part of
the tutorial and I'm just going to call
this camera button and that's fine and
then to make all that work of course
we're going to have to go into media and
get camera and drag that over here and
drop it there and you can see it shows
up there all right so we added all the
different things we need in the designer
block so now we need to jump over into
the block sport of App Inventor and make
everything work okay so here we are in
the blocks part and you can see right
here the very last thing I did will show
you how to delete items from lists so
now what I need to do is make the slider
work so very first I'm going to do is
come over here and we can look for
slider which is right here click on that
and what do I want it to do well there's
only really one event that it catches
and that is position changed so what I
want to do is have the label at the top
of the screen change when the position
of the slider changes so I'm going to
have to come and get set button event
label because that's what I've been
using going to duplicate that drag it
over here drop it into place and then
the text is actually going to be
multiple lines so that means I'm going
to need a join and the join is in the
text area so click on that drag it over
here and let's just drop it right there
grab this because we're going to use
that drop this right here and then I'm
going to put in a string of text and it
is going to say age slider changed to
put a space and then I need to get
whatever the value of the slider is at
that moment so that means I'm going to
have to go and get the slider component
again so where is it hiding at here
there it is click on that I need to find
the thumb position which is right here
now the only problem with this is by
default it is going to return a fraction
now since most people do not think about
frac
in regards to their age that means we
want to round it down and to do that
anytime you're talking about math you're
going to have to go into the math
section and let's take a look at the
different things that are available here
for us so let's just scroll through here
and one of them ceiling would make it
round up floor would make it round down
so we're going to take the floor drag it
over here drop it right there and drop
this in right there and what this is
going to do is it's going to eliminate
the fractions on the slider so there we
go
slider is working the next thing we want
to do is make our zombie work but to do
that I'm going to use a special app on
my android phone to find some special
information so that I'll be able to
properly do this however what I'm going
to do first is set this up then show you
how I get the proper information to be
able to open up any app from inside of
App Inventor so I'm going to want to
whenever the zombie button is clicked on
I'm going to want this on be AB to open
and there is the open zombie button and
so when the open zombie button is
clicked I want an a bunch of things to
occur now whenever we want to use the
activity starter which is the guy that
we're going to be using in this
situation a whole bunch of different
things we have to do now if we want to
I'm going to show you other ways of
using activity starter but if you want
to open up an app inventor app from
inside of another App Inventor app what
you're going to have to do is get two
pieces of information to do so one is
going to be the package which is pretty
much like all the code and it's like all
the code for the app all in one box is
called a package and I'm dramatically
simplifying that but that's basically
what a package is so what I'm going to
have to do here is set the package the
folder where all the stuff lies get that
drag it over here drop it in there in a
second I'll show you how to get the
package information and then what I'm
going to do is I need to get the class
the very specific activity that is going
to start
so again activity starter and I want to
get set activity class now we're going
to drop that inside of there
then after I define the package the
folder where it is and the class the
specific thing that I want to execute I
need to call for the activity to start
so click on that and that sounds a lot
like a method and of course it is and it
starts off with call and it's purple and
everything's perfect and drop that
inside of there now I get into the
specifics of what package do I use and
I'm going to jump over into my phone and
show you the tool that I use to get that
okay so if we want to be able to come in
here and open up an app inventor app
from inside of an app inventor app what
we're going to have to do here is
download or at least this is what I use
I use something called Android system
info and what it does is it gives me the
package information I need it's free
just hit open get it installed blah blah
blah blah blah but this is what it does
for us here it is I'm opening it up now
if I want to be able to open up an app
inventor app inside of an app inventor
app what I'm gonna have to do is I'm
going to have to look for it on my phone
so let's look for the zombie app for
example and this is also going to show
you exactly how you're going to be able
to open up pretty much any type of app
from inside of App Inventor by the way
what I'm specifically looking for is the
zombie app and there it is so lo zombie
now if I click on it and I look right
here this is what I'm looking for
package name see it says App Inventor
dot AI and there is my name dot hello
zombie that is the information I'm going
to need to be able to open any
application but specifically to open
this App Inventor app and I can't really
get in any closer so that is the tool I
use to be able to open up all sorts of
other different applications from app
and better alright so now that I showed
you exactly how to get the package I am
going to go and define it so if you can
remember from previous little part rows
in that app it is App Inventor dot AI
underscore
Derrick baños because that is my name
and hello zombie in this situation is
what I want to open up and that is the
package so we can take that and throw it
there now to get to the class I'm pretty
much going to use the same exact thing
so I'm going to go duplicate and drop
that on there and the only change I'm
going to make is at the very end of this
I'm going to pipe in dot screen one and
that is going to allow me to open other
App Inventor apps from inside of an app
inventor app so kind of neat now we get
into kind of a simpler way of doing
things in regards to how we going to
open up websites emails Google Maps
YouTube and the camera well the camera
is actually extremely easy basically
what we're going to do is we're going to
say when the camera button is clicked on
so let's just go camera button and when
it's clicked on we're going to grab it
drop it over here and then what we need
to do is call the off camera which is
this guy right here super simple and go
to take picture grab that drop it right
there and that's all you need to do
right there now whenever they click on
that button named camera it's going to
automatically jump over into the camera
parts of your Google device or Android
device I guess you should say now if we
want a website to open pretty much going
to do the same sort of stuff you're
going to look for your website button
there it is click on that and we're
going to say when the website button is
clicked on we want to open a website in
our browser so to do that what are we
going to do well we're going to have to
define an action something that we want
to occur and these are all going to be
basically the same because we're going
to let our Android device basically
define these special or the right app to
open based off of the type of data we're
saying we want okay so let me just show
you this so we're going to go into
activity starter anytime you want to
open up an activity you want to open up
another app you're going to use the
activity starter and in this situation
you're going to say that you want a
certain action to be performed I'm not
going to get into the specifics of what
this means
pretty much going to be using the same
action over and over and over again
whenever you want to open up an app so
we're just going to come in here and the
specific thing we're going to do is type
in Android dot intent dot action dot
view and there we go and that is going
to go in there almost every single time
that specific thing and of course under
the video I have a link to all of these
blocks print it out on my website and so
maybe it'll be easier to see that way
then what we're going to do is we're
going to find the type of data that we
want to use and then let our Android
device figure out which is the right
application open so we're going to need
to again go into activity starter click
on that and then we're going to look for
data URI and there it is right there
so grab this guy drag it over here drop
it in and then we're going to say that
we want to go to a website and it's
automatically going to open up the
browser HTTP and let's say that I want
to go to my website you think pink comb
and hit enter and drop that in there and
then what we need to do in this
situation is say start activity you're
basically saying hey this is the type of
data I want to work with Android go get
me the right activity so we're going to
go duplicate copy this drop it right
there and there you go so whenever you
click on the website button it's
automatically going to work now we can
also we have an email button let's zoom
out of here so we can get ourselves more
screen real estate and let's come in
here and duplicate this guy and I'm
going to make the email thing
automatically work for the email button
so I'm going to go change this from
website button to email button there
that is we're going to let the action be
the same as it is right there and the
data URI the type of data we're going to
work with is going to be mail now to
have the mail application open up we're
going to go mail to and then we're going
to type in an email address that we want
to use so let's just say there we go and
then on top of that if we would want to
add a subject to it we could just put a
question mark inside of there let's
scroll over a little bit and then we
could type in subject is equal to and
then we could say help the only thing we
have to remember here is we have to put
a % and a 20 that represents a empty or
a space a blank space have to always you
fill in % 22 represent all spaces and
then we could type in please we could
also come in here and go and see C is
equal to and then
put that in there the additional email
address we could also come in here and
type in body as well but I'm just going
to leave it simply like that for home
working go in there and play around with
all the other different options you're
going to have to do or the things you
want to play around with
just remember can't have any spaces
inside of here and any spaces that you
do have you have to replace with 8% 20
and hit enter and that's it
it's done now whenever you click on that
email button it's automatically going to
open up the email and it's going to put
the subject of help please so kind of
neat if we want to get our map to work
we're going to do another duplication
here so duplicate right this guy drop
them right there and in this situation
we're going to change this to map button
and then we're going to leave this be
exactly the same still going to be view
right here all we're going to have to do
now is type in geo and this is going to
be the geo location for the map that we
want to open now I use a web site kind
of by default let me go and take a look
at that for a second here it is I don't
know why I started using and start using
this forever ago it's a free plug to
this University I guess but anything if
you just type in map geolocation or
something like that this is just what I
use then what you're going to be able to
do is let's say that I want to put the
white house on here I just go type in
the address for it
hit search and it pops back the latitude
and the longitude so I'm just going to
copy this jump back into my app jump in
here and right after it says geo I'm
going to go
paste and then I'm going to put a column
in there jump back into the browser get
to this number right here copy that jump
back over here and right after this I'm
going to paste in the geolocation
and I can leave this be startactivity
and this is going to automatically open
up a Google map and zero in on the white
house so that's how that works if you
want to open up a YouTube video
again we're going to duplicate this
we're going to drop it down here Android
intent action view is going to be the
same as it was before
let me go and find myself a video to
show and here you can see right here is
my YouTube video for the first part of
this tutorial I'm gonna copy that jump
back over into App Inventor come down
here to where I'm going to have my
YouTube button BAE I'm going to have to
zoom out give myself a little bit more
space zoom back in there click on that
and look for YouTube button there it is
and then for the data URI I'm going to
say that I want a YouTube video and it's
going to automatically open up at the
YouTube app so the only thing left to do
now is to make the password and the
notification thing work let's go look at
that so what I want to do is have the
password thing work here they're going
to type in their password it's going to
be blocked off and then they're going to
hit this button right here let's go and
actually give it a name over here and
let's type in enter there we go and
let's look here and see if we actually
gave it a good name yes we typed in
enter password button okay so there that
set jump back over into blocks and let's
make that work so we're gonna come over
here and we're gonna say all right where
is enter password button there it is and
enter password button look for click
there that is drop it right here that'll
work I think and then what we're going
to do is we're going to say whenever
they click on that we're gonna get the
password when I open up a dialog that
says never give anybody your password so
let's come down inside of here we can
see here that we have the notifier click
on that and there are a bunch of
different types of notifications or
dialogues that we can have pop up here
I'm just going to keep it real simple
and use this one previously I used that
one you can go in there again for
homework you can play around with all
the different options that are available
we're going to drop that right there and
then we're going to want to have a
longer message so we're going to get
ourselves a join so come up here and get
text and there's join and we're going to
get over here and drop it in see that
automatically resized let's go and get
ourselves a little bit more room inside
of here and then what we're going to do
is click here and say don't tell anyone
your password is put a space enter grab
that drop it right there if we want to
get the password that they actually
entered we're going to come over here
again and we're going to look for
password text box there that is and
we're going to say that we want the text
that they entered so we're not going to
be setting it we're going to be getting
it come over here
drop that in there there that set and
then if we just want to come in and do
something like received password and
drop that string in there right there
and then for the button text to do
something like okay and there that is
there we go the application is finished
we saw a whole bunch of different ways
to start different activities and in the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
create like a media application it's
going to play videos and music and a
whole bunch of other different things
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
