4 of my angularjs tutorial in this part
of the tutorial we're going to focus in
100% on angularjs services and services
are basically objects that bundle
together methods that serve a specific
function
now angular provides a ton of built-in
services which I'll cover in this
tutorial but it's also as you'll see
very easy for us to make our own custom
services if you haven't watched any of
my previous angularjs tutorials you
absolutely have to and I provide a link
here so that you can definitely do that
otherwise you will be quite confused and
of course all of the code is available
as well as a transcript of this tutorial
in the description underneath the video
so enough talking let's get in and write
some code okay just like in all the
other tutorials on the left side of
screen I have the Adam text editor on
the right side of the screen I have
Google Chrome and I went and used all of
the previous things here I went and
wrote them in here already you've
already seen all this stuff and you can
see exactly what I have right here I
provided the controller and also I
provided or imported the angularjs
library as well as the JavaScript code
that we're going to be writing and this
is angular Tut 13 HTML and the
JavaScript is going to be in exam 13 Jas
ok so we're over in exam 13 is and just
make sure that all your code is exactly
the same here I'm going to be writing a
lot of it but I'm going to get a lot of
this stuff up here so we didn't have to
wait some time okay so the first I'm
going to do is create a simple service
that's going to provide a method we can
use in our controller and of course we
can also use services in directives as
well as filters and how we create this
is we just come in here and go app 13
and service and let's call this hello
service and then we'll create our
function here close that off here I'm
going to say this hello service now
services unlike factories as you can see
here in a moment don't return anything
but instead provide access to a single
object that can be used by your entire
application so I'm going to create
another function inside of here and this
is going to be the function we're going
to be using and I'll just keep this very
simple I'm just going to print some
information
out onto the console and I'll call this
hello service and close that off and now
I'm going to create a factory that's
going to create an object and then add a
method to it and then return that object
just so you can see both examples here
so again app 13 except in this situation
we're going to say Factory and I'm going
to call this hello Factory and once
again create a function inside of here
create a factory object and this can
have any name it doesn't have to be
factory of course and also we're going
to go hello factory and here we'll
create our function and this guy's going
to do exactly the same thing it's going
to come in and get our console and just
so we can see the difference it's going
to say hello factory instead and then we
can close that off and of course
remember to return that factory object
now what we need to do is pass the
service into our controller so that the
controller will be able to access these
services so I'm going to go app 13
create our controller and I'll call this
main controller of course because that's
what I called it out in the HTML we're
going to create a function now any
services you're going to be using you're
going to have to pass inside of this
function so hello service and hello
factory create that close that off
and then to call these specific
functions that we created here we go
hello service and hello service which is
the name of that function and then
likewise we're going to do the same
thing with hello factory right like that
and if we save it and reload the screen
over here well we're going to have to
open up our console so JavaScript
console and if we do you can see down
here hello service prints out as well as
hello factory okay so there is an
extremely simple example in regards to
how to use services with angularjs and
now I'm going to jump over and show you
a whole bunch of built-in services okay
so now we're in angular Tut 14 dot HTML
and exam 14 j/s and all of this is
exactly the same as it was previously
except down here I am going to import
something called angular sanitize and as
you can see in this comment here it's
going to be used to allow HTML
to avoid sanitation and you're going to
see exactly what that means here in a
moment it's basically going to allow us
to print HTML out that the user inputs
which could be a security risk well
we'll get into that in a second so the
very first service that's built into
angularjs I'm going to cover is window
and you're going to see this got right
here what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create an input and it's going to be
a text input I'm going to go ng model
and you should know what all this stuff
means basically just going to tie in all
of our data here I'm going to call this
a user name then I'm going to create a
button and add a click event to it and
whenever this is clicked it's going to
call a method we're going to create here
in a second called greet user and we're
going to pass in the user name to that
guy and then we'll just give this the
name of hello button like that and
that's all we're going to do there now
let's jump over into the JavaScript as
you can see here I have a whole bunch of
services these are the services that
we're going to cover at this moment
anyway and we're going to be putting all
this directly inside of our controller
and basically the windows service is
going to provide an object that's going
to represent the window object now we're
going to go and create our function here
for greet user like we just created over
in the HTML and it's going to receive a
user name and one of the things you can
do with window is go and open up an
alert for it
so we're going to say hello user name
and there you can see and if we come in
here and type in Derrick for example and
hit hello it's going to pop up an alert
that says hello Derrick so let's jump
over and take a look at location which
does a little bit more in regards to
neat little things we can do here and
basically a location is a service that's
going to provide access to the current
URL and can be used for navigation
within the document and a whole bunch of
other different things so what we're
going to do here is I'm just going to
type in URL if we want to get our URL
current URL I'm going to do a whole
bunch of these different guys just throw
a break statement inside of there we can
also get our protocol I'll just call
this the protocol we can get our host
let's call this current host we can get
our port let's call that current port
just so I'll be able to remember it when
I get over into the JavaScript we can
get our path current path search current
search and I think that's good enough so
now let's jump over into the JavaScript
once again inside of our controller
we're going to be putting all this stuff
inside of here so I'm going to say scope
current URL and to get our current URL
we're going to call location of course
that's the whole point of this and we
can go and get our current URL that
we're using we're also going to get the
protocol that's going to be either file
or HTTP or one of those things location
again and protocol we can get our
current host by calling location host we
can get our port quite easily turn for
it by calling location port I'm starting
off with the simple services we'll get
into the more complicated ones here in a
second we can also come in and set our
path and then get it so to set the path
we can go location path and then we're
going to put a hash symbol and path
whatever that path might be we could
then come in and get that path or output
it by calling location once again and
path we can come in and set our search
by calling search and then we could pass
in something like random equals stop
you're going to see what that looks like
on the browser of course we're going to
be able to come in and get that search
by calling location again and then just
passing in search without anything
inside of it and I think that's
everything
so it's jump over here make sure that's
all set yeah search whoops got a little
bit of an error after coming here this
is a lowercase RL another little bug
let's go and get rid of this little part
right here there you can see how that's
saved
reload it again and now you can see
everything all there on one screen so
you can see our URL and it's localhost
angular cut you can see exactly where I
have that located you can also see right
here where I have random stop setup and
that ties in with the search and you can
see all that setup HTTP of course
localhost is the host 80 is the port and
there you can see the path that I added
to it as well there's a whole bunch of
different things we can do with location
now let's go and do some more
interesting things by taking a look at
the interval service so let's jump back
over into the HTML once again we get rid
of all this stuff we don't need all that
let's say that we wanted to come in here
and get the current time on the system
we could go current time and I'm just
going to put time inside of there I'll
jump over into the JavaScript and
basically what the interval service is
going to allow us to do is execute code
at a set time and in this situation I'm
going to have it be every two seconds
and what we're going to do here is spit
out the actual current time that we have
for our system so we're going to say
interval and then throw a function
inside of it and I'm going to go and
create our is equal to new date and then
if I want to get the current hour let me
just go get hours and that's all I'm
going to do for the hour I'm also going
to come in here and get the minutes
however if you do not put in any leading
zeroes in your minutes you are going to
potentially get let's say it's 304 it's
going to instead print 3/4 so we have to
fix that and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add a starting zero and then
slice the last two numbers off of our
string that's going to be my out of my
head solution here so create a new date
and go get minutes and then at the end
of it I'm going to slice off the last
two numbers that we have inside of here
and then I'm going to do the exact same
thing for seconds to change this seconds
change this to seconds slice off the
last two and then I'll set my time that
I have here so I'm going to say scope
time which is what I called it in the
HTML and then we'll just say hour plus
real colon inside of there
let's going to take those spaces out of
there minutes and let's throw a colon
inside of there and seconds and then
what we're going to do next is we're
going to say how often we want the
interval to occur so right inside of
here we put a comma and I'm going to say
that I want this to update every two
seconds
save that reload it current time and
you're going to see there it is pops up
945 and you can see every two seconds it
goes and updates so that is how we use
interval and I just threw in a little
bit of a neat example here so we can
also play around with getting the
current time and next I'm going to cover
the log service which is going to allow
us to log messages to the console for
debugging mainly so let's come in here
and let's just create a label and let's
call this message and I'm going to have
input so the user can input some
information and then we'll change the
actual log message that we put inside of
there so I'm going to go ngmodel and
let's just keep it simple and just call
it message and let's close that off and
let's close off our label as well and
now I'm going to show you a whole bunch
of different log messages you can have
inside of here so I'm going to have
button and whenever this is clicked on
I'm going to call log log message and
this is just going to be a generic log
and then we're going to do pretty much
the same thing for all these other
different options we have here like I
said this is going to print messages out
to our console another thing we can have
here is a warning message which is just
going to change the icon that we have
I'll just have this be warned we also
have info let's just give this a name of
info error error and then finally debug
save that jump over into our JavaScript
and this is going to be very simple all
I'm going to do here is call scope and
log equal to log reload it and there you
can see all the different options and
you can see there's our message and all
these other different things let's just
say warning if we hit log you see
warning shows up down there with no icon
if we hit warn you're going to see
there's a different icon down there info
error debug and you can see all those
other different
types of log messages you can put inside
of there like I said it's often used for
debugging purposes I'm going to now
cover another guy that's kind of used
more for debugging purposes more than
anything else and what it's going to do
it's called the exception handler
service and what happens is any uncaught
exceptions are going to be delegated to
our exception handler service and it's
good once again going to output
information to our console so let's jump
over here to our HTML and this guy is
just basically going to come in here and
throw an error let's just get rid of all
this and let's create a button and
whatever this is clicked on it's going
to call a function that's going to throw
an exception so let's just keep it
simple and let's just have it be throw
exception and that's all we need to do
jump over into our JavaScript code now
let's get rid of this scope once again
and throw exception and what I'm going
to do here is throw in a try block and
if we didn't catch the exception a stack
trace would print in our console but
instead I'm going to sort of control
what goes on here I am however going to
throw an exception let's say throw new
error and I'm just going to call this
exception thrown and then going to catch
that exception and then I'm going to
call exception handler basically it's
going to receive the exception as well
as a string that's going to explain the
exception let's get our message out of
that and then let's go and explain
something let's just say caught
exception reload throw exception and
there you can see exception thrown and
caught exception is printed out there
and now let's take a look at how
angularjs sanitizes information so let's
go in here again let's just get rid of
all this let's get rid of all of it and
this is where you're going to need the
angular sanitized J's file and you can
just use this link here to link to it
and be able to get it and use it in your
code now basically angular is going to
automatically replace brackets like this
that could potentially allow people to
do dangerous things with your site such
as being able to do a mouse-over event
on a HTML element that is displayed on
the screen that then causes bad code to
trigger and so forth and so on so let's
just take a look at an example of that
so we're going to do an input and type
of course
ng-model let's call this bad stuff and
then I'm going to have a span here in
which we're going to try to display the
bad stuff I'm going to throw another
span inside of here and I'm going to put
ng bind dot HTML inside of this and what
this is going to allow you to do is
actually display the HTML that the user
enters but as you're going to see even
if you do allow it it's not going to
allow a mouse-over event or some other
potentially dangerous thing and we'll
tie this bad stuff and then we'll create
another one ng bind is equal to bad
stuff let's jump back over into our
JavaScript code here we can get rid of
this and let's just create a scope
inside of here for bad stuff give it a
default value of nothing and let's
reload this and you're going to see here
let's go and put some information inside
of there that's potentially bad so I'm
going to input a little bit of text
inside of here and you can see all kinds
of errors pop up here it's because it's
warning because you're trying to do bad
stuff here basically what I inputted
inside of there was this paragraph with
a mouse-over event do bad stuff
da-da-da-dah and you can see it didn't
turn it into a paragraph of course and
here it's not turning it into a
paragraph either and you can see how
that could potentially cause or help us
avoid any potential bad things from
happening but we could also come in here
and sanitize this ourself let's jump
back over into the JavaScript code and
let's say scope and watch and basically
what this is going to do for us is
monitor a change in a value in this
situation bad stuff and sanitize it for
us
so we can say that we want to watch bad
stuff specifically and we can pass a
value inside of here and then go scope
dot HTML data is equal to sanitize set
value and save that and reload it and
you can see once again that all of that
information has been sanitized so just a
little bit of a quirky type of thing to
take a look at but I'm just doing my
best to cover all the built-in services
we have here and let's take a look at
the compiled service now what I'm going
to do is just create a paragraph inside
of here and I'm going to call this get
player info and we're just going to
throw this information inside of here
and I'll jump over into our JavaScript
code and then I'm going to throw in some
data here that's just some baseball
players and baseball player information
that we're going to use here and
basically the compiled service is going
to compile our HTML into a template
using the scope data that we have here
and then it's going to replace the get
player info over in our HTML document
with our specific new information that
has been combined so we go up 14 oops
first off we want to get outside of the
controller we have the data in the
controller but we're not going to have
it otherwise now I'm going to create a
directive which we've already seen in
the previous tutorials it's going to be
called get player info as you probably
guessed I'm going to create a function
inside of it we need to pass in compile
because we're going to be using that and
then we're going to say return function
once again
it's going to be the element well we're
going to get the scope going to be the
element this is tied to as well as any
attributes that's tied to the element
that's as directive is tied to we're
then going to come in here and create
the template we're going to be using for
this so we'll go player list and let's
just have this be an unordered list and
Li and we're going to use ng repeat and
we're going to say player in players
this is players up here this guy right
here this is what we're going to be
pulling that information from and then
we want to close that off and then
inside of it we're going to just go
player name we could get anything we
want it out of there but I'm just going
to have it be simple and have it be
player name and then going to close off
my list element and close off my
unordered list so there is the template
we're going to be using now what we're
going to do is wrap it in a JQ a light
object so I'm going to call this list
elements and then call angular elements
and I'm gonna pass in player list now I
need to create the compile function
which is going to generate our HTML
which we're going to output on our
screen to do that
go compile function and compile past in
the list elements and then process our
content pile function scope and then
update our JQ light object and add it
back into our documents another thing
we've already seen we're going to use
pend and list element and if we reload
it you can see it did exactly that it
went through all of that information we
have here and output it directly on the
screen using the template we have right
here so there are a whole bunch of
built-in services now I'm going to jump
over and show you how to use the service
HTTP to parse through JSON data now
before I do that I want to actually
create some JSON data and here you can
see I went and took the baseball players
and threw them inside of here and you
can pause the video and copy that down
or just go and get the code and copy and
paste it in and that is in player data
dot JSON and just so you can see where
that is located that is down here in the
main directory not in the JavaScript
directory that we have here and over
inside of our HTML I'm going to go and
put some stuff inside of here first off
inside of our controller I'm going to
create a button and add a click event to
it and this is going to call a function
called get data and we might as well
just give it the name of get data like
that then inside of here I'm just going
to display the raw JSON data so I'm just
going to call this player's jump over
into my JavaScript code inside of the
controller and I'm going to say scope
get data and create our function here
and I'm going to call the HTTP service
and this is how easy it is to get JSON
data I'm just going to type in the JSON
file that we have here and I'm going to
say onsuccess I'm going to be able to
call this function here pass in our data
inside of here and then do some stuff
with it what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to update our scope with the data
that we were able to retrieve and close
that off reload and there you can see
get data and if I click on it you're
going to see all that information was
input directly into our HTML document
now for the next example you're going to
want to go to good
and you're going to want to download a
Chrome extension and it is called allow
control allow origin extension directly
right like that and you're going to want
to get this guy and you're going to want
to add it on Chrome Syria that you're
going to be able to do some things there
this is if you get the cores error on
your browser which you're most likely
will because you're developing this on a
local host and you're pulling data from
a website so causes an error and
whenever you do install that extension
you're going to see this little guy
right here pop up so make sure you get
that extension but why don't I show you
another example here with the current
player information just to make this a
little bit more elaborate let's put our
JSON data inside of a list so we'll just
go unordered list and we'll say list
item ng-repeat is equal to players in
player or player in players close that
off and then we'll go player name plus
hit player HR which is home runs and
we'll say home runs closed off that list
item close off that unordered list and
reload it hit get data and you can also
say that went and created that unordered
list for us okay kind of neat so now
let's take another look a long time ago
I created a translation application it
was an Android application it's a web
service and we're going to be pulling
information from that web service so
what I'm going to do here once again in
the HTML file just get rid of this and
I'm going to say translate this is going
to allow you use my web service to pull
in information so or do a translation
poor translation but whatever so here we
go
text ng model I'm going to say words to
translate and then I'm going to create a
button here and click event and this is
going to take the words that are input
and translate them into multiple other
different languages and then output them
directly on the screen so we'll do a
translate if you want to know how I
built this web service there is a web
services tutorial that I created and
we'll just say translated and you're
going to see all the translations print
out there on the screen
so let's jump over into the JavaScript
to show you how this is set get rid of
this got right here and we're going to
say scope translate function I'm going
to get all the words that they input
over in the HTML and then I have to take
words to translate and replace all of
the spaces in them with plus signs
because that's the way I have everything
set up and that is how you do that and
I'll replace them with plus sign and
then I have to provide a link to the URL
and here is the web service that I
created its new just in comm translated
PHP it's PHP file obviously action is
equal to translations and English words
and then what I need to do at the end
here is add in all the words that they
want me to translate or the sentence or
whatever now to use the HTTP service I'm
going to use git once again I'm going to
pass inside of it my URL that I want to
call for do success and this is going to
call a function that's going to just
simply print all the different
translations out on the screen so
translated is equal to data and you'll
be able to do all kinds of different
things with that of course save reload
and if you do not have the extension set
up just wanted to show you this it's
going to say XML HTTP request cannot
load bla bla bla bla bla but we're going
to turn that on and that's perfectly
fine and now hit translate again and
there you can see it went through and
translated into a whole bunch of
different languages so there you go guys
that is a rundown on all the different
things or many of the different things I
should say you can do with angularjs
services and before I go just want to
send a special thank you once again to
all my patreon supporters I'm able to
continue making videos like this because
of your support just like always just
wanted to say thank you and for
everybody out there please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
