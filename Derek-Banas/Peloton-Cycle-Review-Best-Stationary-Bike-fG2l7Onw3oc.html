peloton cycle review in this video I'm
going to talk about the benefits of
stationary bikes in general I'm gonna
compare the peloton no doubt the
Cadillac of stationary bikes two other
different stationary bike alternatives
I'm gonna go over all the specs I'm
going to give you an overview of the
different classes that are available my
results
my overall classes and so forth I can
also talk about running versus
stationary bikes and a whole bunch of
other different things so basically the
buying a peloton is completely out of
character for me I spend literally
nothing on anything one thing I do spend
money on though is health and
specifically the reason why I well I
didn't have anything really to do with
getting the peloton bike that was
actually my wife that decided to get it
for me but I personally think it was a
fantastic thing to get this is basically
my birthday Christmas and 15th
anniversary present from my wife and my
entire family so the reason why
stationary bikes are fantastic for you I
run and you can actually see in the
description if you want more information
on my Strava and how much exercise and
so forth it's down there if you want to
look at it as well as the information on
the peloton classes are also down there
in the description but basically riding
a stationary bike is the best form of
best exercise for increasing your
cardiovascular health your overall leg
strength as well as it provides an
excellent exercise for your abs as well
as your obliques and so forth and so on
so it's a fantastic alternative to
running which is my main form of
exercise so that gives you a reason why
you would want to use a stationary bike
now what I specifically was looking for
with a stationary bike is I don't know
about everybody else but when I buy
something I want to buy something that
lasts I want to buy something that I can
count on for 5 maybe even 10 years I
want something it doesn't rust I want
something where the pedals for example
weren't gonna wiggle and wobble on me I
want a quality product and the peloton
definitely fits in in regards to that
now some people might find that they
could take a little bit less
Oh bite can be perfectly happy with that
and in a minute I'm going to talk about
the alternative options that we have
there but first what we're going to do
is go specifics into the specs of the
peloton bike itself now this is the body
of the peloton bike it is a powder
coated steel it is extremely resistant
to sweat I have a Nordic track treadmill
in comparison that is not powder coated
and it is rust all over the place even
though I wipe it down constantly this is
the flywheel this is a 40 pound flywheel
and the reason why having such a heavy
flywheel is important is it's going to
give you the ability to consistently
move and not have to have the bike
bouncing around
that's a delta pedal and those tires are
those shoes you see right there also
came with it you can also see here a
really nice cushy seat that is extremely
comfortable and a place for weights the
weights also came with the peloton bike
but that was part of a deal that I got
but basically what I was get back to the
flywheel is if you have a heavy flywheel
that's gonna mean you're gonna be able
to really go at it when you're on the
bike and the bike is gonna bounce around
on you and it's also gonna feel like
you're using a real bike you can see
right there those are the number of on
demand classes almost 8200 classes are
available right now and you can see just
a whole ton of them there are so many
different instructors and so forth and
here's also scenic rods that are
available to you so I mean it the scenic
rides when I first saw him I thought oh
this is gonna be ridiculous and stupid I
have no interest in it but after I did a
couple of them I was just like I do them
all the time now because it's a great
way to relax you could see all the
different types of music that's
available with all the classes there's
all the different types of rides you can
take beginner low-impact rhythm metrics
heart rate power zones I mean it's just
ridiculous
there's numerous different times so if
you only have 5 minutes or 10 minutes or
15 minutes or if you have a 120 minutes
there's a class at all those different
time lengths you can see a list of all
the instructors a lot of these
instructors from what I gather they've
sort of been stolen from the best cycle
studios
so I mean these I've done 12 classes so
far and every instructors been fantastic
now of course I like the different ones
there's my name I am bananas is my name
one teletón and there I am making a
grimace you can see there's my 12 rides
you can see the different achievements
that I've reached and you can have this
be a peloton can be used for people that
are very competitive or if you're not
competitive it doesn't matter but it if
you are competitive it's the place to be
because you're competing against real
people live and it is ridiculous you can
see there my output the kilojoules has
improved ever since I got the peloton
which means I'm getting results I'm able
to drive my heart rate as you're gonna
see through the roof on this which I
couldn't do without potentially hurting
myself if I was running and so you know
that's what I'm talking about and we're
a stationary bike really comes in you
could see all the statistics also has a
heart rate monitor which I didn't show
and you can see right here my overall
output across that you can see where I
placed sixth out of I don't know five
thousand people or something like that
which was ridiculously cool but like I
said if you're not into that competition
you don't have to worry about it it
doesn't peloton doesn't force you to do
that and the instructors don't like
scream at you good or nothing like that
it's there we're all pretty cool you can
see there it might change a resistance
might change in speed my distance you
can see how many calories I burned over
the course of the ride and so forth and
so on
and you can see there my max heartrate
154 you know getting your heart rate up
that high it just it's the help it's if
you want to be healthy it's the way to
get healthy and that's why ultimately I
love the the bike is because it it I'm a
computer programmer I sit at a desk all
day
so without things like this or a
treadmill you know whenever it's five
degrees outside I would be out of shape
I would be ill and ultimately I love
this bike because it allows me to be
healthy and being healthy is like the
only thing I spend any money on you can
see
or the different instructors that I had
so for everybody I think probably is
gonna like different instructors I don't
know um I I own purpose tried to use the
different instructors rather than Ali
love was my favorite so far she's just
fits my personality she might rob other
people the wrong way I know that Cody's
like a big guy that a lot of people like
also as well so you know there's just an
overview of some of the different
classes I'll provide a link also in the
description where you can click and you
can see how a class actually runs it's
basically just personal on a cycling you
know cycling and there's live DJs you
could I mean it's really really cool and
it's definitely something to look into
if you're into it and it's very easy you
can see my reflection very easy to set
up bluetooth this is all Android and
there's my my headphones wireless
headphones automatically connects to
that so really really cool stuff and
real happy about it
but you might say to yourself well what
about other stationary bikes because
there's obviously cheaper alternatives
and there most definitely is so I would
say based off of comparison comparing
the peloton to other different
alternatives basically if you go with a
sub $400 bike or a trainer what trainers
just like a thing you clip on to the
back of your back tire - real bikes of a
real bicycle and then go that's like the
cheapest way of doing this and if you're
into that go with a trainer there's only
these are the negatives though with a
trainer you are going to shred your
tires potentially you could get really
flat tires or use old tires whatever
it's just up to you another thing is
that's gonna be friction based so that
is going to me and it's not gonna feel
like you're riding on a road another
issue is going to be if you get a sub
400 all or spin bike or stationary bike
don't expect any support I can tell you
exactly with the peloton I did need
support because of the delivery company
not necessarily because of peloton and I
can tell you you you hear about people
buying expensive cars I don't have an
expensive quarter I think I mentioned it
earlier I've like a 20 year old car I
drive so there's no reason for me to
have a fancy car okay
so basically you talk about people who'd
have like really expensive cars and the
level of support they receive this is
the first product I have ever purchased
in my life I can say for a fact that I
feel kind of special for having it in US
and it's ridiculous if you call support
you get through almost immediately and I
have never dealt with a company where
you get almost immediate telephone
support they answer the phone and they
go out of the way to fix things
same thing with email if you send them
an email you're gonna get a response you
know as long as it's during business
hours within an hour or do you get
support like that um you are paying for
the best with this I mean you're you
that's just simply the way that it works
so you might say to yourself well maybe
that support doesn't matter to me and
rather than get a friction based bike I
want to get say a thousand dollar
stationary bike what are gonna be the
issues with that your main issue is
going to be your flywheel weight and I
can use the NordicTrack
gram tour as an example of that the
Grand Tour flywheel is a 16 pound
flywheel that means that if you're going
nuts the bikes gonna be going nuts also
and like I said before it's if it's a
light flywheel it's not going to feel
like a real bike another thing is is
you're gonna have plastic everywhere
you're not gonna have powder-coated
steel you're gonna have a potential
bicycle that's going to rust so if
that's okay then and you don't you know
you just a thousand dollars for a bike
sounds better for you then go that route
but like you said that these are just
the different things you're giving up
depending upon your different price
points so you might say well how about I
go to 1,500 or 2,000 or you know just a
bike that is compared to a pallet on
price wise what am I basically giving up
well I looked at those as well
basically for some reason the screen on
the peloton which I didn't even mention
is a 21 inch screen it's huge
wit it is the only stationary bike that
has any establishment that established
time to it that has a screen that huge
and it does make a difference it's very
very cool and it's immersive whenever
you have a screen that big for some
reason you the 1500 and 2000 dollar spin
bike stationary bikes that are out there
are and which is how much to 2 grand is
how much a peloton cost um with before
discounts and I can also provide a
discount code in the description but
basically they have crappy screens you
know like I'm talking grayscale screens
so they might be powder coated owns and
rust-resistant but basically you're
giving up on the screen for basically
the same price so there's an overview of
my experience with the peloton hopefully
that answers some questions that you
might have and I answer all my YouTube
comments if you have any other questions
feel free to leave those down in the
comment section below and hopefully this
helped you in one way or another either
way I'm always happy to help and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
