2 of my angularjs tutorial once again
I'm going to continue teaching angularjs
by providing a ton of examples and in
this tutorial we're going to focus in on
teaching form validation using route
scope to share data between controllers
I'm also going to cover controller
inheritance filters as well as how to
create custom filters and of course if
you haven't watched part 1 of this
tutorial series you absolutely have to
otherwise you might be quite confused
and just like always all the code is
available in a link in the description
underneath the video so I have a lot to
do so let's get into it okay just like
in a previous tutorial I have the Adam
text editor over here and I have Google
Chrome over here and this is where I'm
going to write all of my code I'm going
to start off here by adding in another
style and you can see all the styles and
everything you know what cloak does
you've seen that before you can pause
the screen if you want to type all that
in or of course you could get the code
and what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to add a style there's something
called ng dirty and what that means is
whenever an input box or element is
going to be edited in some way it's
going to change ng dirty to true so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to say
that I want to change the style on the
input if ng dirty is indeed true and the
information inside of it is also
considered invalid we'll get more into
that here in a second and I'm going to
say that I want to change the border
color on that input box to red ok so
just some simple styling there now I'm
going to come down here and start
working with our controller so I'm
define a div inside of here and
go ng-controller is going to be equal to
and I'm going to do G list controller
this is going to be a grocery list that
we'll be able to add to I'm going to do
a little bit of review of course just
because that's going to help a lot and
then I'll get into nothing but brand new
information so we're going to have our
grocery list I'm going to create a table
inside of this and let's go and have a
table heading and a table row and then
we're going to have an item which is
going to be some type of grocery item
and then we're going to also say whether
that grocery our item has been purchased
or not and then we're going to close off
or heading section and then inside of
this we are going to use ng-repeat just
like we did previously and we're going
to cycle through and get our different
grocery items and have them populate our
table and groceries and then close that
off and then inside of here we'll have
each of the grocery items automatically
thrown inside of there so grocery item
and I'm going to create those in the
JavaScript part here in a second and
before I close that off I'm also going
to come in here and throw in throw this
in between TD tags and I'm also going to
come in and throw in a checkbox on
whether the item has been purchased or
not and here I'm going to have this be a
checkbox then I want to bind my checkbox
to my data model so I'm going to go ng
model equal to and I'm going to go
grocery purchased and of course close
that off and then underneath of this
let's close off our table altogether and
I'm also going to allow the user to
enter in new information so let's throw
in a label and we'll have this be new
item and then we could throw an input
box inside of here we'll go and have
whether it's been purchased or not we'll
just have it by default B not purchased
because that makes sense and we'll have
this B new item and then whenever they
click on the button that's automatically
going to add this information into our
scope
so we'll say ng click and we're going to
call the method add item and pass in the
new item that they just added in there
and then for this button text we'll just
have this be new item and then if
there's some type of error we're also
going to cover that so we'll say if
there is an error we want to come in
here and populate this this were going
to get a lot more complicated here
whenever we get form validation but this
is just going to be sort of like a look
into the world of form validation and of
course this is where we're going to pull
in a the angularjs library as well as
our JS file make sure that this matches
up with the name exam 5j s now we'll
jump over into exam 5 J s and start
working with that so of course we're
going to need to come in here and create
our controller and it's going to have
the same name as we defined right here
sorry if this is a little bit basic for
people that already know this is where
that's coming from so much we'll just
copy that paste that inside out of there
and then we'll go function and we need
to use scope so we'll throw a scope
inside of there and then we're going to
throw some cans grocery items inside of
here just to start off so we'll just
call this groceries and then we'll
create an array out of this and just
like we saw previously we're going to
have item and we'll have something like
tomatoes and we're also going to check
if the item has been purchased or not so
we're going to say purchased and by
default we're going to have those all be
false and throw a couple more grocery
items inside of there and then we're
going to have to catch any time we
receive a new item as we saw over here
whenever we click on this button down
here this guy right here we're going to
have to create this add item inside of
rjs code so I'm going to say scope dot
add item and we'll define that function
and we'll just leave the name be the
same new item and then we'll do some
validation here to make sure that
everything looks okay so we can check
that our inbox has a value so we could
do something like if not and then we'll
go new item is equal to undefined and
the or new item doesn't have a value so
we're basically checking that new
there are those are going to be true in
that situation we know we can add in our
new item to our rat so we'll just throw
this on our groceries array push it on
and then we just say item new item and
we'll go and put purchased by default is
going to be false and then we can come
in and go with scope again and since we
didn't have an error that we want to
print out we can just set this new
missing new item error and we can just
set that nothing doing a lot of
reviewing here a while at the same time
covering a couple of new things as well
and then in a situation which we do have
an error which would occur any of those
things are true we want to come in here
and change the value of that and of
course that's automatically going to
update and we'll say something like
please enter an item just to keep that
nice and simple and if we reload it you
can see right here grocery list
now let's shrink that down a little bit
hopefully can still see that so it's the
grocery list tomatoes potatoes Dada Dada
let's say we click on add item you can
see please enter an item pops up there
that's this guy right here and otherwise
we could come in and say something like
lettuce and they let you can see lettuce
went in there alright so that's one way
that we can add items to different
arrays and doing some error checking as
well which is quite useful to know so
now let's get into a little bit more
complicated types of form validation now
that we have the basics of that down
so I'm jump back over inside of here
again and of course we're going to have
to create a new controller for ourselves
so let's go in and say div ng controller
is equal to and user control put that in
there so we know what we're looking at
alright so what we're going to do here
is we're going to create a form and this
is going to pass our user data to a
method called save user and we're going
to do a whole bunch of different things
with form validation here first off and
we give this the name of user form which
is going to be important because we need
to refer to that and then we'll also
define where we are going to be
submitting this data and that's going to
be in a method we're going to create
here in a moment called save user and
we're going to
Passover userinfo inside of it close
that off and then close off our form now
what we're going to do here is we're
going to receive a first name and what
we want to define also is whenever they
enter a first name that the length of
the first name is at least two
characters in length first thing we're
going to need to do is do a label and
we'll just do first name just to keep
that simple
then we're going to define an input box
that we're going to be able to work with
here
and we're going to give this a name a
name of fname the model for this is
going to be equal to user info F name
and then we can define some requirements
we want to have inside of here so let's
say that we want this to be required for
them to be able to submit the
information well we just go ng required
true that's set and then remember we
also wanted to make sure the minimum
length of the data that they entered is
going to be make sure you put a space in
between ur is going to be have a minimum
length up to and then we done we got
that all set up now we can come down
here and create a span and this is
basically going to cover our error
messages that we want displayed if they
don't follow the rules that we're going
to be defining and we're basically going
to say we're going to say that ng-show
which means show the error message
that's what we're saying here this is
going to show if userform remember I
said we're going to have to define our
form here so user form this is what
we're referring to right here user form
dot F name dirty which means that it has
been entered and this error message oh
if the input box has been changed in
some way as well as if the user form dot
F name error required so if it's a
required piece of data that we need and
the user form has been entered or the
input element has been changed in some
way then we want to output this error
message so we'll say something like must
enter a first name
we'll close off our span and there you
go there's some error checking and we
could also throw in another span and
what this span is going to do is it's
going to be a special error message
that's going to show up if the minimum
length requirements haven't been met so
we're going to do pretty much exactly
the same thing as well just copy this
paste that inside of there we're gonna
have to speak again and in this
situation we're going to go use a form
dirty we're going to check that it has
been changed and then down here we'll
just go F name error and then the error
that we're looking for in this situation
is that the minimum length requirements
have been met and that's fine and then
we'll just say must be a minimum of two
characters sorry if there's anybody out
there in the world only has one
character in their name whatever all
right so we have that all set up so that
we will be able to validate the first
name for our people and our entering
information I can just come in here and
copy this because I'm going to do the
same exact thing for our last name let's
just paste that in there there we go
and the thing here of course we want to
come in and change this to last name
it's basically everywhere we have F
we're going to change that to L okay so
we're doing validation on the first and
last name first one's kind of
interesting but the last name got a
little bit boring so let's do something
else now we're going to commit here and
do some validation on the street that
they're going to enter for us so we're
going to say Street and create a label
for that and you can do some really neat
validation so we'll say again this is
going to be text and we'll give it the
name of street and once again we're
going to do ng-model is equal to and
we're going to have this tied to that
form again user info and we're going to
tie that to the user info object again
so user info Street we're going to say
that this is going to be required again
course in this situation we're going to
say that the min length and there's also
a max length which is just ng max length
and we'll just say that this has to be
six and then what's really neat is we
can throw
in a regular expression that we want to
check the data against and we can just
throw in a regular expression that we
know is going to work for us and I have
tutorials on regular expressions if you
want to know what all this stuff means
but I'm just not going to cover that at
this point in time and then we can cover
our error messages that are going to
display so once again class error
message this is going to show in this
situation just like previously if user
forum Street has been changed which
means it's going to come back positive
with dirty and user forum Street comes
back as invalid and we'll say something
like must enter a number Street and
Street type and it will do like an
example for them and if I will close off
that span now let's say we want to do
some validation on a check box
I can just go label like it's a
subscription-based thing if they want to
subscribe to something or not we can do
that and then do input type is equal to
check box name is going to be equal to
subscribe the ng model is going to be
user info and tie that to that object
once again and subscribe and then we're
going to say that the value that we want
to assign to this check box if it is
checked as true is going to be the word
subscribe we can also come in and define
the value that's going to be associated
if this is unchecked and in that
situation well first off we're going to
make sure we put single quotes up here
around this and single quotes around
this and then the value is going to be
don't subscribe make sure you backslash
that and then close off that check box
and in this situation it doesn't make
sense for us to say that we require it
because then we wouldn't be able to get
input if they didn't subscribe so that's
the reason why we didn't require that
let's come in here and define a delivery
method like let's say this is some sort
of newsletter or something they're
subscribing to I don't know this is just
something I'm making out of the top of
my head
so we'll say a label once again and
we'll do a select box in this situation
so name is equal to have this
the delivery option ngmodel is going to
be user info delivery and then in this
situation we are going to require this
so we'll say required is equal to true
and then inside of here we can define a
couple different options so the first
one is that our newsletter is going to
be delivered by email and the section
option or the second option is that it's
going to be delivered by mail so let's
just change this to mail so we're going
to allow them to sign up for a snail
mail newsletter it's kind of silly but
whatever just came to mine close that
select box off now of course we're also
going to have to have a way for them to
send us this information so we'll come
in here and this type is going to be a
submit and let's give this a value of
save and if we want to disable the
buttons we can do that
so we'll say disabled is equal to and
here we can go and refer to the form
itself and if anything is invalid which
means that it hasn't been input well
then the button will remain disabled
until they enter all of our information
that we asked for and then the final
thing we can do here is output all of
our users directly on the screen so we
can see that everything is working for
us so we'll just go Li and do another
ng-repeat
is equal to and we'll say item in user
and then we'll output all the different
information we want to output let's come
in here close that off first so we can
say something like user and put the
username and we'll get the first name
for all of our different users and we'll
get our last name of course and the
street address whether they decided to
subscribe or not or how they decided to
as well is the delivery method that
to item delivery and there we go that's
all we're going to need on the HTML side
now we're going to jump over into the
JavaScript now we're going to need a new
controller for all of this information
we have here and the name of our
controller or is it forgot what I even
called it it's user control this guy
right here so let's create a new
controller app 5 controller and this is
user controller function and we're going
to need scope again and we'll go scope
let's throw a user in here just start
off everything just so that we see
something and I'll just use myself here
first name after this and we're going to
have to define the save user of course
which is this guy let's go up to the top
of the form save user and then we're
going to pass in the user info object
that's going to contain all of our
information so I'm going to have to come
in here and define that of course
so we'll say scope save user and this
function is going to be receiving our
user information now let's do a little
bit of verification to make sure that
this is okay so we'll say something like
if scope user form comes back as valid
well then we can say scope user and push
on the new information that was passed
over to us and that's going to be the
first name and how we get access to that
first in first name information is just
referring to the object that was passed
over into this guy so we'll go F name
and then we're going to do the same
thing for all the other different parts
and there's all the other different
pieces and we could save that and then
let's say that we want to output a
little message to our console something
like user saved so that we can check
that we actually saved a user and then
else if there was something that was
invalid we want to output a little bit
of information about it being an invalid
so we'll just say error and there we go
that's all of our code let's reload it
and there you can see all the new
information we have here first name last
name street subscribe dah dah dah dah
say something like Paul Smith 234 Main
Street subscribed delivery method email
you can see down here is all the other
information I have down there I also see
that I forgot to add a little bit
information in here being the street say
1 2 3 Main Street let's reload it again
there you can see now all the
informations down there oops made a
little bit of an error let's come back
over here this has to be minimum length
like that and those will all show up and
one like this fine right there I'm in
length change that right there min link
there is 6 and reload it now you can see
if we reload it if I type in P must be a
minimum of two characters shows up right
there I type in PA you can see that
that's not perfectly fine we're also
going to see the same sort of similar
things right here we type in Smith if we
come down here you're also going to see
that same error and if we go and don't
put anything in must enter our last name
is going to show up inside of there
let's verify that if we come in here and
go 1 2 3 M it's going to say that we
have to enter in specific information
and if we type in main that's still not
going to work Street all of a sudden
that goes away there's no validation on
the subscribe you can see here that the
button is still disabled because I
haven't put in a delivery method but if
I put in delivery method that works and
if I hit on save you're going to see
that Paul Smith is automatically entered
into our scope so pretty cool stuff now
I'm going to jump over and show you how
to use root scope to share data between
two controllers ok so now I just change
this to app 6 and I'm in my angular Tut
6 dot HTML file cloaks inside of there
don't need to do any other styling this
is going to be a real simple thing where
we're basically going to be able to
enter and then access information on
superheroes so just to keep it simple
I'm going to create a label you want to
have this
hero to search for let's close off our
label and there's going to be an input
box type is going to be equal to text
and ngmodel is going to be equal to hero
name and then underneath that we're just
going to have a button and add a click
event to it and the click event is going
to call a method called get hero data
which we're going to create in a second
and we'll just have this B's submit and
then whenever we find this hero data if
we can we're going to display it
directly underneath here and that's it
that's going to be our first controller
let's jump over and actually create all
the code for that
so we'll go app-6 and define our
controller and it's going to be called
hero controller of course because that's
what we called it over in our HTML file
so this is going to be a function and
this is going to receive scope but it's
also going to receive root scope and
this is going to allow me to update
information between two controllers as
you're going to see here in a second you
can't just do that with scope because if
you use a controller twice on one page
each controller has its own scope so you
can update the scopes using root scope
but you can't do it with a shared
regular old scope okay doesn't work that
way so we need to use root scope if we
want to be able to update information so
I'm going to throw in some canned
superheroes here and then after this
we're going to have to define the
function get hero data for this guy so
use get hero data so we're gonna have to
define that guy as well so we'll say
scope get hero
data and function and we're gonna search
through our array of superheroes I'm
going to actually create this in a
different function so I'm going to call
that function hero search and pass
inside of it hero name that we're going
to be searching for and then let's
create the function get hero data so
it's a function hero search it's going
to be passed a named search for I'm
going to go scope hero data and let's
have it be not found by default and then
we'll search through everything so to do
that we'll go
variable I is equal to zero we're going
to continue searching through here as
long as we have heroes so you're seeing
here how to search through a list of
arrays in a scope that's what I mean
when I say and a whole lot more so also
we're going to say if scope hero I hero
name is equal to the name that we are
searching for well then when you go
scope hero data is equal to let's go
hero I and get the real name for our
hero plus and then we could say is scope
zero I and have the real name for our
superhero
and that'll be displayed on our screen
but we also want to way for them to add
heroes so let's jump back over into
angular tut six and for this we're going
to use another controller we're going to
keep everything all in the same type of
area so we're going to have this be hero
control once again and here we're just
going to allow them to enter a new hero
name so they'll have the hero name and
then an input box and then we'll have ng
model is equal to hero name and then
we'll throw in another label because
we're also going to have to get the
heroes real name this and then we'll
just change this to real name and then
we'll have to put in a button that's
going to call for our function to
execute so we'll say whenever this
button is clicked on we want to call a
function called add hero data and it's
going to be passed the real name as well
as the hero name and then we'll just
give this add as a name and then button
to close that off that's all we need to
for the HTML jump over here and define
our other controller and then down its
side of here what we're going to need to
do is whenever a new hero is added we're
going to need to broadcast the update to
the other controller scope so to do that
we're going to say scope add hero data
function and real name and hero name and
then we'll have to go route scope and we
want to broadcast the change that we
have a new hero being added and we're
going to call this broadcast here
dated and then the information that
we're going to be passing into this
close that off and the new data is going
to be real name and then it's going to
be real name again and hero name and
hero name again and then we could just
to check our if any errors come through
we can just go console.log then we're
going to have to have a way to catch
this broadcast and then update the scope
in both controllers and to do that we go
scope on whenever there's a broadcast
called hero updated hero update is the
name of it hero updated is what we got
right there well in the situation in
which we have a broadcast and we catch
it catch an event and we're also going
to catch the arguments that are passed
these are the arguments that are passed
those guys down there and to catch it
we'll go scope and we will push it on to
our hero alright we'll just go real name
: and to get it we'll go args real name
that's how we get ahold of those and
then the hero name is going to be args
your own name OOP have a little bug here
go up here and make sure this is root
scope sorry about that
if I'll save that reload it here or to
search for if I type in Batman
and here hit submit Bruce Wayne is
Batman shows up there if I type in flash
submit not found shows up I can then go
flash and Barry Allen I think that's
always spell isn't it ad and now if we
come up here have flash submit Barry
Allen is flash ok so that's how we use
root scope to be able to pass in data
between two different controllers and
now I'm going to show you exactly how
controller inheritance works now in
explaining controller inheritance I'm
going to use an example that shows you
just exactly how much this is like
regular old object-oriented programming
so I'm going to create a controller I'm
going to call this main controller and
create our function here now what I'm
going to do is to find two fields that
are going to be bound to this controller
and I'm going to use an example of
what's called a scope list controller
using this instead of scopes or we can
say this
name for example and I'm going to use
the classic animal explanation of how
object-oriented programming works so
there you go and then I'm also going to
bind a method to this controller and
it's going to be called animal click and
whenever you click on this it's going to
output some information and to keep this
very simple I'm just going to have an
alert box pop-up and then we can output
the name of the animal as well as the
sound okay so that's all we're going to
do for that guy right there now I'm
going to create another one so app seven
again and controller and this one is
going to be a dog
controller and function and the
controller service is going to allow us
to instantiate a controller inside of
another controller so we're going to
need that so I'm going to say something
like child controller is equal to this
and then I'm going to create an instance
of our parent controller so I'm going to
go child controller child is equal to
and here we can use controller and then
pass inside of it main control with our
curly brackets and then I can come in
here and overwrite things so let's say
that I want to overwrite the parent name
field well I can just come in and go
child controller child name and let's
change the name for this guy to dog
instead there we go I can also define a
field for our child
so we'll just go child controller again
child bark is equal to wolf we can also
come in and extend the child controller
by declaring our own methods so let's go
child controller and child and let's
create a function called dog data is
equal to function and we'll open up
another alert box and this is all we're
gonna do this is enough to pretty much
show mostly well all that you'd ever
want to know about this concept this
sound and this bark and there we go and
now we'll jump over into the HTML and
show you how all of this is going to
work okay so now what we're going to do
as I'm going to create a div of course
and this is going to be our controller
and then I'm going to go main control
and I'll be able to refer to this as
parent in this example and now we can
display some of the information we have
inside of this controller so we could
say name and we could put just refer to
it as parents name and that's going to
output that on the screen for us and we
could also go and have sound of course
because that's the other thing that we
have saved inside of there so let's
change this to sound and let's issue a
button here and ng click in in this
situation we're going to refer to the
animal click function that we created
which is going to output information
about our animal in this situation
animal data and button and then break
and that's all we're going to do with
that because I'm going to show you now
what's going to happen with the other
controller as well just copy this paste
that inside of there and instead this is
going to be dog control and then we'll
define this as dog doesn't really matter
what that is and now what we're going to
be able to do is get access to that
information by going dog child name and
then we'll also be able to come in and
do the same thing dog child sound get
access to that also do a button click
except here what we're going to do is
call the parent method using the dog
fields that have been updated so we'll
be able to come in and call our super
controller or however you want to refer
to let us by going dog child animal
click and that's going to call the other
one except I'm going to call this dog
data we're also going to be able to come
in here and call the methods that are
specific to our dog controller and this
is going to be dog child and we'll
instead say a dog data we'll just say
more dog data or a button then we're
going to also be able to come in here
and change field values
so we'll just go ng-model and refer to
dog child bark I want to change the bark
for our dog and let's also output that
change on to the screen so we'll go new
bark and that's of course just going to
be dog child bark and if we save that
reload it you're gonna see right here
named animal sound ger dog data is gonna
open up the alert that says animal says
ger you see here is the change ding dog
as well as ger even though we called the
parent version of that method dog data
dog says ger like that and more dog data
and dog says ger and wolf it will also
be able to come in here and say wolf
wolf and change those values so there is
an example on class inheritance and now
to finish off everything I'm going to go
into a deep example in regards to how we
can use filters so I'm going to have
three files now I'm going to have
angular Tut eight HTML filters Jas and
exam eight Jas and I'm going to have the
filters J's file in the Jas folder of
course and basically filters are going
to allow us to transform data in the
view without altering it in the scope
and to use filters you're going to use
the pipe character as you're going to
see in a second so I'm going to create a
controller again and let's just keep
this as main controller and we could do
something like use convert whatever data
we have here into uppercase
so we're going to take whatever input
they provide to us and convert it into
uppercase text analysis ng model is
equal to I'll just put a name inside of
there and then paragraph and we will
output the uppercase version of whatever
they gave to us and to do that we'll use
the pipe character that got right there
and then we just put uppercase inside of
there and lowercase is going to be
pretty much exactly the same let's go
and just demonstrate that right out here
let's convert this to a lowercase and
then just change this to lowercase oh we
might as well do a couple of these let's
also go and cover currency which is
another filter so we'll just change this
to currency filter you'll see what these
do here in a second type Mg model we'll
just have this B change the money and
then here we'll change this to currency
and then we'll change
it in our money and then we'll change
this to currency there that is and if we
reload it we can type in a name and you
can see there is uppercase as well as
lowercase and then here we could go
da-da-da-da-da and you can see that it
automatically throws the dollar sign on
there now let's take a look at what is
referred to oddly enough as the filter
filter what we're going to do here is
output some information so I'm gonna
have to jump over here and create some
information and our J's file so I went
and threw in some dummy information you
can pause the screen here if you want to
type all this in basically I just create
an array of objects that are going to
have a name as well as a GPA and you can
see there's a student list as well in
which we have an array called GPAs with
all those objects listed inside of there
I'm also defining a date as well as a
random string and a random array so
we're going to be using all of those
over in the HTML using a whole bunch of
different filters so let's save that now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
cycle through this information with an
unordered list so I'm going to use
ng-repeat to cycle through this
information and the information I want
to cycle through is going to be student
GPAs so we come over here student GPA is
this guy right here that's what I'm
going to be cycling through and to do so
I'm going to go in student GPAs and then
here we'll have our filter and I'm going
to go student name and then I want to
order by GPA so I'm going to list all
these students out in order based off of
what the GPA of the student is then we
can come in and define our name so name
plus and get the student name that was
saved inside of there and just put a
colon aside of their GPA plus and
students get the GPA for the student and
then close off that list item and reload
it and you can see right there all the
students listed and there are the GPAs
and if we want this to go in the
opposite order just put a negative sign
inside of there and reload it and now
you can see it goes from the highest GPA
to the lowest GPA so there's the filter
filter we also have the number
turn which is kind of neat let's go in
here and throw a label inside of their
number filter and we'll get some input
and this is going to be regular text
ngmodel
and we'll just have this be number value
and I'll throw in there's a bunch of
different things we can do here we'll do
the default and we'll get a number value
pipe and number close that off and I'll
show you a couple other different ones
here show you two different ones
we'll say here if we don't want to have
fractions I will say no fractions and to
use that we have number and then at the
end of it we put a colon in 0 that means
no fractions and then let's say that we
want to have negative numbers with four
decimal maximums do that and then we'll
just leave this be well let's change
this to negative a number so that now
it's negative and if we want to be for
maximum there we are and reload it you
can see the number filter over here and
I can go one two three four five you can
see here no fractions show up in here we
limit this to well let's let's go and
throw a six in here you'll see this
turns into a six you can see that it
rounds and there we are so there's the
number filter you can play around with
that a lot more let's go and create
another filter or look at another filter
this one is the date filter and there
are a ton of different things you can do
with dates but what I'm going to do here
is just show you two examples and we
already have a date defined so that's
our current date so I'm going to be
manipulating our current date so come in
get the current date and call the date
filter on this and let's just do medium
just sort of like a default for this guy
and then let's go and do a lure
elaborate one sews a date too
and here we'll go current date and a
filter and a date and then here we can
define exactly what we want so we could
say a month day year and then if we want
to say something like at or put at in
the middle there make sure you put that
little single quotes around that and
then we could say hours and minutes and
then our little attribute that's going
to be a.m. or p.m. and there's a link in
the code to all the other different
things
we can do with the date filter and you
can see right there an example of how
that's going to look could also use
another filter called limit 2 and that's
going to allow us to limit things like
strings there's this string right here
I'm going to cut this down to only 10
characters and then we're also going to
do an example with this random array
where we're going to cut that down or
limit the number of items that get
printed out on the screen so we'll have
our default and our default is just
going to print out on the string out on
the screen I mean and that's going to be
the random string and now I will apply a
filter to it and I'll say 10 characters
is all that we want to display so we'll
go random string again and call our
filter and the filter is limit to and
we'll say we only want the first 10
characters to print out and now we can
go in here and also limit the array so
let's go and create an unordered list
inside of here Li ng-repeat is equal to
cycle through our array in random array
and I just showed you a second ago what
that's going to look like and if we want
to limit the number of items that come
out on our screen we just go limit to
let's say we just want the first three
items that's how easy that is and then
we just want to output whatever the item
is goes off that list item was off that
unordered list closed off that paragraph
and reload and you can see right here
this has been cut down to only 10
characters and then right here we're
only getting the first three from the
array because we use limit two so now
what we're going to do is create a
custom filter so let's go into filter
CAS and what this filter is going to do
is it's going to output different
Unicode characters I'm going to either
so a sunshine picture or a umbrella
depending upon whether information so
what we need to do to create a custom
filter once again this is going to be in
filter CAS in our J's folder is we're
going to create a module so let's go
angular module and I'm going to give it
the name of whether filters whether
filters doesn't have any dependencies
and then we're going to come in and go
filter and the name for the filter is
raining so basically this filter is
saying is
raining or not and it's going to react
in different ways depending upon whether
a variable or a value is equal to true
or false define our function inside of
here close that off and let's also close
off the module itself then we're going
to go return depending upon input that
we receive input and if the inputs value
assigned you're going to see what this
means here in second comes back as true
we are going to return a Unicode
character make sure you put this inside
of single quotes we're going to return a
Unicode character of two 6:02 which is
an umbrella and otherwise we are going
to return a unicode character which is a
sunshine or the Sun or whatever so real
simple type of filter just wanted to
give a real easy to understand example
here now I need to go into here and this
is the exam ACS file and I'm going to
define different weather information so
scope weather is equal to I'm going to
throw two different objects inside here
so let's say it's like a weather report
for Monday and then we're also going to
have is it going to rain true or false
and then we're going to do exactly the
same thing for Tuesday
now save that jump over into our HTML
file we'll just zoom up here so you can
see everything and let's create a
paragraph and we'll just define this as
an unordered list and then we'll cycle
through the list items item in weather
which is that object array that we just
created and then we'll go item de plus
just throw like a colon inside of there
and then outside of that here we're
going to use our custom filter and we'll
go item rain and we'll check if it's
raining or not it's going to output
different information depending upon
whether that is true or false
look at this again say this guy right
here that's what we're looking at and
raining is the name of our filter
there's our filter and then close off
that list and save it and reload and it
was a little bit of an error and the
reason why there's an error is I forgot
to come in here and
clewd my filter so I'm going to come in
here and do that so script source is
equal to nsj filters dot J s close that
off and close off the script tag and if
we reload it you can see down here
Monday is listed as a Sun and Tuesday is
listed as an umbrella so here you go
guys that is a ton of information about
angularjs and I'm going to make at least
one more video on angularjs to cover
everything else that I haven't covered
so far and before I leave I want to
thank all the people that are supporting
me on patreon the reason why I'm able to
continue making videos like that I'm
making right here is because of all you
guys and I just want to say thank you
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
