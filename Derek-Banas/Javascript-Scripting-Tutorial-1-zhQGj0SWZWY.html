while since my last post and you can
guarantee that if I'm do not post for a
couple days that means that I'm either
dead which I'm not obviously or I'm
working on a big project and here is the
beginning of it I'm going to completely
teach you everything --gel thing there
is to know about JavaScript first off
what is JavaScript well we already know
if you see my other tutorials HTML
specializes in structuring the website
CSS or cascading style sheets styles the
text and handles the layout of the
website but what JavaScript does is it's
a scripting language that allows you to
make your site more interactive now
going back to the fact that HTML provide
structure by surrounding all of the
content on your web page with tags if
you don't know what this means that
means you haven't seen my HTML tutorial
javascript can manipulate HTML tags
through the use of event handlers will
cover that embed validate form
information change CSS styling and store
information on the visitors computer
here's a brief explanation of event
handlers an event handler is an alarm
that alerts JavaScript code to do
something if the alarm has been
triggered by the some action the visitor
has performed now some of these actions
could be just simply loading your page
if that handlers can notify JavaScript
code also if the mouse pointer touches
any tag and event handlers can notify
code if a person would click on anything
obviously along with a whole host of
other things so where do you write your
JavaScript code well there's actually
two ways just like cascading style
sheets you can either embed directly
into the HTML and you would do that by
using the script tag followed by type
quote text forward slash JavaScript and
then type out all your code and end that
with a closing script tag or you can
link to an external javascript file and
you would do that by just simply typing
script language followed by the actual
location of that draw the script code
and if you want it to hide your script
from browsers that don't recognize
is javascript code or have JavaScript
enabled you would simply embed it by
using the same exact opening phrase then
followed by the HTML comment that we see
right here before we have high
JavaScript then you would have your
JavaScript code and then you would
follow that up with a fourth line down
followed by the script closing tag here
is some JavaScript basics what are
functions functions are groupings of
statements that you can type once and
then use over and over again we'll get
more into that
what are loops use looping statements to
perform a repetitive action over and
over until some condition is met here's
an example add 1 to this number over and
over again until it is equal to 10,000
and we have conditionals conditionals
provide you with the ability to do one
thing if something is true and do
another thing if it is false for example
if your friend buys you a gift on your
birthday you would think it if your
friend did not you would punch him
there's a conditional variables are
simply locations that you define you
want to store information in for example
you store your receipts and checks in a
box named taxes so that you know where
to find them come tax day think of a
variable as a label box you store stuff
in now we're moving on to functions and
operators javascript includes many
functions that will perform common
actions for you it has all of the common
operators such as addition subtraction
multiplication equals and division and
modulus a whole bunch of other thing
what are comments and how do you use
them in JavaScript JavaScript provides
you with the ability to leave notes or
comments inside of your code here you
would describe what the code is doing
you can define that something is a
comment by starting the line with the
two forward slashes and then everything
that follows till the end of the line
will be ignored or you could comment out
multiple lines by typing /startindent
0.0 /endindent
additional word in your function name be
capitalized then you would have the
arguments that you would like to pass to
your function followed by an opening
curly brace all of your JavaScript code
then you would use the return keyword to
send a value back to the code that
requested that the function perform
certain actions and then finally you
would close off the function with a
closing curly here's a real function
what this function does maybe add these
as simply adds two numbers assigns them
to the Voronoi to find your name total
and then returns total and you can see
down below here on the third bulleted
item you would call this by simply
typing in the name of the function
followed by two arguments that you
supply to it and then it would return
that value and assign it to addition in
this case or you could also embed the
function like we did here not only did
we send two arguments to the function
add these we also added two to the
result of that for loops a for loop
continues performing actions until a
condition is met quite simply this is
the basic structure of a for loop first
you have the keyword form followed by
your initial expression which will be a
value that you are going to perform
operations on then you have to define
how long this loop will continue until a
certain condition is met and then
finally you have the point in which you
would actually edit your expression can
see here I defined a variable named I
give the value of one and then I said
I'm going to continue looping as long as
I remains smaller than 100 then you can
see the shorthand version of increment
for the variable I all this does is
these two addition symbols is
continually adds one each time it loops
through then I use the document write
line function to output that value to
the screen we also have while loops a
while loop can also be used for looping
its basic structure to get the keyword
while followed by a condition then you
have your code and then finally you have
your iterator here's a real example
we're going to continue to look through
this while loop until I is either equal
to or greater than 100 and you can see
just like in the previous four loop of
performing the same act which is two
repetitively write the value of I to the
screen you can see the iterator down
there as well the do-while loop doesn't
check if the condition has been met
before executing the code that is what
differs it from the for as well as the
while what it does is it actually goes
through performs all the actions you
defined in your code and then at the end
checks to make sure the variable is less
than 100 real example of a do-while loop
first off it's going to output the value
of I to the screen that it's going to
add one to that value and then it's
going to check to make sure that I is
indeed less than one variables variables
are locations that you define you want
to store information
use the keyword var to tell the browser
you want to create a new place to store
information here's an example where I
created a variable name my email and
then assign to it the string which is my
email address it's considered good form
to start the name with a lowercase
letter and then capitalize each word
thereafter and here is an example of
that being done variables created the
inside of your functions are only
accessible inside of the function in
which they are declared remember that if
you want to be able to access a variable
anywhere make sure that you declare it
outside of all of your other functions
you should also never create two
variables with the same name javascript
is loosely typed what this means is most
languages require you to tell them what
types of information you will assign to
a variable javascript doesn't care
except for a few instances you can
assign a number to a variable name and
then assign a text value to that same
variable name and not throw an error for
example you can sort of the following
all in the same exact JavaScript
variable the number 1000 which in most
languages would be considered an integer
and you have an exponent with a thousand
zero be considered either a float or a
double and then you have actual text all
of those things can be stored one Java
variable here are some examples what
we're doing here is creating variable
named number one and
doing it the value fine then we're
taking another variable and assigning it
the string 10 you can see here whenever
we add these two variables together even
though one is a number and the other is
a string javascript goes even further
and outputs the value is 15
automatically and they have different
functions and operators in JavaScript
you have obviously the addition
subtraction multiplication the division
then you have the odd modulus which is
used to return the remainder of a
division of two numbers then you have
increment which is a shorthand way to
add one to a value decrement which is
actually two negative signs together
that's shorthand for subtracting one
from a value also there are operators
you've used or in your looping here
we're checking to see if X is equal to Y
X is less than Y X is greater than Y and
so forth and so and that is basically it
in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to
teach you everything about JavaScript
just as I have in all my other tutorials
by showing you real JavaScript code and
explaining how it works and yes indeed
everything will be covered till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
