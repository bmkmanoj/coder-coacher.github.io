13 in my c-sharp video tutorial this
one's going to be quite fun because
we're going to talk about manipulating
lists and really cool ways I'm going to
cover lambda where to list select zip
aggregate average all any distinct
except and intersect and like always all
the code as well as a transcript of this
video is available in the description
underneath the video and I have a lot to
do so let's get into it okay so here we
are back inside a visual studio and what
I'm going to do here is to create eight
delegates we're going to use delegates
once again and we're only going to use
it for one example though and I'm going
to call this double it and it's going to
receive a double and a value inside of
it and this delegate is going to be
assigned what we call a lambda
expression and I have to make sure I put
it inside of the class area here
otherwise we won't be able to see it so
let's just paste that inside of there
all right now we can jump down main and
start writing some code now like we did
with predicates earlier lambda
expressions are going to allow you to
use anonymous methods they define the
input parameters on the left and B code
to execute on the right so what I'm
going to do here is a sine a lambda to
the delegate that I just created here so
I'm going to say double its once again
and I'm just going to go double it and
and then here is where we are going to
define our lambda now like I said it's
going to receive a value on the left and
then it's going to perform an operation
on that value on the right right like
that so there we just created that now
what we're going to be able to do is and
this is a simple example we'll get into
more complicated things as this
continues now what I'm going to going to
do is I am going to call for it to
execute so I can say something like five
times two is equal to and then I can
reference and that delegate up is up
inside of there so we can say double it
like this
and then pass the five directly inside
of there and then close that off and if
we execute it you're going to see that
indeed that is going to double the
five whoops as I have an error with this
name double it doesn't exist in the
current context oh okay so I just forgot
to put the B inside of there no problem
get that and let's run it again and you
can see indeed it took the five multiply
2 times a 2 and we got a value of 10
okay so not terribly exciting but let's
go and let's create something a little
bit more complicated now you don't have
to use Delegates and here what I'm going
to do is search through a list to find
all the even numbers for example so
first what I want to do is I want to
create a list and it's going to be an
integer list and the go number list is
equal to new list and then we'll just go
and throw some random values inside here
so I'll throw one and nine and two and
six and three and then what my goal here
is to come in here and be able to find
just the even values and then what I'm
going to do after that is put those even
values and a list now we can just use
var here just to keep everything nice
and simple and I'm going to say that I
wanted an even list and to do that I
reference the number list that I want to
work with up inside here and then I can
use where and I can define inside of
here what specifically I'm looking for
so I'm looking for a situation in which
the parameter passed inside of it when
modulus of two is taken out against it
that we are going to get a value of zero
and that is how we're going to be able
to check if we have an odd number or not
because of course when you do the
modulus of an even value if it comes
back to zero that means it's odd we are
then going to convert this into a list
just to make this easy to work with and
then I can come in here and I'm going to
show you a couple other different ways
we can output list information I can go
in and check to make sure that this
indeed worked for me so we can go in to
console of course and let's just output
all of those guys on the screen so we go
and we run it you're going to see that
it just outputted two and six because
those are the only two even values
inside of our list all right it's a
pretty neat way to be able to do some
rather complicated things here now what
I want to do is show you how to add
values in a range to a list so we came
in again and I'm going to call this
range list is equal to I'm going to use
the number list that we already have
here and I'm going to say we're an
ex-member we're getting the value from
this list that we're working with and
I'm going to say that X is greater than
two or and then define another situation
X is less than 9 I'm then going to take
those results and convert those into a
list that we can work with and then
let's get rid of this right here so we
don't have any confusion just cut that
out of there and paste that down inside
of here and this is going to be changed
to range list and specifically we're
looking for values that are greater than
two and less than nine and if we run
that you're going to see that we get
actually now that I'm thinking about
this this makes more sense to have this
be and so I'm looking for values of x
that are greater than 2 but less than 9
just say that name let's run it and
you're going to see that 6 and 3 come
back as a result all right so another
way to sort through information and list
now let's do something a little bit more
interesting what I want to do here is
find the number of heads and tails that
are flipped randomly and what I'm going
to use just to keep everything simple is
1 is going to represent a head and 2 is
going to represent a tail so what I want
to do is come in here and define our
list and I'm going to call this flip
list is equal to new list like that and
then I'm going to come in here and
generate random values so I'm just going
to say I is equal to 0 I'm going to
generate a run the number generator is
equal a new random then I'm going to use
a while loop to fill this list up so I'm
going to say while I is less than 100
flip list and I'm going to add a either
a 1 or a 2 to this guy and to do that I
just go realms and next and I want to
get values from 1 to 2 so I'm going to
have to put 1 2 3 inside of there the 3
isn't counted and then I'm going to
increment the value for I all right so
that's how we're going to
create our list and then fill our list
up with information and now what I want
to do is come in here and using a lambda
I'm going to print out the number of
heads and number of tails that were
randomly generated for us so come in
there do this and I'm just going to say
heads and throw in whatever the value
for heads is going to be the number of
matches we got and to do so I can go
flip list and then we can say we're a
and this is going to be each value of
the list is going to come in here and
we're going to check if it's equal to
one then after that we can come in and
we can say two lists and then after that
we're going to count the number of
matches that we had all right so that's
going to tell us the number of heads and
this guy right here is going to tell us
the number of tails and I just need to
change that to two and that's going to
work for us if we save it and run it in
state lo it came back exactly 50/50
that's uncommon actually run it again
this time we've got 51 heads and forty
nine tails and let's run it one more
time and here we got 49 heads and 51
tails okay so pretty accurate
representation there and just another
example when we do one more let's try
finding all names that start with a
specific letter so just come in and if
our name list is equal to new list and
this is going to be strings and then
let's just throw some random names
inside of here so we got dug and we have
Sally and let's spell Sally right and we
have soup all right so we got the list
generated and now what we're looking to
do is find the number of names that have
a value of s starting off the names will
save or I'll call this s name list and
to check the name list we got a name
list and we're in here must say X is and
I'm going to pull in those values and I
can say X starts with and there we go so
we have that brand new guy right there
and then let's say I want to cycle
through all
these different guys so I can say for
each VAR m in s name list and then after
that we can in output all of the s names
inside of there so here we are and I'm
just going to output them not going to
do anything else fancy with it and we
can run it and you can see that it's
popped out Sally and Sue okay so some
neat stuff we can do with lambdas as
well as a couple other little neat
little pools and now I'm going to talk
about select alright so basically select
is going to allow us to execute a
function on each item in a list so what
we want to do is come in here and
generate a list of values let's say from
1 to 10 like this and new list and this
is going to be just integers and create
that guy now let's come in here and add
a range of values to this so I'll go add
range I'm on purpose using these same
things over and over again these
tutorials just so they sort of click in
your head and the range that I want is
one to ten there we go we have our list
now and how hard would it be to come in
here and get the square of all those
values and then store them in the list
well we can go for and squares is equal
to one two whoops
spell that right one to ten and then
select and then we are going to perform
land calculation on this it's going to
take the value and multiply it times
itself and store that in a list and then
we come in and output that information
once again and here what I'm going to do
is go to our L in squares and then
output each one of those values so I
like this and then we'll just have L and
we'll run it and you can see it went
through each one of those values and
multiply it times itself okay so that's
how we can use select just a simple
example go in here and experiment do
your own little things but now we're
going to talk about zip now zip is going
to apply a function to two lists and
what it's going to do is add values in
this situation I'm going to use two
lists and add the values from both the
lists together
so let's go and create a list and I'm
going to call this list 1 is equals a
new list and we'll go new integer array
and then throw some values inside of
here I'm going to throw 1 3 &amp;amp; 4 inside
of there save that and then let's
generate another list so what we're
going to do is add these two lists to
each other so we'll go list 2 and let's
just change the values so we'll change
this to 4 6 &amp;amp; 8 alright so there we go
now we can use zip to add the values
together so I'm going to call this sum
list is equal to list 1 and zip and then
we're going to go list 2 and then
whatever we want to add to it so we'll
get a value from list 1 and that's going
to be represented with the X and we'll
also get a value from list 2 which is
going to be represented with the Y and
then we're going to tell it that we want
to add those two values together now you
don't necessarily have to add them you
can do whatever you want with them so
we'll go to list again and then we can
come in and output our results the to
see what we got so horrible and in some
lists and then output that information
and to do so to throw in inside of there
and let's run it see how that works and
there you can see that we were able to
add those two values or those three
values into separate lists to each other
ok so that's how we can work with lists
and manipulate values between those
lists and now I want to give you an
example of how we can use aggregate now
aggregate is going to perform an
operation on each item in a list and
then whatever the value is after each
operation it's going to carry those
results forward so let's say I wanted to
some values in a list how could we do
that well let's go create another number
list to new and another integer list and
let's go and give this the values of 1 2
3 4 &amp;amp; 5 I'm going to sum those together
and what it's going to do is it's going
to add 1 + 2 and then carry that result
4 which is
be three and add that to three and so
forth and so on that's how aggregate
works and let's go and simplify this a
little bit and some these together so I
can just say sum and then get the value
here which is going to be number list
two and then call aggregate and then
define how we want to work with this so
I want to get a and B which is going to
be the first and the second value and
that's going to move up to the second
and the third and so forth and so on and
I want to add them together so a plus B
and that's that
and if we run it you're going to see
that it takes that list sums it together
and we get a final result of fifteen
okay so that's a way that we can add or
divide or subtract or do whatever you
want with different values and then
carry the results forward as you proceed
through your list now let's take a look
at average now average is going to do
basically what you think it's going to
it's going to give you an average of a
list of different values so it'll go in
here create another list and list again
and let's just do the same thing I could
I just kept that list there on the
screen but it's no problem going in here
and having you type things over and over
again because that's how they stick in
your head now to output this information
what I'm going to do is use something
called as Coria Bowl and what that's
going to allow us to do is to manipulate
the collection in a way that is going to
allow us to calculate the average so we
can go in and we'll output something on
the screen here we'll get the average
course and that inside of there and then
to calculate our average we're going to
go lumber list and I'm going to say as
queryable and then call for average to
average basically add up all those
values and divide by the number of
values that we have inside of there
there we go and you can see the final
result comes back as three which makes
sense whenever we input a one two three
four and five okay so real quick example
of average no real point in doing more
averages I'm sure you got it so now
let's see an example of all and there's
a point me changing all these different
things let's just keep one two three
four five inside here as our list and
basically what all is going to do for us
is determine if all items in a list are
going to meet a condition or not so
let's say that the condition we are
looking for will throw all inside of
there are all the values inside here
greater than three that's the question
that I'm asking so do check I'm going to
come in here I'm just going to get rid
of all this stuff and I'm going to say
all and then I'm going to list my
condition so I'll go in here like that
and X is greater than three so pretty
simple stuff so that's out of there and
run it and you can see that the answer
comes back it's false just like we would
have thought and let's come in here and
also check if any of the values are
going to match that condition and we can
do that just by changing those to any so
any greater than that and then change
this to any I'd like that and want it
and you can see that comes back is true
all right so quick way is to see if
values are found inside of the list with
all and any and now let's take a look at
distinct I'm basically going to keep
this exactly the same I'm going to
change the list however I'm going to
have this be one two three and then I'm
also going to go and throw another two
inside of there and another three
because what the stinks going to do is
eliminate duplicates from the list and
we can come in here and see that that
did indeed work out for us I'm going to
put distinct inside of here like that
and then I'm going to come down here and
get rid of this guy and to just print
out the entire list without using for
each and all that I'm going to go in and
go string and join and throw a comma
between each of those I've shown you
this guy before and here we can say
number list three and then call four
distinct to work on number list three to
just give us those things of that are
indeed different whoops when we're going
to run some different things so that's
there and run it and there you can see
it got me one two and three even though
there were multiple values of two and
three okay so it just cuts out what
isn't needed all right so now let's take
a look at except now basically what
except is going to do for us is receive
two lists and then return values that
are not found in the second list so we
need two lists here so let's just go
papi this guy right here and we'll paste
that down inside of there and change
this to number four come over here and
one two three and two three we'll just
leave that the way it is and then we'll
come down here and we will just have
this have a value of three okay so like
I said it's going to receive two lists
and return values not found in the
second list so let's go in here and
change this to accept and we can leave
this B string join just like we did
before and the only thing we're going to
change here is we're going to change
this to accept let's go and have this be
on the second one so it's easier to see
so we'll go accept and then inside of
here we're going to put number list 4
and then we are and run it and you're
going to see it comes back with one and
two why did it do that because one and
two we're not found in the second list
but three was and that's the reason why
3 wasn't shown alright and as a final
example I'm going to talk about
intersect which is going to receive two
lists just like you see here but return
values that are both that are found in
both the lists so let's change this to
two and three for that and leave this be
one two three two and three just like we
did before and here we will say
intersect that's and then we'll come
down here and just change this to
intersect save that leave everything
else exactly the same and reload it and
you can see that comes back with the
values of two and three and the reason
why is because two and three are in both
of the list items there you go guys
those are there are numerous ways that
we can work with lists and manipulate
them and do all sorts of different
things and I hope that was useful and
just like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
