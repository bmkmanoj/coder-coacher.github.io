Jade video tutorial in this one tutorial
I'm going to teach you pretty much
everything you need to know about the
Jade templating engine and Jade is a
templating engine for Doge a/s and it
compiles into basic HTML and like
handlebars which I've already made a
tutorial about Jade is going to help you
separate your HTML from dynamic content
and many people find generating HTML
with a preprocessor provides for more
readable code that's easier to maintain
and enough talking I'm going to jump
over and start writing some code alright
so before we start writing a code we're
going to need nodejs so you're going to
go to node.js org four slash whatever en
download Dada find the operating system
you use and download nodejs if you want
a more specific step-by-step walkthrough
on how to install node.js look for my
Express tutorial where I show you all
that but it's pretty straightforward and
you should have no problem with it then
after you have no js' installed you're
going to have to open up the node
package manager and install Jade and
you're going to be able to do that quite
easy just by going NPM and this works if
you're on Windows or OSX doesn't matter
what you're on install and Jade - G and
Jade's going to install for you and
there you go you're ready to go now what
you need to do is figure out what
directory you're going to be storing all
your Jade files in and from there we're
going to be able to compile these and
turn them into HTML or JavaScript what
I'm going to do right now is open up
sublime text and I'm going to do that
with su BL followed by a period hit
enter and it's going to open everything
in sublime text but you can use any text
editor that you would like okay so on
the left side scream I have sublime text
on the right side I have the terminal
and I have Google Chrome running right
here and let's just start writing some
code the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to cover dock types and
how to generate those and to do so
you're just going to type in doctype
like that in a file I called mine Jade
Tut Jade I'm going to save that then
over inside of my terminal or my command
prompt I'm going to type in Jade
followed by the name of the file and
it's going to render that for me then I
can come up here reload it and view page
source and you can see right there
doctype HTML that is the default that
we're going to be using with doc types
and for the most part that's what you're
going to use all the time however there
are a couple other different
document types you can use doctype XML
you can also come in and use
transitional and this is exactly how
you're going to type it to generate
everything and transitional just means
that the document can contain
presentational or deprecated elements it
also come in and type in strict which
states that it doesn't include
presentational or deprecated elements
you could also type in frameset which is
pretty much exactly the like
transitional except it's also going to
allow for the use of frame set basic
which is basically used for documents
that are going to be used with PDAs
pagers or set-top boxes again you're not
going to be using these that often or
mobile which are going to be XHTML
documents that are specifically aimed at
mobile devices and that's basically all
you need to know about doc types inside
of jade then we're going to generate our
HTML tag and to do that we're just going
to type in HTML and that's it it's going
to automatically generate it if you'd
like to come in and include other Jade
files inside here like let's say I
wanted to get my header section inside
of here let's first off go and create a
new file called head dot Jade and inside
of this I'm going to define my head tag
and then I'm also going to define my
title for my web page and I'm just going
to call this tutorial you know I'm going
to put quotes around this or anything
and I'll tell you to find that and then
let's say that I wanted to include
jQuery inside of this you would just
type in script like this followed with
the source and if we wrap that around
you can see exactly how that's defined
we could save this and jump back over
into Jade Jade and include that file and
to include that file what you're going
to need to do is indent and then follow
that with include dot forward slash head
dot Jade we could save that and then
while we're at it when we come in also
and type in body and save that come over
here render all this reload nothing
shows do a view page source and you can
see that all that stuff was
automatically generated you can also see
the head section was open and closed as
well as the body and the final HTML tag
so it's going to generate all those for
you and that's basically how jade works
jade is going to use indentation rather
than tags to define elements and each
level of indents is going to create a
new block that's going
to create a child element in the element
above it so the indent means that
include Miss situation and body in this
situation are going to be between HTML
tags and that's how that continues to
work now as I showed you right here this
is going to automatically generate the
HTML or this guy down here typing in
Jade Jade Jade let's say you also wanted
to come in here and generate the Java
Script that would be used for this guy
in that situation you would type in Jade
- - client - - no debug followed by Jade
Jade and hit enter and the JavaScript
file is going to be created for you and
you'd be able to open that up and see
exactly how that all looks you can see
that all the input or all the output to
the HTML file is all right there for us
let's just do a word wrap so you can see
that all in one place and all the code
in this tutorial of course is available
for free in the description so feel free
to click on that if you want to look at
it closer so just want to show you that
not something you'd use all the time but
wanted to include it nonetheless now
let's come in here and generate a little
bit more now we want to have divs inside
of the body tag so I'm going to indent
and I'm going to type in div here and
then let's say that I wanted to also
include paragraphs inside of this div I
could just put P for paragraph and then
first paragraph and you're going to be
able to either put the text in the
element directly after the tag or you
could define a text block by going in
here with paragraph like this indent and
then put a pipe and in this situation we
would be able to mix in other HTML
elements so let's say I wanted to throw
some lorem ipsum inside of this guy and
then follow that with a break statement
which is this guy right here and then we
wanted to put our next block of
information directly afterwards what we
do just use the pipe in both situations
and we could save that render it and now
you can see that information starting up
here and you can also see where the
break statement took effect right here
so that's how we would do that there's
another way also to work with paragraphs
however and that would be to come in
here and put a pair
graph tag followed by period and you
would do this whenever you were working
with just a simple block of text but
we're going to put our paragraph back
here because we don't want the paragraph
inside of this paragraph but make sure
that we indent right here paste in some
new text you can see right here I'm also
going to be able to define HTML elements
inside of it and they will take effect
and don't forget to come over here and
render this and whenever you do and
reload you can see there is the new
paragraph and right here that the HTML
elements that we use therein are going
to be affected by those elements when we
come in here and create another
paragraph we're going to keep it on the
same level and this time I'll show you
that attributes are basically going to
be defined in parentheses and they're
going to be separated with commas so
let's say when define an ID we just put
that inside of parentheses and we could
say something like second paragraph or
something like that I guess it would be
the fourth paragraph but whatever we're
then going to separate that with a comma
and yes you could go on to the next line
if you'd like to you could also come in
here and define a class and we can come
in and say something like lorem ipsum
input a space and you could do something
like very important or import and then
follow that with a period very important
and then after that after it's been
indebted we could throw in some more
information render it reload it you can
see there's the additional information
we threw inside of there and if we say
we want a view page source you can see
that we did that and you can also see
here is the ID inside of the paragraph
tag as well as the class both classes
actually now divs are going to be used
by default any time you do not provide a
specific tag however that's only going
to work as long as you are defining a
class or ID and you would define an ID
with a hash symbol like this or a dot
whenever you're using classes so let's
start off with an ID right here and I'm
going to type in something like second
div and then I can of course come in
here and define multiple classes for
this guy so I could do something like
lorem ipsum put another period and very
import and directly after that I could
just paste in some more lip lorem ipsum
come over here render it and you're
going to see that div shows up inside of
there and if we say view source you're
going to see that the div shows up
inside of there and both the ID and the
class
are also going to be defined inside of
it now let's create some things that a
little bit more interesting inside of
here let's say that we wanted to
generate a list of elements just type in
ul just like you do with all the other
different tags and you want to generate
your list items first off we would come
in here and define an ID BBP like this
and we could say list item like that
then come in and define a link and say
that it has the attribute 4hf and now
let's just keep this simple and just
have it be nothing for now and we could
say Barry Bonds and then we could do the
same thing for all the other different
list elements inside of this and we
could say something like Hank Aaron and
Babe Ruth reload it you can see that all
those pop up directly inside of there
another thing we can do with list
elements however in much the same idea
here is to just go ul like this and
define everything on one line so we
could go Li and let's call this hero
list item follow that with a colon and
then go a pate reference and then follow
that off with Batman and then do exactly
the same thing for as many other
different heroes as you'd like to list
so just come in and go Superman and the
flash and you can see that those
automatically generated as well so
there's multiple different ways we can
use these different list items or we can
generate list items now let's take a
look at interpolation basically you're
going to use interpolation to execute
JavaScript in a template by putting a
dash and a space in front of set
JavaScript now one thing that I forgot
let's talk about comments here for a
second if you do not want to comment to
show up in the HTML you do it this way
like I say it won't see me so that's a
comment that will not show up inside the
HTML however if you just put two forward
slashes like this can see me these
comments will show up in the HTML so
there you go and it's automatically
going to convert it into HTML comments
just in both the situation okay now that
I got that out of the way let's go take
a look at interpolation which is just
going to allow us to come in here and
execute JavaScript directly inside of
here so let's say I wanted to find a new
variable I'm going to call it my name
and just put Derick inside of there like
that I'm now going to be able to come in
here and place variables in HTML by just
coming
and finding a tag and then say something
like hello and then put whatever
variable I want to show up inside of
here between these two curly brackets
and you can say hello Derek shows up
right there I'm also going to be able to
execute JavaScript pretty much any place
I use those curly brackets so I could do
something like one two three four times
five six seven eight is equal to I like
this and then go one two three four
times five six seven eight and you can
see that automatically went in there and
calculated that for me so you can see
it's quite easy to come in there and
execute JavaScript which is very cool
you're also going to be able to use this
code inside of attributes so let's say I
want to come in and define a variable
called website and I wanted to put my
website inside of here I can do that
and then I can come in here and create a
link age reference and then inside of
the quotes put our dollar sign and type
in website close that off and then
define whatever the link is going to be
and you can see that that automatically
popped up there and if I click on that's
going to take me to a website also going
to be able to come in here and create a
raise say Heroes is equal to Wonder
Woman Supergirl and Batgirl and let's
turn this into a list once again might
as well just copy this because it's
going to be very similar to this paste
that inside of there except in this
situation I'm going to say hash symbol
and then curly brackets and Heroes and
I'm going to reference the zero index
right there for that array and let's
come in here and do the same thing for
these other two so there's the one index
and there's the second one
and make sure you spell Heroes correctly
here reload it and there you can see all
those showed up another thing you can do
is shorten tag name so ever this isn't
always the best of ideas but let's say
that I want shortened blockquote just
down to B Q for example something you
wouldn't want to do normally but I'm
just going to cover it just so that you
can see that it can be done so we can go
blockquote like this and then go to
dollar sign BQ and we'll just say bad
idea like that it's a bad idea because
people won't know what these tags do and
you can see a bad idea shows right up
inside of there we've checked the source
it's going to be a block whoa you're
also going to be able to use an equal
sign when a block contains only a
variable so let's come in here and
define a variable called Batman
data and in between quotes we'll just
throw some information about Batman in
there and you'll see that you'll be able
to come in here and go paragraph equal
two and Batman data and it's
automatically going to create that
paragraph and throw all that information
inside of there if you play with this
stuff a little bit you'll remember it
it's very straightforward other things
kind of neat is you can also do the same
with attribute values that are stored in
an object so let's say you want to
create an input that is going to be for
first name input you can just come in
here like this and find type and say
text separate that with comma then say
name colon F name like that you then
come in and create a span first name and
then input and say type is equal to FN I
dot type and name is equal to FN i dot
name and I'm rendering this each time
you can see that shows up right there
and you're going to see if you go in and
view the source that the type and name
are going to be defined exactly as I
have them right here
another thing to know is the tags are
going to be encoded for security reasons
so let's say we would come in and we
would say something like some info and
then we come in and define italics very
interesting and then close that off you
might be surprised by what you see here
if we would then come in and go P is
equal to some info we reload it and
you're going to see that the tags are
not used if you would actually want to
turn off encoding all you would have to
do is put an exclamation mark like that
and now it's going to show up exactly as
you would be expected and if you'd like
to just for completion reasons want to
see another way to do this you could
also go some info with an exclamation
point but for the curly brackets and get
exactly the same results very
interesting as you can say and let's
keep going on here now let's take a look
at different logic operators that Jade
provides us we're going to be able to
provide different output depending upon
different conditions so let's come in
here and let's say we want to have a
different output whenever it's night
time versus daytime so I'm going to come
in
and create a new data object and I want
to get the hour out of that date object
do something like gets hours I'm then
going to be able to perform different
output depending upon an if condition so
I'm going to say something like if hour
is greater than or equal to 6 and hour
is less than or equal to 17 then I'm
going to indent this I'm going to say h3
daytime is when I want to output in that
situation then what's a little bit weird
is I got to put it - right here before
that closing curly bracket and I'm going
to say else once again we're going to
type in h3 night time then come down
here put another dash inside of this and
just for the heck of it I'll show you
another way of do using if statements
that's a little bit more straightforward
you can basically write the if
statements just using regular
indentation which is the way that I
normally prefer to do it so we're going
to define another variable and I'm going
to give it a value of 18 then I'm going
to say if age is greater than or equal
to 16 and age is less than 18 put an
indentation there h3 say something like
you can drive then you come down and say
else if age is greater than or equal to
18 h3 tag you can drive and vote and
then finally we go else h3 you can wait
till you are 16 something like that
rendered it loaded it and you can say
the night time shows up here properly
and you can drive shows up there
properly and it's all based off of my
current time here on my computer so you
might get different results of course
another conditional operator that's
available to us here inside of Jade is
called unless and unless is going to
come out negative if a condition is true
so it's sort of like the opposite of if
so we could say something like age and
less age is greater than or equal to 16
and then h3 you'll drive at 16 would get
executed and you could use all
statements it was just like you did
previously we could say
three and you can drive and you're going
to say that you get you can drive shows
up right there because the age was
greater than 16 and another conditional
operator is the ternary operator so
let's say we want to do something like
day time is equal to and we would put
our greater than or equal to six and our
less than or equal to seventeen on here
put a space then we're going to put a
question mark and if this comes back is
true then day time in this situation is
going to be assigned to the variable day
time otherwise lake time is going to be
assigned to that variable and then we
would be able to output that information
just by going H three and putting in the
variable name and reloading it and you
can see that night time shows up right
there and now I'll show you the final
conditional that's available to us and
it is called case which works very much
like switch works to find another
variable inside of here name and let's
say the name in this situation is sue
we're then going to be able to say case
name and win Sally we're going to output
h3 and hi Sally and then you're not
going to put else or anything like that
you're going to say instead when Sue and
here we'll say hi Sue once again we're
not going to put quotes for the output
otherwise the output will use quotes and
then finally you could just say h3 hi
you because you have no idea who they
are and final thing is you're also going
to be able to run JavaScript just by
come in here and join script for example
with a dot after it and then say
something like console.log and say
something like hello Jade and if we
reload it you're going to see that hi
sue pops up inside of there and you can
see right here hello Jade pops up inside
the console that's a whole bunch about
conditionals and a whole bunch of other
different things now when we take a look
at looping so let's say we wanted to
create on array again and it's going to
have quarterbacks inside of it so we
could say and Brady so there is our ray
we're going to be able to loop through
these guys and let's say we want to put
them in a
list so that's a little bit interesting
I've been able to do that with a four
loop so we'll say AI is equal to zero
and we're going to continue looping as
long as I is less than the total length
of the quarterback's array and then
we're going to increment I at that point
put a dash inside of there right for
that closing curly bracket and then
indent inside of the four and then we'll
just say list item is equal to Q B's and
whatever the value of I is and you can
see it automatically generated that list
for us from that array each is in a
similar vein going allow us to iterate
over arrays as well as objects so we
could say come in here and do an
unordered list and say each QB in QBs
and then generate the list items like
this see it's a little bit shorter and
you can see get exactly the same results
that's neat
also going to be able to use while loops
so let's say that I wanted to generate a
while loop that's going to output
incrementing numbers from 1 to 20 let's
go and create a variable to start off
with it and then we'll go unordered list
and we'll say while I is less than or
equal to 20 I'm going to keep generating
list items like this - and then we'll
increment I like that make sure you put
the closing semicolon in this situation
whatever and you can see that it
generated all those list items from 0
through 20 so very cool and now let's
take a look at mix ins which are really
neat mix-ins are basically reusable
pieces of code that are basically when
it comes down to it JavaScript functions
and how we create them as we go mix in
say something like NFL player and this
mixin is going to receive a name a
position and a team and it's going to
output information which is going to be
a list item so we just put our hash
symbol and name like that is the and
hash symbol or the position for the and
then we're going to put team inside of
that we're then going to be able to call
the mix in by going let's just go you
will give that an ID and
I'll players and then call the mix-ins
just put a + sign followed by NFL player
and then pass in the attributes we want
to send to the mix in or the function or
whatever you want to call it
quarterback Patriots and then let's do a
similar thing for Peyton Manning and you
can see that it generated those
sentences right like that so that's kind
of cool it's very important to know that
mix-ins don't have to receive parameters
however and can just provide output so
let's say we want to create a mix in
it's going to automatically output a
copyright symbol we could do that so
let's just call it copy R and then put a
pipe right like this
we'll say and hash + 1 6 9 we could then
come in go paragraph and put a plus sign
again to call the mix in copy R and pipe
and put two spaces there so there's a
space between a copyright symbol and
there you can see it showed up sunny now
let's create a mixin that's going to
allow us to receive a variable number of
arguments and so mix in let's call this
make list its we're not going to define
how many arguments we're going to get
because we have no idea when you know ul
and let's go and create a variable and
we're going to turn the arguments object
in this situation in total a prototype
slice call arguments then after that
we'll go for item in args and generate
list items so there we are
now we come in and call this mix in once
again by putting uh + on and make list
and pass inside of it dog cat fish
reload and it automatically created that
list so a pretty neat stuff now let's
talk about extend which is basically
going to allow us to replace blocks in a
template sort of fashion what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a new file
I'm going to call it extend exe a the
name doesn't mean anything basically
blocks are containers that can be either
replaced appended or prepended so we can
define block and let's say that we have
header here and inside of that default
data is going to let's just put an h3
tag and put default header inside of it
like this define another block and let's
call this content and throw a paragraph
inside of it and call this default
khone's
and let's create a couple other
different content blocks inside of there
as well and then finally throw a footer
in here as well just to show you all the
different ways we can mess around with
this call this default footer block
content to block content 3 and let's
just do the same thing here 2 &amp;amp; 3 you're
going to see how we can either replace
these different pieces of data or
prepend or append them I'm going to save
that again it's called extend EXO Jade
jump back over into Jade Tut Jade then
we're going to type in extends and we're
specifically going to need to call
extend e^x which was the name of that
file where we defined all those blocks
and I'm going to say block header and I
can come in here and completely replace
it by going h3 the title I could also
come in and completely replace the
content by referring to the content
block and throw a paragraph inside of
there throw a pipe here and then throw
in some lorem ipsum I could also come in
and append data make sure you're
indenting is properly done when I come
down here you put spaces between all
these things by the way doesn't matter
so I went to append content to what is
already there I just go append content
and we'll go paragraph and pipe and I'll
put appended data just so that shows up
and we also will be able to prepend just
by going prepend and in this situation
we'll prepend content area 3 with
another paragraph and a pipe and we'll
say something like I come first save
that and you can see exactly how this
information the title went in and
replaced this is supposed to be default
header the title replaced it because I
told it to replace it also went in and
replaced the first paragraph here we
have the default information followed by
the appended data here we prepended it
before the default and we didn't do
anything with the footer and so nothing
was done with the footer so there you go
guys that's pretty much all the basics
you need to know about Jade I just
wanted to let you know that after the
last month making only 3 dollars and 49
cents off my previous eight videos
I decided I was gonna have to do
something if I wanted to continue making
educational videos on YouTube so I
signed up at patreon if anybody would be
nice enough to throw a dollar at me I
would greatly appreciate it if not I
completely understand however and just
