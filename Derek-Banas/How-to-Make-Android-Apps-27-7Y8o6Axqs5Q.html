27 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps in this part of the tutorial I'm
going to show you how to create swiping
tabs with android using the new material
design way of swiping tabs and i'm also
going to cover pager adapter as well as
view pager i should have in the last
tutorial pointed out that i just wanted
to cover the way to use tabs using the
old action bar but that i did plan on
using the new toolbar and in this
tutorial i'll do that while we go over
and look at the finished product okay
and here is the finished application and
as you can see we can swipe and it has
that really smooth animation that
everybody likes and we're also going to
make a click on the tabs and also bounce
around and display different fragments
so let's go write the code okay so you
guys already saw the finished product
and now we are going to create it the
very first thing we're going to have to
do however is you're going to have to
come over here and you're going to have
to create a new package right like this
and i am going to call it s tab for
sliding tab layout but i already created
it for us and what we're going to need
to do is go and get these two files so
let's jump over to google chrome and get
them alright so you're going to have to
go to this address right here i'll put a
link to it in the description underneath
and you're specifically going to have to
come down here and get both of these
files sliding tab layout dot java
and sliding tab strip just click on them
they're going to open up and you're
going to select the whole entire file
and you're going to copy and paste it
over into Android studio in the package
that I just created
s tab another thing I wanted to point
out to you guys is I'm going to start
transitioning over into Android games as
well as large Android applications and
you guys seem to be very interested in
material design
so slide nerd also on YouTube on this
isn't a sponsored hype or anything like
this this is just me saying hey you guys
are interested in general design and
this guy already has a whole bunch of
tutorials on material design because
like I said I'm going to transition into
making apps again which is what I like
to do so if you want to learn more about
material design and nice little tiny
videos which are really nice go check
out slide nerd ok so here we are we
copied and pasted both of these go
libraries inside of here and
you're going to be using the very first
thing we're going to do however is
create all of the fragments we're going
to be using so we're just going to come
over here click new and Java class just
like we have done previously and this
guy is going to be called tab fragment 1
and click on OK and there it is
and let's get rid all this junk and this
guy is going to extend fragment and I'm
also going to be used as support library
here come down here and right click and
we're going to say that we want to
generate override methods and then on
create view just like we've done
previously and there that is once again
delete this come in here create a view
and of course all of this code is
available in the description create an
inflator to inflate our fragment on the
screen or our dot layout which I'm going
to create here in one second it's going
to be called tab under school or
fragment one pass in the container to
inflate into and false and after we do
that we'll return our view and there we
go
quite simple now we're going to go over
here to the layout folder and create
that guy come down here XML layout XML
file and of course this is going to be
called tab fragment one just let that
set as a linear layout click on finish
down here and we can throw a textview in
here if we'd like textview with wrap
content height wrap content we'll give
it some text and I'm just going to put
tab fragments one inside of here text
size let's make this 16 SP and then
padding 5 DP just so it shows up there
on the screen real nice then of course
we're going to create these layouts for
all of the other different fragments
come over here write new XML layout file
tab fragment to linear layouts fine
click on finish like dal paste that in
there it changes to fragment - it's all
we need to do come over here create
another layout tab fragment 3 click the
copy/paste
change this to 3 and there we go now we
got all those layouts all set up now we
come in here copy all this over here
create another class new then other
reason I'm doing this again and again is
just because there might be somebody
that comes to this tutorial that didn't
see the previous tutorial
to select all based changes the to
change this to to anything else is fine
close that and close this as well and
then create our last fragment Java class
add fragment three there it is
select all paste change this to three
change this to three all right
everything's all saved and we can get
rid of all that now we're going to
create another class and what we're
going to be using here are view pagers
as well as pager adapters view pager is
just going to allow us to switch or
swipe back and forth between our
fragments and your pager adapter is
going to do things like define what the
title is going to be on the tabs as well
as provide the proper fragment whenever
either a tab is clicked on or they swipe
event occurs so Java class and I'm gonna
call this my fragment pager adapter
click on OK and there it is
this is going to extend the fragment
pager adapter it's going to say I need
to come in here and generate some
methods no problem over here click on
this implement methods implement both of
them another thing I want to do is come
in and define my titles for all of my
tabs so let's just create a string array
keep it simple tab titles is equal to no
string and then let's just name this
frag number one frag number two and frag
number three semicolon at the end we're
also going to need a context here just
go this context and then down inside of
here what we're going to do is return
the correct fragment based off of the
index that is passed to get item so
we're going to say if I is equal to 0
return new tab fragment one else going
to do the same thing here is equal to 1
we're going to change this tab for AG
meant to and else we're going to pass in
a two here change this the 3 and
otherwise we're going to need to return
null there we go get count which is down
here we're going to change that to 3
because we have three possible fragments
and also I'm going to want to create a
constructor here to write generate
constructor click on the context and
that is all set up there is our pager
adapter another thing we're going to
need to do though is one of these guys
here there is sliding tab layout believe
this is the one that calls for the page
title
so we're going to have to go get page
title there it is it's going to ask for
a page title so we're going to have to
come over here inside of our adapter and
set that up for it and generate override
methods and then down inside here pager
adapter get page title click on that and
then here we'll just replace this with
tab titles and then the position that
have passed in so basically the pager is
going to request the fragments and then
at the same time we're also going to
whenever the fragments change inside of
the page or we're also going to update
the title inside of all the tabs that's
all we're going to need to do for the
pager adapter another thing I'm going to
do before I forget is the Gradle this
one right here specifically going to
open this up and we are going this can
be set to 15 doesn't have to be 21
unlike you might read somewhere but you
want to make sure that you have your
proper support libraries inside of here
say 21 you want to make sure that you
have that inside of there and once again
that's in the build Gradle file this one
right here and of course you can get the
support libraries by open up the SDK
manager here's my SDK manager zoom in
here a little bit and then scroll way to
the bottom see support library 20 1.03
that's where that comes from so you just
put a check in there and say you want to
get that alright alright so back to
activity main we're going to have to go
and get our sliding tab and put that
inside of here so we're going to go calm
dot ooh
think-tank just copy this paste that in
there and then we want to specifically
get to the sliding tab layout which is
in the S tab folder so sliding tab
layout there it is and then we're going
to give this an ID and I'm going to
specifically call this sliding tabs and
then we're going to have the width be
match parent and then we're going to
have the height be match parent close
that off and then underneath of it we're
going to have our pager it's going to
allow us to swipe between our fragments
so Android dot support dot v4 dot view
dot view pager is what we want we're
going to give this an ID which is view
pager and have a width inside of this
which is going to be match parent for
our height we're going to come in
and we're actually going to define this
as zero pixels because we're going to
have it fill up all of the screen by
then going to the weight and putting one
inside of there and then we could also
define a background color if we like and
let's just say Android : color forward
slash white and then close that off and
that's all you need to do for activity
main now we're over inside of main
activity this is going to extend a
fragment activity for us we're then
going to need to come down here and
create our view pager which once again
is going to allow us to flip through all
of our different pages or all our
different fragments that we use view
pager is equal to you pager find view by
ID and that's going to be our dot ID dot
view pager now we're going to need to
set the adapter for our view pager which
is going to allow us to return a
fragment based off of the index so set
adapter then inside of this we'll go new
and we'll define our pager adapter well
then call for get support fragment
manager which is going to allow us to
interact with our fragments and then put
in main activity this okay now we'll
need to initialize the sliding tab
layout so sliding tab layout let's just
call this sliding tab layout good no
sliding tab layout cast and then find
view by ID and pass in our dot ID dot
sliding tabs and that of course is going
to come from this sliding tabs right
there back over in the main activity and
all we need to do is connect the view
pager and go sliding tab layout dot set
view pager and that's it guys that's all
you need to do to use the new material
design tab slider or tab Swiper whatever
you want to refer to it as sorry about
the confusion I should have mentioned
that I wanted to demonstrate the action
bar before moving on to this but either
way now you have both so please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
