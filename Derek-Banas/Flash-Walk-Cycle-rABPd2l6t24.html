flash tutorial on how to create walk
cycles in this tutorial I'm going to
show you all the basics to not only just
create walk cycles but to pretty much
create anything there's all my little
pieces all my little guys that I was
playing around with and what I'm talking
about walk cycles you can use basically
any of the techniques that I bring up in
this tutorial to create not only just
walk cycles but maybe a little bit
fancier walk cycle like a double bounce
and this is called a double bounce just
because it's a little bit more
flamboyant if that's a good word to use
or these are the basic principles behind
running or if you wanted your character
to be depressed you could do this
slumped over version and even these are
the basic principles behind jumps I mean
everything is here and the reason why is
in flash you pretty much draw these
midway points and flash draws everything
all the movements in between that's why
we call the these movements down here
these automatic animations inside of
flash tweens because the really good
animators would draw each of these major
movements and then the minor animators
which were called Inbetweeners would
draw all of the movements in between so
that's where that all comes from and all
this all these files all this is free on
my website a new think-tank o´clock so
just get that basic understanding that
all these techniques can be applied to
pretty much performing any type of
animation inside of flash and the reason
why is something called the bone tool
which I have not covered yet inside a
flash but we are going to definitely
cover it today so what I did was I drew
all of my individual body parts inside
of flash using a graphic tablet and you
can see here's my head here's an arm
these are all just really really really
basic little guys that I drew inside of
flash and I'm going to bring them all
together and animate them here for you
on the screen right now first I already
did animations on all the different body
parts except for one of the legs but
understanding how I do the animation on
the leg means that you're going to be
able to do the animations on any of the
other body parts so I'm going to come
down here and right leg I have still not
defined
so what I want to do is I want to put a
frame here and it's very important when
you're doing this animation that
everything is exactly the same number of
frames in length and after you have
created this first frame I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna paste my leg here onto the
screen then I'll come over here to the
bone tool click on it and I'm going to
define all of the parts that I want to
move so I want to start up here at the
very top the leg that I wanted to find
the kneecap area just like that then
drag it down to the ankle area and then
drag it down to the bottom of the foot
now I'm gonna be able to automatically
move all these different pieces just
like there are bones inside of them and
flash will automatically correct for the
most part the outlines on the leg and
make everything real smooth it is
absolutely awesome that started in flash
cs4 and of course I didn't get rid of it
for slash cs5 it's awesome now I'm gonna
go and create additional keyframes at
each seven frames so right there right
there 21 28 35 40 to 49 and 56 hopefully
my maths right okay and I like to start
the animations off so that they are
straight up and down especially with the
legs with the arms it's not quite so
important but with the legs definitely
and I want to make this foot more flat
so what do I do and just drag it and
there it is it's more flat now I want to
make it go backwards because I know that
I already define my other animated leg
to go in the opposite direction so I'm
gonna make this guy start to go
backwards this is gonna be a maybe a
little bit more like a run animation and
here I did and now I'm gonna jump to the
14th frame and I'm gonna make a bigger
change you can see I'm just dragging
this guy I can drag the foot all kinds
of things it slips up in a couple
different areas but this is easily
corrected later on I just have to
understand that this tool is really here
to save you an immense amount of time
and you're not that it's going to
completely do the job you're still gonna
have to do a little bit of Correction
afterwards but for the most part this is
gonna save you so much time so and you
can see I'm just dragging these little
guys around I'm just gonna leave this
straight up and down flat just like that
and then start to move it this way and
after you play with it for a little bit
you used
and drag it out again drag this ankle
look till you get it in a position that
you want it and then drag this leg out
again and then just leave it in its flat
position and now if I run this animation
you can see flash automatically goes in
there and does all the animation work
for me
super I'm gonna jump right back over
into my main scene fitting window and
then I'm gonna take all my little pieces
that I already drew any animated you can
save mom let's just jump over here you
can see I already animated this I'm
using my zoom tool here shortcut Z and
if I hit enter you can see that I
already animated this and I animated it
into a precise same way that I animated
the leg so there's nothing really sneaky
here or that I'm not covering okay so
I'm in my left arm layer and keep all of
your different pieces all in separate
layers so my got my left arm layer it's
a lot easier to tweak later on and just
drag it down here there it is on screen
of course I created a frame here and to
do this then I'm gonna grab my left leg
grab that throw that on there then I got
my head and I also animated the head a
little bit throw that on there and I got
my torso now you could of course have
your head and torso all in the same
place but that's totally up do you jump
onto the right leg and there's my right
leg and there's my right arm so I'm
gonna click there and get the right arm
remember this is the right leg this is
the left leg selection tool I'm gonna
come in grab the torso throw it in there
where I think it goes grab my head slop
it in there essentially where I think it
goes grab my right on got it there grab
my left on this is the right leg there's
the left leg that's gonna be hidden
there's the right leg this is just a
real basic figure I'm gonna select all
these guys at the same time and then
remember that we're fifty six frames
gonna so I'm gonna jump out to 56 and
I'm gonna put keyframes down here for
all of these individual pieces that's a
little sloppy
come here grab the head move it a little
bit in there grab my right leg move it
in a little bit grab the left leg
pull it in there a little bit and if I
grab all these different pieces and move
them off the screen over here jump back
here make sure yep that's all nice and
tight and now I can just simply click
anywhere inside of this layer and create
classic tween create classic tween
create classic tween and I did this
whole animation in about 10 minutes now
of course most of the time you're gonna
spend in flash is doing tweaks that's
really what you spend time and flash
doing so I just created all that jump
over to frame 1 and you can say your
basic walk cycle I mean that's really
all of all the longer that it takes to
do that and just click on test you can
see there's a basic walk cycle it says a
little bit more like a run cycle but all
I really have to do to really fix this
guy and make this really really tight as
you can see there's a couple little
things I do with the head there's a
couple little tweaks I'd make with the
arm and there's a couple little tweaks
I'd make with a leg and this is
essentially a perfect sort of walk cycle
that I was able to throw together in a
couple minutes you there's no other tool
you can do that do anything like this
this quickly and as I scrub through this
animation inside of flash you can see a
couple errors that I got here like let's
go through I'm going to show you how to
fix them and this is the first one that
I really notice right here so this is
gonna be in the left leg and if I want
to correct this you can see I'm gonna
need to move that left leg in there a
little bit so it's real simple to do I
just double click on the left leg and
you can see there's the left leg right
there and if I come in here around this
frame let's jump over into the scene
editor again and it's pretty much
straight up and down at that point and
it is as it's going backwards so I know
that the error occurs right there
so that's frame 26 and continues until
roughly frame thirty four so if I want
to edit that just double click on the
leg and 26
what I'm gonna do in this for instance
is throw down another keyframe and move
this in with the arrow tool and then
throw down another keyframe right here
move that in a little bit let's jump
back over in the scene and see if it
fixed itself up looks yeah it's still up
it's still that's a little bit too much
but you get the basic premise of what
I'm doing here so I went a little bit
too batty with it I'm gonna move it back
and I move this one back a little bit
and you basically this is what you're
gonna do you're just gonna be tweaking
things inside a flash a little bit until
you get everything the way that you want
it and you can see I pretty much fixed
that problem except I have a little bit
more of a pull upwards when it looks
like he has cheeks right around there
but that's the basic premise of how
you're gonna fix and edit any of the
errors that develop because you used the
whole animated tool inside a flash so if
you have any questions as a basic way of
doing animations of pretty much any type
inside of flash if you have any
questions leave in a comment section
below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
