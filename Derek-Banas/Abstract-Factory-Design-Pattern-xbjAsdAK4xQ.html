6 of my design patterns video tutorial
today we are going to cover the abstract
factory pattern as well as review the
factory pattern in a completely
different way that I have in any other
previous tutorial because I've received
a bunch of questions about it so let's
get into it so what exactly is the
abstract factory pattern it is like a
factory but everything is encapsulated
the method that orders the object the
factories that build the object the
final objects and the final objects
contain objects that use the strategy
pattern and if you don't remember
there's a link above to the strategy
pattern but I'm going to review it later
on in the tutorial the strategy pattern
just uses what is called composition or
in other words its class fields are
actually objects themselves but either
way if you don't get that let's move on
so what can you do with an abstract
Factory it allows you to create families
related objects without specifying a
concrete class which is extremely
important because it provides you in ton
of flexibility you want to use them
whenever you want to have many objects
that can be added or changed dynamically
during runtime and with an abstract
Factory you can model anything you can
imagine and have those objects easily
interact with numerous other objects
through common interfaces the only bad
thing about an abstract Factory is it
can get very complicated
but hopefully in this tutorial I can
make it uncomplicated now I want to move
on to the factory pattern I'm gonna
simplify everything in this everything's
just gonna be pictures but eventually
I'm gonna get into the code with a
factory pattern you basically have your
application which is this alien right
here and it's gonna say make a UFO then
you use what is called a factory and in
a minute here I'm going to show you all
the code behind all these little
nice-looking pictures this Factory based
off of input from the alien over here is
either going to shoot out a UFO a rocket
or a boss UFO in this situation the
factory then shoots out abstract classes
that have names speed and damage and
then these abstract classes are then
used to create a final product so as you
can see here there are no concrete
classes because all of that is
abstracted out so these guys here can
literally be just about anything as long
as
they define a name speed and damage
which is what these abstract classes do
so that is the basics of a factory
pattern now let's go back and let's look
at the code and explain this further
here is the factory pattern if you can't
see this don't worry about it I'm going
to zoom in on everything and basically
you can see here the little alien is
asking for a UFO the factory is putting
a checkmark in the UFO box it's spitting
out an abstract glass and then those
abstract classes are going to create one
or another these different ships so
let's zoom in here and see exactly
what's going on with our main
application and we know this is the main
application because it has public static
void main where everything is going to
be running inside of here and basically
all this guy does is it asks for input
from the user to either enter a you an R
or a B it's then going to take that
information and pass it to the factory
and make a ship and in this situation
type of ship is either going to be a u
an arm or a B so it's going to pass that
over to my factory and here is the
factory itself so let's zoom in and see
what that looks like and there you go
then the factory is going to say did
they give us a u if they did we're going
to have to return a UFO enemy ship which
is going to be an abstract class or they
entered an R which we're going to return
a rocket abstract class or a be a big
UFO enemy abstract class so everything's
abstracted out if we zoom in on this
abstract class you can just see right
here that if they want to create an
enemy ship they're going to have to
define a name speed and damage and all
these other different methods underneath
it here are going to be created later on
inside the ships themselves and then
finally we get into the ships itself and
you can see here our two ships big UFO
enemy ship and UFO enemy ship and they
both extend enemy ship right here and
you can see they come in and provide a
name as well as a damage and a speed and
there you go those are your final
objects and they're all ready for you to
use so now let's look and see how a
factory pattern differs from an abstract
factory pattern in this situation
remember we're going to abstract
everything out even the ordering process
is going to be abstracted out so
whenever our alien says I want to make a
UFO I want you to make me one just act
like there's a Salesman in here now the
salesman's only job is to take the order
he doesn't care about any of the
specifics of
he just wants the sale quite literally
so what he is going to do then this is
sort of a middleman is define a generic
ordering form and basically this is
going to be an abstract class and the
only requirement that this abstract
class has is that it contain a method
called make enemy ship all right so now
let's get more specific now make enemy
ship which is our generic ordering form
is then going to define the different
types of UFOs that can be built you can
look upon this as a more specific
ordering form and this guy is going to
define a UFO and attach it to the to be
built UFO and it's also going to give
the UFOs a name don't worry about it I'm
going to show you the code here in a
second just want you to understand the
process of what's going on then we are
going to define the classes that
implement the interface and here
basically what we're going to define is
everything that every UFO must be able
to do to be considered a UFO which means
it needs to contain a weapon as well as
an engine so from this interface that we
create here we are then going to create
factories now this can sometimes confuse
people just think about it this way each
factory that we're going to define is
only going to be able to create one type
of gun and one type of engine however it
could also create a missile in this
situation all of these things could be
built or all these factories could be
built from this one abstract class just
continue to think of these as order
forms or blueprints for what needs to
come next so basically what we're saying
here is whenever you build these
factories they must be able to make a
gun and an engine or they could also
make a missile and what we're doing here
is defining what factory makes each
specific type of UFO remember we're
abstracting out everything we want to be
able to use everything in its most
generic form then from that point on we
have our specific factories and they are
going to output generic ships again we
want to encapsulate everything so that
we can look at everything as if it is a
ship so basically what we're saying here
is every enemy ship that is ever going
to be created in this instance is going
to have a name weapon an engine and
that's it they don't know what type of
name
up in our engine but we do know that we
need those things basically what we're
defining here from the factory real
simple is we're saying this is the
blueprint for making an enemy ship and
then this blueprint is going to be used
to make a very specific ship's and you
can see right here that's exactly what
it's going to do this interface that is
demanding that every ship have a name
weapon and engine is then going to be
able to be implemented to create actual
ships and what this allows us to do
again is to take advantage of
polymorphism where we can refer to every
object that we're going to be playing
with as an enemy ship and just say hey
enemy ship go over there and it doesn't
matter what type of enemy ship just
whichever one we point out is going to
do whatever we want it to do and then
further on each of the parts of this
enemy ship can then be defined inside of
an abstract pattern again you are just
defining the specifics of the ship just
like we were defining the specifics of
what a factory can do and each of these
ships is going to be made up of a series
of parts and what this is going to allow
us to do is to like I said before use
composition or have fields inside of our
spaceship object be objects in the
situation's that our weapons and engines
so let's look at this in a code related
way and there you have the whole entire
abstract class and all the code Vale is
available underneath this video so let's
zoom in here okay so we have our little
alien coming in here and saying hey I
want you to make me a ship well enemy
ship building is going to handle orders
for new enemy ships and you're going to
be able to send it code using the order
of the ship method and it's basically
just going to send the order to the
right factory for the creation of said
ship that is what it's going to do and
then here we're defining a basic enemy
ship and we're giving them names and
then make UFOs which is enemy ship
building which I'm going to show you in
a second we're going to pass over the
string UFO and in this situation the
string UFO boss so now let's take a look
at this abstract class we have here and
there you can see enemy ship building
and what is it going to do well it's an
abstract class that's going to demand
that any real order specific order forms
are going to be able to make an
animation
and string type of ship that is going to
be either UFO or boss UFO as you can see
right here UFO UFO boss
so that string is going to be passed
inside of there and this is going to act
as an order mechanism for creating enemy
ships that have a weapon engine and name
and nothing else as you're going to see
here in a little bit and those specific
parts used for engine and weapon depend
upon the string that is going to be
passed which is this string right here
type of ship and then these methods
after the ship is created are all going
to run down here make ship display enemy
ship and just basically just shoot
information out onto the screen so this
is the abstract order form so now let's
look at the very specific order form for
our different types of ships and I'm
going to focus in in this situation on
just UFO enemy shipbuilding because we
could have multiple very specific order
forms but in this situation I'm just
going to focus on one now this is going
to be the only class that ever needs to
be changed whenever you want to put new
ships inside of here and if we zoom down
right here if UFO was sent what we're
telling to do is grab the factory that
knows what type of weapons and engines
of regular UFO needs and then the enemy
ship object is returned and given a name
like you see right there and then in
this situation down here we're going to
do exactly the same thing it's going to
make sure that the right factory is used
so that we're able to pop out UFO bosses
rather than regular UFOs and now we get
into the abstract class for our Factory
and here using this interface enemy ship
Factory you're going to be able to build
ships along with all of the components
for those ships and right over here
you're going to define the parts that
are required if an object wants to be an
enemy ship just like we do with all
interfaces we're just going to force
them to implement these methods and then
if you come over here this Factory is
going to use the enemy ship factory
interface to create very specific UFO
enemy ship parts or methods in this
situation and this is where we're going
to define all the parts the ship will
use by defining the methods implemented
right here using es weapon or enemy ship
weapon and enemy ship engine so now that
we have created our
Factory they are then going to pop out
different types of abstract enemy ship
classes let's take a look at that and
here again you're going to see an
abstract class for enemy ship and it's
going to have a name a weapon and an
engine and then all this other stuff is
just basic and then this abstract class
is going to force because we have
abstract here for every ship that is
going to be defined to have the method
called make ship and then finally you
can see here I implemented the two
string method here and that's just going
to allow me to inside of us
system.out.print line for example say to
print out an enemy ship that is going to
use this abstract class and it's just
going to output all this information in
regards to that said ship so now let's
look at those ships that use this
abstract class and here they are you're
going to see extends enemy ship and it's
going to create a copy of ship factory
that's going to hold forward here and
you can see down here it's going to be
very easy to just swap in different
types of guns and engines depending upon
the ship Factory so now let's look at
how we're going to accumulate or attach
parts to this spaceship and you can see
right here that's exactly what we're
going to do we have es weapon which is
doing nothing more than an interface
that is going to force every weapon to
implement the two string method and an
interface es engine which is also only
going to force each object that uses
this interface to also implement to
string and then whenever the actual gun
itself the object that is created from
this class is called it is just simply
going to return 20 damage and 1,000
miles per hour what's really cool about
this is that any part that implements
the interface es weapon is easily going
to be able to replace that part in any
ship so it provides flexibility on a
level that is almost incomprehensible I
think you can kind of see here exactly
how you can use the abstract factory
pattern to implement pretty much
anything you could ever want to do in
regards to simulation so that is both a
review of the factory pattern as well as
a look at the abstract factory pattern
all of the code is available in der
Neath the video if you have any
questions it's probably answered down
there because it is heavily commented
leave any questions or comments below
