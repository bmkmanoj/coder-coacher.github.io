pearl video tutorial in this one pearl
video you're going to learn all the
basic syntax of the language so that you
can create pretty much anything else in
the description underneath the video I
have timestamps to all the individual
parts of this video so you can watch
part now and then come back later and
just click on the timestamp and go
directly where you left off also in the
description I have a link to all of the
code as well as a cheat sheet and a
transcript of the entire video so go
check that out if that would help and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so I'm not going to waste a lot of
time on installation if you're on
Windows you should probably check out
strawberry pearl calm and you can
install that there and you'll be able to
do everything that I'm doing here on my
computer and then thereafter you're
going to go and check that you actually
have pearl installed and you can just
type in pearl - V and it's going to pop
up all sorts of stuff here and you're
going to see that I have pearl version 5
version 16 inside of this guy and if
you're on OSX or you're on Linux you are
probably going to want to install pearl
blue because that is going to avoid
damaging versions of pearl that your
system depends on and how you would do
that is you would just type in pearl -
KL HTTP and then this long URL you have
here with a little line here followed by
bash and that's going to install pearl
blue and then you're going to want to go
into your bash profile and that is going
to be in users and whatever your
username is obviously it won't be
Derrick baños and you're going to
specifically look for bash profile this
guy right here open up that file and
then inside of your bash profile you're
going to want to put in this guy right
here this line of text and you can put
install brew there but you don't need to
so just put that in there and then save
it and then if you have a terminal open
you're going to want to restart your
terminal and then you'll be ready to go
after you have pearl brew installed you
can go and install a new version by just
typing in Pearl brew install and then
pearl
whatever version you want to install say
I want to install 5.2 to 1 that's how
you would do it and then you'd be ready
to rock now what I'm going to do is you
can actually execute Perl commands
directly inside of the terminal this is
a very common thing to do it's two
different ways to do it one way with
windows an one way with Linux as well as
OSX so we could do our hello world
obligatory thing that we always do throw
in a new line right like that and then
we're going to put our double quotes
there and everything else is surrounded
by single quotes and if you click that
you're going to see the dot shows up on
Windows however you're going to have to
do something a little bit different
you're going to have to come in here and
before the print you're going to type in
the double quotes and then around the
hello world right here you're going to
back slash out those double quotes like
that and like that and then you'll be
able to run that inside of Windows if
you were wondering but we're going to
spend most of our time here actually
writing some real Perl languages or Perl
code so you can see the structure that I
have here for my directory this is the
main directory I'll be working with and
my main file I'm going to be working
with is going to be called Perl Tut one
dot PL that's the extension for Perl
then we have some modules here I have
one called cat one called line one
called employees or employees is
actually going to be a data file and you
can see exactly how I have those all
structured and as the tutorial continues
I'll get more into that now the first
thing we're going to want to do in Perl
Tut one dot PL is define what are called
pragmas to force us to write good code
as well as provide information on how we
can correct some errors and to do that
we're going to say use strict and use
warnings and use Diagnostics and that's
all those going to do it's just going to
help us write better code and give us
error messages that make sense I'm also
going to want to use a function called
say that's going to print a line
followed by a new line and add that in
in use feature put some quotes say I'm
also going to want to demonstrate the
switch statement inside of Perl and that
is actually called given when it's
actually called switch I'm going to tell
it switch here whenever I type that in
we'll get more into that as the tutorial
continues if I want to define that I
want to use a specific version of Perl I
can just as long as I have it installed
I can just type in use V and I'm going
to use 16 in this tutorial and there
that goes that's going to make sure you
have that that's going to correct a lot
of errors if you want to put a comment
inside a Perl that's all you do put that
little hash symbol inside of there and
let's say that I want to do another
hello world here before we get into the
complicated stuff I can do it directly
inside of here the backslash n is going
to put in a new line because print
doesn't put in a new line automatically
and then if I want to execute my code
after I type that in I just type in Perl
in the name of the file and you can see
hello world comes right back there at us
so let's get into some more advanced
information here let's talk about
scalars now there are three main data
types in Perl there are scalars arrays
and hashes and if you want to declare a
variable all you're going to have to do
is type in a sigil followed by well
first you're going to type in my and
then you're going to type in a sigil
which is going to be a dollar sign
followed by whatever you want it to be
and the variable must start with a
letter or an underscore and then you can
have numbers thereafter and a variable
is going to receive a default value of
undefined if you don't put anything
inside of there so let's just say I want
to type in my name here you can put
strings or you can put characters or
numbers or anything inside of scalars
basically it's just an individual piece
of data that's what a scalar is another
thing you're going to be able to do is
assign multiple values again you're
going to type in my that just means that
it's not been defined yet and I could do
something like age and then
I could type in Street is equal to and
then I could put different things inside
of here so I could say something like
one two three main streets and there you
are and that's going to assign 42 age
and Monteith remain street to street and
you can see exactly here the different
types of data you can store inside of
scalars now if you use a double quotes
whenever you are defining your strings
your going to be able to include things
like new lines which are backslash n
that just means skip to the next line of
course
so let's come in here and say something
like my and then my info it's also very
common in Perl to separate all the
different words with underscores so
since I'm using double quotes here I'm
going to be able to say something like
name lives at will say lives on that
makes a little bit more sense and then
if I want to put double quotes inside
here as well
I just backslash double quote and then I
could say something like Street
something else to put there and there we
go I can put double quotes there with a
backslash again and then it's also throw
in a newline and if you're wondering if
there was any way to avoid escaping out
your quotes yes there is there's a way
of doing almost anything in Perl it's a
language that's been around for forever
if you want to overwrite my info you
could just type in my info there you
don't need the my after its first been
defined and you could just come in here
and go equal to and whenever you are
working with single quotes you would
just type in a queue and your little
curly brackets but I'm working with
double quotes that's what I look for
then I'm going to put two double or two
queues inside of there that's going to
be exactly the same as if I would put in
a double quote and now I could just come
in and say name lives on and then I
could put my double quotes inside of
here without escaping them straight like
that and then I could throw a newline
inside of there and there you go so I
did exactly the same things but we
didn't have to escape double quotes
meant something that some people like to
do and then I can come in here and say
that I want to print my info and reload
you can see Derek lives at 1 2 3 Main
Street and you can see the double quotes
that are inside of there you could also
define very long strings over multiple
different lines I'm going to say
something like my and I'll just say a
bunch of info and what you're going to
do here at the very beginning of this is
you're going to define the word that is
going to end your long string so we're
going to come in and then say something
like this is a bunch of information on
multiple lines and at the end of it to
end your long string you would just type
in and like that and now let's also use
say which is automatically going to come
in here and throw a new line in after
we're done so a bunch of info and we can
execute and you can see that those
printed out with all the different lines
exactly the way that I define them
inside of there now the size of the data
is going to change depending upon if you
have a 32-bit or a 64-bit system but
this is more than likely going to be the
biggest integer that you're going to be
able to store inside Perl pretty big
number more than likely that's going to
be enough for you and with another
function called print F you're going to
be able to format strings by defining
the data types that follow the % so if
you want a character you put percent C
string
use an SD u unsigned integer this guy
right here is actually an unsigned
integer you have your floats and you
have scientific notation for floating
point numbers
let's take a look at print F and exactly
how that works here we're going to use
an unsigned int and a backslash or a new
line of main and then if we want to go
and throw a number inside of here we go
big int plus 1 and if we execute that
you can see right here you can see that
this number even though I added 1 to it
did not go up in value and that's the
reason why is because that's the biggest
number that we can pretty much put
inside of Perl and in regards to
floating point numbers remember these
were all scalars the you can basically
trust up to 16 digits of precision for
floats so let's go and define another
one let's call this big float is equal
to and there you go
6
teen digits of precision and here we're
going to use print F again and we're
also going to define that we want 16
digits of precision by putting in our
little % followed by 16 that means we
want 16 digits of precision for this
float and then we can come in and say
big float + and throw in a big giant
number inside of there and see exactly
how that prints out and there you can
see it printed out perfectly fine and
that's because we stuck within the 16
digits of precision that a float is able
to handle inside of Pearl you're also
going to be able to switch values of
scalars in a neat way there's all kinds
of neat things you can do with pearl so
let's say we just go my first and my
second is equal to 2 you're going to be
able to switch the values of those quite
easily just by going in and saying first
and then second and then switch them
around so we'll say second and first and
just by doing that little thing right
there now the value that was previously
in first is going to be in second and
then second in first so pretty cool
stuff and just to prove that that's true
we can just say say and execute that and
you can see that those values have
switched so there's a rundown of scalars
I'm going to be doing a lot more with
them so now let's go and take another
look at what we can do with math
functions inside of pearl now pearl is
going to of course have access to all
the normal math functions so addition
subtraction multiplication division this
is modulus that gets you the remainder
of a division and this is going to be 5
to the power of 4 and if we execute you
can see exactly how those all work out
I'm guessing exactly the way you were
thinking they were going to work out
there's also a ton of built-in functions
I'm just going to cover a couple here
and we of course have all the trig
functions I'll let you look that up if
you're interested in that I'm going to
show you the most common different math
functions and you can see here with the
first one what this is going to do is
going to give you the result of e to the
power of whatever the value put inside
of there so we have one right here on
the second line we're going to be
converting from hexadecimal here we are
going to be converting from octal this
guy right down here is doing to truncate
the value that you pass
to it and of course we're also going to
be able to use parentheses with our
function but it's very common in Perl to
not use those parentheses use them if
you like them if you don't like them
then don't use them here with log we're
going to get number to the power of E so
whatever number you pass in is going to
be converted to the power of E this is
how we're able to convert or create
random numbers from zero to ten with the
random function and here we have square
root and if we save that and you can see
exactly how all of those are calculated
and if we would come in here and reload
it again you're going to see random
number comes back as five and random
number comes back as six over and over
again with the random function that's
built inside of Perl we're also going to
have shortcut assignment operators and
they are going to be things like plus
equal to and minus equal to and
multiplication equal to and division
equal to and what these guys are going
to do for us is we will be able to come
in here and say something like let's go
my R and num is equal to five and then
we could say R and num plus equal to one
that is going to be exactly the same as
if we would come in and say R and num is
equal to R and num plus 1 okay so it's
just a shortcut that we were able to use
and then we could say say number
incremented and you can see of course it
went up to 6
there's also shortcut ways we can
increment as well as decrement but you
have to understand exactly how these
work so let's save this and then let's
execute it here what's going on is it
saying print out the value of random
number then after you print it out on a
screen say it print it 6 then add 1 to
it here what we're saying is we want to
add 1 to the value of random number and
then print it out and that's how you see
the value jump from 6 to 8 and then you
can also see how it decrements and how
we drop down from 8 to six all in one
stop so that's a shortcut way that we
can perform some incremental and
mental operations another thing that's
important to understand is order of
operations and this is pretty much the
same in every language so if we go three
plus two times five is equal to you have
to understand that this is going to be a
different value than if we use
parentheses and five like that and we
could come in and let's just copy this
and change it just slightly like that
and then this time what we're going to
do is we are going to throw parentheses
inside of here to handle or change the
order of operations or the order in
which we're going to perform these
calculations and there you can see right
there in the first situation because
multiplication gets precedence two is
going to be multiplied times five first
and then three is going to be added on
and in this situation we're demanding
that three plus to perform that
operation first and then multiply times
five and you can just see how order of
operations can change the values of our
calculations so there's a quick rundown
of some of the things we can do
mathematically inside of Perl now let's
take a look at conditionals now Perl is
going to consider false to be either
undefined or zero or zero point zero or
empty parentheses or zero string that's
zero okay so those are all the different
falses inside of Perl make sure I type
that right undefined like that that's a
false and we're going to be able to
perform conditional logic using either
equal to not equal to less than greater
than less than or equal to greater than
or equal to like you've seen in many
other different languages and we're also
going to be able to perform boolean
operations using either not which is
going to turn false and true and true
into false and as well as or and I'm
going to show you a whole bunch of
examples of exactly how those are going
to work for us so let's say we have age
is equal to 80 and we're going to do two
different things and I'm also going to
come in here let's make sure I didn't
define age already so let's go to my
like that and I'm going to define if
somebody is going to be able to legally
drive or not so I'm going to say that
the age is equal to 80 let's figure that
out here
using our conditional logic I'm also
going to check if the person is
intoxicated because of course you
shouldn't drive that's true and I'm
given in a value is not intoxicated is
equal to true by putting the one inside
of there and I'm also going to say age
of last exam
because we were going to check out if
the individual has basically been tested
to make sure that it's okay for them to
drive and we'll do a simple if check
here so I'm going to say if age is less
than 16 put our curly brackets and then
inside of here is going to be everything
that executes if that condition is true
so I'm going to say that they can't
drive then else if is actually shortened
take the e out as well as the space and
we can check another condition so here
we want to check if they are intoxicated
or not so we'll say is not intoxicated
and what the knot symbols going to do
here is turn the true into false and
false into a true and here we could say
you can't drive in that situation
because they are intoxicated and then
finally we can say else this is what's
going to come down to if either of those
or both of the above conditions are
false we're going to say you can drive
and there we are and if we execute that
you can see you can drive comes back
because the person is a legal age and
not intoxicated which are both good
things today now we'll go and do a
little bit more complicated example here
so I could show you some of the boolean
operators and how they work so here I'm
going to say if age is greater than or
equal to 1 and that means that both of
these conditions have to come back as
true if we want to be able to perform an
operation or execute code so I'm going
to say if age is greater than or equal
to 1 and age is less than 16 well in
that situation we're going to say that
this person is not going to be able to
draw
of course one a three year old or one
year old driving cars so there we go and
that's how that's going to work for us
then we'll say else if and let's check
once again to make sure the person is
not intoxicated so we'll say is not
intoxicated and we'll say you can't
drive if they are intoxicated we could
do a and even more complicated condition
here with else if let's get really crazy
with this one we're going to say age is
greater than or equal to 80
so if age is greater than or equal to 80
then what we're going to do and we're
going to check two conditions here if
they are 80 years old we're going to say
that the law was passed that says well
its first off say that if they are over
100 they're not allowed to drive sorry
I'm just I'm not picking on people I'm
just using this as an example then what
we can do is we can also say that a
person over 80 must take a test every
couple years like every five years to
make sure that they can legally drive so
we'll say age last exam and then what
we're going to do after that is check
that they've taken their exam every five
years okay so there's that example and
if they are over the age of 80 and they
were over the age of 100 well that's
going to say that the person can't drive
otherwise we're going to say if they're
over the age of 80 and they haven't
recently passed an exam in the last five
years in that situation we're going to
say that they can't drive so we'll just
say you can't drive again you can't
drive otherwise we're going to say that
they can't drive so say you can and then
we are and let's execute whoops messed
something up here and you can see right
here is the error bear word age not
allowed well strict subs bla bla bla bla
line 23 I think you can see what I did I
didn't put my dollar sign inside of
there so let's save that and you can
come back here and you can see that the
answer comes back is you can't drive all
right so let's look at some other
different operators or conditionals that
we can work with here you're going to
use different comparison operators
whenever you're working with strings and
those are going to be equal to not equal
to less than
less than or equal to greater than or
greater than or equal to and we're going
to come in here and show you an example
how that would work so we could say
something like if a is equal to B that's
funny I had to pause for a second I'd
Jehovah Witnesses come to my house I
always come to my house because I'm nice
to them I guess I don't mind all right
so that was funny so let's go and um
here we're checking if these strings or
this character characters are string
whatever it doesn't really matter inside
a Perl and otherwise we're going to say
a doesn't equal B and let's go and
execute and you can see that a doesn't
equal B of course so that's how we check
equality whenever we're working with
strings versus or that's how we check
conditions inside and live with strings
versus how we would check using numbers
another thing is we have something
called unless which is the opposite of
if and you're probably not ever going to
really use this but we can say something
like is not intoxicated like that within
less and then we could say something
like get sober okay so there that's how
unless works and you can see right there
that that comes back that way and the
final thing is the ternary operator
which is going to return different
values depending upon a condition and we
can use it to save a value to a variable
or a we could go and actually print out
different information depending upon a
condition so we'll say something like if
age is equal to or greater than 18 then
we're going to put a little question
mark inside of here and if that comes
back true we're going to say that the
person can vote and then we're going to
put a colon inside of here and if that
comes back as false we're going to say
that the person can't vote so there is
the ternary operator and exactly how
that operates and you can also see here
with say I can either put the
parentheses inside of here or not put
the parentheses inside of here that's a
rundown of what you can do with
conditional statements inside of Perl
now I'm going to go and take a look at
how looping works now first off we have
the for loop and it's going to operate
very
there's a whole bunch of different ways
you can use a for-loop but it's going to
operate in a similar fashion to how you
may have seen in other different
languages so here I'm just defining the
starting value for I and then I'm going
to define a condition so we're basically
going to continue looping as long as I
is less than 10 and then we're going to
define how we're going to increment I as
we cycle through this and make sure that
you put your dollar sign inside of there
and if we run that you can see that it
went and cycled through and printed out
all those different values on our screen
for us we're also going to be able to
use while loops inside of Perl of course
and I'm going to show you the for each
whenever I get into arrays later on so
just want to cover that let's go and
define how we're going to use while
loops so we're going to say I is equal
to 1 we're going to have to define the
value we're going to be incrementing
outside of the while loop and then we're
going to say something like while I is
less than 10 we are going to continue
cycling through these guys let's go and
use our if statement again here what I
want to do is just print out odd numbers
as we cycle through this time just to be
a little bit different so I'm going to
go modulus 2 is equal to 0 and in that
situation we're going to increment the
value of I another guy that's available
to us is next and what this is going to
do is skip back to the beginning of the
loop and not execute anything that
follows it sort of like continue in
other programming languages and then
we'll also we're going to throw another
if statement in here we'll say if I is
equal to a 7 in this situation we're
going to call the function called last
what that's going to do is completely
break us out of our looping structure so
that's sort of like break in other
programming languages so next is like
continue and last is like break in other
languages and then we can come in here
and we can just type in say and see what
the results are for this and then just
make sure that you increment your values
inside of here for all the different
conditions that could come up and if you
do you can see that it only printed the
odds 1 3 and 5 and whenever it hits 7 it
jumped out of the looping store
sure and stop printing things all
together we're also going to have
another one of these guys and that is
going to be called the do-while and
you're going to use it anytime you want
to make sure that you always go through
the loop at least once so let's say we
have like a lucky number that we want
the person to come in here and try to
check and we'll say that that is the
value of 7 so let's come in here and
we'll say guess and we don't need to
give it a value it just has a value of
undefined just remember that and the
do-while loop is going to start off with
do right there and then at the end of it
what you're going to do is you're going
to define exactly how long this
condition or how long this is going to
execute and we're going to say that we
want to continue executing as long as
the guest that person types in is not
equal to the lucky number and don't
forget to put your little semicolon or
yeah semicolon at the end there and now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
guess a number between 1 and 10 and this
is how we get input from the user
guess is equal to and we're going to put
brackets and standard in that's going to
be the keyboard in this situation so
we're going to get input from the user
just like that and then we can also say
you guessed 7 and we come in and execute
guess the number between 1 and 10 we can
type in 2 that's not right and then we
can type in 7 and we got 7 so there's
how we use the do-while loop as well as
how we get input from the user all
useful stuff now remember up here I said
that I want to use the switch statement
inside of Perl that is actually a
different guy it is going to be called
the given win statement but you're going
to see here exactly how that looks so
let's just get rid of all that stuff and
let's come in here and define age old is
equal to 18 then what we're going to do
is we're going to say given age old is
going to be the variable we're going to
be checking for then what I'm going to
find
is you could either put a value inside
of here or you could put a condition
inside of here could do a lot of
different things and we're going to type
in the dollar sign and an underscore
here to represent the value for age old
so we're going to say if their age is
greater than 16 well then we're going to
say drive just to be simple and if you
don't put continue inside of here it's
going to stop checking all the other
different conditions
if you leave continue inside of there
it's going to check for the next when so
we're going to do that just to be
different and I'll sign like that and
we'll say that they're older than 17 in
this situation we're going to say go
vote and there you go and then we're
going to say remember we didn't put
continuing here so it's not going to
check the last one
if both or either one of those comes
back is true and then here we'll just
say nothing special I don't know there
we hard so that's how we would use that
guy and you can see the drive and go
vote both print out on the screen so
there is a whole bunch of different
things we can do looping wise so now
let's go and take a look at what we can
do with strings now a string as a scalar
just like anything else and we're going
to come in here and type in long string
and we can go in and say a random long
string even though it's not particularly
long just wanting to make it longer
though all right so there we go and we
can go and get the length of our string
just by going like a string and
don't have to type that in obviously
just type in link and then come in and
type in long string and it's going to
get you the value for that which could
be very helpful if you're working with
for loops or other things like that you
want to cycle through a string well just
use length index is going to return the
location of a string let's use printout
fear again just as a review of what
exactly that does so we'll say long is
at and we're going to find the location
or the index for long in this situation
and to get that index we just type in
index and then we type in a long string
which is the string that we're going to
be searching for and then inside of this
we're going to type in the word that we
are going to be searching for and that's
how we get that likewise we could go and
use our index to return the last
occurrence of something we're going to
use printf here again so let's just copy
that paste that in there and we could
say something like last G is at and
leave that exactly the same except we're
going to change this to our index and
then here we're going to change that to
G and you can see long starts at index
number seven and last G is at index 17
and whenever you're using indexes with
strings the very first character or R in
this situation is going to be zero and
then one two three four run and upwards
from there you're going to be able to
concatenate or join strings with the dot
operator
so go long string is equal to and then
we'll go a long string again and if we
want to join that do that and then we
could say something like isn't and in
this situation when we have single
quotes we're going to back slash that
out isn't that long and then close that
guy off and that's how easy it is to
concatenate or join strings substring is
going to receive a string the starting
index and the number of characters to
retrieve so we'll say index seven
through ten is what we're looking to
gather here and substring once again
we're going to type in first off the
string that we want to be searching for
and we're going to put
after that and then we're going to
define the starting index and then the
total number of characters that we want
to receive whoops I'm going to show you
the percent sign what it does here in a
second we're going to be searching for a
scalar though and we'll execute that and
you can see index seven through ten and
it gets you the word long so that's how
we can grab individual parts of a string
let's go and create another one of these
guys let's call this animal and animals
now chop is going to delete and return
the last character of a string so we'll
go print out and there's actually a
special one for deleting new lines which
I'm going to show you here again so
let's say last character is and we'll
put that inside of there and we'll throw
a new line inside of there and if we
want to get that last character we type
in chop and animal and not only will it
remove it but it will also return it to
us last character is s and like I said
chomp is going to delete new lines and
you will use that a lot
so we'll say something like no new line
is equal to no new line and then we'll
throw a new line inside of there and if
we want to get rid of that new line
we'll just type in Chomp and no new line
and then we'll delete that new line and
there's no point in seeing that exactly
how that works we could also come in
here and upper case and lower case our
different characters so we can say upper
case and we will throw our string inside
of there and to upper case every letter
we just type in you see and we'll just
throw our long string inside of there
and likewise we also have a lower case
which is LC and upper case first and
lower case first you could also do but I
can't imagine why you'd want to do that
and if we execute them you can see that
that's upper case that's lower case and
this is going to upper case the first
character inside of our string next guy
is really cool it is this guy right here
what this is going to do is take a list
of characters on the left and replace
them with the characters that are on the
right so we can come in here and do
something like long string and you have
to type in equals followed by the tilde
to use this s
here what we're going to say is that we
want to take all of the spaces and
replace them with a comma and a space
and then we're going to type in G inside
of here and that means that we want to
replace all occurrences if you don't do
that we'll just replace the first and we
could also type an I in there if we
wanted to ignore case you know upper
case or lower case and we can just say
say long string and you can see right
there that it replaced all those so
there's tons of really cool little tools
that are built inside of Perl could also
do go and repeat a string let's go and
do it under those so we'll say something
like two times is equal to and you want
to multiply that this is an X that we
put inside of there and that's going to
double that up and say two times and it
says what I said is and it says what I
said is so that's another neat little
trick we can do with strings we could
also create a range of characters and
then put them in an array you want to
define an array you put an at symbol
looks a lot like a array or like a a so
that's how we define an array we're
going to get more into those later so we
can go and let's say we wanted to
generate all the different letters in
the alphabet that's how that is that's
how easy that is to do we could also
combine values in an array and define
the separation with something called
join so you can type join like this and
we can come in and throw comments out of
there and what this is going to do is
it's going to separate all those
different characters we have there with
a comma and a space and then we just
throw in our array that we want to print
out there on our screen and then we
could also come in here and throw in a
newline and there you can see it printed
out all the letters on the screen we
could also increment letters I know I'm
getting into a lot of really weird stuff
but if you had my letter like this and
you had C inside of there you'd actually
be able to say say next letter and go
and increment that letter and their next
letter is D say and I think I've covered
a lot of the real crazy stuff you're
going to see with strings inside of Perl
now what we're going to do is we're
going to jump in and take a look at
arrays I showed you a sec
go basically an array is just a list of
scalars and they're going to start off
with the @ sign instead of the dollar
sign so let's go and show you how to
create another one so we can do
something like create an array of primes
and you're going to put parentheses
around these guys 3 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;amp; 11 and 13
and 17 that's enough there you go you
just created an array of prime numbers
now you're going to be able to store
multiple data types also in arrays
inside of Perl so we could do something
like my info is equal to you're going to
put it inside of quotes once again and
it could put it like my name and an
address and I could throw in an age and
height and there you go that's all that
information in a different array with
different data types you can also assign
new values by referencing an index
you're going to use a dollar sign here
though whenever you want to do that so
we can just say my info and in the
fourth index let's say that I wanted to
put my last name inside of there that's
how that is done you're also going to be
able to cycle through an array by using
another version of the for loop remember
I said I'm going to cover more versions
of the for loop and we're going to say
my because we are creating the variable
info so you always have to put my inside
of there and what I want to cycle
through is the my info array and there
that is and we can say say and info and
there you can see it printed all that
information out and there's my last name
which is in index 4 so 0 1 2 3 4 all
right so we can also use another version
of 4 called for each which is also going
to be a way to cycle through an array
and to do that we can just say for each
my num and then we're going to put
inside of here the array that we want to
cycle through and then we can say say
and let's just keep this simple will
just say num and there you can see it
printed all the prime numbers out so
there's a couple different ways to use
force to cycle through arrays another
thing that's really kind of neat is
you're going to just be able to say for
and then go my info just as a awesome
shortcut parentheses and then say say
followed by
dollar sign and underscore now this
dollar sign and underscore is
automatically used if no variable is
declared and we're going to be using
that more and more and more and you can
say that it went and cycle through there
just as the other one did it's just a
shortcut something to be aware of you're
also going to be able to slice data from
an array so let's say that I wanted to
say my and my name is going to be the
equal or is going to be this guy right
here and I could go my info and I want
to cycle or I want to grab out the first
index inside of there as well as the
fourth and store them in this new array
I can do that and then I could just say
say at my name and let's just print both
those indexes out there real quick and
you can see a derek bands pops back
there's no space however but i showed
you how to use join and things like that
to join all these different guys if you
wanted to do that if you wanted to find
out the length of an array in here and
go items scalar whenever it's used with
an array is going to return the number
of different values that are stored
inside of there and five pops back way
down here you're also going to be able
to come in and assign values from an
array to variables so we could say
something like my and then type in F
name for my first name my address how
old am i and my height and my last name
and sign all those from the array by
just going equal to and then typing in
my info and then if this is a little bit
neater we can now say F name and last
name and there you can see it printed
out my first and last name also going to
be able to pop the last value off of an
array I just let's go popped value by
just typing in pop like this and the
item we want to pull off or the array
that we want to pull stuff off of we're
also going to be able to push a value on
to the end
of an array and whenever you do that
it's not going to return the value that
was popped off it's instead going to
return the length of the array and oh
let's go and actually see that pushed
value and here we'll type in push
instead and we're going to type in
primes and we'll say that we want to put
17 onto the end of the array another
thing we can do is we can actually
return the first item with shift so we
can say say first item and shift and
again we're just going to type in the
array that we want to shift and we could
also add a value to the front and once
again get the length by using unchipped
so let's say unshifted item and
unchipped and the array that we're going
to be working with and the value that we
want to put on to the front of that guy
and then let's say that we want to come
in here and print out this array that
has had all this different stuff done to
it we want to separate everything with a
coma and we want to get all of the array
items from the primes array and then at
the end of it we want to throw in a
newline and you can say that it printed
out all those prime numbers no the thing
we're going to be able to do with rays
is splice out values and to do that well
let's just go say remove indexes 0
through 2 and how we would do that is
type in splice and then you're going to
put in the array name so I'm going to
say that Prime's is the array that I
want to pull information out of and then
I'm going to go
what index so I want to start at 0 and
then what index do I want to how many
items do I want to pull out I'm going to
say 3 and we can come in here and print
out this new guy just to see how that
works
and there you can say that it knocked
off the first couple values and it also
shot back the values that it did pull
off at the screen or pulled out of the
array we're also going to be able to
come in here and join a joint to list so
we can with the join obviously so we're
gonna say join and here I'm going to
find how I
those items to be separated and then
after that I can come in and throw some
different things so we could say
something like list of words and then I
could also come in and I can Chuck's the
product put double quotes or single cuts
inside of here so that's going to join
those we could also use split to turn a
string into an array so let's say we
have customers and we're going to have
Sue Sally and Paul now we could go and
create a customer array is equal to and
call split and how we want them to split
is with a space in between them and then
we're going to type in the string that
we want to split into this new array and
then once again how we want to show them
out on the screen customer array and
there you could say that they print it
out on the screen from the array
reverse is going to reverse an array so
let's say we want to go customer array
is equal to and we want to actually
store the opposite inside of it we could
just type in customer array and that's
going to reverse the order of that we're
also going to be able to sort our array
with sort so we can just min and say
customer array is equal to sort at and
we'll just edit customer array again we
can do a reverse sort by just typing in
reverse in front of sort and that's
going to give us a reverse sort for a
rat and grep is going to filter a list
according to an expression which is
extremely useful I could do a whole
tutorial and grep but just for now I'm
just going to show you the basics so
let's go and create a new number array
now let's say we want to add a value if
the modulus operator doesn't return a
value of zero so we're going to say
something we're going to create a new
array and it's going to have nothing but
odd numbers inside of it so odds are a
is equal to crap and then inside of here
we're going to take each individual
value remember if a variable isn't
defined then it's just going to
automatically go into the dollar sign
underscore so modulus two and we'll go
to
and we'll do a print join inside of here
and throw our odds array inside of there
and you can see it printed out just the
odds and then finally to finish off this
coverage of array and other array
related topics I'm going to show you map
so do my double array and map is going
to perform a function on every item in
the array so we can go map and let's say
that we wanted to come in here and
multiply everything in the array times
two and there's number all right and
we'll throw a joint inside of here and
this will be double array is what we
want to print out and there you can see
it did just that so there's a rundown of
things you can do with arrays inside of
Perl as well as a whole bunch of other
different things now let's take a look
at hashes now how hash is going to be
different from arrays or is that hashes
use keys to access values and to define
a hash you're going to put a percent
sign inside of here and then let's say
we have something like employees is
equal to and you can put these on
separate lines if you'd like so we can
say something like Sue and then you're
going to put an equal sign like a little
arrow inside of here and 35 you could
actually put a comma inside of there but
I personally like this butter so we're
going to say when I mean you could put a
comma here instead of that arrow but I
like this this design better and we
could so in a 43 and then we could go in
and put Sam and 39 and close that off
with a semicolon
and we could say print F and sue is and
we'll go and get a decimal from this guy
and you're going to access the hash
value by putting in a dollar sign and
employees and then you're going to use
curly brackets and you can either put su
inside of quotes or not inside of quotes
it's up to you and you can see that su
is 35 pops back right like that you're
also going to be able to add a new key
to a hash so we can just go employees
and then you're going to use curly
brackets and I can type in Frank this
son is 44 going to be able to iterate
over a hash and print
both the keys and the values I'm going
to use a while loop here and put my
inside of here because we're going to be
creating two different variables and
I'll just have my key and I'll have my
value and then I'm going to say equal to
each is the guy that's going to allow
you to cycle through this hash and this
is employees and then inside of curly
brackets I'm going to say print and the
keys and values so key and value and you
could see that it's cycled through and
printed out all that information you're
also going to be able to slice data from
a hash so let's say we do something like
create an array is equal to going to
define the hash you want to work with
here and we're going to use curly
brackets though and set and here we're
going to say that we want to slice out
su as well as Sam and throw them in the
array and then we could just say say
ages remember it's not going to throw a
newline in there each time you can see
the 35 and 39 pop back we could actually
convert a hash into an array let's go
and create another one of these guys so
go hash array is equal to and you just
go and put employees here and that's how
easy that is you're going to be able to
delete a key as well as a value by just
typing in delete remember put the dollar
sign inside of there and you're going to
put employees and then whatever you want
to delete so let's say we want to delete
Frank out of there we can do that and we
could print this out again if we wanted
to see how things have changed and you
can see that Frank was added and then
Frank was deleted out of there we could
also come in and check if one of these
values was actually saved inside here so
let's say that we want to check if Sam
exists in this array we're going to type
in exists and then we'll type in
employees and then specifically what
we're looking for which is going to be
Sam and let's go and do a ternary
operator here so Sam is here and
otherwise no Sam and Sam is here of
course comes back because Sam is inside
of that hash we're also going to be able
to cycle through keys and we can say my
key and the operator that's going to
allow us to do that is called keys and
we just need to pass
and the hash that we're going to be
Sirkin or cycling through and then while
we are cycling through it we could come
in here and say employees and
specifically we could say that we want
to look for key equal to 35 and in that
situation we could say a say hi Sue and
you can see hi sue pops back and that's
a rundown of what you can do with hashes
inside of Perl now I'm going to take a
look at subroutines now subroutines or
functions are going to allow you to call
for a block of code to execute and how
you define one is by typing in sub and
then you give it a name and you can give
this one get random we're going to work
with arguments in a different way than
in other languages but in this situation
we're going to generate a random number
from 0 to 10 just by typing in random 11
now what we're going to be able to do is
say random number and call this
subroutine just by calling get random
and then put your parentheses at the end
there and you can see that it comes back
as random eMeter to random number 10 and
so forth and so on so there's a basic
subroutine it just returns the same
thing every single time you call it if
you want to work with arguments that are
being passed inside of here we're going
to go sub and get random max let's say
that we want to allow them to define the
maximum size of the random number that
is generated we can do that and to
access arguments that are passed to a
subroutine they're all going to be
stored in the at underscore so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
say max number it's only ever going to
accept one our argument so we're going
to say at underscore that is the array
that is going to be sort inside of so
we're going to grab whatever value is
stored inside there and then save it to
the variable max number and then we want
to define a default just in case they
forgot to give us one and just go like
this and let's say that our default is
going to be 11 and then in this
situation we're going to return a
different random number based off of the
maximum value that they passed inside of
it and that's how easy that is and now
we come in and say
exact thing that we did before except in
this situation let's say that we want
this to be 100 and you can see right
there Kim Pak is 8 that's funny oh the
reason why get random underscore max
there we go and you can also see that if
we pass in an argument and it doesn't
use it it's just disregarded no errors
are thrown or anything in there you can
see now it's working properly okay happy
accident and we learned something else
so that's good you're also going to be
able to receive multiple values in your
supper routine so let's say that we go
and create a new sub routine called get
some we're going to be able to come in
here and define two variables so let's
say it's number 1 and number 2 is equal
to and just put at and it's going to
grab the first one and store it in the
first variable and the second one and
store it in the second variable so you
don't have to think too much we can come
in and define our default values if we'd
like to and that's just to protect once
again if they forget to send something
inside of there and number 2 and let's
just give that the value of 1 as well
and then we can come in and return the
sum of both of those numbers so num1 and
num2 and i think you know how that works
out you can check that out on your own
and other things kind of cause we're
going to be able to receive an unknown
number of values so say let's call this
guy some many and we're going to come in
and say my and define sum is equal to 0
and then we can say something like for
each my Val and say that we want to
cycle through all of the different items
that were passed inside of there and
then we can sum up all those individual
values that were passed inside of there
and after we're done we can say return
sum and then down inside of here we
could then pass in a whole bunch of them
and then pass in as many as we would
like look and I got a little bit an
error the reason why I got an error is
this needs to have an underscore
underneath it and this one does as well
and there you can see some comes back as
15 so pretty cool stuff you can also
have a variable in a function retain its
value with state as you'll see here so
let's say we have something like you
and then we'll type in state and execute
total is equal to zero and each time
this is called it's going to execute or
increment execute total but it's going
to retain that value and we can do
something like executed times like that
and then we could just come in and type
in increment and increment multiple
times and see exactly how that works a
and it retains that value another thing
that's useful is you can return multiple
values so we'll do something like double
array go my and defined number right
equal to and get the values that are
passed inside of that and then go to
sign underscore four and we're going to
do that for all those different values
in our array and then say return Norma
Rae and now outside of our subroutine we
can say my and find another one let's
just call this random array is equal to
and five and then say print join and
call our subroutine double array and
pass in random array and throw a newline
inside of there and you can see that it
went and doubled all those different
values for us you can also return single
variables so we can go sub and we'll say
get in malts and go my random number get
that argument passed inside of there and
then we can define a default for this
guy random number and let's give it a
value of one and then say return random
number times two and also random number
times three and now we can come out of
here and go my and double num and then
trip num is equal to get Maltz and then
pass three inside of there and then just
to see what they look like and there
they are six and nine
pretty much anything you'd ever want to
do with subroutines or functions you can
do and the final thing I'm going to do
here is cover how to use or how to
create recursive subroutines which are
just going to be subroutines a call
so I'm going to use the factorial
example which is very common so we're
going to come in and we're going to say
nom is equal to and get the value of the
argument passed inside and we're going
to say return 0 if the value for nom is
less than or equal to 0 otherwise we're
going to say return 1 if num is equal to
1 and then here we're going to call our
functions
so we'll say num times factorial and
then we'll go and pass in num minus 1 so
that's where we're going to be calling
it and then we'll skom in and say say
factorial of 4 for example is equal to
and call this subroutine by passing in a
value of 4 and if we execute the
factorial 4 comes back as equal to 24
which it is and if you want to see how
that works whenever we come through here
the very first time we're going to get 4
then we're going to take the value of 3
which you get right here and call
factorial again and then we'll cycle
down to 3 now it's going to be to come
down here to + 1 so 2 times factorial of
1 is going to be the same as being equal
to 2 this 2 jumps up here multiply that
times 3 which is going to give us a
value of 6 which jumps up here which we
multiply 2 times 4 which gives us our
final value of 24 so there's a rundown
of what you can do with subroutines or
functions inside of Perl now I'm going
to take a look at file i/o
now I'm going to create a text file and
we have a bunch of different employees
inside of here let's go and delete that
out of there so here's a whole bunch of
different employees and we're going to
read that data into our system here so
what I'm going to do first is I'm going
to go and define employee file being
equal to employees and this is our text
file that we have right here and then
we're going to open this file we're
going to say open my and we're going to
type in F H which stands for our file
handler which is going to be used to
access the file and then we
going to type in a less than sign and
this means we are opening the file for
reading only and then the actual file
that we're going to be reading from and
then we're going to say or die which
means you know kill the program can't
open file in that situation and here we
can use dollar sign and an underscore
and this is going to provide an error
message in the situation in which we get
to that point now we can call the while
loop and this is a continue cycling
through the file as long as there is
information to be gathered and we're
just going like this and brackets and
there is our file Handler and make sure
we close that off and then what we're
going to do as we cycle through all of
our file or all the information inside
of the file first we're going to come in
and delete our new line so we use chomp
again which you saw previously and then
I'm going to go and get information out
of here so I'm going to say something
like employee name and then the next
thing I want to get out of here is the
employee job and then the employee ID
and we can do that by using splits which
you saw previously so we're going to
split on the colon and info is going to
be each line that we're going to be
pulling from that guy and then we can
come in and actually go and print this
information on the screen is a and we
could say job and has the ID of whatever
the ID is for said person and if we run
that you can see salary as the secretary
and has the idea of 121 okay so we were
able to go in there and read our file we
always want to close our file after
we're done and we can do that by
referencing the file Handler and we
could put in a message here in the
situation which we have some type of
error so close file and then once again
dollar sign underscore is going to be an
error message that prints out on our
screen if we have that we could also
open the file for appending data which
means putting that at the end of the
file so we say file handler
and here this is how we would append
data and employee file is where we're
going to be reading that information
from or to I which means that we can't
open our file and our sign underscore is
going to print out our error message and
to append to the end of the file you
just reference the
file handler and then we'll say that we
want to put mark and salesman inside of
here and 124 and we could throw in a
newline inside of there let's open this
up I already have mark inside of there
let's delete him out of there just so we
can see that this is actually going to
work and then we would come in and close
our file once again just copy that paste
that in there boom we did this and here
you can see that mark is in there now
because we were able to append that to
the end of the file we can also open a
file to read and write from it and we
might as well just copy this because
it's all basically going to be exactly
the same so good like this we're just
going to change this guy right here
however we're going to put a plus and a
less than sign everything else is going
to be exactly the same now if we want to
seek to the beginning of the file we're
going to do a file Handler and that seek
position is going to be 0 0 so we moved
to the beginning of the file and then if
we want to print information to the file
we use the print statement again with
the file handler again and we'll say in
this situation we want to put somebody
named Phil inside of there let's just
let them be a salesperson and 25 save
that and let's come in and close our
file once again there we are
and if we come back and look at employee
as you can see that Phil is now in the
beginning part of our text file so
there's a run down what we can do with
file i/o now let's take a look at object
oriented pearl now in Pearl a class is
going to correspond to a package which
is just a self-contained unit variables
and subroutines that you can call for
and use inside of your programs so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
store these packages in the Lib folder
so let's go
and say that we want to use the lib
folder and now let's jump over to cat
and let's go and actually create this
guy so we're going to define this as
package animal cat and we're going to
put two brackets inside of there and you
can see the file structure here animals
a folder cat is followed by the pm
extension and we're going to say use
strict again and use warnings just to
make sure that we can see if anything
goes wrong now what we're going to do is
create a constructor now this doesn't
have to be called new but it's very
commonly called new we're going to get
arguments that are going to be passed it
whenever a new object is created and
we're going to go class is equal to
shift let's grab that information out of
there and then we'll also go self which
is a reference to this actual object we
have here and to get the name that is
passed in when these objects are created
that's how you're going to do it you can
also get the owner and we can go shipped
once again and then close that off now
what we're going to do is call bles
which is going to return the reference
for us a bless self and class and then
we will return our finished object to be
used now we're also going to be able to
put other subroutines inside of here
let's just do a simple one like get name
and just going to be like any other
subroutine here we're going to reference
self which is this object it's like this
and other programming languages and
there that is and now that we have self
defined we can return the value for name
and just type name inside of there and
close that off we're also going to be
able to allow them to set values so
let's go and set name and once again
we're going to have to define self
inside of here as well as name that's
going to be changed too and we can get
those by calling that whenever this
function is called and so name so that's
setting the new name for our object and
go name if defined if they gave us a
value for name we're going to set that
value right there and then we have to go
return self name and there that is so
that allows us to get the name as well
as set the name why don't we go and
create one more subroutine this is going
to get our animal or our cat sound and
output information on the screen again
we're going to do the same thing again
reference self which is the object
itself we're going to this guy return
and here we'll say self and we'll say
name and since it's a cat we're going to
say says meow and that can be called and
then the way we finish off our packages
we always have to put a 1 and a
semicolon here and this is because a
package must return true whenever it's
called let's save that jump back over
into Pearl type 1 and let's create some
objects so we already reference we want
to use the Lib folder we also want to
use this package so there's animal cat
so we'll be able to reference that
object we can come in here and create a
cat object let's call it whiskers is
equal to and you can call new that is a
reference to that new subroutine inside
of there remember it doesn't have to be
called new but we're going to call it
that and we'll say whiskers and we'll
say that the owner of whiskers is Derek
and we can call the subroutine so we
could say say whiskers if we want to
call the subroutine and go get name we
can also go and change the name so let's
say that whiskers needs to have a upper
case value well we can do set the name
just exactly the same way and whiskers
like this there you are you were able to
change that value and we can come in and
go whiskers
and get whiskers name changed name nm
let's call our final subroutine which is
going to be whiskers and get sound and
see how that works for us and whiskers
you can now see that the name has been
changed to an uppercase and here you can
see that whisker says meow coming back
now the final thing I'm going to do is
show you how inheritance works so we're
going to go to a lion so this is going
to allow us to inherit all the variables
as well as all of the subroutines inside
of here so we're going to define the
name for this package which is going to
be animal lion we're going to say that
we want to use animal cat inside of here
and use strict if you want to inherit
all the variables and subroutines from
cat you just go our @ sign is a is equal
to Q W and animal and cat if you want to
override a method you can go sub and
let's say well we can't have our liance
and meow so we're going to instead come
in here let's get self which is our
object equal to at underscore and
instead return self and get our name for
our lion and our lion is going to say
roar instead into that subroutine right
there 1 and then we can jump back over
into our Perl Tut here we can say use
animal lion we can create a new one
let's call him King go and get a new
lion
let's pass in King as the name and this
lion doesn't have an owner so we just
created that and then we can say King we
want you to go and show us your new
sounds whoops this is going to be my
King not use King and if we execute you
can see the King comes in here and while
it retained all the variables and
subroutines we also were able to
override another subroutine there you go
guys that is an insane amount of
information about Perl all in one video
and like I said all the code cheat
sheets transcripts are available in the
