my web design and programming tutorial
today I'm going to talk about object
oriented programming in PHP you cannot
really perform object-oriented
programming in PHP perfectly I'll just
leave it that way but you can definitely
perform kind of a knockoff version of
what is called object oriented
programming with PHP and that's what I'm
going to show you here over the next
couple tutorials whenever you want to
define class which is just a blueprint
that is going to be used to define what
all of the objects that it is used to
create should look like
meaning what attributes are variables
those objects should contain and what
functions or methods those objects
should contain now to create a class and
I'm going to do this kind of in a facade
Oh code type of way you start off with
the name class then you follow with the
name of your class in uppercase letters
this is something that's normally
different of course you don't have to do
this but this is considered good
practice and then you would define
certain variables so let's say variable
two and all of the objects that you then
create are going to automatically be
assigned these variables and I'm going
to give you a bunch of real world
examples here in a second you would then
use something called encapsulation to
protect these variables now
encapsulation lets you hide the code
behind an interface of sorts so you can
both protect the code and also so your
users of your code do not need to
understand the code you wrote and then
variables inside of PHP and most other
programming languages they operate in
anyway using object-oriented programming
principles are often given additional
attributes such as they are either
public private or protected and there's
another one actually there's two other
ones that I'm going to cover in the next
tutorial what I mean by public public
means that anyone can access this
information in this variable and make
changes to it I'm going to show you here
examples that whenever you define a
variable as being public or an attribute
as being public that means you are
allowing anybody to just step in here
and change the value of this variable or
get the value for this variable private
is very restricted the only way you can
get access to a private variable is to
literally set one call
method or a function that is going to
allow the person to define what this
value is with a function that lies
inside of the class
that's encapsulation so then in this for
instance what you would do is a variable
1 is equal to value passed this helps in
regards to encapsulation and this is
only for private and protected variables
not public and also a private variable
is protected in regards to how well you
can access or retrieve the value of said
variable and it normally operates
something like this and then of course
after you define all of the variables
and functions that your object has you
are then going to close off the class ok
so now I'm going to create you a real
world one I just thought I'd do that
real quick here so that you could
understand the basics of this before I
jump right into an example so let's say
I create a class called animal and by
the way protected I'll cover more in the
next tutorial because it's a little bit
more complicated and then I'm going to
define some variables inside here so say
that all my animals are going to have
names they're all going to have an age
which we're going to protect and for now
they are not going to have any protected
variables it's also static variables and
constants which we'll get more into in
the next part of the tutorial ok so I
created name and I've created age I told
you before you can directly access name
so I don't have to create set functions
for it but I do need to create a set
function for both age and get age and
for people to be able to access these
functions I'm going to have to make
these functions public so I'm going to
create this and make that public and of
course you have to come in here and type
in function function and instead of this
I'm gonna call this sent age and age
here is actually going to be changed by
referring to this followed by a minus
sign and any closing caret brace this is
referring to the object this is a direct
reference to the actual object itself
and then this is a reference to the
variable called age inside of the object
and we're going to create an object here
in a minute and to save time
this and paste this in there and anytime
you want to refer to variables inside of
objects you have to use the this keyword
I'm going to come in here and type of
this again - and closing caret price
followed by age okay so all this is
going to work now so now we got this
basic class created this animal class so
now I'm going to actually create the
object so let's say I create an object
called dog is equal to and then you
would always type new followed by the
name of your class and close that off
then I'm going to say that I want my dog
object name to be equal to Rover and
then I'm going to create a variable
called dog name and I'm going to assign
it the value of dog - name like this so
basically what I'm doing here is I'm
creating an object of type dog of the
classic animal here I'm assigning a
value to the public attribute name which
is up here see I can do that because
this is a public variable you would not
be able to do this same thing with age
that would throw an error and then I'm
retrieving the value from the public
attribute name so this is how you would
retrieve values if they are public
inside of PHP and this is how you would
set values inside of PHP using
object-oriented principles so you might
say how well how do I set the age well
here I'm going to call dog - carrot and
I'm gonna call the function that resides
inside of there and now age is actually
going to be equal to 8 and normally
whenever you create these functions
really wouldn't be any point of creating
them at all if you didn't have certain
error handling to make sure that the
values that are being sent are actually
proper values so for example if somebody
sent a string or a boolean value or
something I wouldn't make any sense for
this so I would definitely provide
certain error handling but this is just
an example so I'm going to try to keep
this as simple as possible and then what
I'm going to do is echo out to the
screen the dog's name is dog name got
close that off and I'm also going to
echo to screen the dog's age is dog I'm
going to call for the get age function
and come in here and copy this and paste
it in here and if we run this code and
went to file save jump over here you can
see dog's name is Grover say that's
we're coming from this line and the
dog's age is 8 so here
just specifically just called for the
function that I referenced up here I
could actually put this guy right here
in there but I just chose to keep that
separate and this is how you call for
functions inside of PHP using
object-oriented principles now you could
also come in here and create things
called constant variables it's just
going to have the same number every time
so let's say all these animals are
associated with a pound ID where they're
located 2 3 4 5 and let's say that
that's it this is always going to be the
same for every single animal that comes
from this pound so I feel comfortable in
making this a constant another thing
that you almost always do in PHP is
create something called a constructor
file and this is how you would create
that this is a file that is called every
single time you create a new object
inside of PHP and it must have this name
construct and here I'm going to allow
them to set the age just by default so
everything that you keep inside of here
is going to be called or run every
single time you create a new object so
let's just say I go created just so we
have proof that this guy was actually
called and then here I'm going to show
you this - and remember this is a
reference to the object you've created
set age to the value of age that was
passed to it just like that and another
thing that's used is inside a PHP not
often but is used is what is called the
set function and it can be used to
perform error checking before assigning
values to private attributes like age up
here by default and how you create that
is just function and if I don't set
anything here it's automatically public
it's just a set attribute name and this
sort of breaks encapsulation because it
allows you to change private variables
of any type using the set function so
you can use it if you want this is why
it's not often used here I'm going to
set it up so that you know who called it
put that in there put that in there and
then here again this is how you would
set the value for the attribute that it
was requested so this for example would
be age so they would pass that they want
to change age to whatever value they
have here and this can be used as a
universal function to change any
attribute
side of the object again it's not
perfect form but it is something that is
used so I'm explaining it to you so that
if you ever see it you'll actually know
what it is
and underscore underscore get provides
you access to any attribute whether it's
private or not
and I'm just going to copy this and
paste that in there return the value of
that attribute assigned to that object
okay I know this is kind of get a little
heady and a little bit complicated but
told you before eventually it's going to
get a little bit complicated this is
probably one of the most complicated
parts of the tutorial is understanding
this stuff and it's almost never covered
in books for some reason don't know why
in here I'm going to show you what it
looks like whenever you are actually
trying to call for the set function see
there's no mention of set inside of here
you're just simply calling to change do
you want to change the value of a
private attribute or variable inside of
this object which is normally something
would be blocked and would trigger an
error but since you have a set function
created this is automatically called
instead of triggering an error and it
automatically assigns everything right
and it essentially breaks encapsulation
to a certain extent but it does just
simply work and this is how you would
call the get function just simply by
referring to that private variable as if
it wasn't private and then finally if
you wanted to print out the value of the
constant that's going to remain constant
no matter how many different objects you
create again this is another weird sort
of guy you reference the name of your
object for followed by two colons
followed by the constants name copy case
and then file save and see if I typed in
that alright and I did surprisingly I
know so basically what happens and in
this code right here is a new object has
created I just kind of track myself up
whenever I don't make typos but either
way this is when the construct file is
called and here is the construct file
right up side here and this is called
every single time you create a new
object see construct create it right
there then if we come down here we set
the value for growver but that doesn't
do anything so nothing shows up then we
go in there and ask for the name for the
object called dog and assign it to this
then
we set the age in the right way the way
you're supposed to and here you can see
I set the page to 8 and then I set it to
9 and then here I said print out the
value of age and you can see nine shows
up not eight that's the reason we
overrode that and then here like I
showed you before Grover gets printed
and here you see how to get nine and
here you see how to get hold of the
constant file that you defined here in
this object so that is a run-through of
a whole ton of different things in
regards to object-oriented programming
with PHP that is normally not covered
anywhere I mean I know it's covering
other websites but it's there's
countless numbers of books that never go
through this stuff so thought you guys
might be interested in it got a lot to
request you anything is not
understandable leave a question or
comment below and I'm going to continue
explaining additional ways of using
object-oriented programming with PHP and
upcoming tutorials till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
