of my design patterns video tutorial
today we're going to talk about the
facade design pattern and chances are
you have used the facade design pattern
and don't even realize it is an
extremely simple pattern and it's pretty
much common sense that we would use it
as much as possible and the reason why
use the facade design pattern whenever
you want to create a simplified
interface that performs many other
actions behind the scenes and here is a
perfect example and the example I will
show you in code that will follow let's
say you want to just simply be able to
say can I withdraw 50 dollars from the
bank you would then expect the person
that you would pose this question to to
check if your checking account number is
correct check if your security code is
correct
check if those funds are available and
then make changes accordingly mean give
you them 50 dollars that you asked for
and then subtract 50 dollars from your
current account all of that stuff you
would expect to happen quite seamlessly
and that is how you would implement that
using the facade design pattern so let's
stop messing around and get right into
the code alright we're going to just go
right into test bank account right here
and I'm going to show you exactly what
we're going to aim to do what we're
basically going to do is implement the
facade and I'm just going to call it
Bank facade accessing Bank is equal to
new bank account facade and then let's
say you pass it a security code or your
checking account number followed by your
security key and there you go so you've
created that guy and then we want to
simply be able to ask it questions and
then just have it do everything right on
its own so withdraw cash $50 and then we
expect it to just do that and then we
could also come in here and withdraw
cash of say $900 and since we only have
$1,000 in the bank as you're going to
see here in a second we're going to
handle that and then also we want to
give it the option to deposit cash of
say $200 okay so those are all the
things that we want to implement here
and you can see that all these things
are going to be handled in the
background just as I talked about in the
previous part of the presentation so now
let's go in here and start implementing
all the different classes that are going
to handle all these things behind the
scenes well next thing we're going to do
is go into
welcome to bank job ah it's just going
to give you a simple welcome message so
system.out.print line and say something
like welcome to ABC Bank and then it
could say something like we are happy to
give you your money if we can find it
and there you are and there is this
class and all its going to do is pop up
this little message on the screen so
next thing we need to do is check to
make sure that the banking or checking
account number that they provide is
correct and we're going to do that in
account number check Java so let's just
bounce inside of here and let's say to
keep everything in order let's just put
an account number in here of course it
would be much more complicated than this
and there's an account number that's
saved in a private integer and then
we'll say something like public int gate
account number and this is going to just
simply return the account number that is
going to be considered valid above
closing curly braces then we could do
something like boolean check or
something of course this has nothing to
do with the facade pattern this is just
one of the tasks that I want performed
behind the scenes I could say something
like it account number to check and then
say if account numb to check is equal to
get account number and then we could
return true like I said before the
facade has absolutely nothing to do with
performing a bunch of if-then-else
checks it's just this is what I'm doing
with this just to demonstrate it else
and we'll say something like return
false just to keep this all really
simple so all this guy's doing is
checking to see if the account number
you provided is valid that's it so we're
just taking some of the code and sending
it into the background and allowing it
to handle that so the next thing we
don't need to do here is check if the
security code they provide is correct so
we'll just pretty much do the same thing
int security code and let's say one of
the valid security codes one two three
four and then let's just bounce over to
account check here and just steal this
whole thing because it's pretty much
going to do the same exact thing here
paste that in there and here we're just
going to say get security code return
security code now we're going to have to
add a couple different things inside of
here and then in the boolean check we're
just going to come in here
here and say is code correct and then
security code to check here we're going
to change this to security code here
we're going to change this to a CC code
to check and then it's going to perform
exactly the same action so that's going
to check if the security code is correct
and then we can check to see if they
have enough funds in their account we're
going to do that in funs check Java and
this is going to be a little bit more
complicated because it's going to do a
couple other things here so we're going
to say cash in account and let's just
say you start off with $1,000 just to
keep it simple again and then public
double get cash in account and it'll
just return cash and account and then
let's say we want to handle decreasing
cash in count and that'll be a double
just say cash withdrawn and then we just
say cash in count and I'll just put a
negative sign like that cash with drawn
and then just correct that and there we
are then we're pretty much going to do
exactly the same thing for increasing
the cash in the account change this to
deposit it and then here we're just
going to change this to a plus sign
there you are now let's get into all the
other things we're going to need to do
here this is again the fun checker to
make sure that when they say if they
want certain money that we tell them
that it's available or it's not and
we're just going to throw another
boolean in here have enough and all the
code is available and a link underneath
the video if you want to check it out
and play around this stuff so that it's
easier to learn cash withdrawal then
we're just going to say cash to
withdrawal greater than get cash and
account or that right there and if the
cash to withdrawal is greater than the
cash in the account we're gonna do
something like give them a warning you
don't have enough money not something
somebody wants to hear and then we could
go current balance and then shoot the
current balance out on the screen if we
wanted to do that and then on top of
that we're going to return false because
that's going to say that a yeah you
can't get hold of the money that you
thought you could get hold of and then
we're going to throw another else
statement inside of here
and we're going to say decrease cash in
count cash to withdrawal which is going
to decrease the total cash amount and
then give them a little mess
that says withdrawal complete and then
give them some current balance
information good cash an account and
there you go and then also return true
and then outside of the boolean have
enough money we're also going to provide
them with the option to make a deposit
so public void make deposit it's going
to be a double cash to deposit increase
cash in account cash to deposit and then
give them a little message deposit
complete current balance is get cash in
account they are so that's all we're
going to have to do that guy's going to
handle both handling withdraws as well
as deposits to the account no real
reason to go and separate that out so
the next thing to do is to implement the
facade and we're going to call that bank
account facade Java so just go inside of
here and it starts simplifying these
interfaces so that the user is not going
to have to worry about anything that's
underneath the hood so let's just go
private int account number for their
checking account in security code and
then we have to make reference to all of
the different objects or classes that
are going to be handling all this
information for us so I'm going to call
that account checker security check code
actually makes more sense if I call that
security code check and then call this
code checker funds check is going to
handle checking if there's enough funds
and then don't want to forget welcome to
bank and we're just going to call that
bank welcome and that was the little
message that pops up whenever the user
opens up that and then we just have to
create the constructor for this bank
account facade and it's going to receive
a new account number and new security
code to be able to access that and then
we're just going to assign the account
number and the security code like that
and then we're going to also initialize
all of our objects count checker initial
has that as well and the code checker
security code check and then the fun
checker is equal to new funds check
there you go those are all the objects
that are going to handle all the
complicated
things in the background and just throw
it to you inside of there so now we want
to provide them with a way to be able to
get access to the account numbers and
security codes and all that just create
public int get account number return
count number simple stuff public int get
security code return security code and
then implement the option to withdraw
cash withdrawal cash and it's going to
be it a double pass to cash to get and
then we're going to throw a whole bunch
of if-then-else statements again doesn't
really have anything to do with the
facade pattern it's just what I'm doing
here
count active get count number go and
grab that then we're going to say and
code checker and call is code correct
and then get our security code go like
that and then I'm also going to say and
fun Schechter have enough money just
double click on that and this is going
to be cash to get so double click on
that and if all those come true when you
go system out transaction complete throw
a new line inside of there just to clean
that up a little bit and else if there
was an error meaning security codes or
something else happened didn't have
enough money in the bank or what have
you
we're gonna go print line transaction
failed and then as we did previously the
errors and all that other stuff is going
to be handled elsewhere and then if we
want to deposit public void deposit cash
again it's going to be a double to
deposit no we're gonna do or if and else
statements again and I'm just going to
copy this so I'll just copy that whole
thing right there place that right there
place that there and then if the account
number in the security code are fine we
don't need to check the balance because
they're putting their money in or not
trying to take money out so we're just
going to go make deposit cash to do you
pause it and send that over and then
print out a message transaction complete
actually it's just copy this copy uh
paste that inside of their file save it
and everything should work so let's go
back into test bank account Java and see
if I did it right execute and you can
see right there welcome to ABC Bank
we're happy to give you your money if we
can find it and there you are we put
through a fifty dollar withdraw of cash
thousand dollars current balances nine
hundred fifty transaction complete
current balance is fifty dollars because
we took out nine hundred and then we
made a deposit of two hundred dollars
which left us with a total deposit of
$250 in our bank account so there is the
facade pattern pretty pretty simple I'm
like I said before you've probably used
before just didn't know it was called
the facade pattern leave any questions
or comments below otherwise until next
