show you an extremely easy way to make
veggie burgers that are extremely cheap
and extremely healthy so just like other
videos I'm going to start off with high
protein TVP textured vegetable protein
extremely healthy for you and it makes
everything taste like meat if cooked
properly you don't need a cup of that
throw that in a bowl piece of cake then
you're going to get 1/4 of a cup of
quick oats this is what I mean by quick
oats say it's just those quick oats on
it throw that in a bowl then to that
you're going to add 1 teaspoon of
oregano which is this guy right here
1 teaspoon of parsley which is this guy
right here
1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2
teaspoon of mustard powder all those in
there throw that in a bowl Pease cake
then to that I'm going to add one
tablespoon of pesto I have a little
recipe they'll show up underneath this
video
there you are threw that in there of
course you could just put dried basil in
there if you're worried about the few
added calories from the olive oil and
pesto and then I'm going to get myself 1
tablespoon of minced onion this is real
minced onion and then to that I'm going
to add 3/4 of a cup of very hot water
from the tap and there it is just wait
until it's a little bit too hot for your
finger to sit underneath of it and to
that you can add any type of catch if
you like I'm going to put 2 tablespoons
of ketchup in this guy and then 2
tablespoons of either liquid aminos
tamari or soy sauce depends on what you
like there's 2 tablespoons of that and I
use Liquid aminos because I'm allergic
to MSG and there you are you're pretty
much done all you need to do is stir all
of this together until it is all mixed
up
ok that's perfect now you're going to
let that sit from 5 to 10 minutes and
then add a couple more ingredients and
you're ready to cook ok a little over 5
minutes has gone by and then you're
going to add 1 tbsp of creamy peanut
butter you can use anything you want all
this is based off the ingredients I have
this comes out to 136 calories 3 grams
of fat 12 grams of protein and 4
and sugar which is comparable to the
lowest calorie lowest fat morning star
brand Gordon veggie burger then to that
you're going to add one tablespoon of
nutritional yeast and 1/4 of a cup of
whole wheat flour and then you're going
to stir meanwhile inside you could have
yourself set up a tablespoon of
vegetable or you could use Pam oil or
whatever you want heating at about 60%
of its temperature on your stovetop and
just going to stir this until it is
consistent you can see it's sort of
looks like ground beef and this holds
beautifully and it is extremely
inexpensive cost about 1/4 the cost of
buying veggie burgers in a store after
you're happy with your consistency we're
going to go to the stovetop
ok here we are on our stovetop and I'm
just going to take a little chunk of
this fake meat stuff I'm going to throw
it in the side of a pan I'm going to
wait until it starts to bubble then
remember this is 60% and if we zoom in
there you can see that it's already
starting to bubble say real easy you
don't need to use a temperature gauge or
anything else very easy to fry things in
a pan so I'm just going to dip in here
and I'm going to try to get myself about
1/4 of the total mixture just an
estimate doesn't need to be exact by any
means and I just want to form this into
a patty see very very simple if you find
a stick in your hands just put your
hands under hot water and then throw it
in the pan and then go and try to get
about another fourth of your total
mixture of course you can get less you
want a smaller hamburger so just grab
that out of there throw it in the pan
and then you get yourself another fourth
of your total mixture not that I throw
it in the pan and let those cook for
about two minutes on each side might
help them cook a little bit press them
down into the pan and after two minutes
let's go in here and see how we're doing
yep looking nice and both the other one
throw it in there see they're brown and
off very very nicely these are just
beautiful burgers I think they're
comparable to anything you buy in a
store for much more money there you go
that's hot
make cheap healthy extremely easy veggie
burgers at home leave any questions
