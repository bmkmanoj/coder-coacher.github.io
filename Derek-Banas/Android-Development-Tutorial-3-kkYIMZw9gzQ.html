3 of my android development tutorial
today we're going to talk about Android
user interfaces and we're actually going
to make a usable app I'm going to show
you how to use a couple different
components being the text view the edit
text box and the seek bar and I'm also
going to talk a lot about change
listeners so all these guys can interact
I'm going to bring them together to make
a tip calculator I'm going to cover all
those things in this tutorial and then
in the next part of and add all kinds
other features using radio buttons and
checkboxes then you will be able to make
yourself some apps on your own so I have
a lot to do so let's get into it okay so
here I am inside of Eclipse and I'm just
going to come over here into my little
package Explorer and make myself a new
Android application project and I have
to give this application a name I'm just
gonna call it anything crazy tip calc
and I'm going to do this pretty much all
out of my head this time I don't even
have a sequence diagram so I like doing
things that way so I'm going to go new
think-tank which is my website and all
the code and a package and everything
you could possibly want is available to
link underneath the video I'm going to
click on next and then I'm going to
click on next and then I'm going to
click on next and then I'm going to
click on next and then instead of main
activity I'm going to put crazy tip calc
in this situation and I'm gonna hit
finish okay so now that I have all that
set up I have crazy tip calc over here
and you can see that this interface is
already starting up and there is the
name of my app and there's hello world
well we are inside of the activity XML
file it's called activity crazy tip calc
because that's what I named it and I'm
going to come down here to this guy
right here because I want to actually
edit this I'm going to show you both how
to edit the raw XML as well as using the
GUI tool which is pretty cool okay so
the first I'm going to do is I don't
want HelloWorld to show up on there so
I'm just gonna get rid of that then I'm
going to go back into graphical layout
and this isn't going to be the prettiest
app ever design but like I said what I'm
trying to do here is really teach you a
lot of things and I think I can do that
well the very first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to get text view and I'm
going to drag that over inside of here
and drop it inside and I don't really
like the way that this is lining up so
if I don't like the way that something's
lining up what I'm going to do
is go in to values and I'm going to do
this ahead of time I'm going to open up
dimensions and I'm also going to open up
strings so there we go dimensions is
good guy that I'm gonna have in trouble
with here I'm not liking the margins
that it's setting so just for the heck
of it I'm going to change this to 5 DP
and not the 5 DP and save that now if I
jump back over into here and I grab this
guy I'm gonna be able to move it in here
a little bit tighter and I'm basically
doing that just to show you how to edit
those margins now it says text view
right now and I don't really
particularly like that so if I want to
put in some custom strings I'm going to
go into strings XML and I'm going to
come down here and click on strings.xml
down here at the bottom because I want
to play around this raw data and I want
to get rid of that all together now I'm
going to go in here and actually just
start throwing in all the strings that
I'm going to use for this whole entire
app right now so let's just come in here
and the very first I'm going to do is I
know I want to have a little textview
and it's just going to simply say bill
and it's going to be the bill before the
tip has been added to it that's what
that's going to stand for so I'm going
to call this bill text view and let's
just say I want to have Bill show up
you're going to see in a second what
that does if you don't remember from the
passports of the tutorial and then next
to it I'm going to have an edit text box
and I'm going to give that a default
value of zero point zero you're going to
see in a minute why you might not
necessarily want to do that but of
course you can change everything you see
here and then next to that guy I'm going
to have an area to put the tip in so I'm
just going to name this tip textview and
I'm just going to give it tip and this
is just the name that's going to lie
next to the box is going to allow you to
edit the text and then inside of tip I'm
going to put point 15 which is a default
sort of tip that is often used okay and
then underneath that I'm going to have
my final bill so it's going to be final
bill textview and this is just the way
that I like to define these things
everybody seems to do it in a different
way but it's normally similar to what
I'm doing right here and then I'm going
to have final bill edit text and I'm not
going to worry about the seekbar right
now I'll leave that for a later point in
time yeah what the heck
I'm going to use this eventually I'm not
going to use it right now though so I'm
also going to have a little thing here
that is going to allow you to change the
tip using a seat bar what you're going
to see what that is in a second I'm just
going to call that change tip textview
but I'm not going to create it quite yet
alright so now I'm back over here inside
of the activity XML file and I have this
guy selected so I'm going to come over
here and I'd like to give this a name
that has a little bit of meaning to it
so not too much meaning let's just call
it bill textview and get rid of this one
on there and then just click like this
it's going to say do you want to update
all my references and I'm going to say
yes and then it's going to say ok
alright so I clicked on that well now
over here in the text view area next to
text I'm going to want to pull a string
out of my strings.xml file and it's
automatically going to pop up inside of
here and what I want to put inside of
there is the string that's attached to
Bill textview so just double click on it
alright and you're now going to see
there is our app and it now says Bill
that's good well now I want to put in my
little edit text field so to do that I'm
going to go text fields come way up here
at the top and I'm going to grab this
text field and I'm just going to throw
this in here
and try to get it to line up and it's
way way way too big it's way more bigger
than I want it to be anyway so that
means I'm basically going to have to
come in here and actually define how big
this is going to be so come down again
into this into the raw text area and
this is basically what you're going to
do you're not going to do all the
editing in the GUI it's just not
possible so if I want to change the size
of this I'm going to come down here
where it says EMS and in this situation
I'm just going to put five see how that
works
bounce back over here and you can see
that it is indeed smaller and let's see
if I can move this bill around a little
bit more and not really that's not bad
ok so now that I have that selected this
edit text field
got a bounce over here again and I'm
going to give this a name that has a
little bit more meaning to it so I'm
going to call it bill edit text and then
get rid of the one again zoom out click
anywhere it's going to say update yes
indeed hit OK alright so that's all set
up all right now let's come over and
actually change the text that shows up
inside of by clicking
err come over here and bill edit text is
what I have and now you see zero point
zero shows up in there and I'm not going
to worry about the aesthetics at this
point in time I'm trying to do this as
quickly as possible
so I'm going to put another text area or
text view over here and it's just simply
going to say tip so I have that selected
I'm going to come over here click in
there go tip text view get rid of the
one same thing over and over
click anywhere that pops up it yes then
hit OK and there that goes away then
come over here and change the text
inside of it this pops up tip text view
is what I had and now it says tip see
that's how it works
I kind of glossed over this little
editable text area there's a couple
things I want to do with that okay
well I want to define input type for one
thing so let's click on that and all
these different input types show up
hopefully I'm not making you seasick
with all this zooming and I'm going to
come down to number decimal because it's
going to represent money and that's
number decimal okay so I have that set
and you can see that error also went
away that was on there previously at
this point in time I'm not really going
to mess around with anything else I'm
going to however put a little edit text
area for my tip again you go into text
fields right there scroll up and this is
the guy that I want I'm just going to go
out grab him with my mouse drag him over
throw him in there he's gonna be way too
big and he's bouncing all over the place
let's see if I can move him up at all
yeah that's just horrible so come in
here I'm gonna have to change the EMS
again which is just the width of that
little box so here it is edit text 1 da
da da da and this guy I'm going to set
the 4 because it's only going to be two
numbers in length that's gonna represent
my tip and there it is it looks a little
bit better now I can grab it and move it
a little bit better into place maybe
there you go like I said it doesn't look
that pretty but we're not worrying about
pretty right now move that tip over
there a little bit and that doesn't look
too bad
let's grab this move it over a little
bit more you can see I'm just dragging
and drawing this with a mouse let me
just show you again see you're just
trying to move it over a little bit
there you go that's not bad okay so
leave it that way
well now I got to come in here again and
I'm going to change the name of this I'm
going to change it to tip edit text get
rid of that bounce out you know what's
going to happen yes and okay beautiful
and then I'm going to command
and edit the input type just click on
that and guess what it's going to be
another one of these number decimals say
number decimal hit ok and there we go
again so that's all set up and I'm going
to get more into what all these other
things here do later on ok so now that I
have both of those set up the only other
thing I want to do is a final bill so
again form widgets I'm going to go into
text view grab that drag it out of here
and what should I call it what did I
call it in strings I forget I called it
final bill that's a good name
jump over and do this again whoops jump
over into this again have that selected
come over here text view get rid of the
one at the end get rid of the text part
there and call this final bill and there
we are yes and ok and then if I want
final bill to show up inside of there
instead of text you just click on that
final bill text view and there you go
well now I have to actually put a little
box in there so I can put my final bill
amount inside of it so I'm going to
click on that and I'm designing all this
in the nexus one you can bounce back and
forth between all the different ones now
I need an area to put my editable text
area again while it's selected what
actually doesn't matter if it's selected
I want to come down here again and let's
change this to 5 again bounced out of
there there it is it shrunk down a
little bit and just to be a little bit
different because I'm going to want to
put a little seek bar inside of here I'm
gonna see if I can put this on top of
this I'm just moving it around the mouse
and it looks like work and for now
that's good enough so I'm going to come
into this guy and I'm going to go and
actually change its name as well edit
text and I'm just going to call it final
bill edit text rid of that jump out you
know what it's gonna do yes ok and then
I have to give it an input type again
input type and guess what it's going to
be it's going to be number decimal again
so click on that and hit OK well now
that we have all that set up let's go in
start writing ourselves some code and to
do that we're going to go into our
source folder which is up here click on
source this is going to open and there's
crazy tip calc Java and then I'm just
going to go through here line through
line
just create everything so what do I need
to do and just so you know what I have
actually sitting in front of me is all
of this stuff that's it just this stuff
just so I can remember the names that I
gave to all of the different guys over
in my little GUI interface so now that I
have that set up I on I on occasion
pause these videos and go and write
things down and then jump back into them
I just want to make sure you're 100% on
board and understand what I'm doing well
the very first thing I'm going to want
to do here is to define some constants
that I once saved if somebody would shut
down my app and then reopen it so to do
that I'm just going to go private static
final string and one thing that I'm
going to want is the final bill that's
one of the things on that screen and
what I'm going to set it for is total
bill like that so this is going to be
saved if they jump out of my app and
then jump back into it or change and or
whatever they're going to do I would
also like to be able to save whatever
the current tip is so current to and
there that saved I'd also like to be
able to set the bill without a tip so
I'm just going to call it bill without
tip and then I might as well just copy
this and paste that in there and there
that is well some of these things here
I'm also going to want to save on their
own I'm just going to call this private
double and I'm just going to give it a
different name bill before two and that
of course is going to hold the user's
bill before a tip is added to it and I'm
also going to store the tip amount and
I'm also going to store my final bill so
those are all set up so it's just the
same three things that you see over here
that's what I'm saving what's in these
three boxes right there so let's just
jump back here another thing I'm going
to need access to are the little
editable text boxes which are these guys
right here and right here and right here
the reason I need access to them is so
that I can get the values that are in
them as well as save new values into
them so I'm going to go bill before tip
and I'm just going to go et for editable
text and this is going to be an error
saying hey you don't need this library
for this guy and I'm going to say okay
go get
for me and there that is and I'm going
to need three of those because I defined
three of them we can just ignore the
text views there are situations where
you'll want the text views but in this
situation I do not and I'm just going to
call this tip amount and rid of this guy
and call this final bill there we go
have all those defined now when do I
actually initialize those inside of my
code in oncreate whenever this things
set up so just going to skip into this
guy now the very first thing I want to
do here is to check if the app has just
started or if it has been restored from
another state to do that we go if saved
instance state is equal to null if it's
equal to null well that means we are
actually just starting with this guy in
that situation I'm going to go bill
before tip is equal to zero point zero
because that's what I have it set as in
my GUI interface and then I'm going to
go tip amount is equal to 0.15 or 15%
because that's what it's set as in my
GUI interface and then I'm going to go
final bill is equal to zero point zero
and there that is else if we're coming
to this from a restored State well in
that situation I'm still going to be
doing all these different things except
I'm going to be getting them from these
values that I have saved up here these
guys so they're going to hold that and
if I come back from a another state or
another app or whatever I can go saved
instance state get the double and then
it's going to be bill without tip pretty
useful and then I'm going to do the same
thing pretty much for everything else so
instead of that I'm going to throw that
in there and then I'm gonna go current
tip so if you haven't quite got it
this is where that's coming from right
here and then going to do this exactly
the same thing here except I'm going to
go total bill and there we are now what
I want to do after I'm done with this
and I have those values set is
initialize all my little edit text boxes
well let's not think too much about this
here they are by name so let's just copy
them throw them down here right like
that and now I want to initialize them
to do so I'm going to go equals they
need to be
asked into an edit text object and then
if I want to find them
I go fine view by ID remember I said
before that the our Java file actually
has all the IDs for every single
component you ever make well I need to
get them from that and how you do that
is just go r dot ID and then follow it
with whatever the ID was that you set
for this well Bill edit text is what was
set for it whenever I created this
little edit text box if I bounced over
inside of here you can see there's this
if the guy that I'm getting and when I
select it pull this out a little bit you
can see Bill edit text that's the ID
that I set up for it so that's where
that comes from so let's jump back in
here again let's get rid of this because
we don't want to have that on there and
then I'm going to do the same for the
other edit text boxes I like that except
this is going to be tip edit text and
this one is going to be final bill edit
text there we go got those initialized
well now what I want to do here is
actually set up what is called a change
listener so whenever bill before tip is
going to be changed I'm going to do like
this and to add a text listener I'm
going to go add chain text changed
listener if you're getting lost at all
just get the code in the description
everything is heavily commented I'm
gonna go bill before tip listener right
like that
well that means I need to create this
method right here I'm going to show you
how to do this in line in the next
tutorial but for right now just going to
come here and I'm going to go private
text watcher paste bill before tip
listener is equal to new text watcher
and it's saying we need some libraries
so go get them and then at the end here
want to put a semicolon file save and
then it's going to say add on
implemented methods yes do that for me
and there they are now the first two I
don't care about after text changed and
before text changed so I'm just going to
ignore them and I'm going to focus on on
text changed
so whenever the text is changed in the
bill area before tip I want to do a
couple things well one thing that I need
to
do here is surround this with a try
block because there's an exception I
need to check and inside the try block
I want to go bill B for tip and I want
to change the bill before tip to
whatever the new input is so to do that
I need to go and convert it into a
double and to actually get whatever was
changed inside of there I need to get
this guy right here s and I'm just going
to leave it as s just for the heck of it
so this is the string that now resides
inside of this this is what the user
changed the bill to so that's what s is
now to get this value I'm going to
change this to string like that and
there you go now I got that saved inside
of the bill before tip and Bill before
tip is Bill before tip right there that
guy right there then we scroll back down
again and of course if I have a try I
need a catch so catch block and the
exception I want to catch is a number
format exception let that be e and if
that occurs I'm going to instead assign
bill before tip the value of zero zero
point zero then after that has been
changed I am going to call another
method it's gonna be called update tip
and final bill that sounds like a good
name anyway so there that is and that
gives me an error because it doesn't
exist this might seem like a really
simple program but I'm covering a lot of
different things here I think you guys
know that I like to do that well now I
need to figure out a way to update both
the tip amount and then add the tip
amount to the bill to find the final
bill amount so to do that I need to go
and spell private right there we are and
maybe a private void and I'm just gonna
paste in and that guy right there which
I just made a call for so what do we
need to do well one of the things I'm
going to need to do is get my tip amount
and to get that well I need to go and
convert what is in tip amount editable
text area and I get that by calling get
text and then I'm going to convert that
to a string like that and then turn it
into a double so there we are got that
then after I do that what I'd also like
to be able to save and unless you forgot
let me skip up here for a second this is
where the bill
where the tip was actually set and right
there so I don't need to update that in
any way so that means all that I have to
do is calculate the final bill with the
tip and to get that I'm just going to go
bill before tip and add to it bill
before two times the tip amount copy
that paste that in there put this here
and there we are pretty cool and then
what I want to do is now that I have
that set well I'd like to come in here
to the final bill editable text area and
change that so how do I do that
well I just go final bill ET which is
the name of it set text and then I want
it to be a string and I want to format
it so that it only shows two decimal
places so I'm just good like this %
point zero to F and then final bill
needs to go inside of there final bill
did that right good and then this is
giving me an error let's go see why tip
ammount tip ET why did I call it that
let's get rid of that I'm just gonna
call it tip amount ET because that's
what this is called right yeah
tip edit text yeah so I'm just gonna
change that file save to get any other
errors anywhere yeah tip amount and I'm
gonna change this to ET as well there we
go
I like that better okay so I have all
those set now remember whenever I was up
here and we went into this part where I
said is this a brand new instance or is
it coming from a pause state or did
something happen that this information
was saved from a previous state well how
are we going to set those anytime a
change occurs well to do that let's just
scroll down here we are going to create
a method make sure I didn't create
already no I didn't and it's going to
have protected status and it's going to
be called on save instance state and
it's gonna be bundle out state you don't
need to memorize all this stuff just
copy and paste the code now this is
going to be called this method is going
to be called any time the device changes
in some way for example if it's one of
those old-style phones or the keyboard
pops out it's going to be grabbed and
updated or if the device is rotated or
if we switch from an hour
to back to this one in those situations
this is going to be called and all we're
going to be doing inside of here is
saving these guys right here which we've
been talking about a good bet okay so
I'm going to save those then we're going
to go on save there's no reason to go
and type that out again so let's just go
like this and then I'm going to go out
state on that and then to save these
guys I'm going to go out state dot and
since these are all doubles I'm going to
go put double total bill and it's going
to be whatever the value for final bill
is at that point in time and then I'm
going to need three of those because I
have three of them there we are
and this one's gonna be current tip and
that's tip announced I think yes okay
and then the last one is going to be
bill without tip bill before tip and I
think I got all this right yes I did
okay so that's going to handle those
four instances whenever somebody's in
your app they leave and you want to
update it whenever they come back to the
app so that's a good thing to have
around and you might not know it but we
actually have a finished application
here make sure inside your emulator if
you're planning on trying to use a
keyboard click on this guy right here I
want to go edit make sure that hardware
keyboard present is not checked
otherwise you're going to get an error
if you try to open up the keyboard so
make sure that it's set that way if
you've watched the other parts of my
tutorial you understand what's going on
there and I was actually going to skip
over just end this tutorial but you know
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go in here
for you hardcore guys that really like
long tutorials I'm actually going to go
in here and create the seekbar just for
the heck of it so let's just try to do
this quickly I'm going to click on form
widget so I'm going to come into text
view I'm gonna throw that right there
and then I'm also come over here and I'm
gonna grab this little seek bar I'm
gonna throw that inside of there it's
going to cause all kinds of havoc I need
to shrink it down so I'm just gonna grab
it here shrink it down like that and I'm
going to come into the text view area
over here and I'm going to change this
to change tip text few one I'm gonna get
rid of the one part out of there give me
some errors who cares okay
way all right that's good and then here
in text click on that and I'm going to
come in to change tip text view so now
it's going to have tip there as well and
then for this guy I want to set its
progress to 15 so that's what this is so
I'm gonna just click on progress over
here and click on this and I'm going to
set this to 15 actually it's rather than
defining that 15 I'm gonna click on this
scroll way to the bottom and go Android
progress is equal to 15 and that's just
gonna move it over based off of my 15%
and back over there and you might notice
that it moved a little bit okay now that
I have that set up I'm going to go back
into crazy tip kappa and i'm going to
come in here and initialize my seek bar
so up inside of here i'm going to go to
seek bar and tip seek bar don't really
need to do anything else with it just do
that for now it's going to say i need a
library go get the library and I'm
actually going to initialize it inside
of on creative course so I'm going to go
tip seek bar is equal to change this to
seek bar then rather than type that all
out let's grab this and paste it in
there and highlight that and then change
tip seek bar it gets it right now maybe
not bounce back over here nope change
its name here to change tip seek bar now
to work come back update everything yeah
update everything and there we are got
rid of that error and then for this guy
I'm also going to add another change
listener so I'm just going to go tip
seek bar might be the longest eToro have
ever done let's go set on seek bar
change listener and inside of it tip
seek bar listener I like that and of
course I need to make this just scroll
way down to the bottom right here and
then inside of this I'm going to call
this private and then we're going to go
on seek bar change listener give it the
name that we defined above is equal to
new and then we're gonna go on seek bar
change listener again it's gonna give me
an error because I need to get some
libraries also gonna need to put some a
colon at the end there so get the
libraries got those and it's going to
send to get my unimplemented methods yet
though
those what you see how easy this is once
we just bring those methods in there
because basically all that I'm changing
with the seek bar is the tips so under
on progress changed which is a fancy
word for you just change the seek bar I
need to get the value that is set for my
seek bar and I'm going to save that in
tip amount because that's what it is and
to get it I go tip seek bar get progress
say remember good progress is a way of
grabbing information from a seek bar and
I'll multiply it times 0.01 so I turn it
into a percent and then I'm also going
to go to tip amount and set my tip
amount editable text area with the value
from the seek bar so tip amount et to do
that you go set text and I'm going to
have to format it again just like we did
before so I'm going to go format 0.02 F
again just like before accepting this
time we're going to take tip amount
throw it in there for arguments so
that's going to set the tip amount as
the seek bar changes and guess what
I don't need to do anything else except
call my update because all I just did
has changed my tip so I got to go up
here and call update tip and final bill
and it's going to handle everything else
for me throw that in there file save it
and now that I have all that set I'm
just going to jump through here and save
everything real quickly and let's
execute it run and run configurations
crazy TIBCO tada target make sure it's
the emulator and run and here it is
crazy tip calc let's just go inside of
there click on that and let's just get
rid of that and let's try typing in 12
and you can see the tip automatically is
set for 15 and it automatically
calculates that and then if I want to
use the seek bar I can change that and
it'll automatically change the tip as
well so that was one heck of a crazy
tutorial if you want to see all the code
you want to download the app if you want
to do whatever you want all of its
available to link underneath the
description please leave your questions
or comments below in the next part of
the tutorial I'm going to add some extra
features to this till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
