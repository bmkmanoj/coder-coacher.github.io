you how to make four different types of
vegan cheese this takes days and in this
one video I'm going to show you the
entire process and I learned this from a
book called artesian vegan cheese
specifically we're going to make a goat
cheese a cheddar a brie and I mozzarella
and it starts off complicated but he
gets easy as we move on so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it now to start
off you're gonna have to make something
called rejuve alack and I'm gonna get
myself 1/3 of a cup of cam it grains
also 1/3 of a cup of millet grains and
1/3 of a cup of klonoa you could also
use rye berries or wheat berries it
really doesn't matter and there is the
quenelle going in and this is what
millet looks like and then also this is
what cam it looks like just so you are
aware now it is very important if the
jar that you're gonna use needs to be
sanitized and all you're gonna need to
do that is just to boil it in hot water
and then you're just going to add enough
just this is just room-temperature water
to cover up all of the seeds that you
have then what you're gonna do is get
yourself a coffee filter or two layers
of cheesecloth and put it over the top
and then secure it with a rubber band
now you're gonna let that sit on your
counter out of direct sunlight for about
12 hours and then twice per day you are
going to drain the seeds and I just dump
them in a coffee filter and pour some
water on them and then put them back
into my mason jar make sure you always
have your mason jar or whatever you're
using secured with a coffee filter on
top and after you do this for three days
you're gonna see little sprouts start to
come out and whenever you see that you
know you're ready to move on to the next
step now you're gonna get yourself to
one quart mason jars or whatever type of
jars you were using and of course
sanitized them again boil them in water
and you're gonna take half the seeds and
put them in one of the mason jars and
then half the other seeds and put them
in the other mason jar then you're gonna
put in 3 cups of filtered water in each
now you're gonna get your coffee filter
put it on top secure it with a rubber
band and then once again sit on a
counter out of direct sunlight for 3
days and don't touch it then after 3
days you're gonna pour out just the
water not the seeds and then transfer
into another sanitized mason jar and
you're done now we're gonna make basic
cashew cheese so just take 2 cups of
cashews pour some water on them and
let him sit out of direct sunlight for
eight hours and now I'm going to
sanitize everything with boiling water
make sure every single thing that these
cashews touch is been sanitized and then
I'm going to go and get my blender which
has also been sanitized then I'm gonna
slowly pour in the cashews to blend
everything all right now make sure you
wipe it down as we are blending then
we're gonna get 1/4 of a cup of rejuve a
Lac and then we're gonna put the top on
and then slowly pour it in while we
blend and then this is pretty much what
its gonna look like now we are going to
have to transfer it over into a bowl the
rejuve elec is good for a month in your
refrigerator so you can reuse it
multiple times and then you're just
gonna pour that in a bowl that has been
sanitized and secure it now after this
sits out of direct sunlight for two days
you're gonna have basic cashew cheese
and this this is good to eat then we're
gonna take one cup of that we're gonna
make ourselves some real cheese we're
gonna make brie so one cup of your basic
cashew cheese in a food processor and
making cheese from this point on is very
very easy we're just gonna add one half
of a cup of coconut oil and make sure
that it has been melted down then add
one half of a tablespoon of nutritional
yeast flakes to the blender and then
you're going to get yourself 1/8 of a
teaspoon of salt and add that as well
and then all we need to do is blend
blend blend and then you're gonna get
yourself a sanitized Bowl that you're
gonna transfer your brie into and then
you're gonna refrigerate that for 8
hours and you are done how I'm gonna
make my favorite other soft cheeses this
is basically a goat cheese sometimes
referred to as share and basically it's
real simple we're just gonna take 1 cup
of our basic cashew cheese put that in
our sanitized food processor and then
we're going to get ourselves 1/4 of a
teaspoon of salt and 1/2 of a tablespoon
of nutritional yeast and blend and then
after that is all smooth you can put
that in a ramekin or whatever you want
and then you're gonna refrigerate it for
6 hours and you're done see after you
get the basic ingredients done
everything else is easy now it's time to
make some ridiculously good sharp
cheddar I'm gonna get myself one cup of
cashews that have been soaked for 8
hours and put those into my food
processor and then
and 1/3 of a cup of nutritional yeast
and then it's gonna be time for us to
get our rejuve alack again I'm gonna get
myself 1/4 of a cup of rejuve and then
add that as well and then I'm gonna get
myself 1 tablespoon of miso paste and I
personally prefer white miso paste and I
really do think there is a difference
and then to that we're going to add 1/2
of a teaspoon of salt and then of course
we are going to blend this until it is
very very smooth and while you're
blending of course don't forget to wipe
down the sides and then what we're gonna
do is continue to blend this and then
we're gonna transfer it into a little
plastic bowl and then it is going to sit
at room temperature for three days to
get real sharp and now we're gonna make
mozzarella I have 1/4 a cup of rejuve
equiano's that have been soaked for 6 to
8 hours and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and of
course I'm going to blend them and I
decide to use another blender just to
show that you can do that when it's
smooth add 1/2 of a teaspoon of xanthan
gum and then blend and let sit for two
to three days depending upon how sharp
you want your mozzarella to be and this
is how smooth the mozzarella should be
whenever it's ready to set out and after
three days this is what your cheddar
should look like and it should have a
slight mold on top of it because
everything sanitary we don't need to
worry about that then we're gonna
transfer it into a pan on medium-high
heat and then we're gonna add 1/2 of a
tablespoon of carrageenan this is gonna
make everything solidify and then to
that we're also going to add 1/4 of a
teaspoon of xantham gum again this is
gonna make it so that the cheddar can be
sliced and then we are going to stir
that for five minutes and then cool in
the refrigerator for 6 hours and it's
done my favourite storage method for the
cheddar as well as the mozzarella is to
put some plastic wrap and this is what
it looks like up close and now it's time
to finish up my mozzarella I have 1/3 of
a cup of water and then to this I'm
going to add either 1/2 tablespoons of
agar powder or 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of
Agra flakes you're gonna want to bring
that to a boil on medium high then turn
it down to medium low and then you're
gonna want to whisk this for right about
4 minutes now you're going to want to
get your mozzarella that's been sitting
out for 2
three days it's also gonna have like a
slight mold on it and you're gonna want
to add it very quickly to your pot I
spend it for wandering and you guys stir
this for about two minutes and then
you're gonna get yourself a little pan
with ice water inside of it and then get
yourself a big spoon and spray a little
bit of canola oil on it the canola oil
is just there to make sure that the
mozzarella falls easily off the spoon
then you're just gonna get yourself a
nice scoop of it and then drop it into
your ice water and after you get all of
the mots are all out and into the ice
water throw it into your refrigerator
for right about six hours and then
you're done you have technically five
different types of vegan cheese and here
is the cheese and it's final format
there is the goat cheese and then next
I'll show you the cheddar and then the
brie and mozzarella I hope you enjoyed
