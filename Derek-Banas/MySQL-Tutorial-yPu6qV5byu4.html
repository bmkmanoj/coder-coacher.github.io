MySQL tutorial in this tutorial I'm
gonna cover about 95 to 98% of
everything you will ever you need to use
MySQL and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it okay so this is MySQL
workbench and you should install it
whenever you get MySQL oh and I'm not
gonna go through the whole installation
process because that's pretty easy and
everything will be exactly the same on
Mac PC Linux anything if you want to
come in here and go and create a new
user you're just gonna come in here open
up my school workbench click on server
administration and then you're gonna
have this pop-up and click on OK
then gonna have to type in your password
and then specifically you're gonna go to
accounts manage users and you're gonna
see all the users the user I'm gonna use
in this tutorial is gonna be MySQL it
man this guy right here if you want to
create a new user just click on Add
Account and then you're gonna come in
here give a username a password and all
that stuff and then you can go into
administration roles and all of the
different things that that user will be
able to do I'm just gonna cut it short
right there and jump right into MySQL ok
here I am in a terminal like I said
everything is exactly the same on PCs
and on Linux and on Macs and everything
so this would be the command line in
Windows or a terminal inside of Linux or
Mac OS X so you're just going to start
it up you might type in MySQL 5 or you
might have to type in MySQL it depends
on whatever your system is set up for
and I'm just gonna come in here and I'm
going to log in like I said this is a
custom made user and you just type in -
you for the user ID and - P for the
password type in whatever password I set
up for this user and here I am inside of
MySQL
now if I want to quit out of MySQL I
just type in quit and I'm out can also
just press up and log back in and then
type in my password again and Here I am
again clear my scroll back if I want to
show all the databases that I have
inside of my database I just type the
head in show databases and you can see
all of them pop up right there
and I'm going to try to stick with
convention so normally whenever you're
typing in all of your commands and -
queue all you want to use uppercase
letters so if I want to create a
database and let's say I want to call it
test 3 there you go
went and create
that and we can also come in here show
databases you can see test3 is there on
our screen if I we want to then use that
database I'm gonna try and stick with
the upper case here I just type in test3
and there you can see that is gonna be
the current database I'm using if I want
to show my currently selected database I
just type in select database and there
you can see I'm using test3 and then if
I want to destroy that database just
type in drop database if exists test 3
show databases and now you can see test
3 is going and I have a link in the
description for this video that has all
of this listed out and it's heavily
commented you can use it as a cheat
sheet
now when creating our database what we
have to do is very often makes a lot of
sense to print out everything just write
it out exactly what you want to store so
what I'm gonna do here is create a
student database and you can see here I
have student and we're also going to
have scores for both quizzes and tests
and you can see all of the information
I'm gonna have a science class and I'm
gonna have an English class and a whole
bunch of other different classes as well
and I'm just gonna model out exactly
what I want my data to look like then
after I model all of this out and I give
each of my students an ID as well as
test scores and all of the other things
you can see right here I can then break
all of this down into tables and we're
gonna go through these tables one at a
time but as you saw here it makes a lot
of sense for each of the students to
have the first last name email street
and all of the other different things
that you see right here and you can see
down here where I have student ID that's
gonna be the unique ID for each of our
students and as you're gonna hear here
in a moment this is known as a primary
key I'm also going to have my classes
and my tests and absences and all of the
different scores also stored in
different tables and as this tutorial
continues I'm going to go over how all
of these are going to be created so
we're gonna come in here and we're gonna
create our student table so to create
our table you just type in create table
and I'm gonna call this student put your
bracket inside of there and you're gonna
list out all of the data that you want
now I believe that the maximum length
for my first name is going to be 30
characters so variable number of
characters and this is just an estimate
this isn't a cut in stone announcement
we're saying we expect 30 characters but
it might go over that if I want to
guarantee that this data is entered
gonna type in not null and then I'm
gonna do exactly the same thing for my
last name variable number of characters
that I believe is gonna have a maximum
size of 30 and I want to guarantee it's
in the database so not null then I come
in to my email I'm gonna again variable
number of characters and this is the
data types that we're defining here
variable number of characters you can
see more here in a second I'm gonna say
that I expect it to be no more than 60
but in this situation I'm going to type
in null maybe the person or the student
doesn't have an email or maybe we won't
be able to get it whenever we want it
first off so we're gonna say that that
doesn't necessarily need to be filled in
street I'm gonna say a variable number
of characters again put it at 50 and I'm
gonna say that I must have a street
address for my student make sure you put
a comma at the end of all of these city
on all again state in this situation I
know that the state is only ever gonna
have a maximum of two characters so I'm
going to actually put this in stone and
say I expect two characters here and
that's exactly what that says and then
if I want to put a default value inside
of here like Pennsylvania or PA that's
how we would do that for my zip I'm
gonna have a medium side integer and I'm
gonna go over exactly why we want that
in a moment if there's no such thing as
a negative zip so I'm gonna say that
it's unsigned phone I could just say
that this is going to be numbers but in
this situation who knows if they're
gonna put dashes or whatever inside of
there so I'm gonna say a variable number
of characters and I think that's gonna
be around 20 characters and not all
again birthdate I'm gonna mark this as a
date and not null like I said I'm gonna
go over these data types here in a
moment
numerated type if I know that we're
either going to have a male or a female
well I'm gonna define those very
specific options by using an enumerated
type or like that let's say I also want
to mark the date that they signed up for
our class I could use something called a
timestamp which is also going to give me
date and time let's say that I also want
to have cost for lunch I don't know I'm
just making these things up in that
situation I'm going to need decimal
values and that's gonna be a float and
then the final thing we're going to
define here is student ID that's going
to be a unique number and it is going to
be an integer
and we're going to
this is unsigned not null again and if I
want this to automatically increment
every single time a new student is
created I type in Auto increment and
this is going to be a primary key which
is going to allow me to have a unique ID
for each of these students which is
gonna help me a lot and after I create
that database I can come in here and go
show tables and there you're gonna see
the student database is created another
thing you need to do of course is make
sure that you go and create your
database because I deleted it previously
and then say use test three and that's
the name of the database you can change
the name to whatever you want now each
of the students is gonna have what I
call it a primary key and let's just go
over briefly exactly what a primary key
is and some rules about them they're
going to be used to uniquely identify a
row or a record or student information
in this situation each primary key must
be unique to the row it must be given a
value when the row is created and that
value cannot be null that original value
cannot be changed and it's probably best
auto-increment like I just showed you
know it's time to take a little bit of
time to talk about what are called
atomic tables now as your database
increases in size you're going to want
to be able to keep everything organized
and the main reason you're gonna want to
do this is so you're gonna be able to
perform queries really quickly with your
database now if your tables are set up
properly your database will is gonna be
able to crank through hundreds of
thousands of bits of data in a matter of
seconds
if it isn't however then you're gonna
have everything be very very slow so you
may ask yourself well how do you know
how to best set up your tables well
basically you just need to follow a
couple simple rules every table should
focus on describing just one thing for
example a customer table would have name
age location and contact information it
shouldn't contain lists of any things
such as interest job history past
addresses products purchased etc none of
that nonsense just the main bit of
information that you need then after you
decide what one thing your table will
describe such as we had students then
what you need to do is decide what
things you need to describe that thing
then you're gonna write out all the ways
to describe that thing and if any of
those things require multiple inputs
pull them out and create a new table for
them so for example with our students if
we had a list of past
classes and past performance we would
put that in another table then once your
table values have been broken down we
refer to these values as being atomic
however you want to make sure that
you're careful and you don't break them
down to a point in which the data is
harder to work with so that you have to
type in mile-long queries just to be
able to get at your data and as this
tutorial continues gonna see exactly how
I build all of these tables one by one
some additional rules that might help
you make your data a little bit more
atomic and if you can't wrap your head
around all this right now don't worry
about it we're gonna give examples but
one thing you want to do is make sure
that you don't have multiple columns
with the same sort of information so for
example if you wanted to include
employment history for an employee
database you shouldn't create job one
job to a job three columns what you want
to do is make a new table with that data
instead you also don't want to include
multiple values in one cell so for
example you wouldn't create a cell named
jobs and then list that the person
worked at McDonald's RadioShack Walmart
and so forth and so on
you want to split all that out out and
that brings us back to creating our
tables and all of the different variable
types so you have your variable number
of characters right here you have
variable number of characters here you
also saw here I have a character here I
have a medium ends here I have an
enumerated type here I have a date
primary key of course and timestamp what
do all these mean I'm gonna briefly go
over all of them right now okay for the
numeric types if you are only ever going
to store a value between 127 to negative
128 you would use what's called a tiny
int you could also see here the minimums
and maximums for small ends medium ends
and intz in general here are all the
string types you have characters which
is going to be a fixed length series of
characters variable characters which you
saw that I used a lot and whenever I
created the last table and it's gonna
have a variable length even though you
put a number in there that is just an
estimate and then you have blobs which
can be quite large more numeric types
you have big integers you can see
they're the minimum and maximum floats
which is what you're gonna use with
decimals as well as doubles then you
have your string type so you're gonna
have enumerated types which is just like
you saw there whenever you know that
you're gonna have a limited number of
possible values like male or female
numeric type works well and you have
sets which I'm actually going to skip
over in this
the tutorial which is this gonna be a
list of legal possible character strings
and the main difference between an
enumerated type in a set is that a set
can contain multiple values meaning that
you could pick male and female for
example if you wanted to whenever an
enumerated type can only ever have one
real value and we have date types as you
can see their date is just gonna be year
month and day you're gonna have x which
is hours minutes and seconds date times
timestamp and year okay so we're back in
MySQL and if you want to see a
description of any of your tables that
you create you're gonna type in describe
and then student and there you can see
it's kind of messy but if I shrink it
down in size you're gonna see that
everything is listed out there exactly
as we typed it out so how exactly do you
go and enter values inside of here what
we're gonna do is we're going to insert
student information you just type in
insert into and the table you want to
insert that data into and then you're
going to type out values and you can
skip around on two different lines if
you'd like and here I'm gonna type in a
student named Dale and you're gonna want
to type this in an exact order that you
set up the database so we had first name
we had last name and then we had email
address and if you're working with
characters you're gonna want to make
sure that you surround them with quotes
and then we could type in our address
and you can see here I can type in
bounced around as much as I want and my
city and my state zip code which is an
integer so we don't have to put quotes
around it phone number which is a
character that put quotes around that
could also use double quotes if you like
that for our birthday male if you want
to get the current time this is the
information on when this information was
entered into the database you just type
in now with the two brackets there and
that's gonna give you that and the
amount they're going to be charged for
lunch and then Nall is going to
represent the primary kid so I'm gonna
automatically increment itself and there
you can say it and there you can say I
went and filled in a whole bunch of
other student information just like we
did before and clear that out of there
we then want to show all that data we're
gonna go select and we're gonna put star
inside of here that says basically we
want everything and then we're gonna say
what table we're gonna pull that
information from and there you can see
it's kinda messy again if I shrink it
down up you're gonna see all the student
information entered in there I have to
shrink it down quite a bit just
be able to fit it all in there but you
can see the first name last name email
Street city state zip phone numbers
birthday sex date entered you can also
see how those are changing and exactly
what the timestamp looks like lunch cost
and the student ID and you can see those
Auto incremented ok the next day we're
gonna create is going to be class which
is going to have a class ID for each of
the possible classes as you saw right
here we had science we're also gonna
have English and a whole bunch of other
different things and then this class ID
is going to be put inside of the test
area and that's how we're going to be
able to keep track of everything I'm
gonna keep everything normalized like I
said before or atomic by separating out
everything that doesn't need to be there
and we're going to have Class B in its
own table because there's no need to
type in science multiple different times
here or English or whatever inside of
the test area so to create this table
we're gonna go create table and we're
gonna call it class just like we defined
there and each of these gonna have a
name and I'm gonna say variable number
of characters no longer than 30 and not
in all of course we want to make sure we
have something in each one of those and
then we're gonna need a primary key for
this unsigned not null just like before
Auto increment so we don't need to worry
about it primary key of course close
that off and show tables you can see
class was created then I can just paste
this in here another insert save myself
some time you could see English and all
those other different things and all
again is going to allow this to auto
increment and there you can see that's
been created and if I want to see
everything
select again star for everything from
class and there you can see they're all
listed if I want to create my test table
create table test inside an app for each
of these tests we're gonna have a date
and date type of course and not null
remember we had an enumerated type that
was either a test or a quiz so we're
gonna create that all again class ID is
gonna link out to the table that we just
created here and like I said before this
is called a foreign key which I'm going
to talk about in a second and then test
ID which is going to be the primary key
for this guy again int unsigned not null
and every primary key is gonna look like
this primary boom and you can of course
use lowercase letters and there you can
see all of those are create
no as I said in a second ago a class ID
like we created in the test table is
known as a foreign key and what they're
used to do is make references to primary
keys of other tables so class ID inside
of the test table is a foreign key that
references the primary key over in the
class table and to give you another
example let's say we had a customer and
a city table if the city table had a
column which listed the unique primary
keys for all the different customers
that primary key listing in the city
table would be considered a foreign key
or just like you saw previously with the
test isn't and the classes now the
foreign key can have a different name
from the primary key but very often it
makes sense to keep them the same the
value of a foreign key can have a value
of null whoever that wouldn't be
advantageous most of the time but it's
possible most definitely and a foreign
key does not need to be unique so and
but that's quite obvious because we
could have multiple different people to
in a science class taking a test so you
would have science numerous different
times inside of there for the to
represent the foreign key and of course
they wouldn't be unique back over MySQL
and now let's create our score table Oh
create table score student ID int
unsigned not null event ID which is
going to represent the test that was
taken and I'm gonna go back in here as I
show you other different things and
change names and so forth inside of
these we're gonna have our score which
is gonna be an int because these are all
small numbers and then what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to combine the event and
student ID to make sure that we don't
have duplications in regards to scores
it's also gonna make it quite easy to
change scores later on so I'm gonna
create a primary key and if I want to
use the event ID and the student ID to
make sure they're unique that's exactly
how you do that and there that's created
and once again the reason why we're
combining the event ID and the student
ID is because in the scores table we're
gonna have multiple different tests
they're going to be taken by each of the
different students so that's not unique
and also the student IDs because they're
going to be taking multiple tests are
also not going to be unique however if
we combine the two of them together that
is going to be unique last table we want
to create
here is the absence table which we're
going to make use to make sure that the
students are going to be able to take
tests that they missed and it's gonna
have a student ID inside of it it's
gonna be unsigned not at all gonna have
the date of the absence date datatype
not at all again and once again we're
going to create a primary key that is
going to combine the student ID because
students could have multiple absences so
we have to figure that out and date
since they can only miss one date there
we go now we have a unique primary key
and there you can see all those are
created now if we want to come in here
to the test area and describe that now
let's say that we wanted to have
multiple different types of quizzes and
multiple different types of tests
meaning that there would be different
types of and different numbers of
questions inside of them how exactly we
go in here and add in a new row that's
going to have the maximum score for each
of these tests and quizzes well we're
gonna go in here and we're gonna type in
alter table the one we want to alter
it's called test and then we want to add
a new row of data inside of this we're
gonna go add and let's say that I want
this to be called max score and I'm
gonna define the data types
not null and if I also want to put it
after type for example to keep it away
from the different keys I can type in
after height and there you go
and if we go describe test you're gonna
see max scores in there another way to
enter data inside of these let's say I
want to add in some test data let's go
and put that on the screen so we can see
exactly what's going on here we can also
go insert into tests and values and then
we can put all this in here at one time
so let's say that the test is in 2014
8:25 and it's quiz and the maximum score
is 15 and the class ID in this situation
is gonna be the first and then we're
gonna make sure you please call them in
there and then you're gonna put in all
and then you're gonna put a column after
that and then put in all that other
additional data and there you go that's
how you would be able to enter all of
those different types of data all on in
one query inside of MySQL and then we
can of course see all of them select
from test and there you can see them all
in one place now how exactly would you
go in here and change the name for a row
so let's say we go into we want to see
what's in score and we decide that event
ID doesn't really make any sense and we
would prefer to have test ID inside of
there how do we go in and change that
you're gonna go alter again as you're
gonna see use the same commands over and
over again and then you're gonna type in
score which is the table you want to
change and then you're gonna type in
change and if you want to change event
ID to test ID instead you're then going
to have to define the data type for our
new test ID unsigned and not null I'm
gonna be able to go describe score and
see that it's been changed from event ID
a to test ID I'm then going to enter in
all my score data and you can see right
here where I call minute edit this one
line this is how you put a single line
comment inside of your queries you can
see here insert into score values and I
have all that they're just a save time
and you can see that I updated that if I
also want to come in here and put some
data in the absence there you can see
that it's often a good idea to use
describe to be able to see exactly the
order you should put your data in and
you can see there I'm using insert
command again and there are all of my
absences for all the different students
or you can see right there now to list
all of this data out you're not always
gonna use the star command which is
gonna list out everything so let's say
with student database I just want first
name and you could also come in here
nothing's case-sensitive so you could go
first name or last name whatever you
want then you just come in just like
before and go student and that's gonna
list out all of our student names you
can also see here however that whatever
you type in here for first name is gonna
show up there and last name there we're
gonna correct that in a moment
now another thing is sort of bothering
me about this is if we show our tables
you're gonna see everything here is
absence class score student and tests
well I kind of would prefer these to be
plural so that's gonna mean I need to go
in and rename my table and I'm going to
rename all of them instead of just some
of them so we're gonna go into absence
and I could just do one or I could do
multiple ones and we're gonna change
this to AB since this class two classes
score two scores and then test to test
and if we then come in here
show tables you're gonna see all those
are plural now so let's go in
and let's say that we just want to be
able to select the first name last name
and the state from our students database
from students and this is where we're
comes in where is used when you want to
limit your data so I'm gonna type in
state and let's say I just want all
students that are from Washington there
you go and we could also do more than
that way more than that say I want to
get first name last name and birthdate
from students and if I just want the
people that are born after 1965 I can
specifically get just the year from the
date of birth part and I just type in
birthdate and greater than or equal to
1965 and there you can see that data and
of course you're going to be able to
compare all of these using equals to
greater than less than greater than or
equal to less than or equal to or not
equal to I could also go in there and
get the month so I'll get first name
last name birthdate from students and it
doesn't matter that the from has a
lowercase M and let's say we're and if I
want to just get the month like let's
look say we're looking for birth dates
or something for the month I don't know
just type in month birth date is equal
to two or another thing we could use is
an or statement to put in multiple
conditions or state is equal to
California so this is gonna match if
they were born in February or they were
born in the state of California and
there you can see you're gonna be able
to combine these conditions either using
or as you just saw and and another guy
you can use is not and instead of or if
you wanted to put in here two of those
guys or four and you want to put in and
you could do that and for not another
replacement for that is an exclamation
mark which I'm going to show you here in
examples and let's make another query
here that's a little bit more
complicated that uses those logical
operators I just showed you so let's go
last name state birthdate from students
again and let's say we want all the
students that have a birthday that is
greater than or equal to twelve and we
could put an end inside of there or we
could put and inside of there like that
put brackets here if you want to combine
these guys or they're born in the state
of California or
put that in there or put over doesn't
matter I'm gonna put that just to show
you they're the same there's state they
were born in was Nevada there you can
see all those matches
another weird guy is null if you want to
check if a value is null you cannot use
the greater than or equal to or any of
those different things what you have to
use is either is not null or is null and
select so let's say last name from
students and if we want to check if a
last name was not entered at all we
would go
is it null and that would list every
single last name student that didn't
have a value in there or we would come
in and go is not null if we go is not
know it's gonna list all of them because
all of them have last names another
thing we can do is decide how our data
is gonna be ordered inside of MySQL so
let's say first and last names from the
students table I want to order them by
last name there you can see all of them
are now if about a quarter now if you
wanted to put them in reverse
alphabetical order you would just type
in order by and whatever they are
calling name is followed by a DSC that's
gonna be reverse alphabetical order you
could also combine those let's say when
it first last name is state from
students and the most important thing is
to order by state and let's just do it
in descending order and secondly you
wanted last name in alphabetical order
which is ASC and there you can see they
went and had all the states putting in
the order but it made sure that this was
in alphabetical order like that just
another weird query if you want to limit
the amount of data that you're going to
get to say the first five results to
stipend limit five if you then wanted to
get the next five you just come in here
where the five part is and type in five
through ten and there you can see you
get the next five now these guys are
kind of messy where you see first name
and last name so there's a couple
different ways that we can clean that up
and also clean this data up so that the
names are not divided on the screen
we're gonna use concat which is gonna
allow us to combine data so let's say we
wanted to get the first name and then we
wanted to have the last name as well all
in the same area but we want the title
at the top to be just name we're gonna
type in as and name like that and let's
say we want to get
a city in the state and combine those
all into one block as well city state
and let's say we want this to be
hometown and we want that from students
and there you can see everything's
listed and you can see names right here
that's because of this as right there
and hometowns there because of that
right there and all this data is
combined because we use the concat
command another thing we can do is use
like which is going to allow us to get
data that fits certain constraints so
let's go select and let's say we wanted
our last name and first name from
students where and let's say that we
wanted everybody that's first name began
with the letter D we would say like D
and then we would put a percent sign
inside of there or last name like and
let's say we wanted everybody that had a
last name that ended with the letter n
there you can see all those and this
percent sign basically matches any
sequence of characters so that's what
it's used for another thing we can do
with like is we could use underscores
which are going to match any single
character so let's say we wanted a four
letter name that ended with the letter Y
name from students where first name
there's like again we use underscore
that represents one character so we want
three characters and an ending with y
and there you can see those matches now
let's say we in our results we only want
to show something once we would use
distinct in that situation so let's say
we wanted a listing of states from
students and we went to order by state
so we're gonna see every single state
that every single students from but
we're only gonna see at one time there
you can see that's what distinct does it
only gives us a result one time to avoid
duplication if we then wanted to go in
and count the number of students from
each of those states we would use count
and then we would use distinct the only
shows are just our state one time from
students again so you can see that our
students come from only eight distinct
states we could also use count to come
in and count the total number of
students that we have in our class
select count from students see we have a
total of ten students could also use
count to go
and count the number of boys in the
class count all so that's gonna give us
all the students and then we're gonna
say from students and then we're gonna
use where to issue our conditions you
see we have six boys in each of the
class or six males another thing we
could do is group our data so select and
let's say we wanted sex and the count
for each of the sexes sex types from
students and then let's say we want to
group them by sex so the thing that's
gonna be different between any two of
these or it's either gonna be male or
female and there you can see we have six
males and four females do a little bit
more with group by so let's say we want
select the month birth date and let's
change the column name for this two
month and we want to count all of those
different birthday months from students
and we want to group by month and that's
a reference to this month up here that's
what that month is and then we want to
order by month as well and there you can
see for each of these months the number
of students that were born in those
months another thing we can do is narrow
our query results after the quarry has
been issued using a command called allow
so we're gonna say that we want the
state and we want to count the number of
states and we're gonna give this the
name amount we're gonna pull this data
from students and we're gonna group by
the state we're only gonna list a state
if more than one student is from it so
that's what having allows you to do so
I'm gonna say having an amount greater
than one and there you can say Atlas
California Washington because two
students in both situations were born
there it's also going to be a whole
bunch of math functions you're gonna be
able to do so let's say that we want
let's put these all in separate lines so
let's have our test ID as test and let's
say that we want to get the minimum
score on that test score give this the
name as min get our max score get there
a range of scores did the max minus the
min and there's all of them including
some and the average and
gonna be pulling that from the scores
table we're gonna group by test ID and
there you can see all of those now you
can see all a whole bunch of the
different numeric functions that are
available in my school I'm not gonna
give examples of every single one of
them but as you can see we can get an
absolute number or an absolute value for
a variable there's all the different
trigonometric functions you can get
average like I just showed ceiling which
is gonna return the smallest number not
less than whatever it's passed to you're
going to see count like we've seen
multiple different time you also have
the option to get degrees gonna be able
to use exponents gonna get floor which
is going to return the largest number
not greater than the value passed to it
the logarithm function max min modulus
which is gonna return the remainder of a
division you can get the value of Pi
gonna be able to make calculations based
off the power radians you're gonna move
it random numbers you're gonna be able
to round you can a square root you're
gonna have standard deviation some like
we saw before and you're gonna be able
to truncate so you can play around with
those different mathematical functions
on your own and let's go in here and
just do a couple other different things
let's take a look at absences everybody
has an absence from our classes and
there they are let's say that I wanted
to come in here and have a student that
missed a test go in and retake that test
and get a score so we're gonna look in
the scores table here now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna go select and I'm gonna
get a student ID and a test ID just to
show me what's going on here from scores
and I'm gonna look up the specific
student ID that is equal to six because
student ID right here missed that test
so I want that student take that test
you can see them right here you can see
they missed test number three now I
would go and I give them test number
three and they go and take it and they
get a result now I'm gonna go in here
and actually change the values for that
and to do so I'm just gonna type in six
which is their ID three which is the
test ID and 24 which is gonna be their
score then come in here and I'll now see
that they actually took that test
well now what I'm going to want to do
because the absence is still going to
show up there is go in and
remove that so if I want to remove data
from my table I just go delete from and
the absences where and in my condition
student ID is equal to sex and there you
can say select everything from absences
and there you can see it's gone now
let's say that since we're looking at
absences here we might and let's look at
it close let's say that we would like to
have true or false inside of here in
regards to whether they took the test or
not so let's say we wanted to keep track
of all absences and just wanted to put
true or false if they took the test or
needed to take the test or whatever
inside of here well we're gonna use
alter again and table absences want to
add a column let's call it test taken
and it's only ever gonna have either a
true or false inside of here character
and let's just put not in all give it a
default value of F and let's say that we
want it to come after the student ID and
like I said you could put before in
there as well and would be useful to be
able to spell absences right so instead
of ancestors absences and there you can
say that's changed and described is
gonna show the test Aikens in there well
now what if we in using some logic we
realize well it's only ever gonna have a
value of true or false so this should
actually be a numerated type so let's go
in there and let's fix that and once
again to change the data type for our
table we're gonna go alter table
absences modify column and test taken is
the guy we want to change and we want to
change it to an enumerated type that's
only ever gonna have a value of true or
value of false and it's gonna be not
null again and it's gonna have a default
value of f that they did not take it and
there you can see that's fixed and then
let's say that we come in here and we
say you know what let's not have that at
all as you can probably tell I'm just
messing around here and we decide that
we don't even want test taken in there
we can go alter table absences and drop
column
it's gonna allow us to delete a column
and test taken will be deleted and there
you can see it has been now I'm gonna go
in and show all of my
scores where the student ID is equal to
four now let's say I want to update a
score let's maybe a score was entered
incorrectly so we would go update scores
and I'm going to set the score equal to
25 where and the condition here it's
gonna be the student ID is equal to four
and the test ID is equal to three and
then if we pull that back up again
you're gonna see that that's been
changed another thing that's useful is a
command called between and what betweens
gonna allow us to do is find matches
between a minimum and maximum so let's
say we wanted to find the first last
name and birthdate for any student that
was born between 1960 and 1970 there is
between and there you can see that's
exactly what it did for us another
useful command is to be able to go in
here and find matches based off of a
list so and one way to do that is to use
the command in so we're gonna say is one
first and last names in which the first
name is in our list
so either Bobby Lucy or Andi and it
grabbed it for us there and in is a
great way to narrow results based off of
a predefined list of possible options
and this brings us to actually joining
data together now if you want to combine
data from multiple different tables you
can perform what is called a join and a
join works by matching up comm and data
like I'm going to show you right now so
let's say that I wanted to get the
student ID date score and max score on
the test
well this stat all comes from two
different tables so if I want to join
two different tables I'm gonna say from
both tests and scores
don't put that column in there where
date so I'm gonna get all of these
student IDs data scores and max scores
for the date of 2014 25th then what I'm
gonna have to do is decide on how this
these two tables are going to join
together well as we can see right here
with our two our different tables that
we created we have our tests table right
here and our scores table right here
well we're gonna have to find something
that is like that they both have so that
we can join them together I actually had
to come in here and correct this the two
things that they both have being test
and score is
test ID so we're gonna join these two
tables together by pointing out those
two things that are equal and to do so
we're gonna go and test test ID is equal
to scores test ID and there you can see
we got exactly what we wanted so you can
see it's quite easy to join two
different tables in this situation all
we need to do is find like data like we
did right there now whenever you're
joining these different tables together
and different table data it's often
going to be advantageous to proceed each
of the pieces of data you want with the
tables names so you're not going to get
confused so we're gonna go scores
student ID tests date scores the score
TAS max score and then we're gonna hit
say the two different tables we want to
join the condition and then and pass
test ID is equal to scores dot test ID
and there you can see the same data so
how exactly would we go in and join
three tables for example let's do a big
giant thing let's go select concat and
students first name and students last
name as name let's get test date scores
score say we want to get the max score
as well and let's say we want to pull
this data from three different tables
which is gonna be from test scores and
the students tables and we want data in
the situation where the date is gonna be
equal to 2014 and then we're gonna have
to just use multiple different
conditions and we're gonna have to match
up like data between the different
tables so test ID is going to be in the
tests table it's also gonna be in the
scores table and then we have to match
up the last one which is scores student
ID is equal to students student ID and
there you can sees all that information
just go through a couple other different
commands let's say if we wanted to come
in here and list the number of absences
per student well we're gonna put in our
student ID we're going to put in the
first and last name
then we're gonna count the number of
absences from the absence of stable we
would then want to group by that
specific piece of data that we're going
to want to get otherwise we're just
gonna get one result and in this
situation you're going to see a quick
way to get the total number of absences
with each student name another way to do
a join if we want to make sure that we
include all information from the table
listed on the left side of the screen
even if it doesn't exist in the table
that we're combining it with is to use
what is called a left joint so let's go
select first and last name and then
let's say that we want to count the
total number of absences once again
we're going to be using this because we
want to list the students that have
absences and the students that do not
have absences that's why we're gonna use
the left joint and use it you're gonna
say from students you want to make sure
you list all the students names whether
they have absences or not and the other
table you want to join to and then
you're going to put in your condition or
the two things that are the same between
these tables so I'm going to say the
student IDs are equal and then finally
we're gonna group these by the student
IDs and there you can see we're listing
the absences even if they are a zero and
that is all occurring because of the
left join that we just did and the final
join we're gonna cover here or what are
called inner joins and an inner join
just gets all the rows of data from both
of the tables and puts those together so
let's just do something quick students
first name students last name test ID
score and we're gonna use the students
table and do a complete join between the
students and the scores table with an
inner join and then your two things that
these tables have in common are going to
be defined which is going to be the
student ID is equal to the scores
student ID and the condition in this
situation is we want to list all the
scores that are less than or equal to 15
and let's say we want also order them by
scores test ID and there you go
every single score and this is basically
just gonna give us all of our quiz data
for every single quiz that was taken by
every single student okay guys so that's
a lot of information on MySQL please
leave a comment if you watch the whole
thing I'd be excited to see that so
