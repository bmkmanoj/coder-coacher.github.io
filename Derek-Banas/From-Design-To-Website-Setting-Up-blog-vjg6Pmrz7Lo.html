affordable website that search engines
will know based off of the best
statistics I've found they're all for
one hundred eighty seven million blogs
people obviously love reading and
writing blogs there is little doubt then
that a business that doesn't speak to
its customers through blogging is
definitely alienating its customers in
the sting age it's very easy for a
business owner no matter how small to
create a website these websites must
build trusting relationships while
pulling in business from all over the
world in the past business owners needed
to rely on extremely expensive website
design companies to build them a site
those days are now in the past thanks to
a fabulous program called word trust
WordPress is a free blogging toolkit
that brings the power of internet
blogging to the people WordPress is the
largest self hosted blogging tool in the
world used on millions of sites and it's
seen by millions of people every day the
goal of this series of articles is to
help people getting started with
WordPress it really is quite easy there
are two versions of WordPress there is
the blogging software you can use with
WordPress at wordpress.com this operates
in a way similar to most social
networking systems like MySpace Facebook
etc there is another version that you
host on a hosting company such as
GoDaddy or DreamHost this version can be
downloaded from wordpress.org
if this isn't bit confusing don't worry
the video tutorials will show you
exactly how to set up both of these
versions of WordPress WordPress is so
easy to use because it takes care of all
the technical stuff this allows you to
spend all of your time writing what's
better is that WordPress allows you to
easily create amazing tools and new web
designs with these we'll get to them
later
a few more reasons why WordPress is
amazing it installs easily normally it
will take no more than five minutes to
install in a private host and less than
app to install at wordpress.com it helps
you organize all of your articles in a
logical manner
search engines absolutely love WordPress
websites if you follow this tutorial
traffic to your google page ranking are
probably even higher than if you
actually hired an outside web design for
convicted nineties WordPress WordPress
is not just for blog websites you can
use it to pretty traditional sites as
well
there are many pre-made web designs for
you to think from if you want any new
design if your entire site you can have
it in just a few seconds with no design
or technical knowledge your customers
want to interact with your website
wordpress provides you with easy to use
enhancements that allow you to add
bulletin boards calendars RSS feeds
video audio shopping carts etc it will
block unwanted spam as well from your
site the difference between
wordpress.com and wordpress.org as
mentioned before a wordpress.com site is
similar to a social networking site is
hosted on wordpress computers it is free
for the most part and extremely easy to
set up almost every technical activity
is taken care of for you such as saving
your content blocking spam and
insecurity upgrading as well as
promotion let's go back to that free
sort of comment first in my opinion
WordPress deserves every dollar that
they make I just want to make that clear
either way if you want to gain special
benefits in wordpress.com you must pay
for following and these prices are as of
December 2009 the custom CSS upgrade
allows you to use your own cascading
style sheets to customize the appearance
of your blog
CSS allows you to change fonts colors
borders backgrounds and even the layout
of the blog the cost of that is 1497 per
year if you want to use a custom domain
name doesn't end with wordpress.com you
can either pay WordPress 1497 to both
register and host your domain for a year
or if you already own a domain name they
charge 997 for you to host that the main
name on their servers or it Prest gives
you 3 gigabytes of space to use for free
on their computer if you want more you
get 5 gigabytes for 1997 per year 15
gigabytes for 49 97 per year or 25
gigabytes for eighty nine nines
if you don't want work for us to put ads
on your site you have to pay them 2997
per year there is a limited number of
private users available to you if you
wish to buy unlimited users instead of
staying at the standard 35 that will
cost you twenty nine ninety seven per
year now if you want to host your own
site and control everything the version
of WordPress found at wordpress.org is
the way to go you will gain access to a
larger number of website designs called
themes you will only be limited in the
size by your chosen hosting company you
will also gain access to a large or a
number of tools called plugins plugins
give you access to such tools as
e-commerce systems a wide assortment of
media tools and basically anything else
you can imagine
the negatives opposed to your own site
include you must pay a hosting site to
host your site average cost being
between seven to fifteen dollars per
month it is more complicated to set out
many hosting companies however set up
WordPress for you you're responsible for
upgrading your software and your site's
uptime will only be as good as the
hosting company you host on personally I
use GoDaddy for hosting but there are a
large number of other great hosting
companies available to you all that they
would need in regards to minimum
requirements to host WordPress would be
PHP version 4.3 or greater and MySQL
version 4.0 or greater it's also
probably in your best interest to
install a Linux rather than a Windows
Server best hosting companies include
Bluehost dream homes meeting a temple
and GoDaddy
in the next article I will go into
detail on how to create a wordpress.com
account you should do this even if you
plan to host your own site to gain
access to a program called Esmond which
is a great anti-spam tool which is very
important an additional benefit of
starting a wordpress.com account is that
it gives you the opportunity to see if
WordPress is right for you whether you
choose to host on WordPress or from your
own hosting company the interface of
WordPress is nearly identical so if you
learn how to operate a blog on WordPress
com you'll know how to run WordPress on
separate hosting
as well I hope this clears up any
questions about WordPress next I'll
dispel any beliefs the wordpress is
complicated to set up if I missed
anything please tell me how I might
improve the overall post and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
