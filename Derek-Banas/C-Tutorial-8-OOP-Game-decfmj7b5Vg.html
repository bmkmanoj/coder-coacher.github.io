a MIT short video tutorial and it is pop
quiz time what I want you to do in this
tutorial is to create to order objects
and to have them fight to the death
quite simple what what I'm going to do
is I'm going to ease you through the
process and I'm going to walk you
through the steps of how we solve
problems in general and I did this once
many many months ago and a lot of people
enjoyed this tutorial so I think
everybody will enjoy it and like always
all the code as well as a transcript of
this video is available in the
description underneath the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so this is what I want you to
make I want you to create two objects to
order objects as I said and this is
going to be the output we're going to
give them a name and they're going to
fight to the desk they're going to have
a name obviously they're going to have a
health value they're going to have a
maximum attack value and a maximum block
value and basically what you're going to
do is just have them fight to the death
until one of the characters no longer
has any health and then they die and
then you're going to put this message on
the screen right there and then game
over after that now what I want to do
here is I'm going to have three
difference of files
three different class files I'm going to
have the main program dot CS file I'm
also going to have a warrior dot CS file
and a battle dot CS file and I'm
actually going to complete the main
program part of this to show you exactly
what it should look like so what you
should be able to do is to come in to
main and go warrior and then we'll say
something like Maximus is equal to new
warrior and then pass in a name followed
by a maximum amount of health followed
by a maximum attack value and then a
maximum block value then likewise it's
giving me errors because woops Takota so
we're wrong there we are
so it's tell hoarder the drag delay and
what we're also going to do then after
that is to create another warrior and
I'm going to call this warrior Bob and
I'm going to change the name here as
well and I'm going to leave their
statistics be exactly the same
and then to initiate the fight all
you're going to do is use another class
called battle and then you're going to
call sir fight and you're going to pass
in the two water objects you want to
fight and it's going to figure out
everything for you so real nice and neat
this is the way code should look and
that is all you're going to do inside a
program dot CS this is the whole entire
thing so now what I'm going to do is
jump over into the other two classes and
walk you through the thinking process of
how to solve this problem all right so
here we are in the warrior class file
now what are we going to do so Bob
basically we are going to need some
different pieces of information inside
here we're going to have to have a name
we're going to have to have health we're
going to have to have an attack maximum
and we're going to have to have a block
maximum so those are going to be some
things that we're going to want inside
of here we are of course also going to
have a constructor that's going to
initialize all these and create these
objects for us we're going to want some
randomization inside here so we're going
to need an ability to generate random
numbers because we want to be attacks
and the blocks to be randomized and then
we have to think about what are going to
be our warriors capabilities and
whenever I say that I'm talking about
methods of course and basically we are
going to have a capability of attacking
and also we're going to have a
capability of blocking likewise it's
more specifically in regards to attack
you're going to want to generate a
random attack value from 1 to the
maximum possible attack and that's what
this function is going to do and then
you're basically going to do exactly the
same thing for block so let's just paste
that inside of there and generate a
random block value from 1 to the maximum
block and that is it that is all we're
going to do with our warriors our
warriors are going to have a health
attack maximum um well they're going to
have a name obviously they're going to
have an attack maximum and they're going
to have a block maximum and they're
going to be able to attack and blow
all right and that looks like a really
nice class now you could go pause the
video and try to figure out what that's
going to look like or otherwise I'm
going to jump over into the battle class
and create all that so what are we going
to do in our battle class well basically
we're going to need an ability to start
a fight so you already saw that I call
it a function called start fight and
what's it going to receive it's going to
receive a warrior one and a warrior two
for attributes or parameters that are
passed into this function to be able to
use it and then what we need to do is we
need to loop over and over again so
we're going to loop giving each warrior
a chance to attack and block each turn
until one dies all right so that's what
we're going to do inside of our start
fight function then just to keep our
code real nice and neat what I'm also
going to do is create another function
inside here I'm going to call this gifts
attack result and what it's going to do
is it's going to receive a warrior once
again so I'm just going to call this
warrior a because it's going to receive
warrior one sometimes in this position
and sometimes warrior two so I'm going
to call it warrior B and a and then from
that what it's going to do is perform
some calculations so some calculations
we're going to do we're going to
calculate one warrior's attack and the
others block and those going to be
random values of course we are then
going to come in and subtract block from
attack then we're going to come in and
say if there was damage subtract that
damage from the health of the other one
we are then going to just provide some
information like you saw previously I
showed you what the sample output was
going to look like so I'm going to do
something like print out info on who
attacked who and for how much damage
and then with the next line of code
we're going to come in and provide
outputs on the change in health
you already saw that sample output again
and then what we need to do is go and
check if the warrior's health fell below
zero and if so print a message and then
send a response that will end the loop
and bye loop I mean this guy right here
it's going to be up here right there
loop giving each warrior a chance to
attack and block each turn until one
dies so that's the thinking process
behind this whole entire thing and
actually it is the entire program that
is all you need to know how to do and
you can pause your screen and go and try
to write it yourself otherwise I'm going
to jump over in the warrior and start
making it work all right so I said that
I want to come in here and I need to
define a name health attack maximum and
block maximum so I'm going to come in
and define some properties so I'm going
to define a string and it is going to be
called name and don't worry if you can't
get this or anything don't give up it's
just a you know a little thing I'm
throwing in here just to have a little
bit more fun so we're going to say that
we want the default name to be warrior
I'm also going to come in and create a
double and it is going to have a hell or
it's going to be called hell and I'm
just going to have it automatically
generate getters and setters once again
give this a default value of zero going
to do the same exact thing for the
attack maximum so I'm going to say
double attack max once again generate
getters and setters give it a default
value of zero once again and then we're
going to do the same exact thing for our
blocking maximum so I'm going to call
this block Max and getters setters and
default value of zero so there we go so
those are the attributes we're going to
need now another thing is we need to
randomize all of this stuff so that
means we need to be able to generate
random numbers now anytime you're going
to be generating a
andum number you want to make sure that
you create a single random instance and
then reuse it over and over and over
again if you do not you're going to find
that you get the same random number many
times in a row just a warning out there
and that's very important to know so
we're going to create a random instance
here and we're going to use it over and
over again
so we'll just go new and random like
that and there we go so we covered that
previously and now we get into our
attack method well first off we want to
come in here and create our constructor
for this to initialize everything so
that's just going to be public Warrior
and it's going to receive a string for
name and I'm just going to put lawyer
inside of here again what else we going
to do what we're going to do a health
amount is going to be passed in inside
and I'll give that a default value of
zero also we're going to get the attack
maximum give that a default value of
zero and then the block maximum and give
that a value of zero as well come in
here create that and then we're just
going to go name is equal to the name
and the health is going to be equal to
whatever the health was that they passed
inside of here and the attack maximum is
going to be the attack maximum obviously
and then the block max is going to be
equal to the block max and there we are
so now we have a constructor to create
that and now we can come down inside of
here and create our attack program or
attack method pretty simple we're going
to go public it's going to return a
double the name of the function is going
to be attack and then what this is going
to do is just return a random value
between 1 and the maximum attack value
how you do that is random and next pass
in the maximum or pass in one and then
you're going to have to convert the
double into an integer and then you're
going to go attack max and there that is
done now we're going to do exactly the
same thing for the block amount and then
we're done with a warrior so pretty cool
stuff now I think you're starting to get
the idea why object
programming is so awesome so now what
we're going to do is we're just going to
change this to block max and that's it
we're done with warrior now we need to
jump over into the battle CS file and
create that class alright so inside of
the battle file what we're going to do
or the battle class what we need to do
here is to define the start fight and
that's going to loop forever and beget
attack result methods now this is pretty
much a utility class and the reason why
I know that is because battle is sort of
like an occurrence a thing that happens
it's not really a real world object
which makes me think that this is a
utility class and what does that mean
that means that most of the methods or
all the methods inside of it should be
static methods so we're going to come in
and we're going to do it that way so
we're going to go public and static and
void and start fight and what's this do
well it receives both of our warriors so
I'm going to go warrior I'm going to
call this warrior one and then it's
going to get the other warrior and that
is going to be called warrior two
now inside of here what I say I need to
do I need to loop giving each warrior a
chance to attack and block each turn
until one dies so how am I going to do
that well I do not know when the loop is
going to end so what I'm going to do is
I'm actually going to just create a
while loop that is going to loop forever
and then I'm going to put a condition
inside of here that's going to throw me
out of the while loop and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to say if get attack
result whenever I pass warrior 1 and
warrior 2 inside of there if the
response from that is equal to I'm going
to say game over because I think that is
a great way to be able to really
understand what's going on with the code
so I'm going to say if that returns the
value of game over well in that
situation I'm going to come in and go
and print game over because that's what
it told me and then I'm going to break
out of my loop ok so now you can see
actly how we're going to jump out of the
while loop likewise I'm going to come in
here and cover a situation in which the
on the opposite results occurred where
warrior two and then where your one come
inside of there because I have to have
them both attack each other so I'm going
to change this to two and then change
this to one and I can leave everything
else exactly the same don't need to
change anything so that just leaves me
with good attack result what do I need
to do with that
well we already covered this loop so
that's gone to get rid of that and now
we get to get attack result and it's
going to receive warrior a and B we why
did we label an a and B we label them
that way because sometimes it's going to
get warrior two and warrior one I don't
like naming them the same things because
that might cause confusion in the code
so I'm going to name them warrior and B
instead so I'm going to go public and
static and string because it's going to
be returning game over remember I'm
going to say it gets attack result and
of course it's going to be receiving a
warrior that I'm going to call warrior a
and another warrior which I'm going to
be calling warrior B then what's going
on inside here well I need to calculate
one warrior's attack and the other ones
block so I'm going to go double I'll go
warrior a attack amount is going to be
equal to and I can just go warrior a and
call for the attack and that's going to
give me a randomized attack and then
likewise I can go and call warrior base
so I'm going to go warrior B block
amount is going to be equal to warrior B
and called block to get a random block
amount all right so we have those
generated what do I need to do then
let's go and get rid of this I need to
come in and subtract block from attack
so I'm going to create another variable
here and I'm going to call this damage
to warrior B and that's going to be
equal to warrior attack amount minus
whatever the warrior block amount is all
right so we got that set up and what are
we going to do we're going to get rid of
that if there was damage subtract that
from health so it's
as if there was damage that means
there's a chance that it wasn't no there
was no damage so I'm going to say if
damage to warrior B is greater than zero
well then I'm going to do something and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
warrior B and get to the health amount
there is going to be equal to warrior be
help - the damage to warrior Bey that's
gone if there was no damage I'm going to
come in and say else or it could be a
negative damage I'm going to say damage
to warrior B is equal to zero and that
way we won't have a situation where the
Warriors are attacking each other in the
actual health of the warriors going up
because the block amount just so
happened to be greater than the attack
amount okay so that's why that's in
there and we can get rid of all this and
then we can say print out info on who
attack - and for how much damage so
we'll just come in and we'll say
console.writeline and I'm going to come
in and go whatever the border is attacks
whatever the other warrior is and deals
whatever the total damage was and then
let's go and get these so this is going
to be warrior a name and then warrior B
name and then the total damage that was
done so damage to warrior B I know that
is so we got that then we need to
provide outputs on the change in the
health of our warriors so come in again
and I'll say whatever the warrior is has
and then we'll output information on
their health and I'd also like to throw
a new line in there just divide up
what's going on on our screen and check
if the waters health fell below zero and
if so print a message and then send a
response that will end our loop that we
have also in this class so I'm going to
say if warrior be health is less than or
equal to zero that means he's dead on
that situation I need to print out some
information on our screen and that
information
is going to be whatever the warrior is
has died and one that's the other
warrior is victorious and throw another
new line to divide that up and then I
have to go and get the Warriors so I'm
going to say warrior be and name like
that and then warrior a and name like
that and now we know that a warrior is
dead so I'm going to say return game
over and likewise I could basically put
anything down here we'll just make sure
to put the semicolon in the right place
I need to return something so in the
other situation I'm going to make this
an else else return and I could throw
anything in here other than game over
but I'm just going to say fight again
and there we go so hopefully you got
something like that and we can run our
program here make sure that I did
everything right and here we could see
we're starting off our little fight and
Maximus attacks Bob and deals healer
rather damage blah blah blah has one
health whoops I messed that up so let's
go ahead and figure out what I did wrong
well that was silly a man just forgot to
put these inside of here so I'm going to
go warrior B and then name and then I'm
going to do the same thing for warrior a
and then and now we can run it again see
if I messed up anything else nope looks
pretty good so here we go inside of here
Maximus attacks Bob and deals 45 damage
bob has Maximus health whoops not
something else up should change that to
be am i doing here
making mistakes I just did that just so
that if you didn't get this answer right
that you wouldn't feel bad all right now
we run it again and now we could say our
attacks Maximus attacks Bob deals 22
damage bob has 978 health then Bob
attacks Maximus and deals 32 damage
Maximus has 968 health and it continues
on and on you can see the random attacks
the random block values and it continues
until we get down here where Maximus has
died and Bob is victorious so good for
Bob and good for you if you got that
right if you didn't get that right
that's perfectly okay whole goal this
whole entire video is just to make you
think in different ways and try to use
the skills that you've been
in learning about in all of the previous
tutorials so like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
