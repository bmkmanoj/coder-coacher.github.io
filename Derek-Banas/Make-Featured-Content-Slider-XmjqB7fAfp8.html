show you how to make a featured content
slider for your website or a photo
gallery or anything and I'm not just
gonna show you how to make this one
that's on the screen I'm gonna show you
how to style it so that you can make any
type of featured content gallery you
could ever want and I'm using the coda
slider as a basis for this guy yes this
is what it starts out like and this is
what I'm gonna turn it into so all you
need to do is download all the code for
the coda slider it's not a percent free
and there is a link for it underneath of
this video so let's get into the coding
okay so I got the code a slide or
downloaded so I'm going to open up all
the files I'm gonna need and you can do
this and just any old text editing tool
I'm using text wrangler but notepad plus
plus works as well and inside of this
guy i'm gonna get index.html and open
that up and i'm also going to go in here
into the java scripts folder inside of
the code of slider i'm gonna download or
open up jquery coda slide or 2.0 rjs and
i'm also going to open up my style
sheets which is where most of the
editing is gonna be done in and that's
code a slider dot 2.0 dot CSS this is
gonna be a two-part tutorial first i'm
going to show you how to work with index
dot HTML so open that up on the screen
it's gonna be real simple so here it is
and we're gonna scroll down we're gonna
leave pretty much everything exactly the
same but first I'm gonna get rid of is
coded slider up here it's real simple
just highlight it and delete it okay so
that's gone they don't want to put our
little wrapper div around this and if
you don't know anything about divs or
HTML or CSS I provide links to tutorials
on those two subjects should definitely
learn them before you continue so I'm
going to create a div class is equal to
and I'm gonna call it page wrapper and
it's just gonna surround the whole
entire featured content slider on the
screen and then of course I'm going to
want to close off this page wrapper so
I'm gonna go way down here to the bottom
and put a closing div
page wrapper copy this this is just a
comment and of page wrapper and you
could easily just copy this code and use
exactly what I have here on the screen
if that works out better for it and the
way the code slider works is everything
is contained you just leave everything
the way that it is and you're even going
to leave panel 1 inside of here
and what you're going to want to do is
you're going to put everything that you
want to show up in your slider inside of
paragraph tags now since we're also
to be putting images inside of here you
could style this to like regular HTML as
long as you keep your Heights and widths
properly set up what we're gonna do is
we're going to create a div inside of
here and this is how the maker of the
code slider says to do things and I'm
gonna define my height because all of my
images are 320 pixels high so I'm gonna
define that and start here right like
that and then of course I'm gonna put a
closing div underneath the figure and
then inside of these paragraph tags I'm
gonna put links to the big giant images
that I want to show up and I have all
those saved inside of the images folder
here are all of them and here you can
see them real big here on the screen so
this is gonna be my thumbnail and this
is gonna be my main image and eventually
I'm gonna turn this into a WordPress
site so I'm just gonna go inside of the
paragraph tags inside of this and go
image source is equal to and then since
I have it in my images folder
I put images forward slash and then I
have something called T and s dash FC
for featured content and it's ping file
close off the image tag and that's all I
need to do so they don't what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna copy all of this and
just keep reusing this over and over
again so make my life easy I'm gonna
copy all this and come down inside here
paste that inside of there paste that
inside of there and paste that inside of
there so now I can change all of my
images inside of here
so here I'm just going to come in and
I'm gonna put in a different image and
this one's called legend valve scroll
down and change this one to Sloan and
then scroll down and turn this one into
Zurn so those are just my big images
that are gonna show up on the screen
then what you want to do is if you want
these thumbnails to show up down here
well you just have to create a new div
and put those thumbnails inside of it so
right before the coda slider closes off
we're gonna create a new div we're going
to put all our thumbnails inside of it
div class and you can make this anything
you want I'm going to call it nav thumbs
this is gonna be my navigation tool and
then close that off throw in my little
comment there and then with the code of
slider you have to use a very specific
sort of styling here so we're gonna go a
class is equal to and then you have to
put in X trig and what this does is it
allows for these panels up here whenever
you click on them they're going to
automatically activate the thumbnails
it's called cross
but you don't need to worry about that
and I'm gonna say this one is my current
thumb which means that it's gonna be
highlighted so I'm defining two classes
instead of just one and then this is
important also H reference and you're
gonna have to put number one since this
is your first link and in order yel is
equal to and you're gonna put Cota
inside of quotes - slider - 1 and this
is also gonna be the same every single
time and I'm gonna go image source and
then I have to provide a link to the
source for the thumbnail so this is
gonna be images again and then T and s -
FC - 150 by 150 dot paint because that's
the name of it and I gave it this
specific name because eventually this is
gonna be turned into a wordpress theme
and then i need to define my height is
equal to I'm gonna say 50 pixels in this
situation and my width is also gonna be
equal to 50 pixels and I'm gonna close
off that image tag and then close off
the link for it that's pretty much all I
got to do I have to make sure that these
are all lined up right so I did TNS and
then I did Leonard and Sloan and Zurn so
I just have to come in here and copy
this and make more of them basically I
need to change here is make this a two
and then I need to change my thumbnail
so this is gonna be legend valve copy
that paste that inside of here this
needs to be changed to three because
it's gonna be my third link let me
change the Salone and I also want to get
rid of these current thumb's because
they don't want them all to be
highlighted whenever it first comes up
change this to four and then change this
to Zurn and that's all I need to change
for the HTML and just for fun let's see
what it looks like reload and you can
see there's an image inside of there and
we're gonna fix up everything else as we
go along so now what I'm gonna do is I'm
done with index.html and I jump into the
jQuery J's file that we opened up
previously and I'm gonna come in here
and make some changes to that all right
so we scroll down and here is where
we're gonna be making a lot of different
changes now do I want this to
automatically adjust height whenever it
jumps from frame to frame well maybe you
do but I don't I want this to stay
consistent so I'm gonna come in here and
say false
now do I want to set up auto slide so it
slides like you see it doing on our left
hand side of the screen yes so I'm gonna
change that to true and then let's say I
want to auto slide it faster like you
see it going there I'm going to change
that to 4,000 that's basically change
every four seconds and then I don't want
the left and the right to show up with
the arrow tools like you see right here
see it says left and right so I'm just
gonna come in here and I'm gonna get rid
of it so I get rid of those two things
the arrows are still going to show up
and then you can do all kinds of other
different transitions like if you want
to change the transition from frame to
frame you would change this guy down
here and in the code I provide some
comments that give you some different
options that are available to you so you
can slide it at at different speeds if
you prefer to do that now what I'm going
to want to do is as you can see here as
it is changing frames it is also
highlighting different thumbnails so
let's make this bigger
see as it changes frames it's going to
automatically switch to these different
thumbnails now the original guy that you
see here on the screen also does that
say has it changed right there so what I
want to do is I want to hook up these
changes that are occurring in these
panels up here into changes that occur
with my thumbnail I'm gonna use the code
that automatically is changing those to
come in here and instead change my
thumbnails so I'm gonna scroll way way
way down here and first set it up so
that when the left arrow is clicked like
you see this guy see it's I'm gonna
automatically jump over here well in my
situation I'm gonna set it up so that it
automatically is going to change the
thumbnail so let's jump back into my
jQuery code and if you have the ability
to do a find what you're going to want
to do is type in left arrow that should
find it and here you say left arrow
click we're gonna use this as a guide
right here and if you don't understand
jQuery I'm going to kind of give you an
understanding of it basically what this
is saying is it wants me to use the
slider and look for all of the siblings
of coda nav coda nav is what surrounds
these guys right here so in essence what
it's saying is select all of these
different divs that are inside of code
and F then I want to find the one that
has the current class attached to it if
I jump over into this here instead I
used current thumb see there's two
different classes to find inside here so
I'm gonna look for the link that has
current thumb as a class jump back into
the jQuery and I want to remove the
class current which means it's not going
to be focused on and then what it
also do is to find the parent ul that
surrounds all of this this is a list
item right here so there's a ul that
surrounds every one of these guys and
then I want to find the last link so in
essence what this is gonna do is if you
were on panel one and it clicks on this
it's gonna automatically select the last
panel see how it did that right there so
if we're on panel one and the left arrow
is clicked it's gonna automatically jump
over here to panel four so that's what
this guy's doing and then it's assigning
that class to it all right so I'm gonna
use that as a guide to create my own now
the div that surrounds my personal
thumbnails is called nav bumps as we saw
previously and if you didn't remember
that just skip back and watch that part
again so I'm gonna go now
thumbs right like that and then I'm
gonna say I want to find the link that
is of the class current thumb I'm using
what's above to redesign this and I'm
gonna say remove class current - thumb
and then I want to say that I also want
to select the parent of that thumbnail
which is gonna be nav foams again and
then I want to find the last link that's
in contained in there and then I want to
add my class current thumb to it right
like that and that's gonna do it for me
so what I'm doing here if we jump back
into index
here's nav Fung's and I'm saying that I
want to find out who currently has
current thumb assigned as a class and I
want to remove that class and then I
want to jump down here to this a this is
the last link inside of nav therms and I
want to assign current thumb to that guy
in case you don't get it what it's doing
is it's changing this thumbnail right
here so that whenever I click on that it
automatically jumps over and highlights
this thumbnail and we continue to do
that over and over and over again that's
cool and this will work and then what
we're gonna do in essence is copy again
what is going on here but we're going to
change some of the little definitions
inside here and we can copy this and
just make some changes based off of how
the slider is already currently working
on the screen so we're going to be
looking for naphthols just like we did
before and we're going to find the
current thumb and remove the class
current thumb from it and we're going to
select the parent and then what I want
to do is change the find function inside
of here
pretty much everything else is gonna be
the same well as you can see here
current panel is constantly being
changed by the co2 slider code so what
it's gonna do is it's going to tell me
what the current panel is that I'm
currently on all I need to do is just
come inside of here and use that value
to decide which thumbnail should be
highlighted so I'm gonna say I want to
select a link and it's gonna be the enth
child inside of nav thumbs and then to
come in here put plus sign and go
current panel which is going to tell me
which panel is currently highlighted and
then close that off just like that and
now what we're going to do is we need to
make the right arrow work so we're gonna
use the code that we used up here before
copy that we're basically gonna have to
change one little thing inside of here
so let's paste that inside of there and
again we're gonna select the div named
nav thumbs we're gonna find the current
phone we're gonna remove the current
thumb class from it we're gonna select
the nav thumbs div that surrounds
everything and in this situation we want
to select the first instead of the last
what this guy's gonna do is it's gonna
work for this so if this is the current
thumb and you click on the right arrow
see it jumped over here and highlighted
Zurn so we're gonna fix that by putting
in first instead of last and everything
else can be left exactly the way it is
and then to handle for all of the other
situations that will occur with the
right arrow clicks we're gonna copy this
code scroll down here after the else
statement and paste that inside of there
and nothing else needs to be changed
there that's gonna work so now our left
arrow and our right arrow all work now
what we have to do is define what's
going to happen when any other external
triggers occur and if you want to find
that part of the jQuery code just type
in external triggers and go next and
there it is and this is what any changes
at all so what we're gonna do is we're
going to look for the slider where it's
changing all these different things
inside of here and we're gonna paste our
code inside of there that we just used
exactly the same code and it again is
going to work for everything and then to
make this work for the auto slide inside
of this guy again you're going to type
in auto slide next I'm in here paste our
code and
in exactly as we last did it and then
everything's gonna work there and that
is all the changes that need to be done
with the JavaScript and let's see what
it looks like probably a mass because
the CSS code isn't working right a
little bit messy but in the next part of
the tutorial I'm gonna fix everything up
and it will look exactly like what you
see here on the screen and you're gonna
learn how to make pretty much any other
type of future content tool that you'd
ever want to make leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
