of my C short video tutorial on this pro
the tutorial we're going to talk about
public private protected constants
read-only fields constructor setters
getters properties and Static and like
always all the code as well the
transcript of this video is available in
the description underneath of the video
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so here we are once again ready
to program now what I went and did was I
went and created an animal class and I
should got to make classes previously
just go up in project and then you come
down and you look for add class and you
type in the name of the class you want
to create now inside of this class what
I want to do is I want to define a
couple different fields and I want to
protect the data so that it is hard for
the user to go in and just give any
value it could possibly want to any of
the fields I have in this class and one
way to do that is to label a field as
private so I'm going to have a private
string and name and then I'm going to
have another one and it's going to be a
string also and it's going to represent
a sound that my animal can make now you
already saw public basically by labeling
a field as public that means that the
user would be able to go in there and
willy-nilly change anything we also have
another version which is protected now
what protected means is that the value
can be accessed by methods inside of the
class but also subclasses private on the
other hand can only be the value for a
private field can only be changed by a
method inside of the field and the
subclasses also won't be able to change
it and I'm going to show you a whole
bunch of examples here to make all this
much more clear another thing I wanted
to cover is that you can also define
constants inside of your classes so
let's say I have an animal shelter and I
want to make this a constant and I could
give it a name such as Derek's own for
animals and that value once defined
cannot be changed anywhere so that is a
constant and that's why it's called a
constant another thing that
c-sharp introduces is what are called
read-only fields and they are going to
be set at runtime inside of your
constructors they can't be defined
anywhere else and once they are defined
they can't be changed so it provides a
way for you to create a constants that
can be changed at runtime and how you
define one is you define it as read-only
and I'm just going to make an integer
and this is going to be like an ID
number that's going to represent my
animal shelter for all of my different
animals okay of course within your class
you're going to be able to define a
capability for your animals and so let's
say that I want to say that my animals
are all going to be able to make eight
sounds and what this is going to do is
just output on our screen some
information about our animals so we'll
say something like the animals name says
and then the sounds that that animal
makes we are then going to be able to
pull in that information by going name
and then once again we're going to be
able to pull in the B sound for our
animal now I want to get into a little
bit more complex way of defining
constructors so you saw previously where
we were able to define our constructors
like this of course we are going to use
the same name for the constructor which
is going to initialize or define all the
different fields for animals upon
creation but what if you would like to
take the information that was passed
inside of here and then pass the false
up the chain to additional constructors
you would be able to do that all you
need to do is go : and this and then
let's say that this constructor is
called
whenever no information no parameters
passed to this constructor and we want
to define some defaults so I'm going to
say that I wanted to fine no name and no
sounds for the different fields whenever
this constructor is called so that we
are and there we are and then the weird
thing you do here at the end of this is
you put your little curly brackets at
the end there all right so we're going
to come in and
we're going to define some additional
constructors as well so we're going to
define also a constructor in which it's
just going to receive a name so we're
going to type in string and name and
then we want to pass this up to an
additional constructor so in this
situation we're going to say this and
then we're going to pass in whatever
name they pass to us and then we're also
going to pass in a default no sound and
then we are going to put our curly
brackets at the end there once again
it's just giving me an error saying we
do not have a constructor that receives
two arguments so I'm going to change
that right now and find public animal
and this is going to receive a name as
well as a sound so type in both of those
and then this one is going to properly
define everything and so what we're
going to do is I'm going to show you how
to use getters and setters and all those
different things let's just keep this
fine the way that it is right now and
let's come in here and define a setter
and how those work now basically setters
or mutaters are going to protect the
fields from receiving bad data and how
we define them is we can go public and
void
and I can call this set name I'm going
to show you a couple different ways
because there's a couple different ways
to define setters and we use things
called properties you're going to see it
all alright so what we're going to do
inside of this is we want to check if
any character in the string for our name
is a number and if so what we want to do
is we want to say that that's not a
valid name so how can we do that well we
can come in and we can set if and not
and then we'll put name and then what
any is going to do is it is going to
check every single character and it is
going to see if any of those is a digits
if this comes back is true this is going
to change this into a false statement
meaning that there are no numbers and in
that situation what we're going to do
is we're going to say this name is equal
to the name that they passed in so we're
going to say that that's valid that they
were you know they passed in a valid
name all right so that's one way to
check data and that's one reason why we
have setters and getters and otherwise
we can command and say else and we could
say something like this name is equal to
no name and then we can output like an
error message or something on the screen
and that error message say something
like name can't contain numbers there's
all kinds of cool little functions like
any inside of c-sharp and we will cover
them as the tutorials continue we're
also going to be able to define what are
called getters and a getter or an
accessor is going to be able to provide
output aside from the value that is
stored if that's something that you need
to do which very often it is let's say
that we store a weight and we want to
output what type of weight it is like
pounds or kilograms or something like
that
well we could store the raw weight
inside of it but whenever we call for
output to or the getter in this
situation what it's going to do instead
is it's going to also slap on that
pounds or kilograms or something like
that but in this situation we're just
going to return a value and to do so we
can just say return name exactly like
that except we're going to spell name
right and there we are so that's an
example of a getter now in c-sharp a I
like to cover every way of basically
doing things but normally in c-sharp
what you're going to want to do is
define your getters and setters through
what are called properties and how you
do that is you go public and I'm going
to do this with sounds so the name thing
is going to be done in one way and then
we are going to find sound in the proper
way using properties then we're going to
define exactly what our getter is going
to do in this situation it is just going
to return sounds okay so that's cool and
then we can also define our setter in
exactly the same way except in this
situation what we want to do is let's
say we want to ver
by that the length of the sound isn't
too long so we could say something like
the value length and then we can check
that it's not greater than 10 and in
this situation if it is greater than 10
we want to set the value for sounds
equal to no sounds we want to set it
back to its default and then let's say
that we also want to come in here and we
want to output an error message on the
screen and we're going to say something
like sound is too long and there that is
and otherwise if the sound isn't more
than 10 characters what we're going to
do is just say sound is equal to value
and value is the way is like the default
variable that is going to store what is
passed into the setter function that is
going to be defined inside of here
whenever you're using properties alright
so there's an example of a property
another thing it's really cool is you
are actually going to be able to have
c-sharp automatically generate the
getters and setters for you and you're
also going to be able to define defaults
so let's come out of here make sure that
we are outside of our property that we
defined right there and how you do that
is let's make this public once again and
string and let's say that we want to
define an owner for our animal we can do
so and then we can come in and say
something like get and set and then we
can also define that there is no owner
that is going to be the default value
that is going to be stored in the owner
field if nothing is provided alright so
that's how we automatically generate
those and of course you're also going to
be able to define static properties
inside of here so we can just go static
and let's say we want to store a num of
animals and let's give that a default
value of zero to start off and then
let's define the getters and setters for
this guy and we'll go public static and
this is an integer and we'll go
of animals and for this static property
we're going to say guess and that's just
going to return whatever is stored in
num of animals so really simple and then
we're also going to define sets which is
going to be num of animals and then we
will increment the value for that guy
all right so there we go we have just
defined a whole bunch of different
things and let's change this to normal
animals and let's change those to all
right after the verify that all those
are exactly the same and also change
those two ends whoops
a couple slip-ups alright so all of that
is cool now and we have all this set up
and now we can go up and use these
inside of our main constructor file and
that guy is right up here there it is
alright so if we want to come in here
now and we want to set the name we will
use our first way of using setters and
we're going to call set name and pass
name inside of it and then we will use
our default name for working with sounds
which is going to be this guy right
there so in this situation it's going to
call set name of course and it's going
to go in there and verify that there are
no numbers inside of the name and so
forth and so on and you can see here is
get name and in here you can see exactly
how we're going to use properties
instead with sound to make sound work as
you can see there's a capital S there
for sound if we want to increment the
number of animals we can command and go
gnome of animals and pass in one meaning
that there's one additional animal and
that one's going to get passed into this
guy down here num of animals this guy
right here and it's going to increment
the value of num of animals and then
we'll come back up inside of here once
again and let's say we want to define a
read-only value like I said before this
value is going to be the same for every
single animal that is created so let's
say I want to have an ID number that is
going to be associated with my animal
shelter I can come in and go
random and generate a random value and
then go ID number is equal to random and
next and let's say I want to generate a
number between 1 and let's use one of
the big giants huge integer numbers so
that we can pretty much guarantee that
it's going to be a pretty big number
whoops change that to a 4 ok and now
that we have defined all these different
guys what we're going to do is jump over
into the program dot CSS file and use
them alright so here we are inside of
main and what we're going to do is we're
going to create a new animal then I'm
going to call it cat is equal to new
animal now if we want to call the setter
for the set name we go caps and we're
going to call set name and we'll give
our animal the name of whiskers we can
then also set a property for cat and how
you do that is go cats and sound is
equal to meow I think you can see why
using a property is better than using
these functions you can just assign the
value ok looks nice and neat
looks good stuff now we can come in and
we can go and output some information
here let's go and output the name and
the sound for there our cat so we can
say the cast is named and pull the name
out of there and says and we can pull
out the sound for that guy also and to
go and get those we can go cat and get
name and that's the function what we
call and then once again we're going to
go cash and to get the sounds using the
property you're going to see that this
is better because it's nice and clean
and let's run it and see what happens
and there it is the cat is named meow
and says meow but what are we doing here
oh I see I forgot to put that in her and
let's Kevin to zero the cat is named
meow and says meow all right now it says
the cat is named whiskers and says meow
all right so good stuff so now what
we're going to do is we're
come in here and work with some of those
other things that we created so let's
say let's go and test our auto-generated
getters and setters so to work with the
owner we're just going to go cat owner
is equal to and we'll just throw Derek
inside of there and now let's go and
output that information so we can say
console and right line and then inside
of here we'll go and get the name so
we'll say like that and then we'll get
the owner for our whiskers animal and
then we'll go cats and get name and then
we will also come in and go cats and get
the owner out of there and while we go
and get our read-only properties and all
our other stuff so to get our read-only
property let's just copy this one we
want to type all that out again we'll
just go paste that inside of there and
we will say something like shelter ID ID
is and then we can come down and leave
this is get name and then if we want to
get the read-only property we can just
go ID numb and remember that ID numb was
a public value that's available to us we
don't have to call function for it and
let's also come in and test our static
property so in this situation we can say
numb of animals let's just put a number
sign inside of there of animals and then
let's output the number of animal
objects that have been created and to do
so you're going to have to call class
because remember static fields belong to
the class and not to the instances or
the objects that are created and to get
that you're going to call num of animals
and we can save that and we can reload
it and you're going to see the cat is
named whiskers and says me out whiskers
owner is Derek you can see we
auto-generated the shelter ID which is
the same for every single object you
ever create and the number of animals is
one we can also come in here and we can
go and create another animal just to
verify that this is going
increment so we can say animal and fox
is equal to new animal and we call our
Fox Oscar and we can go burn for our Fox
and generate that guy and run it and
you're going to see now that the number
of animals is equal to two all right so
that is good stuff there just one to
cover this because it's a C sharp is
slightly different than a lot of other
object-oriented languages in regards to
how many different ways you can work
with setters and getters and how
encapsulation in general works in
encapsulation once again is just a way
to protect our data like we did here
with names saying that the D name cannot
contain a number and that is a whole
bunch of information and in the next
part of the tutorial I am going to cover
polymorphism and all the other little
whiz bangs and regards to how to use
object-oriented programming inside of
c-sharp and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
