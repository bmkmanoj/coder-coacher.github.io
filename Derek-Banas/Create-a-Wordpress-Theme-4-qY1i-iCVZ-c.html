floor of my tutorial on how to create
wordpress themes from scratch so far we
have the blog page all set up looking
real nice and in this part of the
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
make this single dot PHP page for the
wordpress theme I'll linked all the code
and the theme itself is available
underneath this video and I'm also going
to show you how to make page PHP and
search dot PHP because if you would go
to a page and our current theme this is
what it looks like which isn't very nice
but by the end of the tutorial it's
going to look like this so let's get
into the code all right on the left side
of the screen what I have here is all of
the code from the tutorial how to lay
out a website what I simply have to do
is copy all this information from the
left side in the proper way to the right
side of the screen and this is single
dot PHP in our wordpress theme so what
do we got here get header of course
we're going to be able to use no problem
with that and then what we're going to
have to do is put in get sidebar save a
little bit time I'm going to put our
left side bar inside of this if you
didn't watch all the previous tutorials
definitely check those out otherwise you
may be confused now to bring in our
first sidebar we're just going to type
in first and there you are now our first
sidebar is included then what we have to
do is get content column these are all
the divs that surround our information
and put it in the right way and also get
content container which is going to
surround all of the content on the
screen and by content I mean this all
this information that's in the center of
the screen here so let's click here and
paste that inside of there so that looks
perfectly fine and then what this guy
here if half posts what this is saying
is if we have a post to display we're
going to display all the information
that I asked for so I have to put
everything in the proper order
underneath of this guy first thing I'm
going to say is I want to figure out
what to put in the upper right hand
corner here let's zoom in zor so you can
say you can see here this says article
however in other situations it might say
video it's just an added feature i just
threw in there just to have something
different well if I want to figure out
if it's an article or a video I gotta
ask it what category it's in so let's
jump over here and I'm jumping around a
lot if you go inside of wordpress
and go to the categories page which is
underneath of posts and you put your
mouse over top of one of the categories
down in the lower left-hand corner you
might not be able to see it it's down
here whenever I put my mouse there see
if zooming in helps at all and it's
still too small but if you put your
mouse over top of a category it'll show
a number down here it says category am
tag ID equals and in this situation it
says 87 so if i want to check if
something's up video I have to ask it
what category it's in and that's real
simple I'm just going to go PHP and I'm
going to say if and i'm going to type in
in category and i'm going to say 87
because that's the category for my
videos or my articles that are inside of
the video categories and if it is what i
want to do is come over here to div
class content title and i'm going to
copy right up to there and paste in that
information because content title is the
name of the div that surrounds that guy
that just previously showed article and
in this situation if it's in the video
I'm going to say I want to display video
inside of their clothes off mage for
tags real simple clothes off my dev and
I want to come down here again PHP and
I'm going to close off with the curly
brace for this guy right here then I'm
going to say else if it's not in the 87
category or it's not in the video
category I want to print article so
let's just copy this so that we can save
ourselves some time and output a
different div that says article instead
of putting out the other one that's easy
enough and then I just simply have to
come down here and go PHP and put in
another curly brace to close that guy
off that's easy well then let's look
over here again so we see that we have
content article title in this situations
facebook marketing well we're just going
to copy again from the left side of the
screen come in here and paste that
inside of it now inside of wordpress if
you want to get the actual article title
you just call PHP again and you call for
the title and this function is going to
output whatever the title is for the
article and then you just close off your
PHP section again and then you're going
to close off with your tags and close
off the diff so again pretty
straightforward now what do we going to
do well we're going to look over here
and see what we got here so what this is
going to do is it's going
they posted by admin this is just static
so what we want to do is make this
dynamic so how do we do it let's just
coffee this again use it as baseline
we're going to leave posted by inside of
here that's going to be perfectly fine
now inside a wordpress if you want to
get the actual author person that
created this post you go call a function
called article and it automatically
jumps out there and grabs the author of
this for you well then I want to also
put the data in well that means i need
to get rid of all this so let's get rid
of it and inside of wordpress if you
want to get yourself a date you call a
function called the time and then inside
of that just standard getting dates or
whatever just going to type in these
codes right here and that will get you
the date for whenever this post was
created and then in this situation if i
want to get the category it was posted
inside of again i just type in PHP
category is equal to get the category
and what it's going to do is it's going
to pop back every category into this guy
this array here that this post is
currently assigned to what we don't want
all of them we just want the first one
so we're going to go echo category and
if we want the first one in an array we
type in 0 and then i'll give us the
first category its in and from that we
want to get the category name this is
just kind of like window dressing we
don't really care what comes back it's
just like stuff's just there okay and
then we're gonna put a little colon
inside of there and if I want to get the
number of comments well I got to get rid
of this 18 because this is going to be
dynamic type in PHP I'm gonna say no I'm
comments and in WordPress if you want to
get the number of comments that are
currently on a post you type in get
comments number and then we're going to
go echo which is just going to print the
screen the number of comments right like
that and then we can leave comments here
and we can leave everything else exactly
the same so now let's move back over
here let's get this horizontal rule it's
going to go underneath it here paste
that inside of there so I'm just doing a
lot of cutting and pasting and then we
have content for the excerpt we're just
going to copy this beginning part right
here paste that inside of there and then
we can come in here and delete all of
this extraneous information we don't
need because what we have built into
this already is going to grab all the
for the post we can leave all of this
information in here as well as well as
tag or keywords or whatever you want to
call them then when I decided I wanted
to do is actually wonder the comments to
show up inside of this guy so I'm going
to take this I'm going to cut it out of
there and you can do things like this
it's not going to constrain your
WordPress is pretty much allow you to do
ever you want so I want the comments
inside of there instead and then what do
I need to do well I need to close off
this paragraph that I just created so
let's do that and I can say something
like and of an N Go content excerpt
which may help people understand exactly
what you're doing here I don't want this
div inside of here this is going to
allow an administrator that's logged in
or the person that created the post to
be able to edit the entry so we're just
going to leave that inside of there then
this div here is going to close what
well let's look what did is open content
containers open and so is content column
so let's just copy them both copy just
so we can pull them all down here all at
the same time paste that inside of there
then I'm going to say just copy this
copy paste inside of there and I'm going
to say end of content container based
and we can get rid of that div and then
we have to close content column like
that content column paste get rid of
this and you have your end while and if
that means that all the informations
come through in regards to the post we
don't need anymore then I want my second
sidebar to show up so I'm going to come
in here and I'm tyco in seconds so
that's perfect and then I have to close
what's called the content wrapper which
is going to wrap around all of this
information that's displayed on the
screen closed off that div and we're
going to go copy end of content wrapper
and if you don't know what i mean by
content wrapper that is let's jump in
here page see content rapper this is
where it was first created and content
wrapper is this pink area that surrounds
era everything that's on the screen so
that's what it starts after the menu and
goes the whole way down until it comes
to the footer so that's what content
wrapper is just a big giant div jump
back over in a single and let's file
save that guy let's go see what our
results look good and you can see that
everything's lined up here really really
really tight I mean it's looking pretty
good couple little things I don't like
I'd like this to be stretched down the
whole way on the screen
let's go in here and we'll just play
with a couple little things so we're
going to be messing around with the
content part here so let's get rid of
this I wanted to fix that styling issues
i'm going to jump into style I'm going
to bring my whole browser window up here
in this situation so that I can look at
what's going on on the left side of the
screen as I make some changes here so
let's scroll through style dot CSS and
we see here on 10th column and a couple
other things so what do I want to do in
general everything's looking kinda good
margin right I'd like to kind of try to
Center this a little bit better so let's
change this to 3 pixels and we'll change
our margin left as well I'm just going
to copy that and we'll take that too
we'll leave that at three pixels as well
and then to correct this issue where
there's this big block down here I'm
going to make a minimum height of 1000
pixels see what that looks like then I'm
going to make similar changes to content
column when content column surrounds
everything and then content container
surrounds everything else so you can
come down in here and paste those same
changes inside of there and then we're
going to take minimum height and we're
also going to copy it paste it inside
here and let's file save that see how it
works all right looks like I got pretty
much exactly what I wanted except this
is a little bit longer than what i
wanted it originally to be let's just
change it into 995 reload all right okay
that's pretty much a single dot PHP it
everything is lined up real nice there
so what we going to do now is fix page
PHP and this is what page dot PHP
currently looks like so I don't need
this what I do need is page dot PHP and
here it is we're going to be making a
lot of the same changes so just save
ourselves some time will go into single
dot PHP scroll up here alright so we're
going to want all this information it's
the same single dot PHP is for post page
dot PHP is four pages pretty much the
same sort of thing a couple little
changes here and there so after a header
I'm going to put my sidebar in I'm going
to put them all my containers inside of
there jump back into single have post is
going to be the same someone copy all of
this information down to content excerpt
and then here's where the contents
describe copy that jump over into page
so remember between half posts and the
content all right so here's half posts
we want that and we want to delete
everything until we get to content and
we'll paste in what we had from before
again everything's going to be displayed
in the same way a couple
changes here and there for one thing I'm
still going to want to let the video and
article little things show up there i
still of course want to show the title
however categories isn't really going to
make sense for using inside of pages
remember we're in page dot PHP right now
so i'm going to go into this area right
here and i'm going to delete everything
that has to do with categories just
totally delete it go on and while
there's not normally comments on pages i
decided man what the heck just leave it
inside of there it's up to you you don't
want it get rid of it you know totally
and then horizontal rule exactly the
same content excerpt again exactly the
same underneath of this i'm going to
want to move my comments inside of there
again like I did before so take that out
of there so I want my comments to show
up again I need to close off this
paragraph closed off that paragraph and
I can say what the heck I'm us will just
copy it right end of content excerpt
jump back into page left PHP paste that
in there get rid of this D of right here
and then after edit post link again
remember that's for the administrator
the person that made this page can go in
there and edit it I'm going to jump into
single dot PHP and I'm gonna coffee this
actually every single thing on here is
the same so on we just copy you don't
jump under page delete everything their
taste in on our new content so as you
can see it's almost identical so let's
save and there you see our page looks
nice so there you are that's how you fix
up the posts and the pages and then the
next thing I'm going to show you how to
do is to fix up the search so let's just
type in something so you can see
searches all messed up so let's go in
here and fix search dot PHP I'm going to
use the same content column content
container information so I'm going to
jump into single dot PHP start copying
this again so I'm going to copy first
current content / all that stuff copy
jump in search there you are got that in
there then I'm going to use the content
title to show search results on the
screen just because I kind of makes
sense so here's div class content final
we're going to show that on the upper
right hand side of the screen again like
we did here say here i'm going to have
search results instead of article
because that makes more sense to me jump
back in search don't dump it in there
and age for search results those off the
h4
time goes off the div and then what's
really cool here is we don't really have
to change anything because this is
automatically jump out there and get all
our search results and I decided I don't
need pictures on every single thing it
starts to get a little bit repetitive so
basically all I need to do is close off
these divs that I created so against
jump over into single dot PHP come down
here copy this jump back into search dot
PHP come right in here after it says
template nav paste that inside of there
so that closes off both those divs I'm
going to have to get my right sidebar
like I did previously and then n content
container like we did before so how I
get a second side worst I've been second
inside of there and then I have to end
the content rapper excuse copy this
right before footer boy now let's do a
search and there you can see search
results and only one thing came back
let's see if we can get something a
little better here there you go so
there's how the search results pop back
there you are that's how you make single
dot PHP page PHP and search dot PHP and
next part of the tutorial going to show
you how to make archive PHP and 404 dot
PHP leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
