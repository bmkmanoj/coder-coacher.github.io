2 of my UML 2 video tutorial today I'm
going to show you everything there is to
know about activity diagrams so here on
your screen is a giant activity diagram
and I'm going to be zooming in on it if
you can't read it don't worry about that
so you may be asking yourself what
exactly is an activity diagram what just
simply shows what actions occur to
achieve an ultimate goal and activity
diagrams for the most part use symbols
that are very similar to those used in
flowchart notation so if you understand
that you'll have no problem with
activity diagrams so let's just get
right into it I'm gonna describe every
single thing you could ever want to know
about these guys so let's zoom in right
here and this right here well the whole
entire thing from start to finish is
known as the activity flow and this
right here is unknown as a note like you
see right there and it looks like a note
and it is pointing out the beginning of
your activity diagram which is the
initial node which is just a dot arrows
as they point towards an activity or an
action as this is known are known as
incoming edges and arrows that are
leaving those actions are known as
outgoing edges and the flow of your
activity diagram is totally going to be
documented based off of the direction
the arrows are going to be pointing and
as we scroll on down here you can see
all the things that are going on right
here and then we get to something new
this guy right here is known as a merge
and what this does is combines edges
that are separated by a decision so
basically what we're doing here is
setting up a user account system and
here if the user is authorized to use it
it's going to go in this direction and
perform certain actions and if they are
not authorized to set up a new account
they will go down here and we will
reject them and these two things right
here authorized as well as not
authorized are known as guard conditions
and then as you come out of here you can
see that all of these merge back to a
merge triangle or a merge point now
there are other types of merges as you
can see right here and I'll zoom in so
you can see it really well and the tool
that I'm using is UML
let which is a free piece of software
for creating things like this and it's
free and it works on every operating
system so that's why I picked it right
here you can see another merge however
what is going on here is we are
documenting what are known as multiple
actions if you ever want to document
that we are going to be verifying email
verifying password and verifying phone
numbers all at the same time this is
exactly how you do it and in this
situation this is known as a fork and
then whenever we merge back this is
known as a merge and then we can move on
to whatever other actions need to be
performed after these three things are
verified at the same time so that's the
difference between what we showed you
before this guy over here is making a
decision with guard conditions and these
could also be things like X is greater
than or equal to 10 and this could be X
is less than 10 so basically anything
that would calculate out as a true or a
false statement can be used in this type
of merge however these guys are created
to show that three different actions are
going to be occurring at exactly the
same time so hopefully that makes sense
and then we get down into this situation
here this is known as a time event
so basically we're saying after we make
this decision to create the account or
reject the account we are then going to
wait 30 seconds and then we are going to
move on to account information pending
now a time event can be used in another
way actually as an initial note as you
can see right here this is listed as an
initial node and in this situation this
is known as a repeating time event as
this note points out and this whole
entire diagram and everything is
available in a link underneath the video
if you want to use this as a cheat sheet
and basically what we're going to be
doing here is that every 30 seconds we
are going to call for the system to be
updated that is what's going on and this
is just going to be something that just
runs and runs and runs inside of our
activity flow even though it's going to
be separate from our activity flow and
then we come to this little notation
anytime you would like to briefly just
list the name of a certain number of
activities and then document them
somewhere else this is known as a call
tivity node and you will recognize it
just through the use of this upside-down
pitchfork and in this situation you will
see a box somewhere that will have an
initial node as well as a final node and
it will document every action that needs
to occur represented by this little
block here known as update system so
that's something that we'd use whenever
you are kind of limited in regards to
space then if we come over here you're
going to see a whole bunch of new things
first thing I want to talk about is the
object node which is right here this is
account information pending and object
nodes are used to represent data that is
flowing through an activity and an
object node is represented as just a
normal rectangle as you see you're on
the screen in comparison to actions
which are rounded off rectangles and it
is also very common to attach a note to
an object node that is going to document
exactly what information or what exactly
that object represents so in this
situation the note also makes a lot of
sense to hook to any object nodes that
you create then we get into this guy
right here which is what we call an
interruption region and you would use
one of these whenever you want to
demonstrate an activity that can end
before completion of the activity and
you will specifically see that over here
where we see what we have listed here as
an interrupting event so let's say that
the customer comes in here tries to set
up a brand new account and then the user
decides to cancel the account in that
situation you'd put this little
lightning-shaped little arrow over here
and then go directly to account
cancelled which will then eventually
link to the final node that will end the
entire activity flow so anytime you have
an interruption region which surrounds a
block of activity nodes you know that
somewhere inside of there you're going
to find an interruption event which is
represented by this lightning shaped
arrow and then we get to something else
let's say we come to this part of the
activity flow and this is verify account
by phone and you know that you want to
request as much information as humanly
possible that's why we have request
information listed right here and what
we're going to do here is with
little circle with an X inside of it
which is known as the flow final node we
are going to designate that this is
going to be the end of asking for
additional information however it is not
going to be the end of the activity flow
which is only going to be represented
with this final node shape that you see
over here so hopefully that makes sense
basically we're going to come to verify
account by information and then let's
say we want to continue asking them as
many questions as they'll possibly
answer in that situation we're going to
have a flow final node just like you
have right here and we're going to
continue asking them questions over and
over and over again that was the easiest
way for me to figure out how we could
slap that flow final node in there so if
that doesn't make sense leave a comment
below and I'll explain further then we
come to something else let's say that
we're verifying the account information
by phone and the customer complaints
sorry looks like I didn't put customer
inside of there or it messed up whenever
I zoomed in in that situation whenever
we would need to move into another area
where the customer complaint would be
handled we would create what is known as
a partition and you can see here this is
just basic new account registration on
this side and then we have this big
giant thick line here that is going to
be called a partition or it's known as a
partition and on this side is the
complaint department in that situation
we are going to after the customer
complains
pass that over to the complaint
department which might be another piece
of software that we have and the
complaint department is going to handle
those customer complaints also if you do
not want to use partitions you could
also use what are known as annotations
as you can see here I have complaint
department listed between brackets and
in that situation where you don't want
that partition listed but you want to
instead put annotations inside of all
these activity nodes of course you would
be able to do that as well so let's zoom
out here and let me get my bearings so I
know exactly what's going on and
basically we come down inside of this
area which is pretty easy to understand
what we're doing here is just like we
did before where we are passing objects
around we are going to be representing
objects that are going to be passed from
one activity node to another using these
little blocks right here and this is
known as an
checked out put pin and that means that
the object is leaving the receive order
activity and it's going to be moved over
to verify credit card funds activity
this is known as the object output pin
and this is known as the object input
pin and then it will be moved over and
then as we move on we could also
document exactly what part of the object
is being passed from one activity to
another and this is known as a
transformation and yes you normally do
list it as transformation as I have it
on the screen and as you can see right
here receive verification that we can
place this order and send it for
shipment that's exactly the part of the
order that is going to be sent to the
shipping department the order items
specific part is sent to shipping Co
shipping doesn't care at all about the
price of the items then you have these
two guys which I skipped over there for
a second these are known as signals and
this represents interactions with
external sources send signals which is
what this guy is right here is going to
send out to an outside service to verify
the credit card has enough funds to pay
for the order and that data can be a
message or just any type of data that is
being sent to an external source and
here this is going to represent a
receive signal which is going to be
receiving some form of message or data
from an outside source and this guy
basically whenever you hit the verify
credit card funds this is just like
saying pause until we receive a signal
that tells us to move on and actually in
actuality you could start an activity
altogether without an initial node but
instead use a receive signal and
basically all that's going to mean is
this part of your activity is only going
to be triggered whenever it receives a
signal as you can see right here so in
this situation this would be known as
the initial node for this part of the
activity and then once it receives that
signal it would perform certain types of
actions until that part of our activity
flow would come to an end with an ending
node and then finally we're going to
come to the last two parts of an
activity diagram these are known as
connectors this is very very simple
let's say you started out listing a
whole bunch of activities on your piece
of paper and then you get to the right
side
paper and you no longer have any more
space to continue listing nodes very
simply could just draw a circle put a
letter inside of it and then follow up
the activity nodes that need to be
created from there fourth on the left
side of your paper so real simple you're
just connecting one part of your
activity flow to the next and of course
this can be used on any additional pages
that you create and that brings us to
the final part and this is called
expansion regions and these are used to
represent groups of items that need
certain actions to be performed on all
of them so one thing that would make
sense is let's say that we had a whole
list of out of stock items these blocks
right here which are listed as four
blocks but it's not going to represent
four out of stock items this is just the
way that you would draw this is going to
enter in here and then we're going to
contact all of our suppliers for all of
those out of stock items and hopefully
reach some level of resolution in
regards to ordering Newlands or what
have you so there you go that is pretty
much everything you could ever want to
know about activity diagrams like I said
I'm going to take this whole entire jug
undoh thing and a link to this image is
