xml tutorial in which i will completely
cover xml schemas and as well see how
many times I can mispronounce schema a
XML schema is another way you can
represent how an XML document file
defines data elements and attributes
unlike DT DS which are great when you're
mainly working with text elements
schemas work best when you're mainly
working with data elements scheme has
also worked better when you want to be
certain that proper data is entered this
game is defined what type of data each
element attribute can hold for example
with an XML schema you can specify you
only allow a price on that to be of the
form of a certain number of numbers
followed by a decimal and then two
additional also schemas must be located
in a completely separate file outside of
the XML unlike DT DS in that separate
file it defines how the elements and
attributes work together to
diplomatically gameís use their own
defined data types which you can use as
a base to create even more complicated
data types there currently are 47 data
types available at this time I'll list
them here but we'll only cover the most
commonly used in detail and no I'm not
gonna read off this list if you want to
see them specifically you could go to a
new link DICOM or you could pause the
screen and look at them here you could
probably guess what most of them when
you're used for your is a description
for the most commonly used XML schema
data types
any URI you store your own this type of
data type date/time with this data type
you can define exactly how you want date
and time to be represented decimal a
number that includes a decimal point you
can define the number of decimal places
for it in a jar stores a number with a
qaulity decimal point string stores a
collection of characters there are the
different parts of a schema the eskimo
declaration tells the XML interpreter
which version of XML and character
encoding is being used the schema
element alerts the interpreter that this
information is XML schema the element
declaration defines the element you can
see an example here in the attribute
declaration defines an attribute and you
can see how I'm defining that
you hear being back name and stating
that it is a string what you're doing
with these two lines of code is saying
that this document uses XML schema X SD
by the way stands for XML schema
definition and then in the rest of the
schema you now define the elements and
attributes you specify how these things
work together what elements contain
other elements and the attributes of
each element you must define all of your
elements with an element declaration the
element declaration defines the element
name and may be its data type there are
two types of element declarations the
simple type definitions these are
elements that cannot contain any other
elements and cannot include any
attributes complex type definitions on
the other hand declare elements that can
contain other elements and can also take
attribute the following declaration
defines an element that contains date
information here is an example of a
complex and we'll meant being customer
that contains an attribute being last
name of course you can define other
attributes to this complex element I'm
just doing this just so you can shortly
and quickly get the idea of what an
element in XML schema looks like the
content model defines the type of
content that can be contained in an
element and here they are text defines
that the element can contain only text
and here's an example of a text model
empty defines an element that can't
contain text or elements mixed content
models are models in which the element
can contain child elements and text and
an element content moral defines an
element that contains other child
elements and here's an example here you
can see that I'm defining an element
named first name as well as another
element name last name pay specific
attention to the definition I make here
in the third line meaning XS D followed
by the word sequence in the previous
code I used the XS D sequence element to
surround the child elements this will
specify the order of the key information
is entered being first name and then
last name this is referred to as a
compositor element there are three
compositors available to you sequence
use this to make sure all the child
elements are in turn
in a specific order choice this is kind
of like a multiple choice answer use
this if you want one of the child
elements to be picked and all indicates
that any or all of the child elements
may have to an attribute on an element
is declared with just a name and type
like this here I'm defining an attribute
with the name customer ID and I'm
stating that the value associated with
this name customer ID must be a positive
integer you can assign a set of
attributes to more than one element by
creating an attribute group this would
allow you to use the group of attributes
easily you'll have to declare this group
globally at the top of the schema file
though here is how you would define an
attribute group you can see here I'm
defining an attribute group with the
name suffix and then stating that if you
would have these attributes assigned to
it whitespace in your XML file is
normalized based on the value you
declare here is an example of how you
would declare how to handle whitespace
if you assign the value of preserved
your whitespace definition you're
stating that you want all whitespace to
remain completely untouched here are the
other possible values you could assign
to white space replace forces all tabs
line feeds and carriage returns to be
replaced with simple spaces collapse on
the other hand forces all tabs lines
feeds carriage returns and spaces to be
collapsed into just single space you can
create your own data types quite easily
as well here's an example of how you
could define a price data type it would
only allow for a maximum value of
$999.99 because I maxed out the total
digits at five in the total decimal
places at two as you can see here in
this example where I'm using all and
already defined at a time being decimal
and then stating the maximum number of
digits at five in the maximum number of
decimal places at two if you want to
leave notes that provide additional
information on your file annotations
provide that capability if here's an
example here we're on defining an
annotation in which I am stating this is
a list of customers and also stating
what I'm using the language English
you can just think of this as a comment
here we surround the comment with
documentation tags which are surrounded
by annotation tags so what's next what
else can I cover do you want more XML
examples I've covered a HTML CSS
JavaScript SQL PHP off the core unit
programming and now XML in the future I
plan on covering Ajax objective-c iPhone
development Android development
spiders RSS feeds and pretty much
anything else that comes up if you want
to see any other tutorials on any other
web technologies leave them in the
comment section below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
