perfect personality test questions
seminar the most common requests from
you guys out there is for a personality
test that is easy to understand and very
usable and of course free and of course
personal so that your personal
information isn't available out there
online this delivers on all of those
fronts what I've done is I've combined
the myers-briggs kursi and numerous
other tests into one I then got rid of
all the jargon and explained in detailed
reports your gifts your weaknesses why
you disagree with others how to improve
communication with others and much much
more
and on top of that after you take the
test you'll be able to access a
four-page report 100% for free without a
subscription without giving me an email
without giving me anything I hate it
when people make you jump through hoops
to get results I'm going to provide you
simple results that are real quick in
another YouTube video which you can link
to here after you take the test but also
these detailed reports are going to be
available to you hundred-percent for
free because that's what you guys
requested you'll be able to get access
whether you're on my site right now
it'll be right there on the screen if
you're seeing this on YouTube
this answer key you can either make it
up yourself or there's a link to it in
the underbar that you can print it out
and use it right in front of you so it's
100% personal so you can be 100% honest
and nobody will see your results how you
score yourself is all the questions are
going to be labeled one two three four
you're going to answer those questions
either A or B onwards here and onwards
here then after you're done with that
you're going to add up all your results
and if you score Moraes you're going to
mark an e down here is your personality
type if you score more bees you're going
to mark an eye this gets a little bit
more complicated you're going to tally
all the A's in this column and all the
A's in this column and if you have mores
than bees you're going to put an X here
in the S or in the N so that's how
you're going to completely be able to
score yourself and now on to the
questionnaire answer all these questions
I'm going to try to time these screens
so that they'll be on there long enough
for you to answer them if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
section below but I'm not going to ask
you all these questions because I
thought that'd be irritating just answer
the questions as quickly as humanly
possible
to get the best results don't think too
much about your answers
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
okay that should be enough time for you
to answer all the questions now you can
click on the link on this screen to see
your results or click in the underbar
now that you know what your personality
is and go and directly get your full
report if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
