beat c5 I got my map
there's my I went and made those because
it seems to help me a little bit in
solving these puzzles and I'm going into
it
skipping the console for now and let's
just go here want to let you guys know
because you are the best fans I got I
mean that's who shows up for these
things
um I'm tomorrow I'm uploading a
programming video and then I'm going to
take a break for a little bit and not
upload any videos because since January
I have been making six videos a week and
I'm kind of burnt out I need to take a
break for a little bit so just want to
let you guys know I'm not quitting I'm
just taking a little bit of a break so I
don't have a mental breakdown okay so
let's see
the thumbnail for the video is wrong
yeah YouTube but messed up all the
thumbnails I don't know why I went and
fixed a couple of them that were obvious
and then I I'm just looking around here
and then I figured some other ones are
wrong I don't know what did it say why
am i eating this that's that's YouTube's
favorite thumbnail for me for some
reason they randomly put that thumbnail
on other videos I don't know what's
going on with them anymore
they drop me nuts alright did you do you
so what am I gonna need to do and
probably there's only no that almost
always means well maybe not up yep that
almost always means I need to shoot
something through the window obviously
and there are prisms here I don't see
any fans so that probably means the
boxes are here only for that I have
never once had a puzzle that had a
recording thing in it that didn't use it
let's just use this over here okay
there's a power okay so I know the goal
the goal is to use the recorder I'm
guessing - I'm kissing use the recorder
to bring the robot in here and connect
that blue to that blue and then maybe in
some way am I going to be able to get
the box in here don't know
I am a private consultant that's what I
do for a living I mainly make shopping
carts and I'll get a shirt that says
that is not I'm not goofing on you but
that is the most common question that I
get and I make apps for small businesses
I get asked that constantly it's cool
I'm sure it's I don't I don't I'm not
popular enough on YouTube to do this for
a living so wish it was I would be
really cool but I am not actually my
income goes down having coming up it
just fantastic especially right after I
invested all kinds of money into all
kinds of new equipment to make better
better videos my income went down so
it's like whoops
I don't sup mistake hey what are you
gonna do Linux versus windows versus
Mac's I choose all three I'd old boot a
Macintosh computer that has Windows 10
and Ubuntu on it I am not I'm not one of
those people that has favorites I use
each for what they're best for Mac's are
particularly good at video editing
mmm-hmm we're gonna hit my map trying to
figure out what I want to do here hmm
these puzzles get extremely complicated
the longer you play them
hmm sorry it's taking me a while to wrap
my head around this
okay I'm thinking I have to figure out a
way to get my replicated robot body in
here to get this prism to connect to
this okay so one way to make sure it's
connected it is
then but if I put this here this is a
he's puzzle to get ridiculous I'm
getting near the end there's no way of
doing that there's no fan
all right I'm going to walk around with
the robot and see if I can figure this
out
all right so record let's try to get
this I know what I need to do I just
have to work this out through my brain
because it is okay so this is going here
yep the window there's a window and okay
so that connects to that
and then I'm going to need something
that's going to allow me to get through
here
maybe I'm just going to wait here see if
this works let's say
okay
hmm
this works yeah okay oh oh wait a minute
okay I got to do that
grab that um grab oh crap I don't think
I did it oh wait a minute maybe I did do
it right
now I don't think this is going to work
witness
is that right to do it yeah baby whoo
that was a little bit hard to wrap your
head around on it Wow okay so I got one
ah this game takes a lot out of you
all right I'm playing the Talos
principle and this is in my opinion the
hardest puzzle game and I beat the
witness which is often considered the
hardest puzzle game so that's what's up
with that okay that's a box in there and
you just go around trying to figure out
how to do numerous different things to
get a little gem like I just got let's
put that there
that seems obvious okay there's a box
let's just put it here because I have no
idea what to do with it
hmm
so the dumbwaiter is what this is called
mm all right well let's go run around
see what's on here okay there's this guy
and this is it keeping me from getting
anything in there and here's a fan I'm
guessing I somehow need to get inside of
there with a box
sorry I'm not talking more I just very
hard
so anywhere else to put a box oh there's
another fan and there's this okay so
what I need to do is get from there to
over here actually I need to get to this
blue right here from there but there's a
board so I'm guessing put a box and a
prism on top of the fan activate the fan
so that it blows the box and a prism up
and then connect to it now figure out
how to do that not the easiest thing
well I'm going to need to get a box and
put it on a fan or did I do that already
I didn't put it on this
okay so put a box on the fan because
there's no other way for me to get a fan
in there
or get a box in there
I guess I need to do this also put the
other box here
I need to activate so I only have one
prism Oh
I can do this
so get part of that and power to that
there we are
oh okay so blue the Box up how does that
help me though because I need to be able
to
this fan isn't here to be removed is it
oh I can't remove it that's the first
I'm supposed to jump on this maybe
wonder if I can jump on that and get
into let's try it can I get in there
and then there's no way to grab the box
let's just do it just to suit I can't
even do it all right so that doesn't
even work
whoa oh now I miss the box of
come on now
hmm Oh can't go that way
what happened in the box oh there it is
I can yeah alright I'm resetting because
I have a feeling that I messed this up
let's see if I messed it up or not okay
reset all right reset it okay so get
this sometimes we make mistakes and the
best way to combat that is just to reset
the whole thing
I don't need that anymore let's try this
one and that one okay so now that that's
up there
No
maybe the whole point of this isn't to
do that but instead to get this and put
this over air
there's no other prism anywhere hidden
is there not that I saw
it's as fan 4 can't figure that one out
hmm
alright let's put this here maybe grab
the other one
put it up on top of here I can see the
top of the box
I don't think I want this here anymore
because I don't want that bellowing
there's no reason for it let me just see
what's going on here okay so that opens
that up
Wow
can I say
know that it reaches oh well maybe I can
jump all right put that there put that
there and then work did it
yes Wow all right another one down wow
these are a little bit goofy what's up
next they are this way right this is
mainly I
reason I say that is every time I ever
do that people always ask me what's what
I'm eating so all right so let's see
there's a box there is a red thing let's
see if there's anything in here no power
source oh there's a recording thing
there's a fan and there's a box that
almost always means that I need to put
the thing on the fan and get it to work
that way let's see if that works that
way yes because this is blocked up
there's a prism there's nothing else in
here look I thought I saw a prism for a
second
all right so I'm guessing I need to get
this out of here put this on the Box on
the fan and that will probably it wait a
minute now let's get this it's just a
verify couple things here this I know
that's gonna make the fan work but I'm
just making a hundred percent certain
okay that's definitely what it does okay
so now got now that I have everything
that I I need let's figure it out
where's this box going to go I have to
do a recording and wait a minute and the
recordings going to sort of messing me
up starting to think the recording means
that I am NOT going to need to put the
Box on top of the or the prism on top of
the box
let's try the fan because that normally
works
okay the fan and this can shoot over top
of that I believe let's try it out
no it's not gonna be able to but if I do
a recording it will
hmm
this was a little ridiculous sort of
things my heart
okay I know why you guys picked this
game you like to watch me struggle
through things and this one is I don't
know why this little I'm almost tempted
to leave this and try the other one and
come back because it's really messing
with my brain right now but I'm going to
try to figure it out
I can't make fly because that's the
power source so I only have one box and
I only and the power sources in there so
can't do that what is my favorite
programming language fun programming
languages program with I'm really liking
c-sharp for the last year and a half
I've really loved C short it's been my
favorite time flies
this is time flies right
yes so that means this box has to fly
yes I know that I need to do a record
and and do that I'm just trying to wrap
my head around it because it's everyone
so while one of these puzzles really
really messes with my brain and it's
ridiculously hard so I'm just trying to
wrap my head around it just by staring
at it and looking this little map that I
drew hopefully I can figure it out
somehow if you want to see the map I
have here is say that's time plus whoops
you came and see it you see it there it
is I don't know why but writings just a
little diagram on a piece of paper
really helps me solve these puzzles
yes I have children ones for the other
ones eight
now if I could figure out
wonder if I could connect all of these
guys I think I might be able to okay
there's that one there's this one
there's not any windows though No
so that means I'd have to put the Box on
there so let's try that
I think that's what I want to do all
right I'm gonna try this I'm going to go
deport and my whole purpose is to just
stand here so one two three four five
six seven
okay and then I'm going to do this and
then I'm going to run around and try to
connect all of these so connect that
connect that can I run quick enough
that and then run back crap I didn't do
it long enough well that won't work and
there's a hit that's funny they put the
ladder there they were expecting me to
mess up I think that's what I need to do
yeah I have a patreon pitch it's alright
definitely not getting rich off of it
but it's it's nice I don't talk about it
anymore when I first did it I talked
about it a little bit but now I haven't
even mentioned it for a long time okay
so
you
I think that what I was thinking is what
I want to do I'm gonna try doing what I
did before I just need to step on this
longer okay so one two three four five
six seven
all right is that long enough let's say
hopefully okay so grab that red red stay
on there red run back here hopefully
whoops I it's gonna live it back
I wish it would stick I think that's
what I was supposed to do I'm even onna
there's something I'm supposed to do
with the other p1
let's try that I think I'm like I don't
know I just have a feeling that this is
the right thing to do let's try it again
yeah everybody seems to like random
livestream Friday and make her Monday I
have a blast doing those videos they are
a lot of fun to do especially yesterday
was a lot of fun
they've all been fun
it's nice to mix it up because I when I
first started my youtube channel I used
to do all kinds of fun videos like all
the time and then I sort of that kind of
work that's connected to that that's
connected to that and that's connected
to that now I want to try and power with
the other thing whenever I first started
my youtube channel I used to do all
kinds of videos not just programming
videos and then for awhile I got into
this mode where all I was doing was
programming videos and it was just like
you know I want to go back to were doing
videos the way I used to do it which was
you know mixing things up and doing
different things all the time and so
that's what I'm doing now and I'm making
more programming videos than I ever have
I make like an hour to an hour and a
half of programming content every week
so people that think I'm not making
programming videos anymore or not paying
attention
i I would like to satisfy you by making
more programming videos but seriously an
hour to an hour and a half of
programming videos a week is that the
most I can do I'm sorry it's just not
possible for me to do more and
sorry I'm not talking more this is just
this level it's just ridiculously hard
for me I don't know why
you
you're very welcome Linux
you
yes I used to make all kinds of
psychology videos and marketing videos
and sales videos of dieting videos and I
just got away from that and I don't want
to do dieting vide and I don't want to
do those videos anymore that I did but I
want to do new videos it's fun different
I don't know guys I'm about ready to
give up on this level cuz its melting my
brain I'm gonna try one more thing here
and then see
okay let's record Can I grab that yes I
can
let's put it here and then let's grab
that and let's do this and this and drop
it and then stand here and I think
that'll go up in the air and then I can
run through this and get it
I think all right let's try
okay so that's still there this is going
to activate that think yes it was
working and then run I think I dark I
think I did it did get that Dinka Dinka
Dinka did it think it did it think it
did it did I do it or did I not do it no
I didn't do it what are you wrong why is
it going up and down why is it going up
and down why's it going up and down
let's go back and figure it out okay it
was going up and down
you know what I haven't played that many
games until I started doing this I
thought disappeared to be honest with
you I thought doing a live stream would
be a nice excuse to make a different
type of video and also give myself an
excuse to believe it again the only time
the only time outside of this that I
ever play video games is when I play
things with my kids so my kids like wow
they like their dumb games and they like
playing board games with me so that's
what we normally play
now I'm not a big fan of persona 5 and
games like that ah that's how I messed
up okay
thank you for that tip you are I bet you
correct
okay so put this here and then go and
grab the copy of that and then connect
that and then connect that and then drop
it and then stand on this and wait I
think I got it how can you be as
cheerful and optimistic as I am I'm
light I'm I can't say that I was always
like this I mean everybody has down
times in life I've had some down times
in life but let me tell you I I've had
some down times so bad that I don't even
want to bring them up um I don't know
you just every day gets better no matter
how bad things are things you get better
promise you
I mean if you don't give up definitely
things will always get better yeah and I
know that sounds like that's not true
but everybody that I have known that's
the way it was think that'll work I
think I did it did I do it that time I
hope so yes I did it get out of here
before this closest and traps me in
there forever
yes huh I was all relief okay so how
many more left one more I'm gonna try to
it okay one more what's this one called
up close and jammed yes Thank You Nico I
don't know why just that puzzle was just
messing with my head okay so there is a
robot here that's going to blow up if I
try to grab that jammer can i well
there's no other use for the stuff I
can't do anything without the jammer
basically I wonder if I jump on this box
if I can get it
I know
uh didn't work somebody had just asked
what's my opinion on dual nozzle 3d
printers I don't think they're worth it
I think that trying to print with
multiple colors always looks bad I did
maybe there's a 3d printer out there
that can do it I've never seen that 3d
printer so I might be completely wrong
maybe there is a multi-coloured 3d
printer out there that works good but
I've never seen it and I asked my wife
about it and she's worked in the
industrial design at a high level and
she told me she's never seen even a
commercial printer I can't reach it from
there
I was just wondering maybe I could
distract it or something oh I think it
worked I was talking ready to give up
all right cool
all right great so that work now what
well there's a prism okay
there's a robot who there's two guns
there's a gun there and there's another
gun I think back there and there's a fan
how can I get back there oh there's the
power source over there what's back here
on the robot or something nope
alright there's boxes and prisms and
fans but how can I get this open
oops watch out I'm gonna get blown up
there's no way of opening this yes sir
there's no way to open that door except
with a jammer I like games I just I
don't really have time to do them
this is literally the only diamond doing
it and I've convinced myself that it's
okay for me to play
I came with YouTube so I just how my
brain works so yeah oh boy this was
confusing too if I I can't run in there
cuz I will get shot
look there's is if I step past there I'm
gonna die
um oh well okay well there's a prism
okay so I have another prism the power
source is there it's a fan there for
what do I did enjoy most in life
spending time with my kids and my wife
need a box to block the bomber but and
if I try to go in there I'm gonna get
shot
see that's my major problem I don't see
how I can get in there like if I jumped
on the robots head I'm gonna get shot
and I think there's another gun over
here that's hidden so there's two guns
there's a fan a robot and there's the
power source is it possible okay so I
have one prism and I have time any bomb
I do a box I'm sorry yes I have two
boxes I'll go away there's nothing in
this room of use so I'm not going to
there's nothing to do in there so I'm
going to take the boxes in there's no
way of getting the jammer though that I
can see so the main problem here is
figuring out how to get a prism in there
I guess I could put a prism on the
robots head
would that work
well let's try this and I don't know
what's in here is the sigil on the other
side yes it is okay so that's what we
got to do um I'm just gonna set this
here and fan
now you can't hide behind the boxes at
least I don't think you can I've tried
that before I'm positive okay there's a
box on it is that going to be high
enough do I have any use for the other
box I don't think I do let's try it try
my theory out
oops can I not put two boxes because the
prisms not going to be high enough it's
only temporarily going to open but I
really don't see any other way of doing
this yes okay so now I'm going to go and
I'm gonna get this it's going to leak it
temporarily going to work I think
is that gonna work bro no no no no yes
it worked
yeah baby I did it I Pete C 5 C 5 is
dead awesome
yep dun dun dun dun beat it
alright let's run over so what's going
on with the console see if there's
anything useful in here console that's
just those things again um I thought I
saw another console or something in here
didn't I see time machine or something
what's the set I keep trying to imagine
all this is designed for some person
purpose not just the challenges but ELA
him the terminals the glitches and all
the puzzle isn't before our eyes it's
behind them
hmm I thought there was something hidden
doesn't look like it
edy sssss thought I saw the Sun Corner
Maya let's just tell those things again
hmm
cow stinks I like fighting with the
robot dude alright guys well I guess
that's it unless I see something else
here no don't say anything this is an
enclosed world yeah nothing's hidden or
anything all right cool
beat c5 awesome better than I would have
thought I could have possibly done and I
just want to let you guys know tomorrow
I will upgrade a update or upload geez
oh man my brains fried after I play this
game it just totally destroys it
tomorrow I will upload a learn Swift
version flurry in one video it's
probably gonna be a little bit later in
the day like closer in the afternoon
because I have work stuff I have to do
and then I am probably not going to make
any videos for like a week and a half
because I've been making six videos a
week for since January first maybe even
before then I'm a little bit burnt out
so I do need to take a break
and when I start doing videos again I'm
going to stick to them esteemed format
I'm gonna do maker Monday because
everybody seemed to love that and I
loved making it so yes maker Monday on
Monday and my programming videos are
going to be unity so game programming is
going to start maker Monday I'm probably
going to do some blender stuff but I'm
also going to do some making other
random things random livestream Friday
is going to be random livestream Friday
I'm going to continue playing this game
until I beat it so if you guys won't
want to see me play some other game
leave me a comment below so yeah
tomorrow will be the last video for a
little bit and when I come back we'll
have unity will have maker Monday we'll
have random livestream Friday we will
have game
videos blender videos 3 modeling videos
if you're wondering a blender is no I'm
not gonna sit there and blend food no
blender 3d modeling Arduino more 3d
printing things more painting things
because you guys seem to like that you
know like model painting and things and
games and a bunch of other different
things so someone let you guys know
because you are my biggest fans and I
mean that so ahh like always I always
hang around talking to chat if you guys
