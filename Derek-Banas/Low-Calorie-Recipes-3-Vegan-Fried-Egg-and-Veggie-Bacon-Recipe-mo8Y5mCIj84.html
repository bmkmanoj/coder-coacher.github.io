3 of my low-calorie recipes tutorial
today I'm going to show you how to make
bacon fried eggs barbecue tofu and mac
and cheese and the calories are low but
the tastes are great so let's get into
it in my first video I'm going to show
you how to make a veggie fried egg that
tastes exactly like an egg and has zero
cholesterol versus the normal 212
milligrams then we're gonna make veggie
bacon as well as veggie barbecued tofu
and the numbers pretty much speak for
themselves my version is considerably
healthier and tastes very much like
bacon and then I'm gonna show you how to
make a ridiculously low calorie cheese
as well as probably the lowest
conceivable calorie to mac and cheese
ever so let's do it alright first thing
I'm gonna do I'm gonna get myself some
sea salt I'm gonna put it in a mortar
and pestle I'm gonna mash it up you can
use regular so if you don't want to this
is just for seasoning the egg so it's
not that particular then you're gonna
get yourself the vague seasoning which
is absolutely amazing it will make egg
yolks and you will not be able to tell
the difference you're gonna take one
teaspoon of the Vague seasoning and
you're gonna put it in a little mini
blender and then to that you're gonna
add 1/4 cup of water and you're gonna
blend for 15 seconds and it is done you
can add a little bit of cornstarch to
make it thicker then you're gonna get
yourself some extra firm tofu and you're
just gonna cut out whatever the
thickness of the egg is that you prefer
and I used a jar right here and you
could use a cookie cutter to make a
circle for it and then I used another
small cookie cutter and this is
basically just as a guide and I pressed
it lightly and definitely don't go the
whole way through and then you want to
spin around that and make a little well
in the tofu where your yoke is gonna go
then you're gonna get some I can't
believe it's not butter or other similar
thing and I just sprayed in five little
sprays of that in a pan on high then I
added some salt to the tofu as well as
some ground black peppercorn and you
just basically just season it like an
egg and you're basically just gonna flip
it for like three minutes and then
whenever you have a side that has been
completely cooked you want to get a
little bit of that vague seasoning and
just put a couple little pinches of it
on it I then took the vague yolk and
microwaved it for 25 seconds
poured it right inside of there and let
it sit here for like 20 seconds and
plate it and here it is all finished up
with the bacon so let's make the bacon
now the very first thing I'm gonna make
is actually the barbecued tofu and I'm
gonna use two 14 ounce packages of extra
firm tofu I'm gonna take them put them
on a cookie sheet on top of a towel and
then I'm gonna get myself another towel
put that on top of that and then I'm
gonna put everything heavy in my kitchen
on top of the tofu and let it sit for
one hour or overnight after an hour or
more I'm gonna take the cookie sheet and
a towel off of there and you're gonna
see that a lot of the moisture is gone
and now it is going to be time to make
the marinade for something to add a half
of a cup of water and then I'm gonna get
myself one tablespoon of sesame oil and
that's the only way we're going to be
adding and then I'm gonna get myself six
tablespoons of whatever your favorite
barbecue sauce is I use the low calorie
of course and the good thing about
putting the oil in the measuring spoon
first is everything else comes out real
easy now you're gonna add yourself four
tablespoons of either liquid aminos or
soy sauce whatever you have on hand is
fine you're gonna need to get yourself
six tablespoons of sugar free syrup I
actually prefer Vermont sugar-free syrup
but this version right here is perfectly
fine then I'm gonna add four tablespoons
of Dijon mustard you don't need to use
Grey Poupon of course and then I'm gonna
get myself two tablespoons of honey and
then I'm gonna get myself one tablespoon
of lime juice and then the final
ingredient is one tablespoon of white
miso paste and then I'm gonna stir
everything until it's completely
combined now it's time to get the tofu
I'm gonna cut it into eighths in this
situation but if you want it to be very
crispy you should cut it into sixteenths
and then I'm gonna put it in a bowl and
then get the marinade and pour it over
and after allowing the tofu to marinade
overnight or for at least an hour you're
gonna get yourself some wood chips and
just get enough to fill the bottom of
the pan and then to your pan you're
gonna add two cups of water and then
you're gonna get yourself a wire rack
and put that on top of the wood chips
you're then gonna pre-heat your oven to
280 degrees Fahrenheit put the slices of
marinated tofu on the rack and then
you're going to cover this with two
layers of aluminum foil you're gonna
cook
and then in the oven for 45 minutes
you're then going to remove the aluminum
foil and then turn your temperature up
to 375 degrees and cook for 20 minutes
for each side of the tofu and this is
what it looks like okay so now we have
barbecue tofu which is delicious in its
own right but now we're gonna turn it
into veggie bacon we're going to add two
tablespoons of water to make a marinade
and then we're gonna add two tablespoons
of sugar free maple syrup to make it
extra smoky like bacon we're gonna add
one half of a teaspoon of liquid smoke
then we're gonna add four tablespoons of
either Liquid aminos or soy sauce
depending upon whatever you prefer and
to finish it off we're gonna add one
tablespoon of onion powder as well as
one tablespoon of garlic powder and then
finally we're gonna add in nutritional
yeast and I like to put in right around
2 tablespoons then you're gonna take
your marinade and of course start that
up all nice and if you want this to be
extra crunchy this is your last
opportunity to cut this tofu in half
lengthwise to make it really really
crunchy pour your marinade over top of
your tofu and then in a pan just spray a
little tiny bit of canola oil on it and
pre-heat your oven for 375 you're going
to cook your tofu for 15 minutes per
side until you're happy with the texture
once again you can cook it for 5 minutes
per side under a broiler to make it
extra extra crunchy and there you go now
you can make veggie bacon all on your
own okay now I'm gonna make a low
calorie cheese that comes out to 50
calories for 1/4 of a cup and I'm gonna
start off with a quarter cup of raw
cashews and then I'm gonna get myself
one cup of cooked mashed butternut
squash and add that to a blender and
this is basically what it needs to look
like when it's all blended together and
then I'm gonna get myself 3/4 of a cup
of water and then add that into it and
then we're going to get ourselves one
half of an onion split it in half
put it in the blender as well and each
time I add an item to the blender I
basically count to five and then add the
next one to make sure everything is
mixed really well and then I'm going to
get either three fourths of a cup of no
fat yogurt or non-dairy yogurt and add
that to the blender and max I'm gonna
get myself five tablespoons of
nutritional yeast and add that in there
and then we're also going to get myself
some tapioca flour and that's gonna
thicken everything up I need three
tablespoons of tapioca flour and then
I'm going to be adding in some red
pepper roasted red pepper
feel free to roast your own pepper and
then what you're gonna do is until it
tastes perfect for you you're gonna add
little bits of either roasted red pepper
nutritional yeast yogurt or salt I
actually added an extra tablespoon of
nutritional yeast as well as a half of a
teaspoon of salt now you can either add
that cheese to regular noodles or you
can be crazy like me and add it to tofu
shirataki which comes out this entire
package 240 calories and as you can see
almost no carbs and also has some fiber
so really good stuff to make tofu
shirataki noodles basically you just
have to pour them into a pot and drain
them off and then rinse them off with
water and they have a slight smell like
shrimp I mean you basically have to
stick your nose right on top of them and
but you can wash all that smell away and
then you need to pat dry all of the
noodles with paper towels and then after
you have them really nice and dried out
you're gonna want to put them in a
microwave remember drying with paper
towels then put them into microwave and
microwave on HIGH for one minute and
there I am just making my cheese sauce I
basically cook that in a pot for five
minutes and then I'm gonna add the
noodles and add 1/4 of a cup of the
cheese mixture and I am done I hope you
