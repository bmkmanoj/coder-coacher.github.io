going to explain exactly how people make
decisions and I'm going to do that by
analyzing what is called meta
programming which is based off of a
branch of psychology called neuro
linguistic programming more specifically
we're going to cover how people make
decisions develop preferences focus
attention communicate and work well and
this presentation is brought to you
because I received this request from
John for 29 1 30 first I want to review
metaprogramming if you didn't watch the
first part of the decision making
tutorial you should most definitely
watch it but because it's been a couple
weeks since I created that I'm going to
briefly go over what meta programming is
meta programming is the programming in
your brain that you use to react in all
situations when we experience anything
in life we ignore and generalize most of
the information info we do store is used
to react in future situations or meta
programs help us to use past info we
gather to make quick decisions
immediately meta programming for example
helps a person reason gather information
decide on preferences deal with stress
emote and make decisions which pretty
much and capsule it's a lot of the
things that lie there above it the
information we store in our mind is
heavily reliant on one of three main
senses being either visual auditory or
touch or feeling touch her feeling or
pretty much the same sort of thing if
you're talking to someone they will
better understand you and make better
decisions based off of whether the
information is provided in their favored
sense the sense that they favor is known
as their chosen representational system
for example visuals we'll talk about
color location distance size and
brightness the reason why is all of
their information or a large amount of
it is stored in their brains in the form
of pictures they literally ricci what
happened for a split second right before
they make a decision hence the other
ones might remember something they were
told or actually reenact a whole entire
event over and over
again those are your feeling or touch or
kinesthetic if you want to use the
jargon term type of people what's
covered in this video well when I'm
going to cover how we input process and
output information based on emotions how
we decide develop preferences and focus
attention what I'll do is I'll provide
my chosen way of making each of these
decisions I'll then go over the other
ways that people use to make decisions
the tools or the programs in their brain
that help them make decisions and then
I'll teach you the questions to ask to
find out how exactly that person makes
decisions and of course you can use
these same questions to figure out how
you make decisions and I want to
emphasize that there is no right nor
wrong way to make these decisions or to
see the world in your specific way
everybody's different and these are just
different ways that we differ first I'm
going to go over the stress coping style
this is just simply how we cope with
stress people are either assertive
aggressive or passive I prefer the
assertive coping style in that when I'm
put in a stressful situation I try to
figure out how I can change myself to
reduce the stress level other coping
styles include the fight being the
aggressive or the flight being the
passives an aggressive person will
confront that which is causing stress
while a passive person will do whatever
they can to get away from the stress
nobody is purely aggressive or passive
in all situations but each person will
show a preference over time and if you
want to find out what they are just ask
what do you do when you are put in a
stressful situation by someone if you
confront them avoid them or think about
how you could change to subdue the
stress level or you could ask if
something is creating stress in your
life do you avoid it confront it or
spend time figuring out how to subside
the stress then you have the authority
style meaning what authority governs a
person's decision making I very strongly
make decisions based off of my own
internal values meaning that I'm
self-referring others rely heavily on
the general values of society as a whole
they believe everyone should follow a
very strict set of rules and live in a
world of shoulds and should not if you
want to find out what somebody is just
ask them or your values based off of
your own rules or those general rules be
they societal or biblical or more simple
when making decisions do you trust your
gut or do you
think about how people may judge your
decisions then you have the emotional
state beaning are you more of a thinking
person or a feeling person again there
are no right or wrong I process data by
thinking my way through it meaning I'm
a-thinking type emotional person other
people process data by completely
immersing themselves emotionally they
see the world as a whole while ignoring
the minor details thinking type people
see the details but miss the emotional
impact of situations if you want to find
out what someone is just ask them when
making a decision do you rely on facts
or personal values or when deciding on
something do you base decisions on facts
presented on your gut then you have
activity level response styles meaning a
person is either inactive reflective or
active I act quickly when put in most
situations I try to solve problems
rather than reflect on the relevant and
in relevant information this makes me a
reflective type person others do not
seem to who engage information
processing unless they are forced these
are your inactives you want to find out
what you're dealing with just ask do you
tend to enjoy getting something done
spending time to get it done with the
best results or avoid it if it isn't
worth your time or you could say if you
study something for a long time before
acting get the general idea and then act
or you just wait until things work
themselves out now we'll get into the
convincing style meaning how long it
takes for someone to be convinced of
something and we're going to talk a lot
about representational systems and how
they can help convince a person to
believe what you want them to believe
people are either difficulty events are
easy to convince it's really quite
simple I require a large amount of
convincing before I will believe
something is true other people are
convinced normally based on just whether
something is sold targeting their chosen
representational system there's
representational system if it is used in
trying to persuade them will make things
sound more believable this is what
someone means when they say that sounds
believable that is a auditory person
saying you are speaking in my
representational system that's why they
say that sounds believable a kinesthetic
or a feeling or touch type person would
say something like that feels right why
a visual would say something like that
looks right people differ in regards to
how many times something must gel with
the representational system before they
make decisions as well for some people
something must feel right meaning
kinesthetic in their chosen system when
I keep referring to kinesthetic that's
the same as touching or feeling type
people other people require it to sound
right many times before they make a
decision most people make decisions
based off of visuals so if you want to
just pretty much cut to the chase talk
in visuals to get people to understand
you or to believe what you're telling
them is true that they make up 50 to 75
percent of the population 1535 are sound
right type people these are people that
think in what they have been told in the
past and twelve to fifteen percent of
people are feeling type people to find
out how many times someone needs
convinced just ask them how many times
does something have to prove itself
before you are convinced or how many
times do you need to see here read or do
something before you think you are
competent in using it eight to ten
percent of people assume something will
be right for them they just these are
the easy sales they just say yeah you're
probably right fifty percent of people
can be persuaded to believe anything if
you just present believable information
in their chosen representational system
enough times and I told you before how
to figure out what is enough times other
people twenty-five percent of society
make decisions purely based on their own
personal time requirements being met
once they feel that they have thought
about something long enough they make a
decision if someone says they'll get
back to you in three months they
normally mean dramatically less than
that if you contact them say in three
weeks and reference that it feels like
three months they will probably agree
with you and then make a decision
fifteen percent of people are almost
never convinced of almost anything these
are the people that go through life
mistrusting most people the only way to
try and convince these people is to tell
them straight up that you're aware that
they are a person that is very hard to
convince and that no time will probably
feel like the right time to try
something different so why don't they
just give it a try today then you have
your emotional Direction type people
meaning how much impact emotion has on a
person's life whether emotions are
pervasive and on
my emotions are definitely non pervasive
i'm happy about some things and unhappy
about other things at the same time
person that has pervasive emotions will
be either unhappy about everything or on
cloud line about everything if you want
to find out what type of person you're
dealing with just ask in general when
you're happy about one thing does that
naturally make you happy about
everything or when in conversation is it
natural for you to switch from things
you're happy to talk about two things
that you're unhappy to talk about then
you have emotional intensity in general
I am more bold than timid I enjoy the
limelight attention and will risk
putting others off by giving my point of
view obviously others cling to that
which is certain avoid risks and enjoy
routines if you want to find out who
you're dealing with just asked you enjoy
more routine or change in life or do you
enjoy doing that which you know you can
do or trying things that are different
that you may fail that in the next
presentation I'm going to cover how we
decide develop preferences and focus
attention if there was anything that you
didn't quite get in this presentation
leave a comment below and I'll do my
best to explain it till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
