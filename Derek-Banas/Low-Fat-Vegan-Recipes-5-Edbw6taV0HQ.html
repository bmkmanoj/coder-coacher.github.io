make two different types of cheese sauce
a really creamy mac and cheese and a
Portobello Philly cheesesteak and what
I'm going to start off here is the very
very simple vegan cheese recipe I'm
going to start off with one cup of
veggie stock and then we're going to get
ourselves two tablespoons of lemon juice
to that I'm gonna add one fourth of a
cup of drained canned pimento peppers
and you can get those in most grocery
stores and then to that we're going to
have some raw almonds that I soaked
overnight and that's going to be
two-thirds of a cup of that and I'm
going to throw those in there you can
either use sliced or just regular once
and then we're going to get ourselves
one-and-a-quarter teaspoons of onion
powder and then the finish this off
we'll add one fourth a cup of
nutritional yeast and then to that we'll
add two teaspoons of salt and of course
we're going to blend this all up and you
can see it is very very easy to make but
it wasn't quite as creamy as I would
prefer so what I'm going to do next is
show you a creamy version of this cheese
sauce that is also a lot healthier and
we'll start off by boiling some hot
water and then I'm going to add one
fourth a cup of diced carrots and one
half of a cup of diced onions and then
I'm we're going to get one cup of cubed
skin potatoes I have a little bit more
than a cup but that's perfectly fine and
we're going to boil that until
everything is nice and tender this is
actually a failed potato soup recipe
that ended up being a dream come true
because this is absolutely amazing one
of my favorite things ever so we're
going to add our veggies then we're
gonna get ourselves a half cup of
cashews that we soaked overnight and
we're going to add those also to the
blender and then we're going to get
ourselves some nutritional yeast again
and we're going to use a lot less
nutritional yeast i'm going to use about
two to two and a half tablespoons of
nutritional yeast this is going to
depend on taste and then i'm gonna get
myself some light non-dairy milk i'm
going to add one fourth of a cup of that
to the pan that's going to be pretty
much the only liquid we're going to be
adding except we're going to add some
lemon juice 1 tablespoon that cuts down
on the cashew taste and then 1 teaspoon
of salt and then we'll finish it off
with 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and one
big tablespoon of white miso paste this
really brings everything together
and of course we're going to blend all
of this up and it's going to take about
three minutes and you can see it's
noticeably creamier it's absolutely
amazing I really dare anybody to say
that this doesn't taste like macaroni
and cheese it's a good quite a happy
accident so go and make a lot of
mistakes whenever you're making recipes
because it's turned out really good and
very often that's the way I find all of
my favorite recipes and now I'm going to
make myself a Portobello Philly
cheesesteak and I'm going to start off
by putting about a fourth of a cup of
water and a really really hot pan and
then I'm going to add right around four
sliced portobello mushrooms into the pan
then I'm going to add one pinch of salt
and that's just going to help get all
the water out of the mushrooms so that
they look really good and you're going
to cook these for about four to five
minutes depending upon your heat of your
pan and it's basically going to be done
when they look exactly like this now
we're going to add some seasonings I'm
going to get myself a half of a teaspoon
of liquid smoke and then to that I'm
going to add one tablespoon of liquid
aminos or soy sauce or what have you
we're then going to stir all that
together to make sure that all the sauce
gets all over our mushrooms is going to
give it sort of a meaty type of taste
but not really then I'm going to add
about an eighth of a cup of water and
then I have some green onions and green
peppers that I chopped up i'm going to
add those to the pan and break them up
so that they cook well I then like to
add another fourth of a cup of water
just to the steam really nice you're
gonna cook these in a pan stirring
pretty constantly for about three to
four minutes and there you go there's
your creamy mac and cheese which is
super awesome i took the cheese sauce
and i made first in this video put it on
the Philly cheesesteak and there you can
see it please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
