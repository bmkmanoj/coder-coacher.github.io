go over job interview questions and
proper answers or how to give a
favorable impression during an interview
archimedes 1987 09 and I was wondering
could you make a video about how to give
a favorable impression during an
interview well if you use this video in
combination with my other video get
people to like you you will get very
very good results all this information
is based off of a ton of questions that
were passed on to interviewers what
they'd like to see from an interview e
and a lot of other psychological
research that I've done first what
should you wear well if you're a man
employers have stated they prefer to see
men dressed in navy blue or gray suits
and of course it should be dry cleaned
also they preferred plain silk ties
plain long sleeve shirts white was much
preferred like curlers in general or
preferred however and of course the
shirt should be starched and if at all
possible it should be a thick cloth and
black shoes overall were preferred as
well for women same colors were
preferred as for men however the
interviewees say they received the best
impression when women wore dresses plain
tops again no patterns as little as
possible in regards to jewelry and most
definitely nothing revealing whenever
you're entering the interview bring
everything in one briefcase that is very
very organized have many cover letters
and resumes you never know how many
people are going to be there and you do
not want to be put in a situation where
you do not have enough cover letters and
resumes whenever you are reaching out to
shake the hand do not clasp their hands
strongly but instead meet them as an
equal and give them an equal up and down
handshake at that point you want to
maintain eye contact sixty to seventy
percent of the time and throughout the
interview that's probably preferred to
maintain eye contact sixty to seventy
percent of the time unless you start to
feel uncomfortable at that point you
want to start to use less eye contact
act enthusiastic but professional have
an interesting story to tell if the
interviewer is chatty always have
interesting stories to pull out after
you enter the room provide them with
three to five seconds to look you over
pretty much what you want to do is just
put your briefcase down or any
information you have and allow them to
look you over without distraction then
you want to sit when asked or ask them
where you should sit and throughout the
presentation if you use the skills and
to get people to like you video which is
free here on you
to you can learn a lot about how to
position yourself in regards to body
language whenever they ask you tell me
about yourself which they will don't
provide your life history they want your
job history and the skills that make you
a good hire don't get personal talk
about how experience fulfill the needs
listed in the job advertisement you want
to constantly not refer to the
advertisement that interest June the job
in the first place but you want to take
the skills they are looking for and
constantly reposition them back to the
interviewee that you have those skills
and how you develop them and you're
going to continue to do that throughout
this entire interview and make sure this
takes no more than 90 seconds to answer
whenever they ask you what are your
strengths again list the same skills
they stated they were looking for on the
job advertisement however don't list the
skills verbatim use your own words when
they ask you what are your weaknesses if
you don't give any they will think you
have an ego problem so you definitely
want to answer this with an actual
weakness however you want to be a little
bit tricky with this give a weakness
that is actually a strength for example
in this job if you must work with a lot
of people state that your weakness is
that you don't prefer working alone or
you prefer interacting with many people
and if you do not get to do this you
will get bored see it's a weakness in
another job but it's actually a strength
in this job and then you want to go on
to provide ways that you're working to
overcome these weaknesses and explain
how you don't let these weaknesses
affect your work if they ask what
excites our motivates you tell them that
using the skills they're looking for
motivates you for example i get charged
up when I help people solve their
problems most definitely do not bring up
money and your best bet in general is to
say solving specific problems excite you
when you are asked what are you most
proud of keep these answers related to
work never go personal and throughout
the presentation you don't want to go
personal give examples of how you've
helped past employers make a too tight
on money because of your efforts and
give examples on how you solve the
problems the advertisement said they
needed solved what is your biggest
failure don't say you've never failed
you may say I look at a failure as
feedback on how to improve and if you do
give a failure most definitely make sure
that the example that you give was
caused because of unforeseen
circumstances and never blame other
people for any failure you describe talk
about how mistakes have made you
a better person how do you stay
organized or get work done on time state
that you constantly prioritize your most
important tasks and then stay till the
job is done and then go on and give an
example of when you did just this if you
are asked how do you handle pressure
state that you enjoy pressure and don't
want a boring job unless for example
this job might be more and then go on to
give an example of when you handle a
high-pressure situation in the past if
asked have you ever lost your temper say
I'm not the type of person that thinks
getting angry solves problems I get
frustrated I just stick to it and get
the job done if asked how do you deal
with stress tell them how you relieve
stress through physical activity or
socializing with friends again don't
bring up the you go out and get drunk
that if as any company culture questions
must immediately be agreed with then
give an example of your actions in the
past that embodied this overall
corporate culture if after you detail
wearing it again same as the
organization question above give an
example of when being detail-oriented
help save money and/or customers if you
are ever asked to rate yourself in
regards to specific skill sets always
give a rating of eight or nine and maybe
an occasional ten but you want to stay
in that general area if you're asked to
tell something interesting about
yourself give the interview or an
interesting story about something that
happened outside of work of course make
sure that your role in the story is both
exciting however most definitely not
illegal if you're asked to tell about
your last performance review stick with
the positives and ignore the negatives
altogether never say anything bad about
anyone yourself or any employees that
you worked with in the past or employers
if asked how do you handle criticism
understand that companies will not hire
someone that doesn't welcome criticism
say I welcome criticism if it is
constructive I then use it to improve my
performance anytime the situation occurs
again if asked out you try to improve
give an example of a failure based off
of an unforeseen issue and how you
prepare yourself for similar issues now
what would a random person say about you
which 1a state is I'm the person people
come to four and then insert one of your
strong qualities and then go on to give
an example in which you back up this
skill if asked do you prefer working
alone or on a team your best answer will
be based on what you will be required to
do with this company this is a question
that people mess up and interview
all the time and then they don't even
realize why they were not hired you want
to constantly answer in regards to what
would fulfill those job requirements and
always give a positive example to back
up all of your answers but keep it short
if asked why are you leaving your
current employer never give a negative
response on either your employer or your
coworkers explain how excited you are to
work for this new employer if this is
your dream job tell them that explain
how the previous employer helped you
gain the skills needed to work for this
better company that you are now
interviewing with you never want to give
the impression that you were forced out
of your previous job or fired why should
we hire you state what their
advertisement said they were looking for
again don't refer to the advertisement
just refer to the skills in that
advertisement and explain how you are
experienced in each skill and be
specific also explain what added value
you provide that the other candidates do
not well that's all folks I pretty much
answered every single common interview
