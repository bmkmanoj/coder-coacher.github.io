request I get is to do a Java
programming tutorial in which I teach
the entire language or the core java
language in one video today I'm gonna do
that so let's get into it alright so
here I am in Eclipse and if you don't
know how to install eclipse in the
description underneath the video I
provide a video that shows you how to do
that so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna come in here and we are going to
create three classes a class is a
blueprint for creating objects what we
do in object-oriented programming is we
model real world projects or objects in
code
the very first one's gonna be called a
animal now I know this is gonna be a
little bit weird for what I'm gonna do
here but just bear with me now I'm also
gonna come in here and also create
another one and this is going to be a
dog and finish and then the final one
I'm gonna create for you cat lovers is a
cat so new come over here and class come
over here and type cat that is all we
need to do to I don't need to worry
about anything else and we're just gonna
click on finish okay so there's our
classes by this being public that
basically means anyone can access it
class that's what it is a class like I
said blueprint for creating real world
objects if you want to have a comment
inside of Java this is a single line
comment if you want to have a multi-line
comment you put a star inside of here
and you can just type whatever you want
to type and there you go over and over
and over again so single line multi line
if you want to import libraries which
you will do all of the time in Java you
can either go java.util.scanner which
accepts user input or you can go and
import the entire library by going Java
util dot star there you are now we're
going to create what is called a field
and I'm just gonna start off with a
complicated one okay so public means
that this is available to anyone else
static means that this number is going
to be shared by every animal object that
is created final means that this is a
constant and it can't be changed
double means that this is a variable
type that allows you to enter decimal
places and it's common to have finals
defined with all uppercase
1.618 oh there you are
now variables or fields can start off
with either a letter or an underscore or
a dollar sign but more than likely
you're gonna start them all off with
letters I'm going to define now a
private field and by putting private on
there that basically means it can be
accessed by other methods in the class
and that's it it's very good idea to
have all of your fields labeled as
private that way you can keep people
from going in there and willy-nilly
changing them a string is just a string
of characters and I'm gonna go through
all the different data types that are
inside of Java private an INT is just an
integer that can have a value of
negative 2 to the power of 31 to 2 to
the power of 31 minus 1 so pretty big
number well what I'm doing here is I'm
divining an animal so it has a name
every animal that I creates gonna have a
name these are attributes fields are
attributes for whatever we are defining
another common attribute would be weight
another thing that would be common is
boolean which can have the value of true
or false is whether it has a owner or
not and we're going to define everything
as not having an owner by default these
guys up here named wait don't have
values when they start off and that's
perfectly fine
private byte be an age and it can have a
value of negative 28 to 127 and we're
not gonna give that a value either in
every class inside of Java is gonna
start off with this brace right here and
then end with this brace right there
another variable type is known as a long
which is massive it goes from negative 2
to the power of 63 to 2 to the power of
63 okay so big and let's just say that
we want to have a unique ID for all of
our animals and that's gonna be a big
number and it's going to be along let's
say just to be goofy that this thing or
this animal is going to have a favorite
character characters are unsigned int
that represent utf-16 codes for
characters just single characters that's
all you can ever put in there private
double talked about already say we want
them on
the speed it is a number with a decimal
place and it's a 64-bit number and then
you can have floats which I never use
and it is a 32-bit number with decimals
and the reason I don't use them is
because they are not very accurate I
don't use floats I use doubles but
whenever I want something to be very
accurate I use what's called a big
decimal now what I'm going to do is
create a protected datatype and I'm
working it as protected that just means
that this value can only be accessed by
other code in the package so this guy
right here anything that sends in this
package right there I'm also just to
make this crazy gonna make it a static
integer and this is going to be number
of animals now remember I said a static
shares the same value every single
animal objects going to share the same
value for a number of animals and
basically you want to mark any variable
or function static if it doesn't make
sense for an object to have that thing
on its own so for example it wouldn't
make sense for a dog to know the total
number of animal objects created if it
doesn't make sense for the real world it
doesn't make sense here make it static
and we're gonna give that default value
of zero a scanner is going to allow us
to accept user input from the keyboard
and I'm going to just call this user
input and I'm creating a scanner object
and you normally do it this way equals
new scanner and then here by putting
system in you're saying we want to get
data from the keyboard now any time an
animal object is created you need a
function that is called a constructor to
be executed here I'm just going to right
click
I'm gonna go source and I'm gonna come
down here and then generate constructor
there it is and here I'm just gonna put
it after user input and I've decided
that I don't necessarily want this to be
created with all of these different data
types so I'm just uncheck that instead
and there you go there is your
constructor super calls whatever the
superclass was for this animal to be
executed and in this situation animal is
the superclass for dog and cat and how
you know they are superclass is dog
extends animal okay so this is now a
subclass of the type animal and of
course cat is going to
stand animal as well and this is what we
call inheritance because every single
field and every single method that is in
animal is going to be available to the
subclasses dog and cats since it extends
it and that's in parents now I don't
want to call the super for this because
I have no reason to and whenever we
enter the animal constructor that means
we just created a new animal so I'm
gonna say number of animals needs to be
increased by one so I'm gonna put two
pluses on there and that would just be
exactly the same as if I typed in number
of animals equals number of animals plus
one it's just shorthand notation now
let's say that I want to come in here
and add some things so equal to 5 plus 1
this is how we add exactly the same as
you would think and if you want to print
out shorthand inside of Eclipse it's
types it's a hold down control hit space
you're going to use system.out.print
line anytime you want to print something
to the screen and here we're gonna go 5
plus 1 equals this is how you put
information inside of here and since
we're going to be creating a string here
you can add two different values
together inside of print line by putting
a plus and then I want to put some of
numbers and there we go and that's gonna
print that out on a screen
I can go and create a whole bunch more
of these and then we can do subtraction
as well put a negative sign in there and
I can type in diff and then I put a
subtraction here and then I could type
in diff also come in here and do
multiplication and that's going to be a
star or an asterisk or whatever whether
star and malt division forward slash and
div and then finally we have modulus
which returns the remainder of a
division that's a percent sign and let's
change this to 3 so we get a result here
and mod now if we want to execute these
guys what we have to do is I'm just
gonna type in main right here control
space this is where our code is going to
be executed or this is going to be
whenever we call for our program to run
this is going to be the function that is
called first again you understand these
public static void main string arguments
if you run this on the command line
you're going to be able to provide
arguments or values that are going to be
stored inside of this array and I'll get
more into what arrays are later they're
just basically boxes okay so if I want
to execute this I'm gonna go animal and
I'm just going to call this as awe
animal is equal to and I'm going to
a new animal object and I just go like
that
and this guy right here is actually our
constructor and now I can come up here
and click on this and go animal ok so
there is everything that we just did and
you can see here modulus that's division
by 3 and the division by 3 of 5 is going
to give you a remainder of 2 so there's
the math functions all right come in
here create a couple more things I've
already said before if you want to print
out stuff to the screen just goes this
out control space there you go but here
I want to demonstrate print and how it
differs basically we want to have the
user enter a name for our animal now the
way that print line and print differ is
there's no new line or a line break you
know where they hit enter and go to the
next line okay so if we want that with
print we just put it in there but it's
better just to use print line because it
saves you some time now an if statement
is going to perform the actions that are
between braces if a certain condition is
reached so we're gonna go user input and
we're gonna say has next line that's
basically saying did they enter a string
a series of characters and that is a
method right there and if they did then
we are going to execute everything that
lies between here and down here and I'm
going to come up here and make this
uppercase there you go and there it is
now what do we want to do to accept that
input basically has next line basically
just means like I said that they entered
some string into the keyboard and if it
comes back as if that is true it's going
to return true which is going to cause
this to execute this is a way for us to
refer to the object that is being
created because there's no other way to
do that so this is a reference to the
object that was created this guy right
down here ok so that we can execute the
proper things and we're gonna go set
name and we're gonna get the user input
that they just entered and to do that
you go next line now depending upon the
type of data you are accepting you're
going to use a different value for here
and a different value for here this just
returns true if they entered the right
data type this actually gets the data
that they entered and here you can see
in Eclipse
it gave me a little error message saying
hey you haven't created set name yet
real easy to do that it's a good idea to
have both setters and get our files so
that we can access these variables that
are up here that are marked as private
all these guys and how you do that
inside of Eclipse is you right-click and
you go in here to source and you come
over here and you say generate getters
and setters you're gonna see what they
look like over here say select all we're
not gonna have a setter and getter for a
number of animals because the
constructor handles that can't change
favorite number user inputs user input
doesn't have anything to do with the
object and that's also why it's static
see these little asses here but every
animal does have an age a favorite
character at least in my world it does
an owner hight name speed unique ID and
weight all right so we're gonna create
those and each one of those is going to
be public boom you can see right here
what they do this is going to return
whatever the value for name is and this
is going to allow you to set the value
for name and you can see there this is
being used again reference to the object
let's get back up in here the different
values that are available remember this
is going to return true if they enter
the right data type but this is for
Strings whenever we use line if we are
instead receiving integers it's going to
be changed to an int like that if we're
going to be receiving floats you're just
gonna type in float it's easy to
remember if it's going to return a
double double boolean and then finally
byte so these guys returned true if it's
the right datatype and this guy down
here this is really simple it's gonna be
next int next float next double and I
think you get the picture so those are
the different ways to return data and
make sure you get the right data types
now I'm having a copy of this everything
in this program in the description under
the video now what I'm gonna do is a
couple of weird things just so I can
demonstrate all the other things in Java
I'm gonna go set favorite color and I'm
gonna do some weird stuff in error and
this is how you call function of course
set unique ID and call that as well but
in this situation I'm going to get rid
of that even though it's gonna cause an
error because I'm gonna create my own
version of set unique ID in what's
called method overloading which just
means that there's different types of
attributes or data that you can send
through here so if you have multiple
different versions of this function
however the attributes of the data
accepts are different you can do the
you can have the same function name and
it doesn't cause any problems so let's
go down inside of unique ID create that
guy and here you can see it right here -
method overload all you do use the same
name boom and you just change the
attribute you can never have the same
attributes inside of there or at least
the data types can't be the same so you
can't you couldn't go in here and type
in long you know unique ID well as you
just saw the dad types have to be
different for this to work so I'm going
to come in here to the original I'm
going to say unique ID set to plus sign
this unique ID you can also see these
things pop up over here so you don't
have to memorize everything and I did
that just because I'm going to do
something a little bit weird here here
they don't get the unique ID sent to
them so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna generate a random number so I'm
gonna create a long and it's gonna have
a minimum number which is gonna be equal
to a 1 and I'm gonna create another one
called max number and we're gonna
generate a random number can't use
commas by the way from one to a million
actually we could put a million inside
of an int but I'm just doing it this way
now to generate a random number and
store it in the unique ID for our animal
you're gonna type in minimum number is
equal to and don't try to memorize all
this stuff especially if you're new long
but I doubt new people hung around for
this math.random you just call
math.random number it's gonna generate a
series of numbers between 0 and 1 so
that's how it's gonna generate all of
them and then you're gonna multiply that
times put multiple braces inside of
there the max number that you want to
generate minus the minimum number you
want to generate and come inside of
there and then go +1 and always put a
semicolon at the very very end of every
one of your statements if I didn't say
that already now you can see this guy
right here long well the reason why we
have along there is we are casting
whenever we do all this stuff over here
math.random generates or returns a
double remember gives you a number
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 a bunch of fractions so if
I want that to be converted into a long
I need to tell it I want it to be a long
and that is how we call or that is what
we call casting you want to cast to a
byte you just do exactly the same thing
you want to cast to an int you do
exactly the same thing if you want to
cast to a long you just saw that okay so
you get the point
as well and these data types are what
are called primitives you either have
primitive data types or you have objects
if you want to convert from a primitive
to a string yes go string number you
type anything there that's just a name
is equal to if you want to convert this
long into a string you just type in long
to string and then pass in whatever you
want converted here it's gonna be
maximum number remember strings are just
series of characters and a string is an
object likewise you could type in byte
to string and then pass in whatever you
want converted into a byte and then once
again integer like that float with an
uppercase or double with an uppercase
all those things and then if you want to
convert from a string into a primitive
you can do that as well so let's say we
wanted to take int number string is its
name you would go integer dot parse int
and then you put inside of here whatever
you want to be converted into an INT
likewise
double float long byte boolean all those
different things and the only thing
gonna change is this is going to be the
uppercase version of whatever datatype
you want to convert from into an integer
okay so these things match integer
integer there you go
and then you're going to also change
this thing except this is gonna remain
int or you can have long or you can have
float or you can have whatever but this
time it's an int in this situation come
up here and at the end of this print out
the same exact thing now what I'm going
to do is overload set favorite color and
I'm just doing this again just to
demonstrate stuff this doesn't receive
anything here I'm working with
characters so let's say that I want to
do a random number and I want to cast
this into an int again put the equal
sign in there
call math.random and I don't want to go
over 126 and a reason why is this is
what I'm going to be doing here I'm
going to be getting different characters
at random and this is the number that's
going to pop back or that I'm gonna use
to get those characters and these are
all of them whole bunch of them if you
scroll through them you're gonna get to
127 and at 127 that's when you don't
have a lot of things okay that's why I
only want to use from 1 to 127 or 26 I
mean so 126 and then I'm gonna put +1 in
there so that it doesn't return that 0
there
than if I want to convert to a character
equal to character random number so I
just converted this into an int and then
I converted that int into a character
now we'll cover the if-then-else
statement now you can make different
comparisons inside of Java using greater
than less than equals to not equal to
greater than or equal to or less than
equal to and here I'm gonna go if random
number is equal to 32 in this situation
32 represents a space which means
nothing's gonna get printed out on the
screen
so instead it I'm gonna come in here and
I'm gonna say favorite character set to
space and print that on on the screen
because there's no way to print a space
else if random number is equal to 10 10
in this character set is going to be a
newline again that doesn't work and I'll
just change this a new line okay and
then what I can do by default if neither
of those occur write this out set two
and then just put in plus this favorite
character and make sure you put a period
between there there you go now there are
also things called logical operators and
you're basically going to have an
exclamation point which is going to
convert a boolean value to its right
into the opposite so it's going to turn
trues and falses and falls us into Tros
have a single end which returns true if
the boolean value on the right and left
are both true and it always evaluates
both values you're not going to use that
very much and and is what you're gonna
use all the time it's going to return
true if the boolean value on the right
and left are both true just like the
other one except it stops evaluating
after the first false you can have a
single or again it's going to return
true if either a boolean value on the
right or left or true and it always
evaluates both boolean values and then
you have double or which is gonna return
true if either boolean value and
left-to-right are true it's gonna stop
evaluating and then you have this last
guy it's gonna return true if there is
one true and one false so it's basically
going to force there to be one true and
one false sort of like an award so let's
use these guys let's say we want to go
random number greater than 97 and so we
want both of these to be true random
number less than 122 if that occurs
so favorite character is a lowercase
letter so you can see exactly how that
works and if we want to do another one
let's just copy this greater than 97
less than 122 we're gonna use both of
those actually gonna put in another
brace right here and another brace here
I'm gonna copy this interior part here
and here I'm gonna go or like that and
then I'm gonna put in another one so
both of these or it's gonna check one of
them or the other needs to be true so
here it's gonna be 64 again I'm just
using those character codes from that
website I just showed you a second ago
91 and if this occurs favorite character
is a letter that's what we just verified
there with that and like I said before
if you want to turn a true into a false
exclamation point true is going to
return false
same thing type in false this is going
to return true and yes you do use that
all the time then if you want to do
another comparison so it's worth let's
use the ternary operator for this let's
say which is bigger is equal to and
let's say we have 50 greater than random
number in this situation question mark
50 this is like a shortcut way to assign
either or another value to a number
random number boom so if random number
is less than 50 which is bigger is gonna
get the value of 50 if however this
comes back as false random numbers going
to be assigned to which is bigger so if
this is true you get this value if this
is false you get the other value so
that's a ternary operator then another
way to compare when you have a limited
number of values you're working with is
called a switch statement and use it
just go switch random number there's
this braces again in this situation you
go case and the number I'm looking for
is 8 and the data types you can use here
right there like I have for 8 is going
to be either an int byte or character or
if you're using Java 7 or above you can
use strings the only thing is if you're
using characters you have to put single
quotes around this and if you're using
strings you put double quotes around
them so in this situation if random
number has the value of 8 we want to
print out something special here and
that's going to be
favorite character set to backspace all
right so that's going to be it print it
out and then after you're done and you
want to leave the switch statement you
hit break break throws you out could do
the same for a whole bunch of these
different guys so let's say we wanted to
if you want to check against multiple
different values let's just paste this
in here you go ten eleven twelve and
that would you know execute this system
out if the value for random number was
ten eleven or twelve and then if you
want to define a default action if none
of the above work out you're gonna type
in default and then sis out something
and then after that break actually
technically don't have to put break
there so break throws you out of the
switch statement and down here to
whatever follows after this brace now
let's get past all these getters and
setters and start creating some
different functions protected again
means only things in the package you're
going to be able to access this static
means that belongs to the class and not
to the individual objects created you
can think of them as utility sorts of
things because they really have nothing
to do with the object except they're in
there and here this is just going to
count and we're going to count by using
a fourth statement which is going to
continue performing certain actions as
long as the condition is true it's a way
of looping here what you're gonna do is
you're gonna take this starting number
that was passed inside of there and
initialize that to I then you're gonna
put in your condition as long as I is
less than or equal to 100 in this
situation we're going to continue
looping and then I plus plus we're gonna
increment I each time we go through the
loop what we specifically want to do in
this situation is we want to skip
printing out nine to the screen the way
we would do that is if I is equal to
ninety continue you could put this
inside a braces if you want but you
don't need to continue is going to jump
out of this current iteration of going
through the loop go back up here and
increment I by one so it's never going
to get here if I is equal to ninety it's
not gonna get the system out it's gonna
jump back up here iterate I and then
continue one and then just put an eye in
there and that's gonna print out the
starting number to one hundred protected
static string print numbers it's also
going to print and just demonstrate in a
different way
int max numbers because I want to show
you how the while loop works now with
while loop you have to put whatever you
want to increment outside of the while
loop and you have to give it a starting
value and it's going to continue
performing certain actions while this
condition right here is still true so
I'm gonna go max numbers that were
passed into it and this while loop is
gonna print out the first half and then
this function we just made up here it's
gonna print out the second half okay I
know it's goofy I'm just doing it just
do something there we go so so for an
eye and we have to increment inside of
the wild loop also that's how the while
on the floor change from each other want
to reiterate that if you want to jump
outside of a loop completely you like
this max numbers divided by two types
break that's gonna jump us out of this
while loop and there you go that's how
the wild loop works and then finally you
may have noticed up here previously I
had void for a lot of functions void
just means it doesn't return anything
when it's done executing string means
it's going to return a string to whoever
calls it and what I'm going to do since
this is a static I have to refer to this
function up here count two by putting
the class name ahead of it X numbers
divided by two is what we're gonna pass
to that and then at the end of it you
can either return a string variable or
you can just type the string inside of
here in this situation do something like
that you do another thing there's
another way of conditionally looping
through and it's called the do-while and
I'm gonna actually use a real world
scenario here protected static void
guess my number is gonna be in the name
of this gonna define an integer number
don't give it a value with the do-while
loop does is it guarantees it's gonna
execute at least one time and that works
particularly well whenever we're asking
for user input in this situation we're
gonna have them guess a number guess
number up to 100 now what we want to do
is we want to verify that they entered
an integer how do we do that while put
the not in there user input has next int
so if it has an integer that they just
entered then we're not going to do this
if however they enter
a character or something else that's not
an integer then we're going to come
inside of here
I'm gonna go string number entered is
equal to user input using that scanner
again next and if you want to print a
string directly inside of here in an odd
place instead of at the end is not a
number new lines gonna give us a break
and then at the end of this you're gonna
put a comma and number entered there you
go except this is not print line this is
print F sorry about that wasn't thinking
and if instead of a string you want to
use a either a byte short int or long
you would put a D in there instead of an
S so a D right here if you want to use a
float or a double you would put an F
inside of here and let's say that you'd
want to define that it'd have at least
two decimal places you put it point two
inside of there this is a string so I'm
gonna leave that be a string okay in the
for instance in which they actually
enter an integer like we asked them to
we're not going to get to that while
loop so we're gonna say number is equal
to user input we're gonna get new input
from them and we're going to keep
executing everything here while the
number is not equal to 50 and then put a
semicolon at the end there okay so this
is going to execute until they enter the
number 50 into the input so that's 50s
our secret number then you could print
out something that says yeah you got the
number okay
now what I want to do is demonstrate
something called polymorphism which
sounds very complicated but it
completely is not it all right this is
gonna return a string and it's gonna be
very very simple return girl okay so
every animal by default is gonna return
ger whenever the make sound is called
also going to create another one that's
gonna demonstrate following morphism
static void well this guy we're going to
be able to pass in here it's not gonna
return anything that's a void means big
animal this guy is going to accept any
animal type even if it's a dog or a cat
which we're gonna create here in a
second and even if this method makes
sound in dog and animal are changed it's
going to automatically print out the
right animal sound that's part of
polymorphism so we'll just say animal
says R and animal
that was passed inside of here makes
sound and it will execute the right
method I'm gonna show you that here in a
second actually let's just do it so
remember I said dog gets everything that
animal has create the constructor for
this and this time it's not gonna do
anything I don't really care then gonna
override that make sound method for my
dog and my dog animals are going to
return wolf instead of Gurr so this is
going to override that my cat is also
gonna override it make sure you the
constructor is cat can't have the
constructor for dog inside a cat and
make sound is exactly the same don't
change anything and this is me out and
let's just put a main function here and
what we can do is go animal Fido is
equal to new dog of course can also go
animal fluffy is equal to new cat see
I'm not calling them cat objects I'm
calling them animal objects then what
we're gonna do is we're gonna create an
array I'm gonna give you more
demonstrations of what an array is it's
just a series of boxes we're gonna do is
this array has to contain the same data
type so this becomes a nice easy way to
store multiple animal subtypes and in a
rack let's call this array the animals
equal to new animal this is how we
create an array and you have to define
the fixed size of the array whenever you
create it then I can do is say in the
array in box number 0 that's where all
the array start 0 put phyto and in box
number 1 put fluffy say these are
objects in boxes now I can say phyto
says 0 make sound and then I can do the
same exact thing for fluffy even though
they are referred to as animals it's
going to have the right one do it or the
right function execute fluffy says just
change this to 1 and some of this other
stuff popping up here well let's just
say Fido I don't care you can say all
the other stuff that printed out here
and then you can see down here at the
very very end fighter says wolf fluffy
says meow I'm gonna let you guys execute
all this stuff on your own so you learn
how this stuff works of course you can
just copy and paste it or type it all in
and then of course we could also call
that function that we talked about
before that's in the animal we could
just pass in a fluffy it's going to pass
it in as an animal type but it's gonna
have the right thing get entered and
there you can say animal says meowth
jump back over into animal and
demonstrate a couple other things
now like I said before an array is just
a fixed series of boxes that contain
multiple values of the same data type
and you can create an array in a couple
different ways like this and then say
favorite number for example and then on
the next one whenever you initialize it
with whatever you want or you you
actually know how many boxes you're
gonna need favorite number equal new int
20 for example that's gonna give you 20
boxes to store and order data types
inside of it or another thing you could
do is just initialize it all at once
different situations are gonna have you
do different things and of course the
very first box inside of every array is
labeled 0 and then they increment from
there if I want to store 100 inside of
there there it goes
change this to numbers I can also create
string arrays and if I know what the
value is gonna be up front I can go
random words separated by commas here
curly brace at the end that's gonna
flick those three things inside of that
string then I can cycle through this
data by just putting string which is
going to be the datatype for each
individual thing inside of their word is
going to be a variable that's going to
store each one of these guys and then
string a right is the string array right
here so it's going to cycle through
every single one of those one by one
store the value temporarily in word and
then here will print out word so that's
one way to print out all the strings
then you have multi-dimensional arrays
boxes inside of boxes so let's do
something really complicated to do three
of them array name is equal to and I'm
gonna explain what this means here in a
second so let's say 0 0 0 and there you
go so you might be really confused by
what the heck is actually going on here
so I'll explain it okay so you saw if
you want to create an array this is how
you create an array it's gonna have
three boxes two boxes this is how we're
going to put three digits in there that
we know ahead of time and this guy right
here is actually going to return 16
which is item number one which is this
is 0 1 2 okay multi-dimensional
very complicated right I mean look at
that thing it's nasty well this is
basically what is gonna happen here the
first box in your array is going to tell
you how many boxes you're gonna have
downwards the next one's gonna have how
many across and then the last one's
gonna have how many of the
groups let's look at that in a graphical
format so how many down for the first
one that's gonna be one two three see
down the next box is gonna be how many
across four one two three four and then
the last one is how many of those groups
well in this situation we have one in
this situation we have two as you see
there's two and there's two okay so
hopefully multi-dimensional arrays make
sense now and in the interest of saving
some time this is how you would print
out this multi-dimensional right if you
wanted to print out just one array using
a for loop initialize this to zero
because the first index is zero you're
gonna cycle through as long as I is less
than the array name length so this
returns the length of the array and then
if you wanted to do another one you're
just gonna have that there except in
this situation you're gonna take the I
put that bracket down there put length
to get the second array length and then
for the third array and then to print it
out of course you just go ray name
followed by ijk so that's how that for
loop would work for that crazy
multi-dimensional right if you want a
coffee in a ray let's go string this is
a string or a clone of write is equal to
arrays coffee of string array and then
you tell it how many indexes you want to
copy and that's how you copy it you can
print out the whole entire array really
quickly just going like this then going
arrays to string you can do two string
for pretty much all variables it's gonna
print them out in this situation clone
all right then if you want to do a
search to find out if an item is in an
array you go raise binary search and
then you're gonna type in clone of array
and then the very specific don't put
that store inside of there the very
specific thing you're looking for and if
it finds it it will return the index for
where it's located or or return a
negative number so there is core Java
that's pretty much every single thing
about Java hopefully you guys like this
it lived up to your expectations again
