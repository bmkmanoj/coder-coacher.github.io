4 of my web design and programming
tutorial I've actually been receiving a
lot of emails and in this tutorial I'm
going to specifically cover arrays and
I'm gonna continue to also cover arrays
in the next tutorial but a lot of you
guys been saying what is the ultimate
goal of this tutorial well the ultimate
goal is to teach you enough about web
design and programming that you'll be
able to create a custom WordPress news
theme that will also contain a PHP
WordPress plug-in that will automate the
whole entire process of posting this is
something that a lot of you guys have
been asking for and by the end of this
tutorial you will know piece by piece
how to create such a tool and a lot of
other things are going to be taught like
PHP security and so forth and so on so
that your site doesn't get hacked either
way an array to make it real simple is
just a great big giant box that has a
bunch of little boxes inside of it by
default the key that is going to
represent the value in each of these
boxes or you could consider or look upon
this key as a label for the small box
inside of the big array box is by
default going to be using an index
meaning a number starting at 0 then
going to 1 2 3 4 5 and upwards from
there this array can contain any type of
information be it a string a number or
even another array or a boolean value it
can pretty much contain anything that
you'd want to contain inside of it now
of course you do not need to use the
default index but you could use real
keys that would help you find the
information inside of your arrays and
then you have multi-dimensional arrays
and this is just a bunch of arrays
inside of an array so you can think of
this as one big giant box it makes up
the array and then it contains
additional arrays and these would be the
default indexes for all these little
boxes inside of the multi-dimensional
direct so now I'm going to show you some
code examples not going to be using any
type of form information I'm going to
focus totally on arrays here and this is
how you would create a basic array I'm
going to create one called my info and
then you would follow that with the
array name and you do need this I'm
creating a key and I want to
associate a value with it which is going
to be my name so the key is name and the
value associated with it is Derek which
is my name then I'm going to create
another one this is an equal sign and
then a closing caret bracket here and
I'll associate with this a street and
then create city is equal to okay so
there we are we created a basic array
now if I want to get the value by
calling for the key associated with it
it's real simple just go to screen I can
say my name is comma my info and then
just call for using the key to make sure
use the uppercase for name here then a
closing bracket for that and I'm going
to throw some breaks in here you didn't
see the other tutorials you probably
stopped watching this video but he's
okay you should definitely watch that is
because then you will know what I'm
doing okay now we want to close this out
over here and if we save this and then
jump in here and reload it you see my
name is derek pops up on the screen my
name is and it pulled in the value
associated with this array that has the
key name and as you can see that's
exactly what it printed over here to
screen let's say we want to create
another array called more information
again make a call to the array function
to create this array and let's say I
define state and then you see there I
put in a regular integer I don't
surround it with quotes then let's say
that I want to merge these two arrays
how do I do that well let's just say I
want to merge them and then merge my
info with the array called more info and
then store it back inside of the array
called my information in essence writing
over it I call a method or a function
called a Raymer and then I place inside
of here the two arrays I want to merge
that's it an array merge is not a
function that I created this is a real
PHP function allows you to merge those
then let's say I want to iterate through
the array well it's real simple I just
used the for each looping device you've
not seen this before to use it you just
type for each and then you type in the
name of the array you want to psych
through as and if you do this it's going
to automatically assign the key to the
variable key and it's going to assign
the value that is associated with that
key as it's iterating through to the
variable called value and opening curly
brace and if I echo this out to screen
closing curly brace and as I like to do
and put these brakes in here and if we
save that and then jump over and run it
you can see it prints out like the key
associated and the value to screen chily
let's increase the size so there's the
key and then there is the actual value
associated and it continues to print
those out and it's print that out based
off of this echo right here so it
automatically as it's cycling through
the array my info it's associating a key
and a value and you can also see here
that I was able to merge using the array
merge function state and PA and age and
35 let's say you wanted to search for a
specific key inside of array how would
you do that here I'm going to use the if
statement and then make a call to array
key exists again this is a function
built into PHP and I'm going to look
specifically for a key called name in
the array of my info and if it's found
I'm going to echo to the screen name
stored associated with the name key is
I'm going to follow that with my info
like that save it
reload the name stored is Derrick see it
automatically pulls over the value
stored associated with the key name and
prints it out to screen so that's a
function that does that for you and if
you wanted to search for a value inside
of an array I'm going to show you
another neat little function here as
well like let's say C search is equal to
use the array search method or function
and I'm looking for the specific value
of Pittsburgh in the array called my
info echo to screen City search and
reload and key for the city that I sent
being Pittsburgh is city okay so that's
how you would look up the key associated
with a value inside of an array and if I
wanted to print out
all of the keys for any array we have to
use a new function that you've never
seen before which is print underscore R
and all this does is it prints out
arrays in a human readable format if you
tried to print out this information
using the echo or the regular print
function it would just print array to
the screen and some kind of random
numbers but if we use print R it's going
to actually put on some information that
makes some sense again I'm going to call
another method called array keys and
don't try to memorize all this I'm going
to give you a ton of examples I just
want to sort of get you in the rhythm of
understanding how PHP works so don't by
any means think you have to memorize all
of these different methods over time
you're going to get them ingrained in
your head you're going to learn best how
to program through experience and not
through just random trying to memorize
things it's probably one of the biggest
problems with people trying to learn how
to program if I run this you can see it
printed out all of the indexes
associated with the key that would then
be associated with those values inside
of array my info again it's going to
store everything by default with the
numbers starting with 0 to 1 so you can
see that is right there and if I wanted
to print out all of the values
associated with an array called a print
or function again and I would call for
an array value so you can see if you
want the array keys type in array
underscore keys you want the values
array underscore values and I'll show
you here in a minute
different ways to pull this information
in piecemeal so that you can use it a
little bit more easy save it reload and
now what you're getting here is the
values associated with each of the
indexes inside of the arrays well
another question you probably have is
how do you create a multi-dimensional
alright remember multi-dimensional array
it's just a bunch like just think of
this as an array and an array an array
all right and it's no different here so
instead of it just having my name
Derrick it might have Sally and Sue
followed by another street address and
so forth themselves not that complicated
so let's create a multi-dimensional
array let's say we create one called
customer 1 is equal to array and then
we'll say name actually I'm going to
jump up here and copy this code up here
to make my life a little simpler then I
just have to change this information so
we'll say I'll just leave that the same
and create customer to equal to array
pace and we'll just say this is Sally
and she lives at 23 Main and I'll just
say she live in Pittsburgh so here I
created two arrays and let's say we want
to combine them into one giant that's
not exactly giant but what and then
another Narae which would make it a
multi-dimensional array all that I need
to do is call the array function
customer one customer - that's it that's
going to create a new array called
customers and it's going to have both of
these arrays stored inside of it and if
I want to call the print on function
array underscore values because I want
the values and not the keys also put
that parentheses right there and then
print out customers save it jump over
here reload it and you can see that it
printed out all of the values and
there's the keys associated with those
values that are stored inside of this
new array called customers here to the
screen and then finally I'm going to
show you this in a more usable manner
I'm going to show you the for each
looping method here I'm going to call
for all the keys that are stored inside
of the array called customer and then
opening curly brace and I'm going to
call for each again keys as and I'm
going to say I want see you can use key
- you can use anything in there these
values don't have any meaning I'm just
using keys and values so that it kind of
makes more sense more than anything else
value and then this is going to allow me
to cycle through the keys and the values
that are each stored inside of those
arrays that are inside of the array for
customers T - value then close off this
curly brace and then close off this
curly brace jump up here type in
customers save it and then reload it you
can see that it printed out both the key
being named and the value being my first
name Derek for each of those arrays and
if you would store additional customers
inside of this array it would continue
to print out the key followed by the
value associated with it
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you even more ways to pull out just
individual
pieces these arrays so that you can work
with them on an individual basis which
is what you're going to be more used to
and what is going to be more useful for
you if any questions or comments leave
