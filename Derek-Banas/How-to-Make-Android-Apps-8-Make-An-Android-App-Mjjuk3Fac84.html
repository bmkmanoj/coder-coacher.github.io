8 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps this is going to be a really
exciting video for me to make anyway and
in this one I'm going to finish the
conversion app I'm going to go over UML
modeling and when you know you want to
use different UML modeling tools to be
able to completely structure your app
I'm also going to cover how to create a
flexible class with enumerated types I'm
going to show you how to change
components dynamically and a whole bunch
more so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it okay so for future tutorials I
decided I wanted to use an action bar
activity and to add that all you have to
do is just put action bar activity
inside of there and then come up here
and make sure that this import shows up
inside of there this guy right there of
course all the code is in the
description and then what you're going
to need to do is go in here and get your
build.gradle this guy open that up and
you can see inside of here that I went
ahead and increase this to 20 and this
to 20 this to 14 this to 20 and I didn't
touch anything else and then so that I
could use all of that stuff I just
showed you I put in this final line
right there okay so that's important to
know in regards to how to increase the
version of the android sdk and as the
different versions of the android sdk
progress and become stable on every
operating system i'm going to progress
and increase them alright so now let's
get back into actually creating our app
alright so when I left you off we
finished on create and among other
things and of course if you didn't watch
part 7 you pretty much have to otherwise
this will be massively confusing okay so
I'm going to come in here and I'm going
to continue using my use case
description to describe everything here
another thing that's going to happen is
we are going to see when the basic use
case description no longer works which
is very important so this is for all the
people who keep to asking me what is
different about this tutorial this one's
going to go into a lot more depth I'm
going to create a quantity class and
that's going to make it very easy for me
to be able to go and convert from
different types I'm going to jump over
into presentation explain why alright so
here I am what let's just say that we
want to convert from one gallon to cops
that's going to equal 16 cups which we
just multiply whatever is in gallons
times 16 and get that seems really
simple and
what we could do is also you're going to
see different conversion types here or
different ways to convert from gallons
to cups we would divide by the same
number here as we would multiply down
here to convert backwards and forwards
between gallons and cups
seems pretty Elementary the only problem
is what happens whenever we also want to
be able to convert between gallons cups
teaspoons tablespoons ounces pints
quarts gallons pounds millilitres liters
milligrams and kilograms all of a sudden
everything gets much more complicated
however if we instead decide that we are
always going to convert from whatever
this value is two teaspoons and then
from teaspoons to the desired final unit
of measure the world gets much more
simple in this situation for each
different unit type we want to support
we just need to have a number inside
here that's going to allow us to convert
from teaspoons and cups
let's say and from cups to teaspoons and
I'm going to demonstrate using
enumerated types exactly how we're going
to do that and how we're going to do
that is we're going to create a quantity
class and it's going to contain a value
and a unit enumerated type and we're
going to create all this if you don't
know anything about numerated types
don't worry you'll see them in quite
detail I'm going to have to define an
enumerated type for each unit type and
it's going to be how to convert from
teaspoons and how to convert you know to
whatever the desired type is going to be
I'm going to have to get the conversion
for each unit type from teaspoon which
is going to be what we call our base
unit we're going to be converting from
and two teaspoons each time we're also
going to receive the number of teaspoons
for the starting unit we're basically I
do that so that we can go from the
beginning unit over into the teaspoon
version of it and be able to save that
and then work with it so that we can
provide from teaspoons to whatever we
want to get to have to convert to the
base unit teaspoons and as you saw in
the previous slide to do that we're
going to divide by the base unit stick
with me if that's not making sense it
will we're also going to convert to
another unit other than teaspoons
and to do that we're going to multiply
by the base unit what else are we going
to have to do with this we're going to
have to have a constructor that's going
to receive the value and the unit type
and then finally we have to create a
two-string method that is going to print
out the value and unit type and let's
just say that we want that to be to four
decimals
I don't know and really understand this
you really should print this out so that
you'll be able to see it in front of you
while I'm creating the code so I am over
in App Inventor again and what I'm going
to need to do here is come over here and
right-click and new and Java class and
I'm going to create exactly what I just
showed you it's going to be a quantity
class and hit OK and a whole bunch of
people have been asking me not to zoom
in these videos as much I'd like to hold
a vote if you guys would please help me
with that and tell me zoom or not to
zoom I don't know how many people watch
these people screen and I basically just
do what you guys want me to do okay so
each unit or each object that we're
going to create in this quantity class
is going to have both a value and a unit
of measure so I'm going to create these
as finals because they are not going to
change they are going to be unique value
and I'm also going to come in here and
create a unit of type unit which is
going to be an enumerated type that I
create here in a second now enumerated
types use a constant key to represent a
value and by using that they're going to
allow us to easily define how to convert
all of the other types of measure so
that we'll be able to turn or convert
from teaspoon to anything and then we're
also going to be able to make the
conversion from a starting type two
teaspoons and backwards and forwards
it's going to make our life really
simple and to create this numerator type
I'm going to create this as a static
because it's part of the class and I'm
going to call it unit of course and then
inside of it I need to define every
single thing that I want to use inside
of here so for TSP well since we're
going to be converting using teaspoons
as our base type we're going to have
teaspoon
SB 1 then to convert 2 tablespoons which
is this guy right here we're going to
convert that to 0.33 3 because it takes
3 teaspoons to equal a tablespoon 4 cups
we're also going to commit here and zero
point you just saw this guy just a
second ago there it is and then I'm
going to put all the rest of those in
there there is every conversion both
from teaspoons all the way through
kilograms all right now what I'm going
to need to do is come in here and define
that teaspoon will be our base unit of
measure everything will at some point be
a teaspoon no matter what it is so we're
going to have to go in here and go final
static unit and base unit is equal to
teaspoons there that is I'm also going
to hold the number of teaspoons from the
original unit because we're going to
eventually convert something into a
teaspoon and that guy is going to be
stored in our double by base units where
that's going then we're going to also
have to receive the number of teaspoons
the starting unit is going to be equal
to and this is going to be double and
I'll just call this in teaspoons because
it's going to be over the original thing
is in teaspoons this by base unit is
equal to in teaspoons we're also going
to have to be able to convert any other
unit value to the number of teaspoons
so public double to base unit sounds
good and it's going to receive a double
which is going to be the original if I
want to convert it to teaspoons I just
go return value divided by base unit
okay just like we saw before in the
presentation part and of course we're
going to have to be able to convert to
another unit as well from teaspoons so
we're going to go public double from
base unit and make this double as well
it's going to receive a double of course
and it's going to return whatever that
value is times the base unit so that is
how we're going to be able to convert
backwards and forwards now of course
we're also going to have to create a
constructor like I documented in the use
case description so it's just going to
be quantity and every single quantity is
going
have a value and a unit type and we can
call the constructor it's not going to
matter the one thing that is important
we're going to have to come in here and
go this value is equal to the value that
was passed in this is our object and
we're also going to have to go units
because we need to store a units and
values and we keep on going now let's
convert from teaspoon to the desired
unit type and to do that we'll just go
public it's going to return a quantity
if I spell quantity correctly let's just
call this two just to keep it simple and
I'd like to use really long descriptive
names but sometimes really short names
or even more descriptive and here I'm
going to go unit and get the old unit
that was passed inside of here make it
equal to this unit and then we're going
to go return new and we're going to
create a new quantity and we're just
going to get the new unit which is what
was passed into this we're going to
convert from our base unit by passing in
the old unit to base unit and pass the
value in there and then we're going to
put our new unit right there and now all
we need to do is come in here and create
the two string method and I just find it
easier to just come in here and go
public string to string and also come in
here and put override and then I'm going
to want to format this a two so that it
will only show a maximum of four digits
in our double and to do that we're going
to go new and decimal format and then
define it inside of here so put a number
sign and then four zeroes and then
whenever they try to print out our
object it's going to print out a nicely
formatted little guy for us so what
we're going to do is say that we want
the value to be shown there plus we're
also going to have to get the don't make
sure you put a plus sign there to the
unit which is going to make everything
display nicely on the screen and that's
all we need to do for our quantity
object now we're going to go back over
into the use case and look into how
we're going to finish up main activity
and finish our app all right so what did
we say we said we want to finish up main
activity so what do we do here put in a
four
and let's say that we want to finish the
main activity how are we going to do
that well what's going to happen is
after they change an item so an item is
changed in the spinner or by the spinner
well what's going to happen well the
first thing we want to do is we want to
verify or check if I'm converting from
teaspoons or not this is a sign that
more than likely your use case
descriptions no longer going to work for
you for dart describing this which I'm
going to show you a new way to do it
then what I'm going to do is if I am
check if I'm updating teaspoons or not
see I'm going to be converting backwards
and forwards between teaspoons there's a
lot of if-then-else sort of things going
on here if I'm converting from teaspoons
to something well I can just immediately
convert from teaspoons of something if
however I'm converting from cups to
gallons well first I have to convert
from cups two teaspoons and then from
teaspoons to gallons see gets kind of
complicated so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go and create what's called
an activity diagram to help you really
understand what's going on here
okay so here's activity diagram I would
have loved to draw this all for you live
but I have a UML tutorial which I'll put
a link in the description too if you
want to learn how this stuff really
works step-by-step but to keep
everything and keep this video short I'm
just gonna I drew it ahead of time okay
so what am I going to do here well this
is going to be the point in time in
which the user changes the unit type in
the spinner as a little note here says
well then what I'm going to do in my
code is check if I'm converting from
teaspoons and if I am I want to update
my unit type using teaspoons so I'm
going to convert from teaspoons to
whatever well I also need to check if
I'm updating teaspoons why that's
important is I want to make sure that
the value that they put in the editable
text box is actually going to be
transpose down into teaspoons in our
little grid view if yes in that
situation I'm updating teaspoons well
then what I want to do is get the value
in a title editable text box and I want
to set the text to teaspoons in the
teaspoon
view okay if not if I'm not updating
teaspoons well in that situation I want
to update each text view using teaspoons
which means basically I'm going to
convert from teaspoons to the preferred
type and then I'm going to set the text
in the correct text view see kind of
boxed in and nice if I would have tried
to explain this in a use case
description like it was previously
probably would have got really
complicated and confusing all right so
let's jump back up here and these are
each going to be methods each one of
these guys that I documented inside of
these rounded off rectangles so let's
jump back up here check if I'm
converting from teaspoons no I am NOT
well in that situation I'm going to have
to create a method that's going to
update the unit type using some other
way of converting so what this is going
to do specifically is convert from the
current unit type two teaspoons and then
convert from teaspoons to the preferred
type and then set the textview
appropriately all right now what I'm
going to do down here is check if the
unit in the spinner is equal to the
current textview doing that exactly the
same thing I'm doing here if yes make
the values equal for the like units so
whatever is in the editable text box is
going to go into the correct unit so if
it is tablespoons for example in the
spinner and it says one then make sure
down in the text views that four
tablespoons I also have the same exact
value if no then I'm going to do nothing
everything is going to be set properly
okay and then what I also did well I
thought it would be a good idea is I
created what is called a class diagram
and you see right here quantity each
quantity object is going to have a value
which is going to be of type double it's
going to have a unit of type unit I'm
going to have to convert from or to the
base unit I'm also going to be able or
have to convert from the base unit and
then I'm going to have a constructor and
then this guy down here is going to do
our little conversions just like we
created and I have to string down here
and then here is the enumeration and
each number that is going to line up
with each enumerated type a lot of stuff
again you guys I'll put this on my
website you should print this out
everything on my websites for you by the
way you should print this out and have
it sitting in front of you while I
finish main activity so let's jump over
and
Finnish mainactivity okay so what I'm
gonna have to do I'm going to have to
check if I'm converting from teaspoons
so to do that I'm going to create a
method and it is not going to return
anything and I'm going to check if
converting from teaspoons and it's going
to receive a string which is going to be
the current unit and then I'm going to
say if the current unit equals teaspoons
or teaspoon and I'm going to keep this
really simple because I knew the coin I
could make or eliminate all these
if-then-else statements but I'm going to
try and keep everything a little bit
simple from now on well then what I want
to do is I want to update the unit type
using teaspoons and I'm going to do that
by passing in the quantity unit and this
is the reason why the enumerated type
was static and it is going to pass as a
TSP else now when we come in here go if
the current units equals tablespoon and
I'm going to have a brand new one just
like I documented in the activity
diagram update unit types using other so
the teaspoon part's going to be the only
one that's special and I'll create these
ones as well quantity unit tablespoon
and then just to save ourselves some
time I went and created those for every
single different unit type so we're
going to call this guy if it is whoops
we're going to call this guy which is
going to create in a second if we're
working with teaspoons and we're going
to call this guy if we're working for
anything other than teaspoons so let's
go and let's create this method right
here I'm down here and it's going to be
public void and update unit types using
teaspoons let's move this over here and
what's it going to be passed well it's
going to be passed the quantity of
course because that's what we're passing
it and it's going to be unit type and
we're going to call this current unit
inside of this we're going to have to
convert the value in the editable text
box to a double and to do that we're
going to go double to convert and to
convert it just go double dot Horace
double pass in the amount textview and
we're going
get the text from our amount text view
and then we're going to convert it into
a string just like that okay so now we
have that double that we're going to
have to convert now we want to combine
the value to the unit so string and I'm
going to say teaspoon because that's the
only thing I have to worry about because
only the teaspoon one is going to be
called here I'm going to call it
teaspoon value and unit makes a lot of
sense and able to convert oops
there we go and then at the end of that
I'm just going to put a space and
teaspoon we go now after I have that I
can go and call my teaspoon text view
and set the text for that guy to the
teaspoon value and unit it seems if
everything is written out here long it
makes more sense to me and it's very
easy to figure out what the code is
doing now all I need to do is update all
the unit text fields and to do that I'm
going to call update unit text fields
using teaspoon because teaspoon is what
I have at the top and to do so I'm going
to pass in the double to convert I'm
also going to again like I said before I
could make this a lot more short but I'd
have to start doing a little bit more
complicated code so I'm not going to do
that this time
we'll work our way up to it if you guys
like these types of tutorials that are a
little bit more professional
I guess I'd say and I want to pass in
the tablespoon text view which is the
text view I want to change so we're
going to pass in the double to convert
and we're going to say we want that
which is going to be teaspoons in this
situation because we are in the update
unit types using teaspoons method and
we're going to pass in say we want to
make it a tablespoon and the whenever
this conversion is made we want to
update the text view for the tablespoon
okay and I went in there and created
those for each one of these guys you can
see here tablespoon cups ounces pints
quarts gallons pounds milliliters liters
milligrams and milligrams so I'll just
did that make everything a little bit
shorter okay so now I need to make that
method which we've been asking to do
things here a whole bunch so I'm just
going to go public void update unit text
fields using teaspoons and what's it
going to receive well it's going to
receive a double which I'm going to call
it the double to convert because that's
what it is and then I'm also going to
receive a quantity of course which is
going to be the Kwan
any that we're converting to just like
you saw there and I'm going to call this
the unit converting tow and then what
else we going to do well we're going to
put a text view of course inside of
there and that's going to be the text
view that we're going to update I'll
just call that the text view I can call
it the text view top update whoops
thanks for you to update that would be
funny um which would be perfectly fun it
makes a code more readable do whatever
works for you all right
so we'll have to create a quantity here
and I'm going to call this unit quantity
like that and equal to new quantity and
I'm going to pass in the double to
convert there it is
and I'm also going to pass in the unit
type of course so unit teaspoons and
then after that I'm going to come in and
create a string and I'll just call this
temp unit because it's just going to
perform an action once and then never
really do anything ever again and I'm
just going to go unit quantity convert
to and this is going it's going to
convert from teaspoons to the unit
converting to I got right there and then
I can just say to string on that
quantity and it is going to print out
not only the value but it's also going
to print out the unit type and then
after that I can just go hey textview I
want you to set the text to the temp
unit now then have that set up I'm going
to also go and update unit types using
other
so let's come up here say this guy right
here and you can see that it's being
passed and told that it a leader is what
we're shooting for here so let's come on
down here and let's create it now
bouncing here and it's going to be
public void update unit types using
other and it's going to be passed a
quantity just like you saw unit and I'm
going to call that the current unit like
that and then we're going to do much the
same thing we're going to create a
double and we're going to call this the
double to convert and that's going to of
course have to be converted into a
double and what we're going to pass in
there is we're going to go okay what's
in the amount textview which is on our
screen or in our app and we're going to
say get our text from that and then
we're going to also say at the end
convert that into a string for me we
we got our double now we want to create
our quantity type and like I said
everything is very very similar here we
come up here and just grab this guy if
we want just to compare what's different
so let's come down here drop that right
there we're going to create a quantity
however we are not going to have
teaspoons in this situation we're going
to have whatever the current unit is
that was passed in so if it's going to
be tablespoons we're converting that's
what we want to put inside of there so
that's that quantity then we want to
create a string for the teaspoon
textview as its special and value in
teaspoons is going to be equal to the
current unit or the current quantity
selection so let's go up here and change
the name of this to the current quantity
selected I like that better makes more
sense current flow any selected and then
we have to convert it to a teaspoon and
we're going to go quantity unit
teaspoons to do that and then we're
going to say that we want that converted
to strings there we are
then we want to set the text view for
our teaspoon textview teaspoon text view
set text and it's going to be value in
teaspoons love code completion and then
we're going to have to create another
new method for everything else and this
is going to be called update unit text
fields using teaspoons and to this guy
we're going to pass in our double to
convert and let's go down the next line
and we're also going to pass our current
unit for this guy and then we're also
going to pass in our quantity I don't
keep spelling quantity wrong just do
that which is going to be tablespoons in
this situation each one is going to be
different of course and then finally
we're going to pass in the textview that
we want updated there it is now let's go
and do that for every single other
option and of course come up here and
type in text field sorry about that
now let's do this for every possible
option and there we go and then after we
got that set up we need to set the
currently selected unit to the number in
the editable text box and if you don't
remember this is where we are check if
the unit in the spinner equals the
current textview if yes we want to make
the values equal for both the editable
text box and then down inside of the
grid view for that same thing that's
just to make sure that they always
remain equal and to do that very simple
we're going to say it
is the current unit name is it going to
be equal the current quantity selected
and we're going to go and get its unit
and get its name if it is we want to
create a textview text by taking the
value in the editable text box in our
app and then we want to add on the
currently selected unit and a spinner so
we're going to go string and get our
current unit text view text so I'll just
call it that and we want to go get the
double to convert and then add on to
that a little space here and then we're
going to put in the current quantity
selected and get its unit and its name
then we want to get the currently
selected quantities unit name and then
tack onto it - textview and the reason
why we want to do that basically we want
to get whatever the current quantity is
and then put textview at the end of it
so that everything is more dynamic and
this is from the activity main.xml
layout file of course so we're going to
go string and the current textview name
and go current unit textview oh now
current quantity selected and get the
unit and get the name so how we can
dynamically sort of work with these guys
and then at the end of that put
underscore underscore textview our text
view there we go
and also let's put current textview now
well now that we have that we want to
get our resource ID so that we'll be
able to use fine view by ID and how you
get your resource ID is just go int
current ID is equal to a whole bunch of
stuff getting covered in this tutorial
we're going to go resources and we're
going to say that we want to get our
identifiers and how we get that is we're
going to pass in the current textview
name put in ID there and then go main
activity this and get package name and
that is going to return the ID for
whatever the current textview name is
alright very useful technique and now
all we need to do is just create an
instance of the textview we want to
change so it tux view current textview
and we have to cast it to a textview of
course and fine view by ID and we have
the ID because we just went and got it
cool beans then we just have to put the
right data and
right textview so current textview set
text and then inside of that it's going
to be current unit text view text and we
just got one more method to create and
it is this one right here and then we
were done our app is ready to go and
people are gonna look at and they're
gonna be like wow that's really cool
so let's go public void update unit text
field with teaspoon and it's going to be
passed a double if I could spell double
right doing this stuff in my head like
this sometimes makes me a little goofy
okay so double to convert it's actually
not the code writing it's the trying to
say the right words to you guys um so
I'm going to go current unit and make
sure this is uppercase you alright so
what we're going to do here is update
the text field using teaspoons and we
have to do a couple more things inside
of here we're also going to not only get
the current unit but get the preferred
unit we want to convert units uh and
this is I'm going to call this preferred
unit and then the textview that we're
going to be updating and I'm going to
call that target textview alright now
that I have all of those set up I need
to create a quantity again and I'm going
to call this the current quantity
selected because that's what it is
is equal to new let's go next line spell
quantity right quantity and we're going
to pass it the double to convert and
we're going to pass it its current unit
that's going to tablespoons or whatever
and then we just need to convert from
whatever the current unit is two
teaspoons and then convert from
teaspoons to what we want to get to so
let's just go string and let's just
create this as a temp textview text is
equal to make this uppercase and we're
going to go current quantity selected
and we want to convert it to teaspoons
so and then we want to convert it from
the two spoons lips let's get rid of
that to our preferred unit preferred
unit she's going to be cups or pretty
much anything that isn't teaspoons and
then we just call to string on it and
that's going to output both the value as
well as the unit type pretty cool and
then after we have that we can just go
to target textview that guy right there
set the
next to the unit value as well as the
unit type temp text view text boom and I
have an extra little curly bracket on
there see if there's anything else I
made an error on and up here I needed to
put in an extra curly bracket so must've
got away from me there everything looks
good don't see any errors anyway so
let's run it
okay made a little bit of an error here
no problem about that what I need to do
is go in here and put Derrick baños
inside here of course yours is going to
be different how to know what to put
inside of there though is to go into
main activity and you can see there's
the package name right there so just
make sure that that is the same for your
androidmanifest.xml file another thing I
wanted to do is down here in the Style
section I'm going to put a p-- style
ford slash theme dot app compat and
that's going to make that work and one
other thing I need to go into each of
these text views that I have here in my
grid layout and make them black okay
so every single one of those has black
inside of it those text views just in
the grid layout so you can see right
here there's black okay and there's
black say-so just do that for every
single thing over inside here text view
wise and that will fix it and now let's
run it and see if it works
okay so here is the conversion app a
little Android right there the default
logo and you can see right here i type
in convert from i can put anything in
there and whenever i switch over it
automatically converts to all of the
other different unit types so does
exactly what I want okay guys so I
covered a lot in this tutorial I hope
you enjoyed it of course feel free to
