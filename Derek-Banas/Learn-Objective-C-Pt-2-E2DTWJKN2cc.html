part 2 of my objective c tutorial here
i'm going to explain the implementation
and interface code that is needed in
Objective C programming first off to
develop iphone apps you will need to
download some free software from Apple
you get it online at developer.apple.com
/i phone it's called the iphone sdk and
the current version is 3.2 as of this
video but four-point-oh is currently in
beta while you can program an
objective-c on pcs you need an apple
macintosh to use this iphone development
software you can get a mac mini for
around three hundred dollars on amazon
or ebay and this is actually how i
started if you want to take a soft leap
into the world of macintosh explain the
last article what goes into writing okie
programs here i'll show you the code
involved you define an object in
objective-c by creating a class
definition for it here is an example
class definition on the right and main
function that uses it the first line of
code important foundation foundation dot
H imports all the information in the
file named foundation H into your
program so all the variables and methods
created in foundation age are now
available for your use then we have the
interface part of the class definition
which begins with an @ sign followed by
the word interface and this describes
the basic variables and method that will
need to be implemented in the
implementation part of your program the
first line above is staying that this
new object class is to be associated
with the object named NS object every
object you ever create will at some
point be derived from nsobject i then
state that this class object will have
two variables named model number and ram
and they both will contain integer
values after the closing curly brace i
then define all the functions that need
to be defined for this class the use of
the word void means that they will not
be returning any values to users that
call these functions after you have to
find the basic structure of your class
you close that part of the code out with
the keyword at followed by the word
special note is considered good form to
start the name of your class with an
uppercase letter all other variables and
method names normally begin with a
lowercase letter however there is one
exception and that would be constants
which we have not talked about yet and
they are normally in all capital letters
in the implementation part of your class
definition is where you create the
functions that every object will have by
default you define the beginning of the
implementation section with the line at
followed by the word implementation and
then followed by the name of your class
in my case that would be new computer it
is also considered to be good form to
never directly allow the users of your
objects to be able to directly change or
view the values for the variables of the
class we implement that rule by forcing
the user to get and change those values
through functions these functions
normally begin with the words get and
set the first two functions will print a
message on a screen when called and as
long as a function that was created and
is stored in foundation H whatever
values that are passed to it will be
displayed on the screen of whoever
execute this program everything place
after the axon and between the two
quotes will be displayed if you want to
show variable values in this string of
text you tell the interpreter where
those variable values will show up with
a symbol such as I use here which is a
percentage sign followed by the letter I
and those values will appear based off
of the order they're in after the
closing quote the other two functions
set the values for the two variables you
define for your class the word void
states that these functions also do not
return a value when they are called then
i set the name of the function and then
after the colon you can see something
that might look odd to you in that i
have the characters int surrounded by
two brackets and then followed by the
letter M this states that this function
can be passed an integer and what you're
saying here is if it is passed an
integer you want to assign that value to
a variable named and you then will
perform that functions actions inside of
the curly braces the code model number
equals M followed by a semicolon is
stating that whatever value was passed
to this function should be assigned to
the objects variable name
number you can see here on the right the
main function this is the part of the
program that is run first by default
when the whole program is executed I
describe much of it in the previous
objective-c tutorial so if this doesn't
make any sense take a look back there
the line of code that begins with new
computer followed by a star does the
following this line of code creates an
object of class type new computer don't
worry about what the star does at this
point we'll cover that at a later date
this code is stating that you want a new
computer created using the blueprint or
class you name new computer and it
should have the name your computer next
line of code states that you want the
computer to provide you with storage
space in memory for the your computer
object and then the next line of code
returns to you the location of your new
object if you look over to the left side
of your screen you could also actually
combine these three lines into one and
if you did that it would look like what
you can see here under the first
bulleted item new computer followed by
store your computer equals so forth and
so on back over to the right on the next
line this code stores the value of 230
in the variable names set model number
and then the next line of code calls for
the method get' model number to perform
an action and that action would be the
outputting of the current value of the
variable model number to the screen and
then finally pulled rain releases the
memory your program was using back to
the computer return 0 as I previously
described tells the objective-c
executors that the program ended
successfully without an error and the
final closing brace signals the end of
the entire program in the next
presentation I'm going to go through all
the data types available to you in
objective-c like I stated before this
presentations put together because I
received a request to do an objective-c
tutorial by kev one if you want me to do
a specific tutorial for you just leave a
comment below the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
