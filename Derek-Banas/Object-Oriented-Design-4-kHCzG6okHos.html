of my object oriented design tutorial
today we're going to talk about
structuring iterations and how to create
domain models now this is not going to
be heavy in regards to the number of
slides there's only two that follow this
one for the most part this is going to
be a totally hands-on activity I just
have to get a couple things out of the
way and if you haven't watched part
three you absolutely have to watch it
because I'm going to use the usage
diagram that I created in part three
heavily in this tutorial so let's get
into it now in the unified process as I
talked about before you want to focus on
the riskiest and highest values parts of
your systems first and we're going to
focus on handling the most common tasks
now which is going to be providing
customers with funds from their checking
account this is all based off the usage
diagram we created in part three to
create an ATM software and so forth and
so on so we're going to plan on starting
programming very soon after we get
through this part now during the
elaboration phase which is the phase
that follows inception which was covered
in part three the major requirements are
going to be listed the riskiest parts
are going to be identified and solved
and elaboration is going to be broken
into two or more iterations probably a
lot more than two or more and you can
expect them to last between two to four
weeks each the end date for each
iteration is going to be fixed now of
course I'm talking about big large-scale
programs here not what we're doing here
but this always going to apply and
everything's going to be covered in this
tutorial now at the end of each of your
iterations you should have production
level code and designs ready now common
diagram tools that are going to be used
in the elaboration phase are going to
include the domain model which we're
going to see here and it's a
representation of conceptual classes and
not software objects so even there
though they're going to kind of look
like software objects and it's going to
focus on explaining simple tasks while
showing how the classes are going to be
associated with each other as well as
the attributes that they are going to
have another diagramming tool used in
the elaboration phase is the design
model and in this you're going to have
diagrams that explain the logics that's
going to be needed and this includes
class diagrams and how objects are going
to interact then you have the software
architecture document which documents
how core capabilities are going to be
resolved
then you're going to have the data model
which documents any database schemas or
other forms of data and how it relates
to system objects stick with me here I'm
going through this really quick but soon
we're going to get a hands-on stuff and
then finally you're going to have the UI
prototype which is going to be an
overview lots of pictures of the user
interface or what we expect it to look
like now we get to the domain model
which is what we're really going to
cover here whenever we create domain
models we're going to be converting
usage cases which we created in part
three into a visual format so we can
easily see how the parts are going to be
connected now don't try to make a domain
model into a class diagram that's not
what it is we're going to try to model
real world rather than software objects
whenever we're creating domain models
and the goal of the domain model is to
provide developers with a complete
understanding of how your system is
going to work and how they're going to
modify it on the other hand a conceptual
class which is what the meat and
potatoes of the domain model is has a
name that represents what it is or what
it does and you'll represent actions it
performs by connecting to other
conceptual classes and those lines will
briefly describe the interaction and of
course it will also describe the
attributes that these conceptual classes
have now whenever you create domain
models which we're going to create here
in the next area you define domain
models by copying either proven models
that are already out there however if
one doesn't exist what you need to do is
go through your usage diagram that you
created previously and identify all the
nouns in your usage case or system
description or whatever you have and
these nouns will represent conceptual
classes as well as the attributes of
those classes now special care must be
taken if different nouns are used to
represent the same class of course and
to tell the difference between a noun
that's going to be a conceptual class
and an attribute ask if we would only
see it as either a number or text or
something like that in the real world in
the real world if you would only see one
of these nouns as either numbers or
texts or dates or something like that
it's an attribute for example an ATM
card would be a class while the card
number or expiration date would be an
attribute so now let's just get into it
here and start creating these
Thanks now I have over here our usage
case which we created in the previous
part of the tutorial can't see this view
at full screen but this should be easy
to see now basically what I'm going to
do is just go through this and highlight
all of my nouns so ATM is a noun
displays a message that's going to be an
attribute probably but we're not going
to worry about that right now itself as
customers are going to be nouns again
customer inserts a card customer and
card are going to be nouns which means
what they're going to be conceptual
classes ATM of course we already talked
about that verifies is going to probably
be on an association line and here's
card again home banking office this is
also going to be bold verifies you see
that again that means it's going to be
something that's going to be going on
here legitimacy then we have card again
and as you can see ATM customer I'm not
gonna bother highlighting those because
I already highlight of them there's pin
there's something else it's probably
going to be an attribute but let's
highlight it anyway just go through and
highlight all your nouns ATM there's pin
again ATM customer whether they want to
remove funds this is a noun or make a
deposit these might be transaction types
as I'm going through this and I'm also
going to think well transaction is
probably going to be a class that should
be in the back of my head see again
customer see you again funds ATM funds
removed checking and savings those are
probably going to be classified as
accounts customer decides which accounts
so that backs up that thought and that's
exactly what's going through my head as
I'm going through this
there's funds again ATM customer money
that's probably going to be transaction
to remove from checking which is again
there's a count and we're just going to
go through and just keep highlighting
enters a mouth that's gonna be
transaction customer again ATM home
office there that is again we're gonna
have to think about the fact also of how
are we going to handle transactions
whenever somebody tries to use an ATM
from a different bank that's probably
going to be listed as a bank network and
there's transaction say we keep seeing
the same things because remember we had
to pay special attention that some
things are going to be given the same
name and remember we have to pay special
attention to some things which are the
same ID actually have different names
inside of these different guys fun
customer transaction ATM repeat steps
Home Office Network customer sees
receipt bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
after we go through all these we have to
define okay well what are our nouns well
let's just go through we have ATM that's
definitely going to be one of them
another two would be customers so that
customers definitely going to be another
one account we saw that numerous times
bank computer which is going to be the
individual banks computer Bank Network
this stuff's normally done on a white
board card we also highlighted that and
transaction which is another thing so
right there we have all of our nouns now
what our job is to do is to go in and
start using those nouns over here and
creating a domain model and one thing I
want to bring up here is sometimes you
want to use something called a
description class and they are going to
be used whenever they are going to be
needed even if the classes they
represent haven't been instantiated and
the same is true if descriptions are
needed after instances are deleted and
the description classes are also used to
avoid creating duplicate data sometimes
so forth
I don't think I'm going to need one this
time but I thought I'd just bring it up
and because I like being complete so
basically we're going to do here is
we're going to take these nouns we have
over here and a description class would
be something like item description okay
and I'm going to zoom in here in a
second so just hold on and then inside
of it will have description and we will
have something like size and then we
might have something like price this
will be an example of that
so if we'd ever want to be able to
access this information even if a class
object has not been made or hasn't been
instantiated we might want to use a
description but in this situation
I'm not going to want to use those as
far as I know right now but that's
slipped into my brain so I thought I'd
go over it so what are we going to do
here we're basically just going to take
all these nouns and we're going to
clearly eight classes out of them
so how many are we going to need we're
going to need seven of them this is kind
of high-level stuff but as you can see
it's not that complicated so there we go
I got my seven different things so what
am I going to do now I'm just going to
transfer them over so ATM I'm going to
zoom in here in a second if you can't
see you don't worry about it cuz
account Bank computer Bank network which
is going to be big giant network that
all the banks are going to be tied into
card transaction and there you can see
there's all of them ATM Bank Network
customer card account transaction and
Bank computer so those are all my
different classes so now my job is to
basically just go in here and make all
these guys work and I have all the
different ways they're going to be
associated listed up here through
inheritance dependents association
aggregation and composition so let's
just move these over here so we have a
little bit more room now since I
mentioned that the Association lines
that are going to tie these different
conceptual classes together are going to
describe the relationship between the
classes and you're only going to draw
associations that will aid in making the
domain model easier to understand it's
very easy to make things complicated if
you have association lines all over the
place and the information that we put on
the Association lines should start with
a verb so that the connection between
the classes that we're creating are
going to be which of course are going to
be nouns are going to be separated by a
verb so you're gonna have something like
card verified by home bank so let's just
go in here and start creating these so I
got Bank computer right here I'm going
to get myself some different Association
lines and I'm also referring to this big
guy right here which you can download
there's links underneath the video you
can get that stuff and put it in front
of you it's like I said this is a little
bit more complicated than what other
people normally cover on YouTube so you
might actually need to get some of this
information together so we're going to
think okay well the bank computer is
going to be connected to an account and
then I'm going to come in here and start
figuring out exactly how I'm going to
describe these different things
so our bank account and our bank
computer I'm actually going to make two
of these one is going to be a little bit
loose and the other one's gonna be a
little bit tighter
well the account is going to be held by
the bank computer and then what the
customers are going to have accounts and
I'm sort of thinking this out here I'm
just trying to figure out exactly what's
going to work and I'm just going to lay
these guys out as I think they're gonna
handle themselves or how they're going
to be connected and let's take card
throw it down here let me zoom out a
second and then what are we missing well
we're going to have ATM which is going
to be over here so
we're and then of course we're going to
have to make room for the bank Network
which is going to be right around here
somewhere so I'm just moving these guys
around here so that I have plenty of
room to describe exactly what's going on
with the different classes like I said
I'm just using the usage case that we
created before to bring all this
together and then just let me grab a
couple things here just so that I can
zoom in here real quick okay so now I
can zoom in here and we can look and you
can see what's going on on the screen so
we have our bank computer we basically
just took all of our different pieces
and there it flipped out a little bit so
an account is going to be held by or
owned by a bank computer and I'm not
going to get into all the different
Association stuff and then we're just
going to connect these guys together so
any customer is going to have a or as a
has a relationship with an account so
let's just come in here and let's just
define that and that's all we're doing
okay so now I got all my different
little pieces here so count as a has a
relationship with customer how is
customer going to relate to card in
exactly the same way it's going to have
also a has a relationship with my card
or with its card so how is customers
going to have a relationship with
transaction again it's pretty much going
to be a has a relationship just plug
that in there now what do we have here
card how is its relationship going to be
in comparison to ATM well the ATM is
going to verify the card to make sure it
is a legitimate card so let's just go
verifies remember see it's a verb how is
transaction going to relate to ATM well
it's basically going to have a
dependency relationship and the
transactions going to be entered in to
the ATM how's the ATM going to relate to
the giant Bank Network that's going to
contain all of the other ones all the
other bank records well that's going to
come up here and we're going to connect
that and the ATM is going to communicate
with the Bank Network
so just take communicate throw that up
there and then how is the Bank network
going to be connected to the individual
bank computers it is going to have a
owns relationship and there we go so
just throw that in there throw this guy
in here
and there you go so that's a basic
domain model and now what we need to do
is go through here and also define some
more information in regards to the
Association lines now the ends of the
Association lines actually have a name
they're called rolls and rolls are
either going to cover multiplicity which
is what I use them for most of the time
which means the number of instances that
are going to exist or navigation info
and multiplicity is going to be the
number representing the expected number
of instances at one point in time so in
the ATM example we would only ever have
one card instance at a time even though
the ATM could expect numerous cards in
its lifetime so let's just go in here
and actually show how that would work so
here is our card and whenever we are
going to be defining these there's only
ever going to be one instance at a time
of card and at any one point in time
there's only gonna ever be one instance
of ATM so there we are we just defined
that and that's it's pretty important to
know because now you're going to know
how many different instances of all
these different guys are going to be as
well as you have a pretty good idea in
regards to what classes are going to be
used so you're solving a ton of things
now there can be many different
multiplicity values and actually I'm
going to come over here in this text
editor and just show you all of them
right now so there's numerous ways to
show multiplicity so you already saw one
which means exactly one you could also
have star which represents zero or more
you could also put one dot dot ten which
is going to be one to ten one dot dot
star which is going to represent one or
more and you could have two four six
which is going to represent either two
four or six so those are the different
multiplicities that are available for
you and the different ways that you can
define them here so now let's go in and
actually start creating a real domain
model and you're going to get to see
this in a couple different ways okay so
here we go it's got this a little bit
bigger to be easier to say and I'm
basically just going to start off with
my ATM again I'm referring to my usage
case I just can't show it on a screen
here because you know I don't have
enough room so I'm going to have my ATM
and lock up all these different guys and
then zero in on exactly
some other different things so like Bank
Network that's something else I want to
tie in here
and I'm just going to make this look a
little bit more exact we're gonna have
Bank computer and I'm basically just
sorting everything out just so it makes
a little bit more logical sense so that
I can fit everything together and Bank
computer I'm deciding is going to have a
bank ID associated with it so I'm going
to bring down here because that makes
sense and the bank computer is also
going to have an account ID for the
customers and the accounts and Bank
computer is also going to have inside of
it a card ID so those are all the
different things and that all comes from
the usage case as well as just thinking
through exactly what's going on so then
we're going to give them over here and
let's look at these association lines
make sure I have those alright so yep
we're just going to use communicates
again and just drag that over and drop
it in
so the ATM is going to communicate with
my Bank Network and how is it going to
Munich 8 well copy paste there's going
to be one ATM and also there's only
going to be a one Bank Network so that's
going to handle those multiplicity and
we know how many instances are going to
exist at one point in time what else is
going to go on well Bank Network has a
owns relationship with the bank computer
and like I said before based off of
looking at the usage case that tells me
that there should be some sort of ID
system being used here so let's say I
want to take a note and actually draw
this in here and draw that over there
and then I'm going to say that this is
going to represent Bank ID and it's just
a way for me to sort all this
information out so what else did we say
I also said that down here I'm also
going to want to link out to accounts
and if I link out to the accounts what's
that going to mean well that's going to
mean that I'm going to need an account
ID so account ID is what this little
notch on here is going to represent and
also let's say that we're going to have
a card ID which is what this other notch
over here is going to represent so I'm
just thinking through and making
everything understandable first in text
and now as diagrams so this links out to
an account so what does that mean well
that means I just need a copy of the
little account guy
we created over here and how does Bank
computer relate well there's an owns
relationship between these guys so I'm
just going to put that inside of here
and then owns a and you're going to see
I'm going to be able to work that out
and we're going to get two attributes
here in a second and also you're going
to notice Bank network guess what the
situation there's going to be one Bank
network and there's going to be one
computer and this is also going to be an
owns relationship right here between
those two guys ignore this part over
here I'm just using it to grab pieces
off of the bank computer and how does it
relate to a card say I didn't have a
card in here before but of course the
bank computer is definitely going to
have information in regards to the cards
this is just a way that this all
improves upon itself and the bank
computer in this situation is going to
validate the card so let's just put that
in here and again this is going to be a
one-to-one relationship one card one
bank computer and validates is what this
is going to do and everything I'm typing
here I'm going to save onto my website
so you can get it it's free of course
and then the account of course the
customer is going to have both a card
and a count so that's why I put it like
this I thought it made more sense so
what type of relationship well this is
going to be customer like that and the
customer or the account has a customer
so let's come over and show that that
indeed is true maybe to save a little
bit of space we go like this and say yes
there's going to be one customer and yes
there's going to be one account you can
space this out a little bit that all
lines up and the customer has a this is
going to be validates though this is
going to be has a there you go that's
much better and then the customer is
also going to have a card and I'm going
to review this stuff later on in regards
to the association lines and why has a
and owns a and all that stuff is
important even though I've done it a
couple other times it's very important
for understanding how this stuff
actually becomes code and there's going
to be one card and there's also going to
be one customer even though it is
possible for there to be multiple names
on the account remember this is a
situation or a point in time this isn't
a all-inclusive thing so then what else
are we going to need to tie in to all
these different guys well we're going to
have to have that transaction so where's
the transaction seem to make sense well
not with card and it definitely is going
to be entered into my ATM so up around
here somewhere let's just slop this in
here and what relationship is the
customer going to have with the
transaction which is what I'm going to
name this it is going to have a enters
relationship because that's kind of what
it is which means that it's just being
used by it so I'm just going to stick it
in here like that and the UML tool I'm
using here is called omlette it's not
the greatest thing on earth but it is
free and it works identically on Macs
and PCs so that's why I'm using it and
this is going to be changed to enters a
because the customer enters a
transaction there's one customer one
transaction so I'm not going to type all
that out think you get that and then the
transaction is going to be entered into
my ATM and I'm not done yet
chill out there for a second so
transaction enters a ATM through the
keyboard or whatever you want to refer
to it as so then what's left to be done
well then it comes to attributes now
attributes are going to be shown if they
aid in making the model easier to
understand just don't throw them in or
just for the heck of it and attributes
are normally going to be listed as names
but can be more descriptive and by more
descriptive let's say that we wanted to
be really descriptive well you would put
visibility in here and an attribute is
always considered private unless
otherwise and of course privates
negative and public is positive so let's
say we have negative which means it's
private then you're going to give the
name for the attribute well I'm going to
just type in PI here I'm going to type
in the data type while pi is a double
which is known as a real whenever you're
using these guys and other data types
are boolean numbers reals date date time
time and string that's pretty much all
of them and then after real which is the
type of it you would then do something
you could put multiplicity in here but I
never see anybody do that then you could
put in a default value like 3.14 and
then finally you could put in different
types of properties which I've covered
before which I'm not going to go into a
lot right now I'll go into later again
I'll review them so if this is only read
owned
you would put that in between brackets
that is the long way of doing attributes
I normally don't do them that way I
normally just put a name in here because
I'm trying to keep this simple
but if you wanted to do it that way you
could definitely could so now let's
think about all the different attributes
are available well with the ATM I can't
really think anything unless it's going
to be an ID or something that's going to
fit into the bank network so for now
we're just going to leave that out and
also what I'm going to do is I'm going
to delete this out of here because I
think this might actually be a little
bit confusing so now we're going to have
everything all in one area what are
their attributes well Bank network can't
really think anything the bank computer
well it's going to have a bank ID this
is going to be a card ID sorry about
that and then it's going to have account
IDs also stored inside of it so that's
enough information for that account well
you're going to have type remember we
were talking about it before when we're
going through the usage case kept seeing
checking your savings and also balance
is going to be something else remember
I'm just thinking through this so type
and balance are definitely going to be
things that are going to be needed
inside of their customer well what sort
of information are we going to need here
customer well we might need a name that
makes sense and maybe address and you
know other contact information email
whatever if you want to have that card
well there's going to be a couple things
inside of here definitely you might have
magnetic strip whatever that is
um so you're gonna have a card number
and you're also going to have a pin
associated with that card and then
finally for transaction you're going to
have a count and you're gonna have type
and you might also have I don't know
withdraw or that wouldn't make sense
because they we can't actually do
deposits so you're going to say
something like amount so it's going to
be what account are we doing this in
checking or savings type is it going to
be a transactional words withdraw or
deposit and what's the amount so there
you go that is a ton of stuff about the
main models and all sorts other things
and ways to think about object-oriented
design please leave any questions or
comments below more is coming at the
last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
