one of my wordpress plugin tutorial
where you gonna learn everything you
want to know about wordpress plugins how
to create them and also how to create
with its short codes and a whole bunch
more what we're gonna do here the widget
I'm gonna make for you today is gonna be
this Follow Me widget I know it looks
really simple but to keep this tutorial
understandable I had to keep it simple
basically what this guy does is whenever
you click on any of these links it's
automatically going to in this situation
open up RSS feeds or take a person to a
Twitter account or what have you so
basically I'm gonna go in here and show
you step by step exactly how this guy
was made first what you're gonna want to
do is go inside of WordPress into the
wp-content folder and then inside of
plugins and then what I did was I
created a folder called NTT social
networks with no spaces nothing inside
of this guy so I created that folder and
then inside of here I have the Facebook
Twitter and RSS feed logos that is it
and then I created this guy right here
and this is the actual file that is
going to load the widget inside of
WordPress and you can see there it's NTT
link to social networks dot PHP you
definitely want this file as well as the
folder name to be as distinct as
possible so that your plugin can be
distinguished from other people's
plugins so let's just jump right in here
and get this guy going first thing
you're going to want to do is type in
PHP and then you're gonna create a
comment section and I'm going to type in
plug-in name I'm gonna call it NTT that
stands for new think-tank if you're
wondering and all of the code is
available in the underbar you can take
it and do whatever you'd like with it
just don't sue me if something goes
wrong which we're going to get into
licensing here also in a second and then
after that you're gonna want to actually
type in the location that's going to
provide more information on exactly what
your plugin or your widget does and this
plug-in does work but it's mainly just
geared towards teaching you how to
create plugins I'm just gonna say
displays this is where we create our
description which is important links to
RSS Facebook and Twitter teaches you how
to make plugins that's the real goal
here with this tutorial and then you're
going to want to actually come in here
and type in a version and I'm gonna come
in here and say a version 2.0
and then author and whatever your name
is and then author you are I this is
going to be your website if you have one
and then that is it so you close that
section off and technically you just
made yourself a plug-in and if you open
up WordPress and jump over here and
reload this guy you're actually gonna
see NTT social networks version 2 this
is version 1 this is the test one that I
created and there it is it just showed
right up for you so you've already
created one and also what is really neat
here if you go into the widgets section
under appearance whenever you're done
this is the ultimate goal this is going
to allow you to type in your specific ID
in Facebook and Twitter and save and
it's just everything else is just gonna
work beautifully so that's great so now
what do we have to worry about we have
to worry about getting sued of course so
what we had to do here is you have to
define your license and you can do
whatever you want with this obviously
you're making it but I use a general
Canoe license that says you can do
anything you want with this plug-in this
code as long as you don't sue me if
something goes wrong and I always have
this just saved here on the side and you
can get your own copy of this license if
you would like to have it again there's
a link in the underbar so I just paste
that in there all the time and then we
get into the meat of what is a plug-in
well whenever you create a plug-in
inside of WordPress you have to extend
what's called the WP widget and how you
do that is you define a new class and
you give it a name that is the same as
your plug-in and these names should be
different again that's why they're kind
of weird so we're gonna extend the
already existing WP widget class here
and then inside of this class there's
certain functions that you must define
and I'm gonna show you those first one
you're going to define is actually the
constructor and what this is gonna do
for you is initialize your plug-in and
it's gonna have the same name for
whatever you have here for the class so
just type that in and in a second I'm
going to jump more in here and explain
each of these functions piece by piece I
just wanted to go through and explain
them bit by bit before we started then
what you're gonna do is define your
widget function and it's gonna have
argument and an instance which is
actually going to be an instance of this
widget and I'll come back again and
explain what that does basically what
the widget function does is it
displays the information that you want
displayed on your website in the sidebar
so this guy its job is just to kick out
the information and display it the way
you tell it you want it displayed then
you have another function and it's
called update and its main purpose is to
save everything for you so like the
Twitter ID and a Facebook ID and all
that stuff it's gonna save that all for
you and whenever you open this guy up
which open new instance and also old
instance those are the arguments that
are passed to that guy and then you have
to define the function the displays in
the widget admin section the thing that
I just showed you where we were able to
type in your IDs for Facebook and
Twitter that guy is built by this
function right here and again you pass
it an instance of the widget itself to
get it to work and then that is the end
of the class those are all the functions
you have to define in the class but
we're not done yet
we also have to define another function
and I always just type in the name of
this widget or plugin and end it with an
it and then inside of this guy you're
gonna type in and register widget just
like I did and then you're gonna paste
inside of here the name of your widget
just like that and then that's done and
then what you got to do is attach your
widget to what is called a hook and you
do that with add action and then widgets
initialized and then what this guy's
saying is when all the widgets are
initialized I want a specific function
to be executed and that function is this
function right here which is going to
register your widget so that it's ready
to be used
you know surround that with quotes and
then of course and it within it because
that's the name of the function and then
close that off and I'll explain more
about Hawkes basically there are two
different types of hooks there are
action hooks and there are filter hooks
action hooks as you can see here this is
an action hook executes a specific
function whenever a specific event
occurs this is the event whenever
widgets are initialized this function is
going to be executed and some of the
other common things to put inside of
here are these guys right here admin
head this occurs in the head section of
your WordPress site and basically what
occurs is whenever the head sections
upon try to close it says oh by the
before I close would you like me to run
some different functions then you have
admin and NIT and again this occurs in
your dashboard
whenever the dashboard is loaded that's
why it says it meant right here then you
can also trigger different functions
whenever comments are posted whenever
you create new categories whenever
WordPress has finished loading
whenever a post is published whenever
the theme is switched whenever a new
user registers on your site so for
example you might want to be emailed
whenever a user registers on your site
something like that
WP footer n WP head again these are all
set up inside of WordPress and they are
ready to be used and then you have
filter hooks what filter hooks do is
they change content in WordPress before
it is either displayed on your screen or
before that content is saved in your
database and you create a filter hook by
typing an ad filter instead of typing in
add action whoever you would type in
your filter hook right here which is
gonna be more than likely one of these
guys these are the most common filter
hooks that exist in WordPress and then
follow that up with the function you
want to call and then you could type in
priority if you'd like to I normally
don't but it's totally up to you and
again if you'd like to change or filter
or in any way comments before they're
displayed on the screen this is the guy
that you would want to look for so you
would come in here and copy this and
inside of quotes type in that and
followed by the function that would edit
the comment in one way or another again
whenever categories are retrieved here's
the content here's RSS content permalink
you can add to and change these in any
way but in this tutorial I'm not really
gonna go into filters I will cover that
in a later tutorial so let's jump back
up here into the code section and I'm
going to continue to write all of the
code needed to make this plugin work
first I'm gonna jump into the
constructor which is again gonna
initialize everything and every single
time he's going to type in widget
options and then you're gonna create an
array in here and you define class name
and this is going to be the class name
that is added to your widget that's
gonna surround everything and I'm just
gonna come in here and put this guy
inside of here which is my widget and
then you're gonna put in description and
what description does is it describes
what the widget does on the widget admin
page so the part where you're able to
drag the widget around and have it go
wherever you want it to go and I'm just
gonna say display is links to Facebook
Twitter and RSS and then there's another
thing you can do inside of this guy and
that is to provide the option so that
this code or this text can automatically
be translated into other languages and
to make that happen all you do is put
two underscores and surround it just
like that now WordPress will
automatically translate this into other
languages if needed that's a nice little
thing to have then what we need to do is
call the parent constructor and how you
do that is just parent colon colon WP
widget and then you're gonna come in
here and type in the name of your widget
NTT social network links description and
then you're gonna type in widget options
and that's it so in the widget options
obviously came from this array where you
initialized everything up here and there
you are the constructor is done now you
can jump into the part that's actually
going to display everything on your
screen again and like I said before
that's the function called widget and
you pass different arguments that widget
needs to display and end as well
instance represents the actual widget
itself so the first thing we're gonna do
and you're going to do this almost every
single time is extract all the different
variables that are stored inside of args
and then we're gonna put in extr SK IP
- widget and it's going to separate them
and put them into their own local
variables and this guy right here helps
avoid confliction all right and what
we're gonna do
goto title and the title is gonna be
what is displayed so before I said
follow me that's what titles get end up
man so we're gonna go instance inside of
this array and we're gonna assign a
value to the title so it'll display and
how we do that is we're gonna ask it
does instance currently have a title
defined and what I mean again just so
you understand here right here is what
I'm talking about title and then the
Facebook ID and the Twitter idea what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to say did
they type in a title if they did use it
if they didn't I'm gonna give it a
default title so that's what it's saying
does it have a value if it does then
keep that value and if it does not give
it a to
fault of follow me so that's all that's
doing right there so now we're gonna do
exactly the same thing for the Facebook
ID and the Twitter ID so I'm gonna say I
want you for Facebook if it has not been
set to have a default and then the
default that I'm gonna use I'm actually
gonna type my own in here and then we
got to do the same thing for Twitter
okay then I'm actually going to close
off the PHP code area that's what I'm
doing there scroll this guy up cause I'm
gonna be jumping in and out of HTML and
PHP so that's the reason why I closed
that off then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna echo to screen before widget and
you're gonna do this every single time
what these are are tags that are created
specifically for WordPress and it's to
help keep all the themes compatible so
this is always gonna be there and you're
gonna come in here and type in before
underscore title again this is a
wordpress specific thing you always want
to do it and then you're gonna type in
your title again you're always gonna do
this
after you don't and you're always gonna
do this so that those two lines of code
are always gonna be there actually most
of what I type here is always gonna be
here you're just gonna change a couple
things here and there and inside of here
I'm gonna show you exactly how to access
images that you have in your images
folder that's why I separated this out
so I'm gonna say the value for NTT feed
icon is going to be equal to and if you
call this function plugins URL it's
going to kick back the location of the
images folder and more specifically the
logo that you're trying to grab so
you're just gonna type in images forward
slash RSS underscore logo not paying
because that's the name of my image that
I want to get ahold of and then
underscore underscore fil e this is a
reference to this guy that I'm making
right here
NTT link to social network this is an
actual link to this file so that it gets
the images folder that resides in the
same place as this file does so again if
you're trying to access images you're
always gonna do it this way so that's
great if you have any questions or
comments leave in the comments section
below I'll be more than happy to help
you answer any questions that you have I
wouldn't be doing this at all if I
wasn't really trying to help people okay
so there I'm typing in my facebook one
and I'm leaving everything else the same
and here I'm going to type in Twitter so
it's jumping out there and getting those
different images for me and then I type
in Twitter here
so that I can get my logos have them all
saved in one place and then I'm gonna
close off that PHP section and then I
get into the meat of what we're doing
here I'm gonna actually going to print
out the icons and attach the links to
the locations here and how you do that
you come in here and go eh reference I
want to create a link that is equal to
and I'm gonna call theirs inline PHP
it's why I close the PHP off and when I
go blog info and I'm gonna use this
function to ask it for the URL for my
RSS feed it's right like that
what I was doing there so close that off
and then I gotta go get my image which
is gonna be my RSS logo and I'm gonna
echo to screen this guy right here so
this is the location for that logo so
just paste it it goes right there okay
I'm gonna close that off and close off
that part of the PHP code and close that
guy off and then I'm gonna type in
height is equal to 50 pixels width is
equal to 50 pixels close that off and
close off the link itself and then for
the most part I can just copy this guy
so let's come in here copy that
and I gotta do the same thing for
Twitter and Facebook on the one thing
that's gonna change of course is not
this because your blog does not have a
special variable for the location of
Twitter so just take all this PHP code
inside of there and delete that out and
then instead you're gonna type in HTTP
colon forward slash twitter.com forward
slash here's where your PHP code comes
from and you'll want echo and we're
gonna say instance and we're going to
pull in whatever they typed in the
widget box whenever they drug this guy
over there okay so that typed in their
twitter ID and we're gonna put that in
there for them and we'll close that off
then you have image source and here all
we need to do is come in here and type
in Twitter and everything else is the
same
and then here again we're gonna get rid
of this PHP code and actually to cheat
I'm gonna come in here and copy all this
right up to this guy right there where
the image source is yeah and I'm gonna
paste that in there and instead I'm
gonna type in Facebook in there with
open facebook here and my spot right
there you go and Facebook and everything
else is exactly the same there and I
want this RSS feed to actually come up
first so I'm gonna paste it in there
first okay so
they'll show ups there that makes the
logos pop up and whenever those little
goes are clicked it's gonna take you to
the defined website then you have to do
something again that you're always gonna
have to do and that is echo out the
variable after widget and then PHP and
this is gonna end this function right
here if you want to know exactly what
after widget does and all these
different things here you go right there
that's what they look like whenever
they're printed out the screen it's just
basic things that WordPress requires to
make sure that all the themes are
compliant so that's just so that you
know exactly what those different
variables contain and again link in the
underbar all this code and a lot more
commenting and then again your also this
is gonna trigger errors if you don't do
this I'm gonna come in here in PHP and
I'm gonna take out all these spaces here
that are in front just to make sure that
doesn't trigger any errors because it
will and then I'm gonna jump into update
and again what this does is it just
saves everything that has been entered
so it saves the Facebook ID and the
Twitter ID and all those different
things that's all this is gonna do and
you're gonna let it actually do a lot of
the work old instance and instance is a
reference to this widget object that you
created and what we're doing here is
assigning the value that was entered in
the widget area in shinning this guy
this is what I keep talking about over
and over again so we're gonna take
whatever value was entered in there and
we're gonna run it through stripped tags
just to make sure that nothing dirty
gets through and by dirty I don't mean
smutty I mean potentially dangerous for
your website coming here again until you
pin Facebook and then type in Facebook
and then type in Twitter and then type
in Twitter and then say return instance
and just doing that is going to save
everything that you had changed
previously so now we get to actually
create this guy here that I keep talking
about and it's actually fairly easy to
do let's scroll this up we're
dangerously close to being done here I
want to set all my default values so
call default and these are the default
values for the widget I'm gonna set
title to follow me and I'm gonna set
Facebook equal to my name or my Facebook
thing whatever alright so they're just
sets all my defaults for all those
variables inside of there then I want to
grab all these widget values that have
been saved and merge them together and
save them
instance how you do that is how you
merge them all together as you call a
function called WP parse args and you
convert all this stuff into an array
instance and you pass along the defaults
that you just defined and you say title
you are now equal to an instance taking
all those values that they set in the
thing that I keep opening it up over and
over again and set them inside of here
Facebook Facebook Twitter and Twitter
and then we're gonna close off our PHP
section and then we have to create the
form elements needed to set those values
and again this is gonna be pretty much
just doing the same thing copying and
pasting over and over again and I'm
gonna surround this with a paragraph tag
I'm gonna type in title that's what
shows up the word title and then I'm
gonna type in input and I'm just gonna
put class is equal to and I normally
just type in whatever inside of here
again this is for styling purposes if
you would want to style this stuff I
don't think I ever have found a reason
to style but if you'd like to there you
are you're able to style this in the
widget section then you're gonna echo
out here any title if it has been
created and if not the default would be
used in this situation so that's just
fire in that title that was or was not
defined into that box ahead of time so
that the person knows hey it's already
in there I don't need to put it in again
that's all that's doing close that off
and this is gonna be a text box and it's
going to have a value echo and you're
gonna run this through the escape
attribute function it's just again
scrubs for potentially harmful text that
could potentially be entered in there
that's all we're doing with that and
we'll put title insider here close that
off and then close off the PHP field was
off the image tag and close off the
paragraph tag and guess what you get to
go and copy and paste to your heart's
content again come in here this guy can
stay the same obviously until you've
been something different here Facebook
ID here you're gonna type in facebook
down here you're gonna save in facebook
I like that and then down here you're
gonna type in Twitter ID here you're
gonna type in Twitter and then here you
go and there you are and what are you
gonna do well since this closed off to
PHP so actually you have to reopen a PHP
section to be able to close off the rest
of this guy and then this is again the
clothes
of the class itself and remember no
space before these PHP tags let me go
sure and make sure that I don't have any
other ones that are like that looks like
you got them all cleared up and then you
get them want to file save that and if
you go into your plugins section you
won't see version two popped up it's
right inside of there and you just want
to have to hit activate and then like I
showed you before here's the widget area
you type in whatever you want it's safe
jump out to sample website and there it
is
everything is all set up so that is how
you make a sample widget inside of
WordPress if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below again there's a link to
the code in the underbar feel free to do
whatever you want with it and there will
be other lot more tutorials on plugins
and widgets in regards to WordPress
coming up till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
