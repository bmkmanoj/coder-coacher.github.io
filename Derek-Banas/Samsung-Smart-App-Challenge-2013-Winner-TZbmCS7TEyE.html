everybody remembers I did a big
promotion for the samsung smart app
challenge so I thought it would be fun
to take a look at who actually won and
talk about why they want now this
specific smart app challenge was geared
towards utilizing the galaxy s4 in one
way or another as well as samsung cord
which we're going to take a look at here
in second the app makers received over
800 thousand dollars first place
received two hundred thousand dollars
three second-place winners received a
hundred thousand dollars eat and maybe
even more important those winners also
are going to maybe gain additional
investment from Samsung receive
invitation to developer events most have
been included on the Samsung App Store
and also to me all kinds of other
promotions in regards to press releases
and mentions and videos and so forth now
the main goal for those developers was
to make an application that specifically
used the s4 device of course and also
utilize Samsung cord in one way or
another I thought it would be fun to
demonstrate how cord works by showing
how apps in this competition used cord
cord basically allows devices to easily
discover and connect to each other and
once those devices are connected they
can easily share data messages files and
even cameras as you can see here the
game party party allows for players to
effortlessly connect and play fun party
games together shared lens which was
another app in this competition allows
you to share cameras with another user
and another app which I'm not showing
right here is called buddy film and it
allows users to share cameras as well in
many different interesting ways as you
can see right here if I want to just
point my camera at something and show it
to somebody I can just do it it's easy
clouds and sheep which is actually my
wife's favorite app of the bunch allows
you to raise cute little sheep and then
send them to your friends or you can
take a picture of your cute little sheep
and send those your friends as well
quite effortlessly dots out the winner
of this contest allows the user to
easily with a click of a button play
with other players either online or also
play locally trans wing also allows two
devices to easily connect four
group chat situations as you can see I'm
just clicking a couple buttons and these
guys connect directly to each other you
can either type in what you want to say
to the other person or speak into the
microphone what you want sent and also
translation services are available okay
so now that you know all the different
things that cord can do let's talk about
the winner which was dots out and you
may ask yourself well why exactly did
dots out win well John Biggs a tech
journalist at TechCrunch said it was
modern and clever timro a venture
capitalist loved it because it was easy
to understand and he also based off of a
bunch of comments he makes seems to
value the opinion of his two children
who call it the best game ever Mimi o
Chun who is an expert in interface
design love the simplicity of dots out
she also enjoyed the tactile feedback of
the game and felt that its minimalist
you I was in vogue Kip wojtek and
advertising analysts said it was a nifty
game that combined pool asteroids and a
catapult which he loved playing and the
final judge Jeff Haney the CEO at
appcelerator like the simple interface
however he thought it needed a better
help system so what will I think after
trying out every single one of these
apps and playing them and having my kids
play them and have my wife blade them I
don't think dots out one because it was
the best looking game nor do I think it
one because it had the best mechanics I
personally think that clouds and sheep
looks much better as much better
mechanics is a ton of fun to play but I
think dots out had the best replay
ability of any app in this contest quite
simply dots out as the app that has the
best chance of staying on your device
over the long term it's universal like
tic-tac-toe it's almost like a utility
app the two friends can pull out and
start playing instantly when they're
bored the online features provide you
with the opportunity play for a couple
of minutes when nobody's around and it's
a great pass and play game as well as a
shared Wi-Fi game anyone can figure out
how to play it in a few seconds but to
get good at it requires strategy
thoughts out is just basically a game
that can take seconds learn but months
to master
if you'd like to learn more about the
different tools the Samsung SDK provides
I have a link to my videos on the
Samsung SDK in the description below the
video and I'm also going to take a
further look at the other winners in the
samsung smart app challenge and of
course a link to all the winners is also
available in the description I hope you
guys enjoyed this please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
