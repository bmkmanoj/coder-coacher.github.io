8 of my learn to program series in this
part of the tutorial we're gonna cover
reading and writing to files tuples and
a little bit more with recursive
functions if you haven't watched any of
the previous tutorials I provided a link
here in the video you can click on that
look at the previous ones because we
were getting progressively more complex
as we go on and also in the description
underneath the video you will find a
link to a transcript as well as all the
code that is heavily commented to go
along with this video to make it easier
to learn and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it
alright so very first I'm gonna cover
here is reading and writing text to a
file now I'm going to import a module
and this is going to be the OS module
it's here just to help us manipulate
files as you're gonna see as the
tutorial progresses onwards not the
great thing about being able to read and
write files is we'll be able to store
data for later use even whenever our
applications no longer running and
you'll be able to create or use an
already created file with a function
call to open but first off we're gonna
start off by typing width and we start
the code with width and in doing so it's
going to guarantee the file will be
closed if the program should crash for
some reason and then we're gonna type in
open which is gonna allow us to open our
file then we're going to type in the
file that we want to work with inside of
quotes after that we're going to put it
down mode and we're gonna put W inside
of here and whenever we put W inside of
here that means that it's going to
overwrite anything that is already
inside of the file if we would want to
append to the end of the file we would
put a inside of there but we don't want
to do that we just want to overwrite it
and then we're going to define that our
encoding is going to be utf-8 and we
already talked about unicode characters
and basically whenever we define that we
want to use utf-8 what that is saying is
that we want to store our text using
Unicode and like I said where numbers
are going to represent a whole wide
range of different characters we're
going to work with going to then at the
end of this define where we're going to
store this file object
and put a colon at the end of that and
here we can start working with it so you
can write to the file I there's actually
a bunch of different ways I'm just gonna
show you one way here you can write to
the file by just referencing your file
object and following that up with the
write method and then we're going to
type in some random text inside of here
and we're gonna put a new line inside of
there cuz right doesn't automatically
put new lines inside of there and then
we'll say more random text and another
new line and some more so just some
chunk information we just want to throw
inside of there all right so we wrote to
the file now what we can do is we can
come in and open the file for reading
and you're gonna do that in much the
same way you're going to say open and my
data and get the text file inside of
there and here you don't have to define
the mode you want to work with because
it is automatically going to be read if
you don't put anything inside of there
and we can come in and say my file once
again and put a colon
now you're gonna be able to read data in
a few different ways there is a read
method there is also a read align method
and then there is a read lines method
now the read method is going to read
everything into one string up to it gets
to a new line so it's gonna read all of
that stuff readin line is going to read
everything including all your new lines
and with string and reading lines is
going to return a list of every line
which is also going to include all of
your new lines I'm gonna use read here
just start off and let's say that I want
to come in and I want to print out a
line of text I just go my file and then
call for read and if I run that you're
going to see it some random text and
data data and all of that stuff prints
out on our screen now reading everything
in a file into a single string might be
a good thing or it might be a bad thing
depending upon how much data you're
reading into it now you can come in here
and then check because there is a closed
method but
we were using with here it's
automatically gonna close it and I'll
prove that right now we can come in here
and check if my file is actually closed
or not by the width method and you can
see comes back as true meaning that the
file has been closed a couple other
different methods we have here we can
get the file name associated with our
file objects just by typing your name
and you can see my data text comes back
we're also able to come in here and get
the mode for our file so we can just go
mode and this is going to be the last
used mode and you could see it comes
back as our or read now getting to our
OS modules that we have available to us
that we went up here and brought that
inside here these are the some of the
functions that are provided you could
come in here and go rename and rename my
data text into something else like my
data to text and that's going to update
the name inside of your operating system
you're also going to be able to come in
here and remove anything you'd like to
remove or any files you'd like to remove
as long as you have permission to do so
of course and we'll just go my data and
text let's say we decided to delete that
altogether you're also going to be able
to create directories inside of here so
say one to go my directory that would
create a directory we could also delete
or change a directory just type OS CH
dir and that would allow us to change
into the new directory that we just
created and we would also be able to
come in here say we wanted to find out
what the current directory is before we
would move into it or move around within
our filesystem we could do that and just
go OS and get CD CWD run that whoops
what's giving me an error for here I
typed in my date instead of my data run
it again and there you can see it went
through and you can also say that the
current directory is my directory so you
know that directory was created and we
moved into it and you could also command
and remove a directory but the very
first thing you're gonna want to do is
move backwards one directory so we're
gonna come in here and first off move to
the directory below where we currently
are so it's going to move down into the
PyCharm projects out of my directory and
we can come in here and just to prove
that that actually is working it's
probably gonna get me an error
yeah gave me an error because dr. da da
da and it gave me an error because I
tried to create a directory all that
already exists just do that and you can
see here we move downwards the directory
and then we could also come in here now
and remove a directory like this and say
we wanted to get rid of the my directory
that we actually created and we could do
so there's a rundown of some of the
things we're gonna do a couple more
things with files here in a moment but
what I'd like to do now is jump over and
answer a question I received and do our
first problems of the day now in the
previous part of the tutorial we figured
out how to create Fibonacci sequence
numbers and here is the function that we
use previously and if you don't remember
basically what we did was we went in
here and translated this basic
definition for defying the numbers that
are going to fit into the Fibonacci
sequence and you can see how easy that
was to do just by referring to what we
have here and moving this up here and so
forth and so on one of you guys asked me
how to display a whole bunch of them in
a row
and so I thought well that would
probably be a good problem for us to
solve so basically our goal here is to
take this basic Fibonacci function and
figure out how to define values so
basically what we're gonna do is we're
going to ask them how many values should
be found and they're gonna type in a
number and then it's going to output in
a list all of those different numbers
and whenever it gets to the very end of
the list it's gonna type out all done so
you could pause the video right now and
give that a go I pretty sure you should
be able to do it otherwise I will give
you a couple hints alright so basically
what we're gonna need to do is ask how
many numbers they want I'm sure you can
do that then what we need to do is come
in here
and loop and while looping so we're
gonna loop while calling for each new
number and we're gonna call this
function up here to execute and then we
are going to print the result and
increment the value that is going to be
used for this loop so we'll come in here
first and once again pause the video
give it a go
otherwise I'm gonna show you how exactly
I would do this so what we gonna do ask
how many numbers they want so that's
real simple I'm just gonna say no
Molly's is equal to I'm going to cast
the string that they enter inside of
here using input into an integer and I'm
gonna do exactly what it said previously
how many Fibonacci values should be
found all right so then we're gonna get
that then we're gonna come down here and
we're gonna loop while we continue to
call that function to execute so the
very first thing we need to do and
whenever we're using a while loop is to
define the value that's going to be
incremented and then we're say while I
is less than the num of fib values that
they said they want I'm going to call
the fib function so I'm gonna just call
this fib value is equal to and I'll just
call fib and pass in the value of I
which is going to be incremented um then
going to print out the fifth value on
the screen and then of course I'm going
to increment the value for I and you may
or may not remember at the very end of
it it says all done and that's it that's
all we need to do let's come in here and
execute how many Fibonacci values should
be found and we'll type in 20 are you
gonna see that it went through and
automatically calculated all those for
us so pretty neat hopefully you got that
guy right and now what I'm gonna do is
show you how to read one line at a time
using files
alright so previously we pulled all the
files into one string this time we're
going to read them one by one so how you
do that is once again we're going to use
with and open and I'm going to call this
my data to dot txt we're going to define
our
in coding once again utf-8 and since
we're reading data we don't have to put
anything else I'm gonna store this in my
file just like I did previously and now
I'm gonna come in here and I actually
want to print out on the screen what
line is being read so that we can see it
a little bit better so to track that I'm
going to keep track of line number I'm
then going to use a while loop that is
going to loop until the data is all read
because I don't know how many times I
need to loop but I know I want to loop
that normally means I need to use while
true and then inside of here use a break
statement to jump out whenever a
condition occurs so I'm going to use
read line to grab the very first line
that's available so I'm gonna go my file
dot read line and that's gonna read one
line at a time up to the new lines like
I said previously then I can say if not
line which basically means if line
doesn't have any data see we're gonna be
looping through each line one by one and
in a situation in which line comes back
with no results meaning there's no more
lines of data to read well in that
situation we want to stop reading data
so that means we want to use a break
statement so that's gonna get us out of
our while loop then what I want to do is
come in here and I'm gonna print line
and then after that I'm gonna print the
current line number that is being
incremented and then after that I am
going to turn out that line and then I'm
also going to call for there not to be a
new line and then I will increment the
value for line number and if I come in
here and run this guy it's gonna come in
and give me an error because with all my
diddling with the OS functions I must
have deleted it so let's go and put that
information back inside of there and
there that is and now we can run it
again and there you can see it printed
out line one some random text more
random text and some more so there we
were able to go in and read at one line
at a time and the reason why this is
going to be useful is with the next
problem what I want you to do is I want
you to cycle through each line that is
going to be output and then output the
number of words per line
and also the average word length so
pause your video and try to solve that
problem otherwise I'm going to show you
how to solve it okay so we're gonna do
something quite similar here I'm going
to go and track the line number I'm
going to of course read data from the
file I'm gonna use while true once again
to cycle through because I don't know
how many lines up front we're gonna be
dealing with will be using read line to
read one line of text at a time we'll
also come in here and we will break out
as soon as there is no more information
this guy however is going to change and
what I'm going to actually print out
here is that I'm gonna get each one of
those lines and how do i if you can
remember from previous parts of the
tutorial do I take a string and split it
into a list well I kind of gave you the
answer we're going to be using the split
function to split that out I said one of
the requirements is I find out the
number of words that are going to be
available to us inside of each line and
I can use the length function to find
out that then what I want to do is cycle
through each one of those characters
well cycle through what's that mean I'm
going to have to loop and I'm going to
count the characters in the list meaning
each of the individual words in the list
in the let's say word list and then I
also wanted to find out the average
length of each of the words inside of
each line that we're going to be
analyzing so what am I going to do here
I'm going to divide the character count
by the length of our word list
so let's come back up here and let's
just do it so after break just to define
how the information is gonna go on the
screen I'm gonna go print and I'm gonna
say line and then I'm gonna print out
line number on our screen and then
underneath of that I want to print out
all the other different things but first
thing I want to do is I want to split
all of the words into a list and to do
that I'm gonna call word list is equal
to and I can get each individual line
this is where line comes from and then
just call split on it
I can get the number of words that I
want to print out on the screen so I'm
just gonna do it right here I'm gonna
say print number of words and I can call
the link function like I said before and
password list inside of it I'm then
going to be looping through the
characters in our word list and I want
to count how many characters there are
so I'm gonna say character count and
we'll start off at 0 then after that I'm
going to be cycling through I'm going to
go through my word list this guy up here
the list that I generated and I'm gonna
get each individual word and then I'm
going to cycle through each character in
each individual word it's a little bit
trickier and then I can go character
count and increment that every single
time there's a new character in each of
the individual words so now I got all
the data that I need but I need to get
the average so I'm going to call this
average number of characters and I'll
just go character count divided by the
length of our word list then I'm gonna
print out this information and then
we're doing a division here which means
there's a good chance we're going to get
a float so I'm going to expect that
there's a float that's gonna be coming
so I can go average word lengths and
then I can use the format options that
are available just go colon dot - let's
say I want to make that just two decimal
places output on our screen and then I
can come in and get the average number
of characters and then of course the
line number is going to be incremented
each time and we run that and you can
see it work came through on line one we
have number of words comes back it's
three average word length is four point
seven three four point seven three three
point seven so hopefully you guys that
got that guy right if not that's okay
and my hope for you is that you just
understand what's going on here and if
you see enough problems being solved
you're gonna get better at solving
problems so now to finish off the
tutorial I'm gonna take a look at what
are called tuples alright so a tuple is
just like a list the only thing that's
different is that their values cannot be
changed inside of the lists and tuples
are going to be surrounded with
parentheses instead of the square
rockets that you have seen previously so
let's come in here and define a tuple so
we'll go in here and throw some values
in here and there you go you just
defined a tuple and like I said once
these values are set they cannot be
changed and when would you use a tuple
instead of using a list well whenever
you don't want the values to change just
as simple as that and you're gonna get
in a situation where if you want to get
a value of course you're going to use
indexes just like you did with lists so
let's say I want the very first value
inside of here not a problem just go my
tuple and there 0 indexes just like
lists are can also come in and use
slices we can say my tuple and let's say
that we want to get the very first item
inside of the tuple up to but not
including third that's how that's done
we can also come in and get the length
or the number of values stored in our
tuple using the length function just
like we did previously
it's a length and then throw in my two
pool we're also going to be able to come
in here and concatenate or join tuples
so I'll just say my tuple and then we
can create a tuple inside of here I'll
say something like 13 21 and 34 will
then also be able to check if a value is
inside of a tuple so I'll say something
like 34 in tuple and it's gonna give us
a true or false value and a check you
just say 34 in and I'm going to check
for my fibs going to be able to iterate
these guys on almost exactly the same
way in and then we'll just call this
more fibs
and print I let's run it to see what's
going on okay you can see right here
first value is 1 here we grab the first
three values tuple length is 5 digits
and you can see it's 5 digits is 32 in
the tuple yes it is and also you can see
right here we were able to easily
iterate through our tuple yeah let's do
a couple more things you're also going
to be able to convert a list into a
tuple so let's just call this a list is
equal to and they're gonna have the
square brackets of course 89
and 144 and to convert a list into a
tuple let's just call this a tuple
you're just gonna type in tuple and then
pass in your list of course you're gonna
be able to convert a tuple into a list
let's go a list is equal to list a tuple
and finally you're gonna be able to get
the minimum and maximum value inside of
a tuple so just go men by using the min
function in tuple and if you can get the
men guess what you're probably gonna be
able to get the maximum value also and
guess what you just type in max trol are
and you can see I grab the minimum
number as well as the maximum number
there you go guys that is a rundown of
how we can both read and write files as
well as how to use tuples a little bit
more in recursive functions and a whole
bunch of different problems new videos
every Wednesday and Saturday in the
morning and please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
