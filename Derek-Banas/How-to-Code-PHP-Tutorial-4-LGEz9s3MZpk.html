4 of my how to code PHP tutorial today
I'm going to cover functions describe
you what scope means cover a whole bunch
of date and time functions and talk to
you a lot about databases you've seen a
lot of built-in functions now you'll
learn how to make your own the basic
structure follows just like this you
first have the keyword function followed
by whatever the functions name is any
arguments that you want pass to that
function and then between curly braces
you would perform whatever actions you'd
like this function accepts two variables
these variable names don't have to match
the variable names that lie outside of
the function the body of the function
lies between curly braces and you can
perform any actions inside a function
that you can perform outside of it you
can return a value to the calling
statement with the return statement as I
did here this function could have been
called with a statement like the example
I have here on the right side of the
screen here I'm signing the value return
from the function add values to the
variable addition by passing two
variables to it being the number one and
number two you can send any variable
type to a function as long as you send
them in the proper order
by creating default argument values you
have a safeguard you can use to make
sure functions don't throw an error you
can define default values like this as
you can see here I'm defining a default
value for both the variable named first
num and second num if you define default
values and no arguments are sent the
default values are used if new arguments
are sent however then the default values
are ignored the variables you defined
within your functions are not available
outside of your function body this is
what we mean when we talk about scope
you could actually use the same variable
names inside and outside of your
functions but you might not want to do
that as it will cause confusion if you
do have a variable that you want to be
available throughout all of your code
define it as a global variable you do
that with the keyword global like I have
here in this example have the word
global followed by a variable name just
so you know a variable defined within a
function is called a static variable you
can get a lot of information on the date
time with the PHP engine the date
function is used to return you this
information and it has the following
function here are all the date codes
available for you to use with the date
function pretty much everything you can
think of that you'd want fast in regards
to date or time here is an example if we
would echo what to the date function
return based off of the codes we entered
here it would print out to the screen
that is currently 352 on Monday April
the 19th 2010 what's also just so
happens to be my daughter's birthday in
a future video I'll cover how to process
form data and then give you the example
code behind sending mail here I'll just
describe the function and how to use it
here is the basic format for the mail
function you have mail and then inside
of the brackets who you want to mail it
to what the subject should be what the
body of the email should be who it's
from being you if you wanted to put a
reply to and then there's two additional
variables here the CC and the BCC you
don't need to enter values for the reply
to cc or BCC I'll trust that you know
how to use email and won't go into what
those codes mean as long as your server
is set up right that is all you need to
do to send an email also if your server
has a default email set you won't need
to fill in a result for the from
variable before you can start querying a
database you have to connect to it here
is the code behind doing that you use
the function MySQL with an underscore
connect to create a reference in this
case the variable named EBS you can use
this to access the database you have to
pass it three variables being the host
address of the database the user ID and
password for the database if the
connection fails the or statement here
will print out an error message I'm
often asked how you would get a database
host address you would get that from
your hosting go now that you have a
reference for the database you have to
signal that you want to use the database
much as you do with the use command in
SQL if you didn't see my SQL tutorial
you should
most definitely check that out you tell
the database that you want to use it by
calling the following statement the @
symbol followed by a MySQL underscore
select underscore DB followed by the
database name and then we have a
conditional here that'll print to the
screen if an error occurred you
obviously want to keep the above
information private so make sure it is
in accessible privilege wise make sure
it has the extension dot PHP save it to
a directory that's outside of the root
directory and access it with the require
once function like I show here now
you're connected to your database so
I'll go over how you query the database
you can perform any query inside of PHP
that you can using the SQL terminal a
standard structure of a quarry in PHP
would be whatever you want to name the
variable name for your query result to
be added to followed by equals and then
MySQL underscore e and then whatever
your query would be normally it is
common to assign an SQL query to a
variable in this case the variable name
query and then send that query to the
MySQL query function here's a real-world
example what I'm doing here is
performing an insert into the table
named customer and I'm assigning the
values peekaboo followed by kiddie to
the variables first name and last name
when you query a database with these SQL
statements being insert delete alter or
update there is no value to return so
what is returned well if the query
processed properly you receive the value
true and false otherwise the MySQL fetch
array function is used to retrieve
information when a query generates it
you need to pass the value of quarry
underscore result to this function
inside of a while loop that will spit
out one record after another until there
are no more results here's an example of
that you can access the value of row
which is an array either by column name
or by entering a number that represents
the first through the number of total
columns returned and that's the end of
part
