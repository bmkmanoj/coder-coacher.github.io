8 of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm going to cover
regular expressions I've covered regular
expressions in another tutorial but it
was specific to Python
even though regular expressions are the
same no matter what language you use I
felt that I must do this with PHP but
this should help all of the people that
are sending me emails asking me
questions about how to search through or
parse through HTML code to find specific
information regular expressions is the
tool that you want to use and this part
of this tutorial is going to be very
specific I'm going to show you how to
find just about anything as you can see
here is a name there's an address
there's a state zip code phone number
I'm going to show you how to find all
these things even passwords complicated
things like that but to start off what
I'm going to be doing here is searching
through this array that I created that
it's full of a bunch of strings I'm
going to show you later how to search
through a string and I'm going to do the
most simplistic of all regular
expression searches I'm going to use the
Prag grep method this is the thing
that's going to be different with PHP
you're going to use preg grep with other
languages you're going to use other
methods then you want to surround
whatever you are searching for with what
is called a delimiter don't let that
confuse you I'm going to explain here in
a second what that is now if I'm
searching through this array from my
specific name this is the most
simplistic of all regular expressions
because I'm defining exactly what I'm
looking for and then then I follow that
up with the array I want to search
through and match name is going to hold
an array match name is actually an array
there's going to hold all of those
things that are found that match this
specific word or name that I'm searching
for so to find all the matches I'm going
to call the for each tool match name as
result trust you know what that means
because I covered that in the previous
tutorials but if you're using another
language that's perfectly fine as well
just focus in on the regular expression
part copy this break down here paste
that in I'll save it jump over here and
hit reload and you see that it located
my name inside of this array and printed
it the screen now whenever you're
looking for certain things inside of an
array for this example what you do is
you use certain codes to define what
exactly you are looking for so for
example if you
looking for a number the code you would
use is backslash D this would represent
any number from zero through nine okay
uppercase D would match anything that is
not zero or nine you're actually in
reality not going to use that very often
backslash W is going to represent any
character a through Z lower case and
upper case it's also going to match
numbers and it's also going to match
underscores capital W is going to
represent anything that is not that
backslash S is going to represent
anything that's a space or a white space
so it could be a tab or something else
uppercase s is going to match anything
that isn't that and backslash B is going
to match what are called word boundaries
so if we had hat and cat this would be
called a word boundary this space in
between these words now the backslash s
would also match that but let's chop the
cat off and this is still a space this
is not a word boundary however because
there's no characters to precede it
however it is still a space okay so
hopefully that's understandable and a B
uppercase B is going to represent
anything that is not a word boundary all
right so let's go in here now with that
knowledge that we have gained and let's
search for something a little bit more
complicated like for example to find
this zip code how would I do that well I
forgot to tell you about de limiters de
limiters in this case I'm using % you
can that is just something I define it
is going to be the beginning and the
ending of what I am going to be looking
for you can use many different de
limiters the most common delimiter that
people use is actually a forward slash
but you could also use an @ sign or hash
or a backslash or a tilde or a % which
is what I'm using in this situation or
an and or a single quote or a double
quote almost nobody uses single quotes
or double quotes because of the fact
that regular expressions are normally
surrounded by single quotes and double
quotes and that causes all kinds of
problems but you can use pretty much
anything you want that I showed you
right there I'm using % alright so what
I'm looking for however is these 5
digits and I only want to find
situations in which there are 5 digits
no more no less so I'm going to have a
backslash D then I'm going to show you
here again I'm going to use a curly
brace and put a number inside of it and
closing curly brace to define that I'm
looking for exactly five digits and if I
save that and then hit reload you can
see that it search through all of this
and found this specific guy right here
now back to these curly braces if you
want to define a certain number like for
example I used five so if you wanted to
say five digits you would do just as I
had here so you're going to say I'm
looking for five of whatever proceeds
what lies between these opening and
closing curly braces and the thing that
lies before this is a digit a number so
this is basically saying I'm looking for
five digits okay now if you wanted to
find instead one two five digits so you
want returned any results that match one
two five digits you would do this
specifically this is the minimum number
you will require where you will take and
this is the maximum number that you will
take and if you don't care about the
maximum but you do care about the
minimum let's say you only want returned
answers that only contain three digits
but you don't care about the maximum
this would also work and actually if I
put this up here it would return the zip
code as well all right let's go in here
and I'll show you how to find something
a little bit more weird like this guy up
here which is a character followed by a
star followed by a word boundary
followed by a digit followed by a space
all right so if we want to find that
very specific thing we're going to type
in backslash lowercase W which
represents characters and we're going to
denote here that I'm looking for zero or
more characters with this star doesn't
have anything to do with that guy right
there and I'm also gonna say I'm looking
for a word boundary followed by a digit
followed by a space and then I'm going
to say also with the dollar sign that
this is going to be the end of the
string so I'm going to explain what that
means if I'll say jump over here reload
and it found just that very specific
random string that I was looking for now
if you wanted to find that you want to
find for example I'm typing down here
zero or more characters you would put
down the character code followed by the
star sign which denotes zero or more of
what precedes it which would be a
character okay so that's what that does
and if you want to define the end of a
string you would
use the dollar sign that denotes that
the string has ended so if this went P
star word boundary number space and then
had more things this would not match if
you wanted to also denote that you
wanted the P to be the very first
character in this string you would
precede it with the caret symbol so that
would make sure that this was the
beginning and the end of the string
because the caret denotes the beginning
of the string and the dollar sign
denotes the end of the string I'm going
to give you a gazillion examples so if
you're a little tiny bit confused don't
worry about it you're totally going to
get this another thing you guys are
always looking for is information that
is stored between tags okay fine so
we're going to put the caret symbol in
here again and we're specifically going
to look for this text right here that's
what we want so we're going to denote
that the string that I'm looking for is
going to start off right here nothing's
going to precede it and then is going to
be followed by an opening tag brace and
then with the period I'm defining that
it is going to contain any type of
character possible except for a newline
star means one or more of those and then
we got our closing part for the tag and
here with these parentheses I'm defining
that I only want to take out what lies
between the tags and I do not want the
tags themselves okay so only what lies
between here is going to be sent and
stored in the match name array so in
here I'm going to define again but I
want returned any character that will
occur 0 or more times and then I'm going
to end this again with any character 0
or more times and a closing brace and
then put the dollar sign in here to say
that the string will at that point end
and if I go file save jump over here you
can see that it found that specific
thing and it only outputted random text
it did not output the tags that were
stored in this random array so again a
period represents anything but a newline
just like backslash d represent any
number or backslash W represents any
character or number star represents a
zero or more times whatever precedes it
dollar sign represents the end of the
string caret
since the beginning of the string okay
so I trust that you now are getting that
so let's give another example that's
maybe a little bit more confusing let's
say I wanted to find anything that
matched Jennifer Jenny or Jen inside of
this array up here how would I do that
introduce another new code and I think
you're getting the hang of the fact that
the percents are going to be surrounding
this so I'm going to say I'm looking for
specifically any string that begins at
the letters J E and then that end with
the letter N and I'm going to use the
pipe symbol to represent or and with the
letters n n I fer or end with the
characters and and Y and then I'm going
to put the closing bracket inside of
there and if I go file save jump over
here it's gonna output Jennifer Jenny or
Jen so it's going to find a hit you can
think of this bracket is going away but
that bracket is going to match Jen or
it's going to match Jennifer or it's
going to match Jenny that's what these
brackets do you put brackets in there
and they will allow you to return
results based off of if different
conditions are met so you could have
potential characters one or potential
character two or you get the point over
and over and over again and that's the
reason why I was able to go in here and
find results for anything they began
with the first three letters Jen now I'm
going to give you an and got another
example let's say I want to come in here
and get doctor but I do not want to
return results for Doug or dog what I do
that again and have the caret symbol
here to define the beginning of the
string
and I'm looking for the string to begin
with the two letters D and O and then
I'm going to use my brackets again
however I'm going to put a caret symbol
inside of them what this is saying that
I do not want results returned if do is
followed by the letter G or ug but I do
want it to return any other results that
match up so whenever you use these
brackets with the caret symbol at the
very beginning of it it's just like
saying you want everything that meets
these standards except for what you
define inside of it if I file save that
jump over here you can see the doctor
was
turned however Doug and dog were not
returned now let's say you wanted to
come in here and you wanted to be able
to get this address that is right here
well you just define exactly what it is
so it starts off the string and it's a
digit and let's just say to be safe
we're looking for anywhere from one to
five digits and then we expect there to
be a space we could put a word boundary
in here then we expect uppercase letters
between A to Z and we also would except
lowercase letters from A to Z that's
what we're doing right there or a period
put the period inside of there close
that off then we're going to use the
plus sign to signify that we must have
at least one character or one period
actually should be more but that's what
the plus sign does it's saying we want
we demand that there's at least one
character or period inside of here that
precedes this space that's what we mean
by the plus sign then we're going to say
we expect another space and we expect
that to follow with uppercase letters
between a to z lowercase letters A to Z
and a period and a bracket and we expect
this to represent Street Avenue any
different thing that could possibly come
up here and let's just say by default we
expect between two to seven characters
to follow that as well as periods and
then we expect the string to come to an
end and if we file save that jump over
here you can see that 1 2 3 Main Street
fits these requirements see when you
break these down this representing just
the digits that's just representing the
space this representing that which falls
after the number to represent the street
and this represents the street itself
meaning two to seven characters in
length it starts to become more
understandable now we'll go in here and
say we are specifically looking for
money meaning this guy right here so
it's going to start off with a dollar
sign however if we put a dollar sign in
here that's going to cause some
confusion because the interpreter is
going to represent and this is the end
of the string so what we need to do is
backslash that dollar sign or escape it
which I talked about escaping earlier in
a tutorial so now that's going to look
for a dollar sign and at the end of the
string then we're going to say that we
expect a
digit to show up and we expect those
digits to be between one two three
digits in length and then we may see a
comma we're not certain so we're going
to put a question mark in there that
means by putting the question mark in
there
that there may be a common expected
however there may not be a call expected
so it's going to find it if there's a
comma and it's also going to find it if
there isn't a comma then we expect
digits and then we expect between one
two three additional digits so the
maximum here would be just short of a
million would be the results that would
be returned and also in this
circumstance we're going to put single
quotes in here so it doesn't pay
attention to these back slashes and
we're going to file save that and reload
it and you can see that it was able to
go in here and find those numbers and
those specific characters that need to
be back slash we already know the dollar
sign needs it but the other characters
would be the hashcode
period caret star plus sign question
mark opening closing curly braces
opening and closing brackets back slash
or in parentheses so if you use any of
these if you're searching for any of
these guys inside of the irregular
expression you need to come in here and
back slash it and of course whenever
you're going to do that you also want to
use single quotes in the next part of
the tutorial going to go over even more
complicated things that you could find
with regular expression if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
