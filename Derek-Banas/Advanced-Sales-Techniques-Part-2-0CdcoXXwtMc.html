two of my sales and closing strategies
tutorial if you didn't see part one go
there now and watch it otherwise this
might be very confusing to do in this
tutorial I'm going to explain exactly
how to figure out why a specific person
will decide to buy from you everyone
makes the decision to buy in different
ways and today I'll explain how they do
this I'll also teach you how to get your
client to say it's like you're reading
my mind and if you ever do hear that
phrase from a client that is a definite
I want to buy your product or service
I'll also teach you how to figure out
how quickly the client will buy and how
to properly present your product first
you must understand the topic of
metaprogramming and what exactly
metaprogramming is metaprogramming are
the tools and techniques our brains use
to reason gather information decide on
preferences deal with stress emote react
to situations and make decisions that
last ones real important if you're a
salesperson here's the Metta program I
use whenever I am deciding if I want to
buy a product or not first I read
reviews online then I compare the item
to other items I've bought focus many of
my buying decisions on what the product
looks like gather as much information as
I can on the product recall my past
experiences with products similar to
this product think about problems this
product will solve and then focus on the
cost than the quality and finally
convenience of said product if all of
those things line up and make sense to
me I buy it if one of them does not that
might be the decision-making tool that I
use to decide to not purchase it what
you have to understand is a customer
won't believe your product is right for
them if you present using their chosen
representational system our patterns are
built in primarily on visuals what we're
told and simply through the use of the
product or feelings that the product
makes us feel if when you're talking to
a customer they're using a lot of
adjectives that focus on visuals such as
color two or three dimensions locations
distance size brightness contrast etc
you want to use the same types of
adjectives so that they will be able to
more easily understand what you're
saying
if they're adjectives are instead
focusing on
meaning louder soft sounds tone tempo
distance from sound clarity continuity
you want to completely focus in on those
adjectives and if those adjectives are
focused on feelings such as pressure
textures intensity weight temperature
shape and emotions you want to use those
same adjectives while you're describing
your product to them you can also
identify their chosen representational
system in buying by asking what lets you
know that you can believe a product is
right for you or do you value a product
because it sounds right looks right or
just feels right people differ
concerning how many times something must
gel with their representational system
before they make decisions as well for
some people something must feel right in
their chosen system just once other
people on the other hand will require
that it sounds right many times before
they'll make that same decision to buy
on average most people make decisions
because they look right these are visual
convincers 15% make the decision because
say a product sounds right 3 to 15% make
the decision to buy or not buy because
they just simply make sense and 12 to
15% make the decision to buy or not
based off of whether it feels right to
find out how many times someone needs
convinced just ask them how many times
does something have to prove itself
before you're convinced or how many
times do you need to see hear read or do
something before you think you are
competent in using it 8 to 10 percent of
people assume something will be right
for them and less proven otherwise these
are people that are very easy to sell
50% people can be persuaded to believe
anything if you just present believable
information in their chosen
representational system enough times I
told you how to figure out the
representational system and I told you
how to ask them how many times they need
shown in that chosen representational
system previously 25 percent of society
make decisions purely based on their own
personal time requirements being met
once they feel that they have thought
about something long enough they then
make the decision to buy or not for that
25 percent that are hard to sell because
they'll push you off to a later date
this is a tip that will help you make
the sale quicker if someone says they'll
get back to you in three months for
example they normally mean dramatically
less time than that
if you contact them and say three weeks
and reference that
feels like three months since they've
talked with you they will probably agree
and state that yes indeed they are ready
to make the decision to buy now 15
percent of people are almost never
convinced of almost anything these are
the people that go through life
mistrusting most people the only way to
try and convince these people is to tell
them that you're aware that they will
never be convinced and that no time will
feel like the right time to try
something different
so why don't you just give it a try
today people also are persuaded to buy
mainly by sorting it out themselves
getting opinions from people they know
or getting opinions from experts they
don't know if they sort it out
themselves reinforce that attitude by
saying in this example if it was a
visual client you can see the quality of
the product or compared the product to
others through photos if they're sold by
other people's opinions and you have
established good rapport more than
likely you are that person explain why
you think the product is best get others
to explain why it's best and then if
anyone is with them get those people to
also identify and notice positive
qualities about the product or service
if they're persuaded by expert opinions
you're probably an expert if you're
selling the product but you can also
give testimonials and show them reviews
to find out who can help you Sallah
product just simply ask when making the
decisions do you trust your gut
or do you rely on the opinions of other
people when you first meet somebody you
must quickly figure out whether the
client is interested in specifics or the
general picture specific people will
think you're trying to trick them if you
gloss over features general people on
the other hand will get forward if you
don't get to the point right at the
beginning of the presentation ask what
do you prefer the big picture or the
details then act accordingly if you ask
what are you looking to get from this
product they'll tell you how to sell
them more than likely if a person wants
to eliminate problems focus on how your
product will do that if on the other
hand they focus on using your product to
achieve a goal then talk about how your
products will help them achieve those
goals if the customer is firing
questions at you they want control so
just simply let them have it if you try
and wrestle control from them they will
fight with you instead probe them for
additional questions if they instead are
waiting their turn they want a show so
put on a whole entire presentation and
don't stop until they say yes I want to
buy this product then you must also
figure out what's most important
this customer cost quality or
convenience tomini cost is always most
important but remember you aren't
selling yourself you are selling the
customer who is in front of you the
easiest way to find out what matters
most to them is to show them a triangle
like I have here on the right now ask
them to place a dot that represents what
is most important then act accordingly
in your presentation while you're
conversing with the customer they will
either disagree with what you're saying
or compare your product to another
probably a competitor to deal with the
disagreeable x' just suggest the
opposite say for example here is the
perfect product for you but you probably
can't afford it they will then probably
proceed to explain how they can't afford
anything if it is the right product
people who compare your products to
others just process information by
comparing similarities they like that
with which they are already comfortable
don't ever fight with them and say that
they are wrong if they say something
like a television that is a television
so I'll just get the cheap one get them
to talk about things that are worth
spending more on get them to explain why
they made their last big purchase and if
you have gone over the above questions
you should know exactly how to handle
this issue as well import three of my
sales and closing strategies tutorial
I'm gonna go over identifying me it's
establishing the yes set testing rapport
and why customers say now if you have
any questions leave them in the comment
