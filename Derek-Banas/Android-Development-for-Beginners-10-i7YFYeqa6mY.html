10 of my android development for
beginners tutorial today we are going to
continue what we started in part 9 and
we're gonna focus in on completely
understanding how JSON data is stored
and structured and can be used inside of
your App Inventor apps if you didn't
watch part 9 you absolutely have to
because this is going to be one of the
most interactive tutorials I've ever
made you're going to need the
application that we had in pour 9 I'm
gonna do my best to simulate it but it's
gonna be a lot more fun and interesting
if you have the app in front of you and
I have an immense amount to do so let's
get into it ok so here we are this is
the new weather app and I have all the
blocks and I have descriptions for every
single thing here what I did was I went
ahead and I created all these new blocks
so they're gonna have a location they're
gonna have temperature weather I just
didn't want to put you through typing in
all those names cuz that's boring so all
you need to do is go location and then
you see over here if we cycle up its
called location label then underneath
the red are next to it I have a location
data label another horizontal
arrangement temperature label
temperature data label over and over and
over again the only other thing I added
it's a weather image yeah and as you're
gonna see here in a second that you're
gonna see what that's gonna be it's
basically just gonna be an icon
representing the current weather and I
went through and created all of these
different things here and before I
continue I just want to make it quite
clear in the description under this
video I'm going to have the location and
what I named it and then there's going
to be another label here and what named
it and so forth and so on so you'll be
able to create this on your own so you
don't have to sit here and watch me do
it and that's all that I did and then I
have the refresh button down here and
I'm gonna show you that that was the
last episodes homework I'm gonna show
you exactly how to make that if you
didn't go and look at it before and one
thing that I want to cover here because
I keep getting questions about it all
the time is padding and how to simulate
padding inside of App Inventor now you
can't put padding information for any of
these labels so if we come over here and
you're going to look no there's nothing
about
no there's nothing about padding so how
do we put padding around all these
labels to position things the way that
we want them well one way is to use a
transparent thing so for example let's
say that I want to put padding between
this image and the word today right here
how would I do it one thing I could do
is go into layout get a horizontal
arrangement bring it over here and drop
it right there then what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go to user interface and I'm
gonna get myself an image and I'm gonna
drop it into that horizontal layout
right like that and you can see the
image there then I can just come over
here and get a picture I'm gonna need to
upload a file and what this is is a
ten-by-ten transparent ping file so i'm
gonna choose file and there you can see
transparent ping and all it is is a
transparent thing file that's 10 pixels
by 10 pixels I'm gonna select it and I'm
going to import it and you can see there
it is and then if I want to put that gap
in there I can just come in here to the
weight which really isn't gonna matter I
could just say nothing horizontal
arrangement I'm probably don't want this
to fill parents okay and then go back
into the image and then if I want a 5
pixel gap between it I just type in 5
pixels hit OK and that is going to
create my 5 pixels of padding and then
of course if you are using the layout
table or the table Arrangements layout
you could of course arrange all these
different pieces throw transparent pings
inside of there between them and pad
away as much as you want so that is how
you handle padding now let's go and take
a look at the finished application ok so
in this tutorial this is what we are
going to make and how we are going to
get this data is by taking what we made
in the previous application and figuring
out how to decipher the JSON so that we
can get the exact information that we
want so in this tutorial like I said
we're going to be bouncing back and
forth between the application we made
previously and then numbering and
locating the data that we want inside of
the lists of lists and I'm gonna do it
over and over and over again so you'll
get it
all right so you know what the finished
application is going to look like so now
our job is to make the refresh button
work so we're gonna go back over into
blocks and you're gonna see everything
that we made previously and what I need
to do here is just make our refresh
button work so I'm gonna find the
refresh button right there click on it
and then I'm gonna say whenever it is
clicked
I want certain things to happen one of
those is that I want to set my global
latitude value which is going to be a
variable which is gonna be this variable
it's called latitude value I want to set
it with an updated
latitude so let's go and move this down
here and then grab that and drop it into
place I'm going to call the location
sensor and get the current latitude
let's scroll through here and there it
is there is the latitude I'm gonna drop
it right there then also previously on
the designer let's jump over into the
designer I'm also going to have a
latitude and longitude right here and if
we click right here you're going to see
that where is it there it is the name of
that label is latitude data label so I
want to set the value for our new
latitude there so let's scroll through
this latitude data label this right here
and I want to set the text for it drag
it right here to being equal to the same
thing as this so let's just duplicate
that and I could of course put the
variable inside of there but whatever
then I'm gonna do exactly the same thing
for the longitude so duplicate that drop
that right there duplicate this drop
that right there and then change this to
a longitude and we our longitude value
and this is going to be used for the URL
whenever we're pulling the data and this
is just going to be the information
that's gonna go in the label and then
get the longitude data label there it is
longitude data label got that set and
then of course change this to longitude
right there and of course change this to
launched it - there we go I have that
all set then one
do I don't know if I tried this before
or not I think it did yes I want to
check if the latitude is zero and if it
is not not equal to then I want to go
get my updated weather data and put it
on the screen so I'm just gonna
duplicate that grab that bring it down
here and throw it in where the refresh
button is and that is how we're going to
make the refresh button work so that
whenever it's clicked on it goes and
gets new weather data and that's it
that's the refresh button now what we're
gonna do is go take a look at the
application we made in part 9 of this
tutorial series and I'm going to walk
you through exactly how JSON data is
structured so that we will be able to go
and get the individual pieces that we
want all right so this is the
application that we made in the last
part of the tutorial and as we can see
here the important part is to figure out
how these lists of lists are organized
now creation date is going to be in
index 1 and creation date locals going
to be in 2 and what we're gonna do here
first is find our location and that is
gonna be stored inside of here because
that's gonna be pretty easy for us to do
and I'm gonna walk you through exactly
how to find all this information we're
gonna be spending a lot of time and data
but what we're gonna start off with
first is location which is list item 6
and this is gonna work best if you're a
little bit interactive with it so write
down the number 6 or type it into a text
editor and then what we're gonna do is
try to figure out how to get to the
Pittsburgh PA part which is right there
well the very first thing we're going to
want to do is not get location which
would be remember this is a list these
are the main list items and then this is
a list inside of the list so this is
list number 6 and the name for it is
location well we don't want a location
what we want is all of the list items
inside of location the list that is
called location so to get the list and
not the word location we then want to
get the second part of this list so this
is the list and list is called location
if we chose number 1 we would get the
word location instead we want the list
so we want to write down first 6 and
right down to so that's gonna get all
those items then what we want to do is
get area description which is going to
be Pittsburgh PA well that is the very
first item in our list so we want to
write down one so we have six we have
two and we have one write all those down
and then what you want to do is you
don't want area description you want
Pittsburgh PA so in that situation it's
not the first item it's the second item
so it all works down to 6 to 1 for the
first item and then 2 again for
Pittsburgh PA so let's go and take a
look at exactly how we do that and see
that it works ok so now that you saw
that what I opened up here is just the
raw JSON data and you can remember from
the last part of the tutorial where I
went and numbered each one of these
pieces of data and the very first thing
we're gonna get is the actual location
where we are getting weather from and as
you just saw that is the sixth item
there's location right there with my
sloppy six letter Road inside of there
and then specifically what we want is
area description which is Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania in this situation so let's
run through the raw data that we have
right here and explain exactly what the
codes are gonna be for us to get the
description first we're going to have
six then we don't want location we want
the actual list which is gonna be two so
we're getting this data right here and
then we want list item one which as you
just saw just a second ago pittsburgh PA
is list item one so just just put it one
inside of there so what we have is six
to one and then we want pittsburgh PA we
don't want area description so in this
situation in this part this is going to
be represented with one for a
description and pittsburgh PA is going
to be a two so that makes our last
number two and that is gonna be the code
we're gonna use to get pittsburgh PA so
let's go take a look at that in App
Inventor how exactly when we're gonna
structure that let's go and scroll down
inside of here and this is basically
like I went in here and just changed
these names so that we didn't have to
mess around with that previously what we
were doing was we were going in and
selecting list
item one and then list item two and list
item three we're no longer going to do
that because we're gonna be working with
lists of lists so let's just go and get
rid of that all together and let's jump
over into our JSON data and get our code
six to one - the only thing is here is
this is going to be flipped so we're
going to instead put to one to six
inside of App Inventor and that is how
we are going to get the actual location
so let's jump back over into App
Inventor and let's let let's look make
sure we know - 1 to 6 so 21 26 is what
we're looking for
alrighty so let's come in here that just
means we're gonna need a whole bunch of
these different things and let's take
this off here all together
21:26 is what we're looking for let's
duplicate that drop that right there and
we're going to get rid of the weather
data part here throw that in the trash
and it was 21 so let's so - and then
we're gonna need another one of them
so let's duplicate that 21 so we're
gonna put a 1 inside of here and then
let's duplex get this out of the way
duplicate again this is gonna be 26 -
and then the last one the 6th part is
gonna be this and that is going to get
our location data and we can very
quickly go over and take a look and make
sure that that indeed is getting our
location data ok and if we run our app
you can see right there that location
works so we know everything's working
alright so now that you know that that
works what we're gonna do now is go and
get our other information the next thing
we're gonna want to do is get our highs
and our lows for the day so I'm gonna
jump back over into the application and
walk you through exactly how to get that
alright so now what we want to do is get
highs and lows and how we're going to do
that is all the highs and lows that ax
is going to be stored in the 5th list
and that is called data so we're gonna
slowly work our ways down into the highs
and the lows the highs and the lows are
down here and they are referred to as
temperature so to find
we have to count our way through so the
first number we're gonna write now is
gonna be 5 which is 4 that guy right
there
the again just like before we don't want
the word data we want the list
associated or called data so then we're
going to write down a 2 then we need to
figure out exactly how far down inside
of here is the actual eyes and lows so
we are going to go hazard is going to be
the first so that's one hazard URL is to
icon link is 3 come down through here
pop is 4 and then temperature is 5 so
now we're gonna write down the number 5
so we have 5 for the main list item 2 we
don't want the name we want the list and
then 5 is going to be the fifth
temperature is the fifth item in this
list then we don't want the word
temperature we want the list itself so
we're gonna write down a 2 and then we
want to the very first item which is
going to be today's high which is going
to be 25 so we're gonna write down 1 so
it all works down to 5 to 5 to 1 so
let's go and take a look at exactly what
that looks like and then of course the
low is just gonna be 9 all right so we
have today's high and today's low and
we're going to pretty much do exactly
the same things we just did before get
these list items get this list item I'm
just gonna duplicate this whole entire
thing bring it down here today's high
data label drop it right there and then
we just need to plug in the specific
code in this situation that's gonna be
one zoom in here make sure you can see 2
5 and then this one let's get out of
here
grab that duplicate it put this right
here and then it's gonna be two and then
it's finally going to be 5 and there you
go and to get the low it's the next item
in the list it's gonna be very easy to
grab that let's just duplicate this drop
it in for the low and it's the second
item in the list so the only thing we
need to change here there's this one and
there we go and that's gonna work for us
great now what we're gonna do is go and
get the actual descriptions
for this so let's go take a look at
exactly how we're gonna do that inside
of our app okay so this time what we're
gonna be doing is getting the actual
text which is gonna be like an
abbreviation of what the weather is
expected to be today so that is in data
also just like before so we're gonna
write down a five then we're gonna go to
because we don't want the word data we
want the list then we have to count
through here so hazards one hazard URLs
- icon is three cycle through this pop
is for temperature is five text is sext
so we're gonna write down five to six
and then we need to get the light snow
likely da-da-da-da-da we don't want text
so we're going to write down a two and
then we want the first item in the list
which is light snow likely
so we're gonna write down that and then
of course whenever we want tonight's
weather we're going to say that we want
the second item which would be five to
six to two so the first item is gonna be
five to six to one and the next time is
gonna be five to six to two alright so
now we know how to get our descriptions
so what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna
duplicate this whole entire thing drop
it right there and duplicate drop this
right here and duplicate and drop this
right here there we go and then we saw
the codes that were used to get those
before they're just going to be one two
that still works six two and five all of
those are going to work perfectly so
actually you know what just take this
out here and trash it
because we have one description after
another we can just come in here and now
duplicate it now we know we got the very
first description weather description
for whatever the day and duplicate this
again and now if we want the second
description all we need to do is change
this guy right here to two and we went
to third one come in here grab this one
change that to three and that's going to
grab just that very specific piece of
information that we're looking for and
now let's go and take a look at exactly
how we're gonna get temperature and the
data label and windchill and all of
these other different things all right
now we're going to be getting into
current observation which is probably
going to be the most
in part because we're going to be
getting a ton of data out of this so
we're going to want temperature 19 we're
going to want relative humidity which is
our e LH their dewpoint Gus we want all
that information so the vast majority of
what our app is going to do is all going
to be contained here which of course is
list item 4 so in what we need to do is
just count the items because they're all
going to be exactly the same except for
one number so let's look at temperature
because that's going to be very very
important so temperatures right here so
what we're gonna do first is we're going
to go for we want the fourth list item -
we don't want current observation we
want the actual list item so we're going
to write down a 4 and a 2 then we want
the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
we want the seventh item in the list
which is going to be temperature and
then we don't want the word temp we want
the 19 which is the actual temperature
so we're gonna have to and that'll works
down to 4 - which is a list seven
temperatures the seventh item in the
list and then finally - we don't want to
wear temp we want 19 and then we just
have to do that for all of these and you
could sit here for a second and type in
1 for automata or however you say that -
for date 3 for dew point 4 for gust 5
for relative humidity and so forth and
so on and then you'll very very easily
be able to find all of that data alright
so now you know how to get the
temperature and all the other different
parts so we're just going to come in
here and we're gonna duplicate this and
we're gonna drop it in there because the
code that we got was four digits long
and remember we're just reversing them
so for the temperature we're gonna have
to and we're gonna have seven and we are
going to have another two and then we
are going to have four whoops make sure
we get that for all right and that is
going to get our temperature our very
specific temperature then all we need to
do is go through and add in all of the
other ones so for our weather data
well first off let's go
it doesn't really matter grab this
duplicate this drop it right there for
the windchill and windchill is gonna be
- it's the 11th item on our list
let's just put 11 inside of there and
then that's gonna be 2 &amp;amp; 4 so the only
thing that's changing is the second
digit right here the weather data which
is a very brief explanation of the
current weather conditions we're gonna
duplicate this that is the 9th item in
the list so we're just gonna change this
to 9 and we'll be able to grab that
we're going to get a humidity let's
duplicate this again Robert right there
and humidity on our list was the 5th
item so replace this 11 with 5 done now
we got humidity weather image is gonna
be a little bit different we are going
to be using a URL to get the weather
image let's go and take a look at where
we're gonna get that from but let's
cycle through here and if we find the
URLs we're going to basically build a
URL so what we need to do here is we
need to take this URL that is right here
well that works so let's go and get this
URL and let's close this and you can see
there an example of the type of image
we're gonna be pulling in and then we're
gonna build this URL here so we're gonna
do that by going into text and we're
gonna get a join because you just need
two parts here and then we're just gonna
put in a double quote and paste da da da
da da grab that drop it into place and
then we need to get the ending part
let's let's just look at this rather
than jumping over to an application
current observation and then what we're
gonna want to get is weather image and
this is the link and that will let
everything be dynamic and how to get
weather image is just going we're gonna
need one of these guys again duplicate
that drop it right there
and weather image was the tenth item in
that list and there we go and I'll let
you go on your own for homework to
figure out how to get the first
description I'm gonna show you what I'm
talking about here
basically what you're gonna want to do
is come into this and pull in this
afternoon tonight and Friday so that's
be your homework but of course I'm gonna
have a link in the description that's
gonna show you exactly how to solve that
and then if you do all those different
things you're
application is gonna work beautifully
and then in the next part of the
tutorial what we're gonna gear towards
is making our app look more professional
which is gonna have a lot to do with how
we're going to design our interface
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise
