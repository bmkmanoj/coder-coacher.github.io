5 of my ki v video tutorial in this part
of the tutorial I am going to cover a
bunch of topics that I haven't covered
previously pretty much all of the
different widgets and little neat things
you can do with TV so specifically we're
going to be looking at the checkbox
radio button switch pop-up spinners
tabbed panels how to switch screens and
a whole bunch more like always all the
code is available in the description
underneath of the video along with a
nice cheat sheet and if you haven't seen
any the previous tutorials you should
probably watch those and I provide a
card right here and I have a lot to do
so let's get into it okay so I have
three files here I created ahead of time
TV Tut dot P Y that's Python file here's
a Givi file called sample K V and key B
Tut to dot py and I went and imported a
whole bunch of things here because I
didn't want to waste time on that now
I'm going to be creating a pop up here
in a second so on just go ahead and
create a this right now so we're just
going to pass pop up inside of there and
then we will throw pass and that's just
going to be a placeholder for us now we
will create our main class and call this
sample box layout because it's a box
layout and of course to do that we need
to pass box layout to it and the very
first thing I want to do here is to
cover the check box now I'm going to
create an object property so that we
will be able to talk back and forth
between my TV file and my Python file
here and I'm just going to call this
check box is active is equal to and this
is going to be object property and I'm
going to give it a default value of
false
now after that I'm going to create a
function that the check box is going to
be calling and I'm going to cover what
goes on in the key V file of course so
let's say that I just want to call this
check box and 18 clicked because we're
going to have them check a check box
whether they are 18 or not and we will
have in the instance passed inside of
here and the value form the check box
and then I'm going to say if the value
that was passed from the check box is
true because
a checkbox is either going to be true or
false I am going to print out inside of
the console you could of course do any
of the numerous different things we've
already covered or you could just print
out to the console if you just want to
test this and else the only other option
is going to be that the checkbox is
unchecked so there's only going to be
two states available for it and that is
all that I'm going to put inside of that
guy right now now let's go and create
our sample app and get all of our app
methods and such we of course just like
always are going to call for build to
build our interface for us
you only need one self of course and
feel free to pause the video if at any
point in time going a little bit too
quickly something need to do here why
don't we go and I'll show you exactly
how to change the background color for
our whole entire window that's just
going to be clear color and this is
going to be 0 to 1 which is going to
represent a percentage of between 0 and
255 for RGB colors as well as alpha and
I'm just going to make the background
white just to do something different and
there you can see red green blue and
alpha so it's going to be white and then
we are going to go return sample box I'm
going to do my best to cover everything
that I haven't already previously
covered in this tutorial or a heck of a
lot of it of course there are many
widgets that are very rarely used so I'm
going to cover just the most commonly
used ones here that I haven't already
talked about and and sample app of
course and we will call run to run that
alright so that is all we're going to
need to be able to work with a check box
and now I'm going to jump over into
sample kV our key V file and create our
check box over there alright so the very
first thing I'm going to do here is put
hash and colon and import check box and
there we go I'm then going to go and
create the sample box layout which is
going to be the root so we'll be able to
access all of the different methods that
we have inside of there
and of course that comes from this guy
right here and then stamp box layouts
and I'm going to give this an
orientation remember this is a check box
layout obviously so we're going to say
orientation and I'm going to have this
one be vertical and I'm going to give it
a padding that is going to be equal to
10 and spacing the padding is going to
be the padding you know the space around
the widgets and spacing is going to be
the space between the window outer shell
of the window and the interior where all
the widgets going to lie then I'm going
to create another box layout inside of
this and this is going to hold all of
our widgets together and we're going to
use orientation again except this time
I'm going to use horizontal and I'm
going to try to divide my screen up here
because I'm going to try to put a whole
bunch of these widgets all in one little
box so I'm going to say something like
0.2 to then actually I also want to use
a custom label here so let's go up here
and create a custom label and we'll call
this custom label and of course this is
going to be taking from the label widget
that we already have available and I'm
just going to come in here and find a
color for this which is going to be
black and make the alpha-1 and let's
just keep that the way that is and then
we can come down here and we can have
our label all be in black just by doing
that so pretty neat stuff and then we
can come in and say something like text
are you over 18 and then if we well
let's go in size this lets say something
like size hint and we'll say X and we'll
say that we want to take a point
eight-oh of our available space and then
we will go and create our check box and
so out of here what we've been talking
about doing and if you want to trigger
an event we could say something like
when it is active we want to refer to
route and remember we created the
function over there called checkbox
eight
team let's check box 18 clicked and to
it we will pass self which is going to
be the instance for this checkbox and
whether it is active or not which will
be the value we passed over inside of
there and we'll say size hint here X and
point 5 5 you just don't play around
with these different little guys
of course this guy right here is this
guy here so self which would be the
check box is going to be the instance
and then the value right there you could
just pass over the value but I just
wanted to show you how to pass over the
instance as well so you'd be able to do
further tests after that ok and I
believe that is all we need to do and
we'll open up our terminal fear on
Windows of course you can just run it
and it will automatically run but we're
on a Macintosh here and if we run it you
can see right there are you over 18 and
whenever I click on it
you're going to see check box checked
check box on check check box check check
box unchecked and there you go so
there's a demonstration of how we can
use check boxes and now I'm going to
show you something similar which is how
we can use radio buttons now the radio
buttons are actually going to be grouped
check boxes okay so you're actually
going to call them check boxes but
they're going to work alike regular old
radio buttons if you put them in a group
and there's very little we're going to
do here on active is still going to work
just like it worked with the check box
so that you'll call or run code inside
of the main Python file and exactly the
same way so what I want to do is just
create an object property here and go
and say true for this as a default and
we're going to create three different
colors and have the user go and pick
which is their favorites
so we'll say our options are going to be
blue red and green and let's go and set
these to false because with radio
buttons you can only have one of them be
active at a time and that's all I'm
going to do there remember they are
going to work exactly the same with the
checkbox so now I'll jump over into the
key V file and we're going to create a
box layout that is going to be
horizontal in on the screen just with
the other check box so we're going to
throw that inside of there and let's say
this is
like 0.55 and then inside of here we're
going to throw our custom labels inside
of there and I'm going to say text and
we will say favorite color which is
going to be the option they have and do
a size int on this X and I'm going to
throw 265 inside of there so you can see
that you can do three-digit little guys
to go and customize the size that each
of these is going to take off and then
as you can see here even though this is
a radio button we are going to call it a
checkbox and what turns it into a radio
button is you're going to put them all
in a group and I'm going to call that
group favorite color and I'm going to
say that I want the value to this I'm
going to pay reference to the object
property that we have otherwise and have
this be root and blue to show you that
you can also access object properties
directly right like this and then we
will do a size hint once again X and
here we're going to do it point oh five
and then we will throw a label that's
going to be tied to that radio button
so we'll say well let's make this custom
label obviously and then the custom
label text for this guy is going to be
blue and let's go and copy this guy
right here as well and we'll throw this
inside of there and change that to 0.15
and then we're going to do the same
thing for the other two color options we
have here so we'll paste that side of
there and we will paste that inside of
there and then this guy is going to be
blue this checkbox here so we'll change
this to red change this to red change
this to green and change this to green
right like that and we will save it and
that's all we need to do open this guy
up inside of here and run it and there
you can see now we have radio buttons
and you're going to be able to select
each of these and whenever you select
one of them the other one is
automatically or the other two are
automatically going to go false and like
I said you're going to be able to access
those changes with on active just like
you did with a checkbox of course
because
they are technically checkboxes I'll
jump back over inside of here and let's
handle our switch and what we're going
to do with that so I'm going to define a
function called switch on and it's going
to get past self and instance as well as
a value and here we're going to do
pretty much exactly the same thing let's
go and just copy this the save time so
we'll paste that inside of there and
we'll say if true and we'll say switch
on and here we'll say switch off just
want to keep this nice and simple so you
can see exactly how everything works in
just a couple lines of code rather than
making some big giant complicated thing
back over inside of our key V file and
I'm going to go grab this guy right here
and jump down here paste that inside of
there and let's just change this to a
height of 30 and then we're going to
have another box layout inside of here
that's also going to be horizontal size
hints let's change this to 2.5 4.25 then
we're going to have a custom label and
here what I want to do is actually also
cover the slider along with the switch
but I'm going to show you the changes
that are being made directly here inside
the key V file so let's go and let's
actually create a label and have the
value change based off of the changes to
our slider values so we're going to call
this slider underscore ID and then well
let's get the value dot value and then
with a slider you're going to give it an
ID here in this situation so that I'll
be able to change the value for the
custom label based off the changes to
our slider so the idea I use there
slider ID you'll then be able to define
the minimum value for our slider which
is going to be negative 100 the max
value is going to be 100 the starting
value is going to be zero and then the
step is going to be each time the slider
moves it's going to go from if I put one
inside of there if that's going to keep
it from going into the area of fractions
okay now let's go in here and also
create another box layout and this guy
is going to be for our switch throw that
inside of there this is also going to be
horizontal size hand 0.2
five and we're going to create a custom
label for this guy as well custom label
and this is going to just say text on
dash off as the starting value and then
we will call for switch or throw our
switch inside of there and give it the
ID of switch ID and then I'm going to
say on active I want to call the
function we created which is switch on
and we will pass so as well as the value
for it which is going to be whether it
is active or not true or false
and save that and if we come in here and
run it look have a little bug what did
we do wrong oh we forgot to indent that
no big deal and err indent that indent
that and of course and done all these
different things got a little bit ahead
of myself save it
execute how did I do that somewhere else
let's go and fix that as well got that
there got the slaughter in right place
whenever I'm going in writing this code
Brill giant like this you can see it
it's sometimes hard for me to see it so
that's why I make little bugs like that
sorry about that it's out of there I run
it and there you can see it works now
and if we hit the switch you're going to
see switch on comes down there and
switch off and you're also going to see
here with the slider whenever we move
this it's automatically changing the
value inside of our label ok cool stuff
now let's take a look at pop ups as well
as spinners okay so we're just going to
continue on here I'm over in the Python
file of course and first thing I'm going
to show you what to do is how to open a
pop-up and I'm going to have it
triggered by a button press and it's
going to open up a pop-up and I'm going
to say the pop-up is going to be equal
to custom pop-up and this guy up here is
our custom pop-up remember we created
that earlier and whenever this function
is called it is automatically going to
open the pop up on our screen so we just
call open on it and that's all we got to
do with that and while we're inside of
here let's go and create our spinner as
well so we
call this spinner clicked and that's
going to allow you to go and grab
different values from our spinner our
spinner widget and depending upon
whatever they pick I'm going to print
out to the console the value that they
clicked on just that easily save that
jump over in my Kiwi file and I'm going
to define a custom pop-up inside of here
this time that's why we define that
class over there in the other little box
so it is called custom pop-up has to be
the same name as what we defined with
the class and here I can say size hint
and let's have this be 0.5 and 0.5 Auto
dismiss we're going to have that set to
false because we're going to put a
button inside of our pop-up that's going
to dismiss it for us or close it or
whatever you want to call it and let's
say I want them to give this a title as
well and let's just make it the pop-up
and then I want to put a button inside
of it and the button is going to have
the text of clothes and whenever that's
clicked on it's going to close the
pop-up and how you close the pop-up is
you call for route dismiss there we are
and now we're going to come down inside
of here and just continue putting some
stuff inside of here I'm going to do
another box layout we're going to have
it on the same level as this guy right
here there it is
paste that inside of there and this is
going to be a horizontal and I'm going
to change the height on this guy to 30
just like we did previously and make
sure you have the tabs all set properly
on this otherwise you will get errors as
you saw previously then inside of here
I'm going to put another box layout and
this is going to be exactly what I have
here just trying to keep everything
exactly the same on the screen so it
looks okay I'm going to throw a button
inside of here that whenever it's
clicked it's going to open up our pop-up
so we'll say text and we'll say open
pop-up and to open the pop-up we just go
on press and root
and we call open pop-up which is over
inside of our Python file then I'm going
to go and create another box layout for
this guy and this one's going to hold
our spinner inside of it keep everything
exactly the same and we'll call spinner
and the very first thing that's going to
show up in the spinner is going to be
first and then the additional values
we're going to have inside of they're
going to be in an array so we'll call
first
obviously seconds and third and give
this an ID as well
spinner ID and here you call on text to
catch the text that was selected with
the spinner and we're going to pass this
back to the method we created in our
Python file and it was called spinner
clicked and here we will pass back the
text that was in the spinner so to get
that you get a spinner ID like that and
text and that's going to pass back that
text all right and we're going to save
that and run it and there we go and open
pop-up well got an error what'd I do
wrong up forgot to put a capital F
inside of there little silly things
scroll back up inside of here and change
that to an uppercase F
save it and we'll run it and there it is
and if we click on open pop-up you can
see that the pop-up opens up taking
about 50% of the screen click on close
goes away click on first here is our
spinner click on first there second you
can see there spinner value second and
spinner value third and spinner value
first okay and that is how the pop up as
well as the spinner works and the last
thing I'm going to show you before I
show you how to switch screens with
keavy is the tabbed panel and with the
tabbed panel I'm going to create
everything directly inside of the TV
file so let's go and just grab this guy
right here
and jump down here and paste that inside
of there box layout horizontal and we'll
change this to height and change this to
30 should we get our whitespace all
correct here and then we're going to
throw another box layout inside of there
or
and 0.25 that works perfectly fine for
me and now let's create our tabbed panel
so tabbed panel and I'm going to say do
default tab and have this be marked as
false
so nothing it's nothing's gonna be
highlighted that's what that one's going
to do you can play around with these
different defaults and see how things
change by changing them and then you're
going to put each piece of information
you put inside of the panel in something
called a tabbed panel item so I'm just
going to put text inside of here and you
can put anything inside of here this is
going to be first tab and this is going
to be the tab name on the panel and then
you can put anything inside of here
you'd like so then I'm going to throw a
label you could throw buttons you could
throw all sorts of different types of
widgets you can put you know anything
inside of there but I'm going to keep
very simple and I'm just going to say
text and put contents of first panel and
I'm going to do the same exact thing for
the other different tabbed panels paste
that there and let's do three of them do
as many as you'd like obviously have
this be second tab change this to second
panel and this will be third tab and
this will be third panel that's it open
it up and run it and there you can see
content off first panel content on
second panel third panel first panel so
forth and so on so there's a whole bunch
of different widgets that I haven't
covered before and now I'm going to show
you how to switch screens with key B
this time I'm going to do everything I'm
going to put all the key v data inside
of the Python file and you can do that
if you use the Builder like we have
right here and then I'm going to show
you how to manage the different screens
and switch between them using what's
called the screen manager so if you want
to create your key B code directly in
your Python file you just go builder
like this load string three double
quotes and then inside here you're going
to put everything you want so I'm going
to call this screen one and I'm going to
have two different screens inside of
here so we'll call this screen one and
inside of this screen we're going to
have a box layout and you can put
anything inside of here that you could
ever'one just like you do whenever
you're using just one screen here I'm
going to say text and on this button
whenever it is clicked on it's going to
go to screen 2 you're going to eat a bit
be able to change screens not only with
buttons but with basically the
activation or the event from any widgets
going to allow you to change buttons or
you can just do it directly inside of
your code so here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say whenever this button
is pressed what I want to do is open
screen - so here we'll just go on press
and you're going to be able to come in
here and define the direction that the
screen is going to slide in so that's
called a transition and direction and
here we're going to have this go to the
left side you're also going to be able
to define the duration how long it is
going to take for the screen to slide
and here I'll just set this to 1 you can
play around with that see what other
different things it does and then if you
want to change the screen that it
currently is on you just go route
manager current and then you are going
to switch to in this situation I'm going
to switch to screen 2 and down here
below you're going to see exactly where
I assign this it's going to be the name
that's assigned to the screen is going
to define what happens or what screen we
switch to all right so we're going to do
that exact same thing for screen 2 so
let's just go and copy that paste that
inside of there and then change this to
2 box layout go to screen 1 in this
situation let's just leave this be
exactly the same as it was except change
this to screen 1 obviously and then what
we need to do is define our classes for
our two different screens so I'm going
to cause glass class screen one and then
we'll just define this with screen and
we will throw pass inside of there we're
going to do exactly the same thing for
screen number two just change this to
two and then we'll come in here and call
for our screen manager which is going to
control moving between the screens so
I'm just going to call this screen
manager
in call screen manager and make sure you
spell that correctly and then I just add
the screens to the screen manager and
supply the name remember I said here
this is the name this is the name we
need to supply the names to the screen
manager so it knows what screen is
assigned what name we do that by just
going to screen manager and add widget'
and screen 1 and here we'll sign the
name for that screen which is going to
be screen 1 exactly like I defined up
above in the Kiba code and here we're
going to do the same thing for screen 2
so just change this to screen 2 and
change this to screen 2 then we have to
create our class for our application
it's going to run so let's just call
this TV 2 app and throw the APIs ID of
there and then we're going to build this
of course
so we'll go build self and return screen
manager and then we'll run it and to do
that we just go let's just call this
sample app is equal to TV Tutt to app
and then we will get a sample app again
and run just like we did before and save
it open it up and run it whoops I have
to open up the different one up here
remember I change this to key B touch 2
like that and run it and there it is and
this is just one big pajama button but
like I said you put labels buttons
anything you would like and if you click
on it it's going to switch to the
different screens on your screen ok so
pretty cool guys hopefully you enjoyed
that wanted to cover a whole ton of
widgets in one video and I think it did
an ok job like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
