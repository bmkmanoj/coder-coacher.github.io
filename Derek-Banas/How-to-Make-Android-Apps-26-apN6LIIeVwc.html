26 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps today I'm going to show you how
simple it is to add tabs to your Android
applications gonna keep it real simple
there and in the next tutorial which
should be uploaded almost immediately
I'm gonna show you how to make these
apps also swipeable at the same time so
why don't we jump over and look at what
the finished product look like okay so
here it is really really simple what
we're gonna have here is whenever these
tabs are clicked on on the top of the
screen the fragments underneath are
gonna change so let's go over and let's
write the code okay so you saw the
finished application and what we have
right here is an application I called
Android tabs and what we're gonna need
to do is because we're gonna be
switching between fragments we're gonna
have to create those fragments first
thing I'm gonna do is come over here and
I'm gonna create some layout so I'm
gonna go new and I'm gonna go XML and it
is an XML layout file and I am going to
call this first one tab fragment 1 and
I'm just going to leave this as a linear
layout and click on finish and here you
can see it right here so just to keep
this very simple I'm just gonna come in
here and I'm going to create a textview
and I'm gonna have the width be wrap
content and the height be wrap content
I'm gonna put some text inside of here
and this is just gonna say tab fragment
1 and then just so it shows up really
good I'm going to have a text size of 16
SP and there we go
now I'm just gonna copy this guy and I'm
gonna create two more of these fragment
layouts and just come over here new XML
layout XML file call this tab fragment
you're guessing
- and you would be right and we're gonna
click on finish come in here select all
paste that in there call this - and
that's all we're gonna need to do save
that clicked all copy come over here
again layout new XML layout file and tab
fragment 3 and then basically just a
copy and paste and we are going to have
all those layouts all set up for
ourselves
that we are and it's just this simple
and change that to 3 okay now I need to
go over and create the class files that
are gonna sync up with these fragments
alright and to do that we're gonna come
over here and we're gonna click on this
and go new and it's gonna be a Java
class I'm gonna call this tab 4i
one and click on okay get rid of all
this stuff this of course is going to
extend the fragment class we're gonna
right click inside of here yeah I didn't
get the right one so we're gonna type a
little bit slower and have this do it
for me and I just want the regular old
fragment come in here right-click come
in to generate override methods and I'm
going to override oncreateview
which is going to say hey go get the
layout and that's the layout I want to
use here and here it is on create view
select that click on OK we're gonna get
rid of that altogether and then I'm
gonna go view create our view here is
equal to call the inflator so that it
will inflate the layout that we want
here and just go r dot layout thought
and then it's gonna be tab fragment one
there we go pass in null and then return
our finish view
doesn't get much simpler than that there
we are select all that when we first
want to save it and then we want to copy
it and then we're gonna create one of
these for all the other fragments Java
class tab fragment to click on ok select
everything and paste that in there
change this to to come down here change
this to to file/save there we go select
all copy over here Java class it's great
whenever things work just perfectly here
fragment three click on ok select
everything and paste that in there
change this to three change this the
three and there we go very simple now we
get all our fragment setup now we need
to go into activity main this guy over
here open it up and we're going to
define exactly the container where we're
going to be loading everything which in
this situation is going to be a frame
layout come in here give it an ID and
I'm gonna call this fragment container
because that is what it is that's where
all the fragments are gonna be loaded
and guess what activity main is done now
we need to go in and create another
class and this is going to be the guy
that's going to listen for whenever the
tabs are clicked on and then it is going
to change the fragment based off of that
and we're going to call that tab
listener here it is tab listener because
that is exactly what it is click on OK
and tab listener is what we call a
callback interface which is just gonna
be invoked just like you would think
anytime a tab action
hers and we just need to come in here
and have it implement action bar tab
listener and if we want to just import
this save some time just go Android app
dot action bar and there we go it's
gonna say hey you need to implement some
methods great go and do that for me
implement those methods just select
every single one of them click on OK
it's gonna give you all the different
ways the tabs can be interacted with and
then you just have to define exactly
what happens thereafter now we're gonna
be changing fragments here so I'm gonna
create a junk fragment and this is just
a regular old fragment we're gonna be
using here we're going to create a
constructor for our tab listener and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna pass
in the fragment we want to change to
whenever there is a click event so we're
gonna pass over a fragment and let's
just call this right this fragment is
equal to the fragment that was passed in
there we go then we need to say okay
what's gonna happen whenever a tab is
selected
or clicked on wherever you want to call
it well here's a fragment transaction
right there what we're gonna do is just
go ft and replace ID this is gonna be
the fragment container inside of
activity main there it is and we're
going to change it to the fragment that
was passed in and there it is that's how
easy it is to replace the fragment on
the screen then we're gonna have to also
come in here to whenever the tab is
unselected and if we want to remove
fragments that was unselected that's all
we do is type in remove pretty simple
and then this guy on tab reselected we
don't need to do anything with that and
that is it there's tab list and are all
set up now we need to go into main
activity and finish up everything so
here we are inside of main activity now
we need to set up our different tabs
that we're gonna be using so action bar
and then I'm gonna go tab and we'll just
call these tab 1 and tab 2 and tab 3
very simple also gonna have to come in
here and define the fragments that we're
gonna load whenever the tabs are clicked
on I'm just gonna define them all as
fragments there we go and we'll just
call this fragment 1 is equal to and
then we'll
fine that we wanted to specifically
focus on tab fragment one and then we're
gonna do the same thing for the other
three potential fragments so if you want
to add more fragments you just would
increase these number of fragments that
you have right here go in there I'm
gonna be using a couple deprecated
different things here just to express
how these tabs work not a big deal if
you want to suppress warnings for
deprecation that's all you need to do
and then we're gonna come in here and
define our action bar we just go get
action bar and if you get this little
error message right here just come up
here we specifically just want to use
the regular old Android app action bar
just come in here change that and now
everything will be fixed we want to set
the current navigation mode for our
action bar that we're going to be using
tabs so navigation mode and then we'll
go action bar dot and set our navigation
mode to tabs and there that is now if we
want to come in here and add some titles
to our tabs which we definitely want to
will you just go action bar new tab set
our text and we can just make this
simple just have it be tab 1 then we're
gonna do the same exact thing for all
the other different tabs just like you
saw whenever I showed you the
application and there we are and now we
have to set up so that we can use the
tab listener to be able to change the
fragments automatically whenever a new
tab is clicked on like I said before the
tab listeners are gonna provide
callbacks for any type of tab event like
the tab being clicked on and just to
reiterate a call back just informs
another class whenever in action has
occurred so we're gonna go tab one set
tab listener that's in new tab listener
which is the class that we created and
we're gonna pass in fragment one we're
just gonna have to do this for every
single one of our fragments so whenever
tab one is clicked on the fragment one's
gonna show up whenever a tap 2 is
clicked on the fragment two is gonna
show up just that simple that's
basically all we're saying right here
and then change this to three very
simple and then the final thing we have
to do after we have defined the title
that we want and the actions that will
occur whenever the tabs are clicked on
well the final thing we need to do is go
in and
the tab store action bar and they are
added just by going add tab and passing
in our finished tabs and then of course
we just have to do that for all of the
other ones so let's just copy that and
that throwing this tab and throwing this
tab and there you go guys that is
everything all the code of course is
available in the description in the next
tutorial which like I said should be up
tomorrow I'm going to show you how to
make this interface also swipeable
