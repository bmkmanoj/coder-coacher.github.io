13 of my see video tutorial today I'm
going to talk about how we can convert
from base-10 to base-2 8 and 16 and
everything in between actually and the
reason why I'm doing this tutorial is
because I've received requests to cover
more on binary code for missing the
previous parts of the tutorial I provide
a link in the upper right hand corner
and this presentation is going to be
about 50% presentation and about 50%
code so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it okay now with C we can actually
work with individual bits and that is
what is great about C and as this
tutorial progresses you're going to find
out because we can work with individual
bits this is going to make C very useful
if we want to work directly with
hardware but first we have to really
understand how binary numbers and
hexadecimal numbers actually work what
we use for counting is known as base 10
and as you can see here base 10 numbers
are calculated by multiplying each
successive number by an increasing
multiple of 10 so if we have here 10 to
the 0 power that is going to be equal to
1 and that is going to say how many ones
do we need to create our final number
also we have 10 to the power of 1 that
is going to ask how many tens we need to
create our final number if we take 40
plus 5 that's how we get 45 and also
down here 10 to the power of 2 that's
going to say how many 100s we need to
create our final number pretty easy
because we are used to it and here just
to reinforce that I have 1000 instead of
10 to the power of 3 100 instead of 10
to the power of 2 10 instead of 10 to
the power of 1 and 1 instead of 10 to
the power of 0 and that is how our
number system works well if you
understand that you should also
understand how all of the other
different numbering systems work now
because it is believed we use base 10
because we have 10 fingers to understand
computers you must learn to understand
the world as if a machine is standing
there and it only has two fingers or you
can think of it as a switch that has an
on button or
an off button and that is in essence
what we have we can only use ones and
zeros obviously in binary
hence what we're saying to create our
final number how many ones do we need
here we obviously need zero then we ask
how many twos do we need here we need
one so if we take two plus zero that
means that one zero in binary is equal
to two hence if we take that out even
further here we have the ones here we
have the twos and here we have the fours
so we're saying that we need 1 4 plus 1
2 plus 1 1 so if we take 4 plus 2 plus 1
that equals 7 and hence 1 1 1 in binary
is equal to 7 in base 10 now bytes which
is something we should get very
comfortable with are normally
represented as 8 bits and they of course
can hold a maximum number of 255 because
of how binary numbers work and if you
add 128 plus 64 plus 32 plus 16 plus 8
plus 4 plus 2 plus 1 you're going to get
to the number of 255 so you may ask
yourself how exactly does base 8 work
well pretty much exactly the same way
the only difference is is we're going to
use an 8 here instead of a 10 or 2 hence
if we have 45 as a base 8 number how
exactly does that translate into 37 for
base 10 well in essence what we're going
to do is calculate 37 down here and
figure out what that would look like if
we display it as a base 8 number so
first let's start here and figure out
how many eighths we need to get to 37
well if we take 4 times 8 that is going
to get us 32 then if we want to finally
get to 37 we just have to add 5 to it
and that's exactly what we did the same
is going to be true if we want to get to
301 as a base number using base 8
numbers we're going to say how many 64's
do we need multiply that times 4 to get
256 then how many eights are we going to
need we're going to multiply that times
5 to get 40 and then we're going to add
all these guys up and come out to a base
8 number of 4
fifty-five in comparison to a base-10
number of 301 so then you may ask well
exactly how to hexadecimal numbers work
out well since we want to keep this nice
and simple if you want to represent a
ten in hexadecimal since we're using 16
digits 10 in hexadecimal is going to be
replaced with the letter A 11 with the
letter B 12 with the letter C 13 with
letter D 14 with letter E and 15 with
letter F so you may ask yourself well
what about 16 this is often something
that confuses people 10 in hexadecimal
code is going to be the same as 16 in
base 10 so it's something that's very
important to be able to grasp and it's
true in all number systems so let's take
a little bit closer look at exactly how
base 16 works it works exactly the same
let's just jump down here so we have how
many ones
how many 16s and how many 256 is do we
need to get a final number of 455 then
we go through and we decide we only need
one 256 and then we have to figure out
how many 16s we're going to need well
we're going to need 12 which is going to
work out the 192 and 12 and hexadecimal
is going to be the same as the letter C
and then finally we figure out how many
ones we're going to need to complete
this calculation so that brings us to
how exactly are we going to be able to
print out binary so I'm going to start
off just showing you or creating a
function that is going to create binary
numbers from base 10 numbers so let's
say that our base 10 number we're going
to be using is 11 how exactly are we
going to convert that into a string in
binary code that we're going to be able
to print onto the screen what I decided
to do is to create a character array and
at the end of that character array we're
going to put a null value so this in
essence is going to be a buffer well
there's a neat little way to convert to
pretty much any type of base and what
we're going to use to do so is the
modulus character now if you take your
original base 10 number and use the
modulus character followed by the base
that you want to convert into it is
going to provide you with the number
that you're going to have
you put down here and in this situation
that number if we're using binaries is
going to be either a 1 or a 0 so in
essence what we're asking here is do I
have an odd number inside of this number
that I want to convert well the answer
to that would be yes so what we're going
to do is put the 1 down inside of here
then to continue moving on we're going
to take 11 and divide it by 2 to get the
number 5 move the 5 down here modulus
followed by the base and that's going to
also provide a 1 in essence what we're
asking is do I need a 2 well the answer
is yes because this is a 1 so we're
going to put the 1 down here then we
continue our calculation we're going to
take the 5 divided by 2 which is the
base then we're going to take the 2
modulus with the base 2 and that's going
to give us a 0 in essence what we're
asking is do I need a 4 the answer in
this situation is no so we're going to
take the zero and put it down there then
we're going to continue and we're going
to continue until this guy right here is
equal to zero so let's move on take the
2 divided by 2 is equal to 1 move the
one down here modulus 2 so we're saying
do we need an 8 to finally convert the
11 into a binary number the answer to
that is yes so we're going to move the 1
down here then if we do an additional
calculation we're going to get an error
and hence we are finished so by going
through this process we know that the
binary representation of the base 10
number 11 is actually 1 0 1 1 and that
is what I'm going to create inside of my
code so here we are we're going to
create our function and it is going to
return to us a character array that's
going to have a binary number or
whatever else we want to use inside of
it so what we're going to have to do is
pass an unsigned int and in the next
part of the tutorial I'll get more into
that and why we're using unsigned int
but it's just something we're going to
use specifically to keep things very
simple and then we're also going to
accept our base now whenever I first
make this I'm going to focus in on just
converting from base 10 to binary then
I'm going to show you how to convert
from base 10 to
pretty much anything up to base 16 so
what did i do originally well I created
a buffer and I said that I want to work
with bytes so that's going to be 32 bits
but I also want to have room for my null
character and that's exactly what I just
created then I'm going to have to create
this character array and this is going
to be the converted number that we're
going to be using and what finally is
going to be passed back to the user then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
check I know we're going to start off
with binary but I'm going to check to
make sure that they're not trying to get
me to convert to a base that is less
than 2 or greater than 16 and if they do
I'm going to say printf enter a number
between 2 and 16 and then just to keep
things nice and simple I'm just going to
exit out of the program if they do
anything else and they'll have to
restart ok so there that is now what I
need to do is point to the last index in
our character array and that is where
I'm going to store the null character so
get our converted number here and to
point to the last part of our buffer put
the ampersand on top of that and then
I'm going to say size of the buffer
minus 1 because we're using 0 index from
the beginning ok so there we go now I'm
pointing at the right position
well now what I want to do is actually
set the value for that and to do that
I'm going to throw the null character
inside of that and there we are so a
little brush-up on pointers as well well
then I want to continue doing things
over and over and over again as you saw
in the previous part of the tutorial
while this guy up here number to convert
paste that down inside of there is not
equal to 0 and there we are so what
exactly am I going to do well I'm going
to get the value and that value can be
received by going number to convert and
then modulus by whatever the base is
that they sent in just like you saw
previously then what I need to do after
I get that is I need to move over to the
left with our little array we're working
with here so converted number is equal
to convert
number minus one and that's going to
move me to the left so that I can place
my number in the right position then I
need to store the proper value in the
character array for the final converted
number so once again put the star inside
of there and if I want to put an integer
inside of this character away one of the
short ways to do that or shortcut ways
to do that is to put this zero inside of
there and add it to value then what I
need to do is do exactly what I did
before and divide my number to convert
by whatever the base is and of course
this number to convert this whole entire
thing right here is exactly the same as
number to convert is equal to number to
convert divided by two so just another
shortcut now that I have that done and I
got my number in my array all set up
let's say I want to come in here and go
print out and print out the final
finished array which is going to be
stored in P converted number okay like
this and then on top of that we can go
return and return it alright now that we
have all of that set up I can bounce
down inside here and I'm going to create
another unsigned int and I'll just call
it number one and I'll give it a value
of 60 which in binary is going to be
exactly the same as 1 1 1 1 0 0 there
you go now I'm going to say printf D in
base 2 is equal to put number 1 inside
of here like that and then I can say
convert base and pass in number 1 and I
want to convert it to base 2 just as I
put it right there and there's a little
bit of a bug here just have to bounce up
here get rid of that paste that in there
I'll save that then I also want to
bounce down here and throw a new line
inside of this bounce over here compile
and execute and here you can see 60 and
base 2 is equal to 1 1 1 1 0 0 just like
we have right there so that is how you
convert from base 10
to phase two but how exactly are we
going to be able to convert from base-10
to base-2 hexadecimal well actually you
guys like homework so what I'm going to
do is you can pause the video right now
and go and try to figure out how to
change convert base to figure that out
and in between then and now I'm going to
show you exactly how to do it it's
actually very easy
okay now I'm back I'm going to show you
my solution to this what I'm going to do
is create a character array and I'm
going to call it all values and then
inside of this guy what I'm going to do
is I'm going to put in all the potential
values that could be stored to create
all of the different bases we're going
to need so we're going to need a 0 1 a 2
a 3 a 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 and then if we're
going to get into the hexadecimal world
we're going to need an ABCDE and F and
that's going to be stored inside of our
array now I actually only have to change
one other line and that one other line
is going to be this guy right down here
what I'm going to be able to do is
change this to all values like that
leave the value inside of there put this
right here and that is it it's going to
automatically based off of how this
formulas put together it's going to
automatically grab the right value out
of here and it's going to store it in my
array and let's go down here and check
to see if I'm right so I'm just going to
go grab this guy paste that in there
change this to base eight change this to
base eight go down here change this to
base 16 and change this to base 16 then
if we bounce over here compile this and
execute you can see that it changed all
of the base 10 number 60s to the proper
binary base eight and hexadecimal values
so that is how you convert from base 10
to all of the other different bases and
a whole bunch of other different things
in the next part of the tutorial I'm
going to show you how to work with
bitwise operators I'm going to explain
exactly what two's-complement means I'm
going to cover binary fractions and how
they work and a whole bunch more please
