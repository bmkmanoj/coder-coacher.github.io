12 of my c-sharp tutorial and this part
of the tutorial we're going to start
covering a little bit more complicated
things we're going to talk about generic
collections jerrick methods generics
trucks and delegates and like always all
the code as well as a transcript and
cheat sheet for this video is available
in the description underneath the video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it okay so I'm going to have two classes
I'm going to have animals ES and
programs ES and this is just going to be
very very simple I'm going to come in
here and create a property string and
this is just going to be name and I'll
get errs and my sutter's and now what
I'm going to do is just create a
constructor and this is animal and it's
going to get a string that's the name
and we'll give it a default value of no
name and then we're just going to go
name is equal to name
all right quite simple and we're going
to come back to this but now we're going
to jump over into the main program file
alright so the very first thing we're
going to talk about or what are called
generic collections and they are going
to be type safe and provide some
performance benefits over the
collections that we saw in the previous
part of the tutorial and you define the
datatype whenever you are defining this
generic collection and this is going to
be a dynamically resizing collection and
one of them is called list and we are
going to be able to store animal objects
inside of it quartz so let's just call
this animal list and then to generate it
you go list and then what it contains
and then you close it off with the
parentheses of course to call the
constructor now you can also create a
list with standard types like if you
wanted to have a bunch of ants inside of
here you could do that as well and here
we just call this number list is equal
to and then of course you just go new
and list and an int like that but you're
going to define that type whenever you
create it and we're all going to do
anything with this so I'll just get rid
of it now you're going to be able to add
values well before I get rid of that
let's say if you wanted to add a value
to our number
which isn't even created but whatever
you would just do this
however if instead you would like to add
objects into our animal list we can come
in and go an animal list and add and
then you could either put the you know
create the object outside of it and then
add the object or you can just create
the object directly inside of here or
just by going animal like that and then
you could also give a value to name like
this so you have an animal named Doug
and what's going create a couple more of
those let's create another animal inside
of here called Paul and let's create a
final one and let's give that the name
of Sally all right so there you go you
have three animals in your animal list
now you're also going to be able to come
in and add in values a specific index so
you can do that with insert so let's say
you wanted to add a new animal inside of
here starting at index one it's going to
move everything else to the right you
can do so animal again and let's say
that we want this one to have the name
of Steve we can do that we're also going
to be able to remove by items out of our
list let's just remove apps and you can
just say let's say you want to get wood
right off whatever's in the number one
index there you did you're going to be
able to come in here and get the number
of total animals inside of here so let's
say num of animals and let's go grab
that and here you're probably going to
remember that you're going to be able to
use count for this because you've used
count so many other times and of course
we're going to be able to cycle through
all these animals with for each again
just to find what each of those is going
to be and whatever you are going to be
cycling through and then you just throw
in whatever you have here and if you
want to get the name and print it out on
screen you can do so like that and let's
run it see what happens and there you
can see whoops I did something a little
bit long let's go check what I did I
forgot to get rid of that quote let's go
get that quote throw it right here
instead I'll save it
it again and now you can see number of
animals as three remember we add an
additional one but we then went in and
deleted it and then we printed out all
the different animals we have alright
let's continue it's also important to
know that likewise there's going to be
stack and the tea represents whatever
the data type is so here we had animal
was what we had inside of there and then
we also had int we're going to be able
to do exactly the same things we covered
previously with stacks using these
generics and then you're also going to
be able to use Q and once again the tea
just represents a data type that you
define whenever you create it you're
also going to have a dictionary and it's
going to have the T key as well as a T
value and those like I said are going to
work exactly the same way and you can
chest those out for your homework now
the next thing I'd like to talk about
are generic methods and I'm going to
jump over into the animal class and
create one okay so here we are and
basically anytime you need many
overloaded methods that differ only by
their parameters a generic method is
normally a very good solution and how we
create one is we go public and we static
Boyd doesn't return anything and this is
going to get us a sum and here we're
going to define that we don't know the
data type however we're going to go
reference and T we do know that the
return data type is going to be the same
as this parameter here and also this
parameter right here so that is what
we're saying
we know that for this to work all of
these data types are going to have to be
exactly the same now inside of here we
can go to double and double X is equal
to and convert whatever is passed inside
of here into a double and it's going to
be able to work with anything and then
likewise we're going to do the same
thing for another one of these guys
let's just call this Y and convert this
into number two and then this guy is
going to output our answer onto our
screen so here we can go in and go
double X whoops let's change that a
little bit with the curly brackets and
plus and then double why I keep hitting
the wrong curly bracket thing here
there's a hard curly bracket is equal to
and then we can add them up and I'll put
that onto our screen so double X plus
double Y and that's going to receive any
data type and go and perform that
arithmetic and now I'll jump back in the
program and show you how it works
so let's come in here and let's create
two integers so we'll say 5 and Y is
going to be equal to 4 what we're going
to be able to do here now with these
guys is called the animal and then
specifically get some and then what
we're going to do with get sum is just
go reference X and reference Y call that
and let's go and do another example here
that's quite the same so let's just copy
this guy and then this time let's have
it work with strings instead of working
with simple integers throw that inside
of there get rid of that and change this
to a string just to show you that it is
indeed going to work and we'll rename
this to string X and we'll throw our
quotes inside our double quotes inside
of there and string Y and throw our
quotes in around the 4 and then animal
get some and here we'll just change the
string X and change this to string Y so
we have that all set up and we can run
it and see that it is indeed going to
work no matter what the data type is
that you pass inside of it ok so pretty
simple stuff and pretty useful stuff now
we're also going to be able to generate
or create generics trucks as well as
classes and I'm going to jump down here
and go and create one just you can see
what one of those looks like so we will
go public and your homework can be
you're going to see how the structure
work and then you can go and create a
generic class on your own and I know you
can do it and I think it's good practice
so I'm going to leave that for you for
homework now of course you're going to
be able to have generic feel
inside of your struct as well as your
classes so let's say we want to have
width inside of here and try that's tea
once again
and length inside of here you're going
to be able to have generic properties so
we can have a public tea width and then
we could also come in and generate our
getters and setters if we would like to
do it that way so we can just do with
like that and generate our setters and
here we're going to just say width is
equal to whatever the value was that was
passed into this likewise we're going to
be able to come in and do the same with
our a length so let's just change this
to length and change this to length and
change this to length and then we are we
generate all those you can see the T's
are in there and pause the video at any
point in time if I'm moving a little bit
too quick I'd like to use the pause
button in my videos we can create a
gerrant constructor and to do that just
put the T inside of there and we'll
throw a W inside of there and T and L
and then we can come in and go with is
equal to whatever the W is value is and
length is equal to whatever the ELS
value is and let's do something
interesting here let's go and create
area so we'll say public and string and
get area once again we'll go double and
double width is going to be equal to
call converts and to double is what
we're shooting for and that's going to
be whatever the value for width is and
then we'll do exactly the same thing
once again for our length so just change
that to length and then we're going to
convert length in this situation and
then after we do all of that stuff we
can come in and go return string and
formats and we can go and pronounce some
information on that multiplies times
whatever the value for length is is
equal to and then let's go and perform
that calculation inside here double
with times double-length alright so
there we are have that all set up then I
think that's good enough
so I'm jump back in the program or jump
back so I'm going to jump back up inside
of main and test all this out see how it
works I'm just coming right here right
before the read line of course and we
will create our generic struct so we can
go like this and say that we want to use
integers in this situation just call
this rectangle 1 is equal to new and
rectangle once again define we are
dealing with an integer and throw the
values of 20 and 50 inside of there and
then we'll be able to come in and output
that information whoops hit the Run
button again console and here we'll just
go rectangle one and get area there that
is and then to prove that it will also
work with other data types let's just
copy that paste that right there and
here we'll have this also work with
strings change this to rectangle two new
change this to a string as well and just
leave this as 20 and 50 but let's put
our double quotes around it because they
are strings and then change this to
rectangle two as well and run it and you
can see that yes indeed that works out
even if we're using integers or we're
using strings or whatever we are using
and that is one of the greatest benefits
of using generics and after covering all
those guys I thought I would cover
delegates now delegates are going to
allow you to reference methods inside of
a delegate object and the delegate
object can then be passed to other
methods that can call the methods
assigned to the delegates and it can
also stack methods that are going to be
called in a specified order so the best
way to understand them is to just see
them in action what I want to do first
those come down here after our struct
and actually create a bunch of them make
sure I get out of there yeah I don't
want to be inside of our struct
definition whenever I'm creating this so
I have to come right here now the very
first thing you're going to do is
declare a delegate type that is going to
in this situation we're going to say
it's going to perform arithmetic and how
you do this is you define the return
type and the types of
of attributes that the methods that
could be assigned to the delegates could
be so how you create one did you go
public delegates and void and this isn't
making sense just after you see the
example it will so you can say right
here that it is going to not return
anything and it's going to receive a
double and another double inside of it
all right and then you put the semicolon
at the end of it so basically it's
saying that the arithmetic delegates is
going to have the ability to be assigned
methods that do not return a value and
receive two attributes so let's go and
create a couple of those so we'll go
public static void
there's the void just like the voids
right there and then we're going to call
this add and it is going to receive a
double doesn't have to be called num1
but that's what I'm calling it and I'm
gonna go and has to receive another
double and I'm going to call that number
two in this situation and then inside of
it it will just perform this arithmetic
so we go like this and then we'll go to
num1 plus num2 is equal to and then add
those together so num1 plus num2 okay
and let's do another one for subtraction
down here once again it's going to not
return anything we're going to call this
subtract instead of add we're going to
leave this exactly the same because we
need a two doubles and here we'll change
this to negative and here will change
assistan egative there they are
and we're going to jump back up into
main once again and make this work so
come down here and the very first thing
we're going to do is to create our
delegate objects and our delegates name
what's arithmetic and I'm going to call
create one called
add another one called sub and another
one called add sub and those are strange
names but that's what came into my head
so what we're going to do now is assign
just the add method so here we will go
add is equal to new arithmetic and pass
in the
to add that's going to be assigned to
that now that it is assigned let's go
and create a couple more we can also go
sub is equal to new arithmetic and in
this situation will put subtract inside
of there alright now it gets kind of
neat because we can also come in and go
add sub is equal to ad plus solve so we
will be able to perform or calculate or
call the method add and subtract and
anytime we go and call for ad sub to
execute it's also important to know that
we would also be able to come in and
subtract a method out of the list so add
sub minus ad and now this is going to be
back to being a regular sub so you took
the ad sub you got rid of the add method
and now it's just simply a sub again
okay so play around with that you'll see
it makes sense so it just provides a way
for us to be able to add like a string
of methods that we want to be calling in
a row dynamically so now we can come in
and print our results so you can see
this in action so we can say write line
and here I'm going to come in and I'm
going to say add and it'll say six well
I don't need to do that let's just go
add 6 and 10 close that off and I'll use
the delegates I can go add 6 and 10 and
this ad right here is a reference to
this ad right here which is going to
call our add method now that's kind of
interesting but what is even more
interesting is whenever we can chain
these different calls together and here
I'll say add and subtract and let's do
10 and 4 instead so 10 and 4 and now
I'll be able to call add sub and we will
pass in 10 and 4 and you're going to see
that it works on all of those so let's
save that and run it and there indeed
you can see in the first situation it
went and just called the add method in
the second situation it called first the
add and then the subtract nothing ok so
pretty neat stuff and a quick rundown
with some example
is on how to use multiple different
generics as well as delegates and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below of lies till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
