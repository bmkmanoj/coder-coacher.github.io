3 of my how to design a website tutorial
this is maybe more aptly named how to
fix a messed up web design because what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna walk you
through the process of fixing what you
see here on the stream now I use Google
Chrome a lot of people use Firefox but I
may use Google Chrome so I'm gonna use
Google Chrome basically what I do is
inside of Chrome I go to view and then I
go down to developer and then I go down
to developer tools basically what this
allows me to do is to try to hone in on
exactly what's going on another way you
can do this is to right click and click
on inspect element which might work out
a little bit better for you all right so
basically what this allows me to do and
if you can't see this view it fullscreen
because there's really no easy way for
me to increase the size of this as you
can see as I'm drifting my mouse up and
down the screen it is highlighting
different parts of the screen what we're
gonna fix here first
is the positioning on this featured
content slider and this other jQuery
slider and fix all the little errors
that are in here and I'm also gonna show
you how to make it cross browser so I'm
gonna act like I don't know how this is
divided up and I'm just gonna continue
to drift my mouse down and see how
things are being highlighted and this is
exactly what I would do if I had no idea
what I was working with and I notice as
I come down into the code a slider
wrapper area that I'm highlighting the
featured content tool so that is the guy
that I want to Center in on and fix and
also while we're at it let's also fix
this guy down here so I just continue to
slide my mouse now and then I notice as
I get down into the scroll pane area
which demo wraps around that this guy is
going to highlight or surround the
jQuery slider that I have down here so
if I want to increase the margins on
those guys so that they Center I need to
look for demo and go to slider wrapper
so I jump over into style dot CSS which
you can now see here real big and I'm
just gonna scroll way down to the bottom
of the screen I'm gonna put in my edits
so I'm gonna put in my edits so it's
real easy for me to make sure that I see
what I've changed in this guy and if I
flip back over into the developer tools
inside of chrome I see that code a
slider wrapper is a class so that means
I need to precede it with a dot and demo
is also a class I need to precede both
of those with a dot so I just got to
remember code a slider wrapper in my
head
jump back over into here and go dot code
up - slider
- rapper and I also have to remember the
other one was demo now if I want to
change the margins on these guys very
easy I just go margin - left and I'm
going to guess and say 30 pixels and if
that's moving over 30 pixels this demo
needs to mean Eve 30 pixels as well
let's file save and see if I got it
reload it and you can see they moved
over but not quite enough so let's take
it to 35 pixels and see if that looks
right reload and that looks very very
centered for me all right so that's
looking good well now as I'm looking
here I also see some other errors as you
can look here you can see that there's a
difference between this top artists
which makes a line go across here so
this is bad so I'm gonna jump back into
jQuery and try to figure out exactly
what's causing that I'm gonna switch
back over into Google developer tools
and try to figure out where that error
is coming from so I just move my mouse
around here on all of these different
divs and look for what could possibly be
causing that error another thing I might
want to do is if I click on resources
it's actually going to show me different
textures that are being used on screen
and this is kind of like guessing I'm
looking here at middle texture and I'm
noticing that yes this texture here is
kind of interesting and it could
potentially be causing me a problem if
it is not repeating correctly on the
screen so I'm just flipping through all
these different things and looking for
things it could be potential problems
and let's just say that my hypothesis is
that this middle texture is not
repeating properly well we gotta go and
actually check it out we also have to
figure out where exactly middle texture
lies inside of my styling code so I'm
going to jump over into style dot CSS
and I go F and it's middle underscore
texture dot jpg then let's see where
that's located okay it's located in art
page background middle texture and is it
located anywhere else
no as you can see here alright so if my
hypothesis is correct that means that I
may be able to get rid of this issue
altogether by just changing how the
background is being repeated so let's
say I don't repeat it downwards I just
repeat it from left to right well I can
change that just by going repeat - X and
let's file save it and see if that
changes any
reload it and sure enough that fixed it
so now what we have here is that middle
texture that was being used is not being
duplicated underneath and you can see
that it's a nice smooth really nice
transition here everything is looking
pretty nice there so let's jump back
over into elements because we got some
other problems here mainly being this
I'm gonna zoom in here if you look right
here in the coda slider there is a curve
here and I don't like that curve so I'm
gonna try to figure out what is causing
this curve in here cuz I want everything
to line up straight and also another
problem I have is this little guy up
here is not centered so we got to try to
figure out exactly where those guys are
so all of those lie inside of my demo
div over here on the right side of the
screen and chances are really good as I
look across here UI - corner - all
surrounds all of this so I'm gonna want
to look in that code for UI - corner -
all and I'm actually going to write that
down so hypothesis really and just
guessing where the errors may lie and
I'm later on gonna check the code to see
if I'm right
I'm opening up all these little boxes
here and I'm just drifting over all
these little boxes down here to try to
figure out what the name is or the div
that surrounds that little bar there I
just keep opening these up and scrolling
and scrolling and scrolling until I get
to that name now I could just do this
inside of the code maybe that would be
easier but this is kind of the way that
I just like to do things and I know now
that I'm highlighting it that I'm
getting very close to it and there you
are UI slider handle pops up on my
screen so I'm gonna take a pen I'm gonna
write down UI - slider - handle and I'll
know that I need to look for those two
very specific things inside of my code
to fix all these errors so let's open up
that code and I know that I'm working
with my JQ slider and I also know that
this styling is coming from the fact
that I downloaded the overcast style
inside of jQuery so I'm gonna go into
overcast inside of my CSS file and go to
this jQuery - you why this is imported
and I'm guessing that this is where the
errors are gonna lie so again I'm gonna
do a search I'm going to look for a UI -
corner - all see if that pops up and
sure enough there it is right there now
I'm gonna go through all these and I
notice that every
single corner radius is defined inside
of this guy
well if I don't want corner radiuses at
all and that's all that's going on here
I'm gonna decide to just come in here
and just get rid of everything and I'm
just gonna comment everything out and
I'm gonna file save and see if that's
getting me where I want to go and you
can see now there's no corner radiuses
okay so that fixed that error that's
looking really good
now I need to fix this guy so inside
here again I'm gonna do a search this
time for you I - slider
- handle I'm gonna go next and there it
is right there see if it's anywhere else
if it's down there also and I'm also
seeing this is where it's being
positioned and it is moving it up
instead of down let's go through here
and see if it's anywhere else so I have
it here positioned on the left this is
the left positioning and this is the top
positioning for that handle let's just
try to get rid of that negative and see
if that corrects the problem so that's
gonna move it down whenever you have a
positive number inside of top that means
down 0.3 iann from the top and again I'm
just testing this and after a reload you
can see that it is properly in place so
that's how I was able to fix those real
nice and easily let's move over here and
I can see there's a little bit of a
space there so let's jump over into my
jQuery prod slider dot CSS code which
defines what goes on inside of this guy
and I see here that my width for demo
which surrounds the whole entire thing
is 483 let's take that up to 485 reload
and you can see now that the bottom
jQuery slider is exactly the same width
as the featured content tool so really
quickly fixed all those different things
and you may think wow your job is done
but it is not because now we're gonna
check this to see if it works cross
browser and I previously inmense the
Adobe browser lab which is free and what
it allows you to do is to check for a
cross browser miss so I just imported my
web page into this guy and did a reload
and if I come down here you may or may
not be able to see that this guy down
here all these buttons are all messed up
inside of Internet Explorer 6 so I have
to go in and I have to fix all those
well how do I do it
it's really not that hard remember back
previously inside of header dot PHP I'm
going to revisit this whole entire thing
we scroll down here I created a separate
style sheet that would be used only if
Internet Explorer 6 was being used and I
created another style sheet that would
be used if Internet Explorer 7 was being
used so now what I need to do if I want
to make this work inside of Internet
Explorer 6 I just need to go to style
dot ie6 dot CSS I'm actually going to do
this inside a wordpress so I'm gonna go
to my web page alright and if I want to
edit this directly inside of WordPress I
actually have two steps I have to go
through I go through two installed
plugins because I have a firewall
WordPress firewall that I use I need to
deactivate that you don't have that
plug-in definitely get it it'll really
help you with security it's free also
then I need to go under appearance and
click on editor and then remember I'm
gonna be doing edits on the style dot I
six dot CSS file so I clicked on that
and here it is right here on our screen
and again we're gonna scroll way down to
the bottom and this guy and I'm gonna
put in my edits and so you can see it
I'm actually gonna do it over here and
then I'm gonna figure out exactly what
I'm working with here so let's zoom in
again so you guys can see it figure out
what these buttons are called and I'm
gonna use chrome again figure those
things out so inside the demo I'm gonna
open up all these little boxes and then
I'm gonna roll over these until i zoom
in on exactly what I want to be able to
fix here and as you can see there's
product name that's something that I
might want to fix so I'm going to take
second here and I'm gonna write down
prod name and all these changes are only
gonna affect Internet Explorer six and
seven it won't affect anything else
fraud more info button well yep as you
can see there of something else I'm
probably gonna want to change prod more
info button and then prod Add to Cart
yeah that's up now someone I want to
change okay so I know that I need to
just basically move these guys around
and then hopefully it'll all work inside
of Internet Explorer let's jump over
into browser lab again and also I see
here that the image is not aligned
properly so and that is called prod
image so it's also going right that
broad image all right so now I know what
I need to stop so come down inside of
here so open up our little TextEdit or
any tool we're just gonna copy and paste
once we do this
I'm gonna go prod more info but to some
styling on that
I'm gonna go fraud Add to Cart but and
then I'm gonna go the product which is
the picture of the product I'm gonna
move those guys around
another thing Internet Explorer doesn't
like pixels quite as much as it likes
EMS so we're gonna do a lot of our
editing based off of that fact all right
so let's open up browser lab and the
first thing we got is prod more info
button there's more info so we need to
move that over to the left side of the
screen so you're just gonna go left and
then let's say that I want to move it I
don't know 4 am just guessing and then
adds a cart well that definitely needs
to mean move over to the left all so
let's do a left and then because it is
overlapping that button let's not have
it go quite as much negative 3 II am
then the product itself position it
relah 2 and I want to bring it down from
the top point 5 pixels then let's copy
this jump over into my theme editing and
paste it in there let's update that file
and jump over into browser lab and
reload this okay oh you can see that the
button for the more info looks good but
the Add to Cart does not so we're gonna
have to fix that and the picture here
looks perfectly fine so we need to move
the add to cart away from there and
actually the more info button is maybe
over a little bit too much so let's go
negative 3.8 and then for this guy looks
like it needs to go positive because
it's all moving based off the position
of the button that is to the left side
of it so I made those a little change
there copy and paste my changes in
update file and jump back over in the
browser lab and it reload browser lab is
terribly slow but it's the only tool
that I have that works as well so stuck
with it and there you go so everything's
looking sharp and tight and everything's
lined up here real nice so fixed up
everything there and in the next part of
the tutorial I'm actually going to turn
this whole entire thing into a working
shopping cart of course I got to go into
installed plugins reactivate my
WordPress firewall and up next this guy
will become a working shopping cart and
as you can see it has products pages
since logged in here if I click on Add
to Cart it's automatically gonna throw
those different products in here it's
gonna allow for checkout it's gonna
allow for everything leave any questions
or comments below
