9 of my design patterns video tutorial
today we're going to talk about the
final creational pattern that i'm going
to cover in this tutorial called the
prototype pattern so what is the
prototype pattern it is when you want to
create new objects or instances by
cloning or copying other objects or
instances in a nutshell that's the
prototype pattern so what does it allow
you to do it allows for the adding of
any subclass instance of a known
superclass at runtime and you would want
to use the prototype pattern when there
are numerous potential classes that you
want to only use if needed at runtime
and one of the benefits of the prototype
pattern it reduces the need for creating
multiple subclasses and here is kind of
a common UML diagram for the prototype
pattern normally this prototype Factory
that I have down here is not used in the
common UML diagram for this pattern
however I always use it and in this
tutorial I'm going to use it the more
common UML diagram points directly from
the client to the prototype and then
from those subclasses that are going to
be created from that subtype you can see
that I have sheep and dog this is
actually going to be animal in this
tutorial and then the prototype Factory
is just going to pop out a whole bunch
of these different guys basically what
I'm doing here is the client is going to
create the clone factory and then the
client is also going to make a sheep
object then the client is going to ask
the clone factory to copy said sheep
object the Sheep is going to be passed
as an animal type remember we're using
polymorphism here so we're going to be
able to refer to sheep and dog as if
they were animals and then the clone
factory simply asks the animal method
make copy to make a copy of sheep and
then of course the sheeps make copy
method is called and the result is sent
back to said client so let's jump into
code and make this a hundred percent
understandable okay so here I am in
Eclipse and we're going to have a couple
different classes inside of here we're
going to have animal and sheep then I'm
going to have my clone factory and then
finally test cloning is going to be the
actual application where I'm going to
test all this stuff and all the code is
available underneath the video and you
should definitely get it so first we're
going to go into
animal Java and create it this is going
to be so simple and this is why I like
using this factory thing that I
mentioned before because it allows me to
make classes that just do pretty much
one thing so this is just going to be an
interface it's going to return an animal
called animal and it's going to extend
cloneable and by making this class
cloneable you are basically telling java
that it is okay to copy instances of
this class and those instance copies are
going to be stored in completely
different locations in memory so it's a
copy but it is not a reference which is
maybe what you're used to seeing because
that's normally what you do see and then
we're just going to create public animal
make copy is going to be the only method
that is going to be required to use this
interface and of course spell cloneable
right and there you go that's all the
work you need to do now we're going to
need to jump into sheep java so here we
are and we're just going to go public
class sheep implements animal and then
of course we're going to zoom into sheep
and it's going to tell us what methods
we need to add add on implemented
methods and there we are so I'm just
going to get rid of that then I'm just
going to add a couple things to this
kind of just used to explain what's
going on as the application run so I'm
going to create this constructor for the
sheep and it's just going to tell us
when our sheep object is made like
simple and there you go and then we come
down to the make copy area and this is
where you're going to see everything be
cloned so I'm just to save some time I'm
going to copy this put some informations
out of here I'm basically just going to
shape is being made so that you know
that it is about ready to make a nice
Cologne of our sheep just like Dolly
then I'm gonna go sheep sheep object and
I'm gonna make this null and then this
is where we're going to be cloning
everything and anytime you want to clone
something you're going to need to wrap
it in try-catch blocks and to save
myself time again going to delete that
and go shoot object is equal to we're
going to cast the result to a sheep type
and then we're going to call super which
is a reference to animal clone there's
clone and it's going to give me an error
if I put my mouse on that guy it's gonna
say surround we'll try catch blocks and
what I did so got all that setup and
clone not supported exception is going
to be triggered if you try to clone an
object that doesn't have extends
cloneable on it so that's what that is
then we come down to this area we're
going to shoot object we're going to
return our finished sheep that has been
cloned and then finally I'm going to
make a method here that's going to be
called if they try to print out the
actual object is strip to the screen and
we do that with two string just like
that and then let's say we want to
return something like Dolly is my hero
back and there you go
I'll save that and there you go sheep is
dead so now we're going to go into the
clone factory and like I said you don't
always have to use this I just find it
so much neater that I'm just going to
stick with demonstrating this pattern
this way so clone factory and then we're
going to go public animal type git clone
so it's going to return an animal and
it's going to be passed an animal call
it animal sample and basically what this
is going to do is it's going to receive
any animal meaning any animal subclass
and make a copy of it and then store it
in its own location in memory and the
great thing about using this clone
Factory it has no idea what these
objects are except that they are of a
subclass of the animal type that is all
that knows and here we're just going to
go return animal sample make coffee
an animal sample is of course of type
animal and make copy of course is here
in the interface as well as in sheep a
copy see make copy just means clone the
super type of this animal and then cast
it into being whatever it is in this
situation of sheep so pretty simple and
that's all we need to do so now I'm
going to go into test cloning Java
create this guy so I'm going to go
public class test cloning then we're
going to go public static void main now
you know we are in the actual
application here and then we're going to
do exactly what I told you we're going
to create our clone Factory I'm going to
call it animal maker new factory this is
going to handle the routing of make copy
method calls to the right subclasses of
the animal and then I'm going to create
a sheep instance and I'm going to call
it Sally new
sheep and we're going to be making a
clone of Sally here in a second
and to do that we're going to go sheep
I'm going to just call this clone sheep
is equal to cast it to the sheep type
that it is and it will go animal maker
get clone and pass it Sally and what it
will do is make an absolute perfect copy
of Sally Fields methods everything and
then store it in a different location
and then just to prove to you that all
this is different we're going to call
Sally and that's where the to string
method comes in and then we're also
going to go clone sheep which is the
clone of Sally and then another thing
we're going to do just to show that
there are in different locations in
memory is go Sally hash code then I'm
going to go to system identity hash code
copy system identity hash code Sally
close that copy this guy and then this
is going to be clone to do is go cloned
sheep and I'll save it execute it and
there you can see set cheap is being
made that is our clone that's going to
be made dolly is my hero Dolly is Mahiro
they both print out exactly the same
thing whenever you call to string
however you can see that our hash codes
are different they're located in a
different part of memory so there is the
prototype design pattern leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
