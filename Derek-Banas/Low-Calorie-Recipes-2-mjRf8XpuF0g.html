2 of my low-calorie recipes tutorial
today I'm going to cover how to make
banana ice cream tofu ice cream
strawberry sorbet coleslaw yes I know
that's a weird thing and another type of
low-calorie mayonnaise so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it first I'll
make a strawberry sorbet that knocks
more than 50 calories off of my ice
cream alternative as well as completely
eliminates fat and cholesterol then I'll
show you how to make tofu ice cream
which will dramatically lower the
calorie fat and cholesterol count and
then I'll go even more hardcore by
showing you how to make an absolutely
amazing banana ice cream in the last
video I showed you how to make a 12
calorie healthy mayonnaise but a lot of
you guys said it wasn't sweet enough so
this time I'll make a more traditional
type of mayonnaise that still knocks 136
calories off of traditional mayonnaise
and then I will cover a very healthy
coleslaw that is a staple of my diet
that tastes delicious and really fills
you up first I'm gonna make a strawberry
sorbet but basically just replace the
strawberry with any other type of fruit
and you can make pretty much any type of
sorbet basically just add one cup of
water and one cup of sugar with your pot
on high and you're gonna stir the sugar
and water mixture until they are both
combined then you're gonna bring it to a
boil and then you're going to take it
off the burner and then let it cool then
you're gonna add 16 ounces of frozen but
thawed strawberries of course you can
use any other type of fruit just taste
it and it tastes good then you know that
you got the right amount of fruit then
you're gonna add your sugar water that
has been cooled then add one and a half
tablespoons of lemon juice and I just
want to reiterate you want to use frozen
fruit because it tends to be ripe and
sweet and it tastes much better then to
keep your sorbet from turning rock-hard
in your freezer you can add 1 TSP of
vodka now of course you don't have to
add the vodka but if you do not you're
gonna have to pay attention to the
temperature and the relative frozenness
if that's a word of the sorbet in your
freezer and then you're gonna blend
everything and you're gonna get your
fruit mixture and pour it into a glass
bowl and put it in the freezer overnight
the next day you're gonna scrape out all
of the sorbet
from the bowl and this is what I use but
use whatever you got and then you're
going to throw them in the blender and
then you're gonna blend blend blend
blend blend until it is completely
smooth and wonderful and now we're gonna
make tofu ice cream just get yourself 14
ounces of extra firm tofu and throw that
into a blender and then I use this
Vermont sugar-free syrup it's 1/4 cups
only 15 calories and I'm going to add 6
tablespoons of it to my tofu and then
once again 1 TSP of vodka is going to
keep this from getting very very hard
and this tofu is going to have a very
creamy texture to it I'm then going to
add some unsweetened soy milk 1 cup of
it and then after it's all blended up
it's gonna have an extremely creamy
texture very much like milk very much
like yogurt now is the time where you're
going to decide on what type of fruit
you want to add I'm adding peaches and
raspberries and a whole bunch other
different crazy things here right now
you're probably gonna add somewhere
between 12 to 16 ounces of fruit until
you get it right in the beginning it's
very bland so add a lot of fruit then
after you get your flavor just right
we're just gonna pour this in a bowl and
then once again throw it in a freezer
overnight then I'm gonna make my
absolute favorite of these desserts it's
jumpin Ana ice cream and it's so easy to
make just get yourself some very very
ripe bananas and throw them in your
freezer overnight and then throw them
both in your blender and then to that
you're gonna add 1/4 of a cup of
unsweetened soy milk then add 1/4 of a
teaspoon of vanilla extract that's 1/4
of a teaspoon and then I like to add 1/2
of a teaspoon of cinnamon and then this
is the final texture after it's blended
and this is what its gonna look like
after it freezes overnight and then
we're gonna make a more traditional
mayonnaise that sweeter get 1 cup of
extra firm tofu throw that in a blender
and then you're gonna get yourself 1/4
of a cup of canola oil and then dump
that also into the blender then add 1
tablespoon of lemon juice one and a half
tablespoons of sugar one and a half
tablespoons of Dijon mustard and then
one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and
1/2 teaspoon of salt and then blend
until creamy and this is what it's going
to look like when it's all done
now we're gonna make some coleslaw I'm
also gonna need the sour cream recipe
from the last tutorial which is just one
cup of cottage cheese one tablespoon of
lemon juice and of course I'm gonna need
some green cabbage and here I'm just
gonna add one half of a cup of carrots
to my blender and here they are all
chopped up and then for your cabbage you
can easily reuse that or you can use a
food processor I'm gonna use a food
processor of course and just be very
careful that you don't shred it up too
much it should basically look like this
when it's all done now to our one head
of shredded cabbage we're gonna add 1/2
cup of the carrots then I'm gonna add an
entire onion that has been minced up
real nice and fine that's gonna measure
out to about a half a cup of minced
onion then I'll add 3/4 of a cup of the
fake mayonnaise I just made and then two
tablespoons of the fake sour cream that
I covered in the last tutorial then 2
tablespoons of just regular old
granulated sugar 1 tablespoon of just
regular old ground mustard and 2
tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and
then we're gonna add 1 tablespoon of
celery salt and it's very important
because that's the odd flavor that's in
coleslaw add salt and pepper to taste
and here it is all finished well I hope
