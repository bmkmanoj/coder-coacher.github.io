3 of my Ruby on Rails tutorial today
we're going to talk about a whole bunch
of different things we're going to talk
about static pages testing helper
functions shared layout shared style
sheets images and a whole bunch more so
enough talking let's start writing some
code okay I have the same setup as I had
previously if you didn't watch the
previous tutorials please watch them and
of course I just opened up my whole
entire rails application by typing in su
BL with a space and dot if you are on
Windows you're going to type in as you
BL exe and the directory you want to
open and when you do that sublime text
is going to open up and we're going to
just be adding onto what we created
previously of course there's nothing
over here because we do not have the
server started at this point just have
chrome up here I have my bash shell my
terminal and MySQL all opened in
different tabs and I'm just going to
start writing some code now the very
first thing I want to do is I want to
generate my static pages and I'm going
to start off with just home and about to
do that inside of rails we are going to
just come over here into our terminal
and we're going to type in rails
generate you can just type in G but I
like to type in generate and controller
very important and then you're going to
have to give a name to the main part
that is going to hold your static pages
in this situation I'm going to call this
pages and then I'm going to generate two
static pages one is going to be home and
one is going to be about and I'm just
going to hit enter and there you can see
all the pages are being generated
there's about there's home those are the
routes you can see right here we've
created our different views and there is
our controller and if we jump over here
and go into config and then we go into
routes RB you're going to see that home
and about or right there then if we also
come over here to the app part and click
on controllers you're going to see pages
controllers right here and here are
going to be the two different actions we
have now if we jump back over here and
we type in rails server you'll see that
our server is going to start up and if
we come in here and reload this page
you're going to see that pages about is
going to load for us and there is pages
about we're going to be making a lot of
changes that out of course and of course
like we talked about previously when
either page is called the code is going
be executed inside of these methods so
whenever home is open if there's any
code in here it's going to be executed
and then we're gonna let our view
display whatever we want to display now
let's go in here and actually make these
things look like something they are
going to be stored in the views folder
so let's open that up and then open up
pages and then let's open up about now
inside of here for h1 tags we could say
something like about us and I'm not
going to worry too much about the design
in this we're going to actually cover
how to do layouts but I'm not going to
waste a lot of time making really fancy
layouts at least at this point I will
eventually say something like we love
what we do and do what we love and of
course in the description for this video
is going to be a link to a transcript of
everything I say here so and all the
code and everything of course we could
then come in and do a fare graph tag and
then inside of our paragraph tag we
could do like a form for mailing or
something like that and then after that
we could say contact Dirk for health and
if we save that reload you're going to
see that it's going to now show about us
we love what we do and do what we love
contact there for help and that would
open up my email application if we want
to change the view for our home screen
just go once again it's in views and
then pages is the controller and home
and we could just come up here and just
type in home just to keep it everything
simple and then welcome to our home page
save that and again you see pages up
here and if we type in Home Instead now
you're going to see exactly what we just
type so that's how easy it is to set up
just a basic static page now let's take
a little bit of a look at tests I'm not
going to get too much into testing right
now but we will in the future I just
want to give you a sample of it so you
know exactly how the testing process
goes how to catch errors how to fix
things and so forth and so on
now basically tests are going to allow
us to simulate a user interacting with
our application and we're going to
create tests to secure app to protect
from known errors that come up as we are
creating our application and to protect
code that is likely to change now
whenever we created this application
you're going to see that tests actually
were created as well and to find them
just go down here to tests and then
we're going to go into controllers and
then there is going to be one right here
it's going to be called pages controller
test and there it is right there so
let's zoom in on this now basically what
we see here here's a test for our
homepage what we're doing here is we're
going to be issuing a get request for
the home action like we have here in
this situation and then what we're going
to do is we're going to check to make
sure we receive a success status code
response that is what this is right here
so as long as we use the get action
whenever we call our home page and we
receive a success message we're not
going to throw any errors that's
basically what that's saying we're doing
there so let's jump back over into our
terminal and of course we're going to be
in our main directory and now what I'm
going to do is create the databases
using the settings that we have in our
database dot yml file and to do that I'm
going to go rake DB create and I'm going
to use trace in this situation there so
you can see that a little bit better ok
and whenever you do this you're going to
get some different little errors here
and the reason why is because we did not
give permission for our user in our
database that we have over here SB admin
to access the testing part of our
database so let's go in here and change
that I'm going to exit out of my SQL
first so I'm going to log in as root now
what I'm going to do is go in and grant
privileges for my user in my rails
application well make sure to put in
grant all privileges on and it's SP blog
test dot star to SB admin at localhost
identified by password there we go now
let's say we want to add in another
static page called directions we can go
into pages controller this guy right
here let's open this up so you can see
it well pages controller dot RB now
let's go in and add another test for a
page that hasn't been created yet and
let's sort of walk through the whole
process of creating a page completely
from scratch so we're going to go into
tests and we're going to go into page
controller tests right like that and
throw in another test here we'll go
tests should get directions and then
we'll go do we're basically going to do
exactly the same thing so let's just
copy this paste that in there again it's
going to be another get request but this
time we're going to do a get request for
directions and the response we're
looking for is going to be success like
we did
four and let's save that now if we go
into the terminal once again and type in
rake test we're going to get an error
and there you can see is the air
basically the error is there are no
route matches for directions so let's go
into the routes folder and correct that
once again we're going to go into config
routes Darby and then we're just going
to put in and other gets method here
page is about and we'll type in
directions this time so I'm trying to do
is sort of walk you through common
errors you're going to see because this
is the thing that drives people crazy
about rails now we can jump back over
here again into our terminal and what's
run rake test again
it's going to give us another error and
the error this time is going to be that
there is no action directions in the
pages controller so let's open up the
pages controller and there look that's
the testing one come up here where we
have our assets folder in our app folder
and pages controller open that up and
we're going to have to throw directions
inside of here so it might seem a little
bit confusing but once you see all the
different errors I'm hoping that you're
going to be able to handle all of them
alright so directions so let's save that
now let's jump back over into the
terminal again and type in rake test
again and it's going to give us another
error this error is going to be missing
template pages for directions well
what's the same thing as saying a
template page it's a view so what we're
going to have to do is go and create a
view for it so we're going to go into
our views folder and our pages folder
and we're going to create a new file and
we'll just come up here and say save as
we're going to call this directions dot
HTML dot e or B and save that then
inside of this thing we can just say
let's just do an h1 tag just keep this
simple and say something like directions
right there and then say directions just
to keep it simple save that jump back
over into the terminal and rake test
again and this time we shouldn't get any
errors just want to walk you through the
process of setting all that up Dada Dada
and here you can see zero errors so now
you know the process of basically
creating a static page and all the
different things you need to not get an
error or to show a success and if we
come over here to pages and type in
directions instead you're going to see
that it shows directions and directions
to our place exactly like we wanted now
let's say we wanted to come in here and
check for the presence of a certain HTML
tag on our page well we can just go into
pages
controller test right here open this up
a little bit wider now if we wanted to
verify for example that there was a
title on every single one of our pages
what we could do is go assert select and
put in title and then we could verify
that the title for our page is welcome
for example and let's go and let's do
this for everything else so what this is
doing is it's verifying that there is a
title for our page and the title that is
being used is exactly what we put here
so let's say the next one is about us
and then for our directions let's assert
that there is a title and it is called
directions now if we save that go into
the terminal and perform another test
guess what we're going to get an error
so let's type in rape test and this time
we're going to get three errors because
a title has not been set for any of
these guys as you're going to see here
in one second rapido
and there are the errors you can see
them all right there and there are three
failures in our test so if you want to
go in and provide a tag and give it an
actual value what we're going to need to
do is go into all of our views so let's
open up about this guy right here and if
we say we want to provide a title what
we can do is just come in there like
this and say provide and the tag we're
going to be targeting is title and let's
make this welcome make sure that it
matches with the test that we had before
and then put a percent sign and that
closing bracket and we're going to do
this for all of our different views so
that's a way to set a tag open up the
home tag actually about this would cause
an error so let's say about us because
that's what we said we wanted to show up
in the title for our test about us and
then this one's going to be welcome in
here like this paste that in there and
type in welcome and then we're going to
do the same thing for directions so
right before the h1 tag close that off
and you're going to see here in a moment
exactly where this stuff shows up in our
HTML so this is going to be directions
save that come over here put our scroll
back run rake test hopefully those
failures are going but you're going to
see here that no in fact they are not
and the reason why the failures are
showing up there is we have not properly
set them up in our layout folder now you
can use a default layout for every
single one of your pages or you could
create a
someone for just some of your pages by
coming over here to fuse and then
layouts open this up an application dot
HTML GRB this guy right here and you can
see right here is the reason for the air
title espy blog is being forced in there
and that is overriding the titles that
we are providing so if we want to go and
get the title that we have set inside of
our main things right here these views
see where we said the what our title
should be we're going to need to do is
open this guy up and inside of here go
yield and get the title that was set and
put it inside of there instead of that
static title that we had previously now
if we come over here and run our rake
test you're going to see that failures
went away okay
so that's the process of going through
and sort of fixing the errors and the
types of errors you see and how to
correct everything now we're going to
take a look at helper functions so let's
open this off what this is going to
allow us to do is to create some code
that we'll be able to throw directly
into any of our pages in the location
for our helper files that we're going to
have our functions in is going to be
inside of app we can control this or get
rid of that and helpers right there and
then we're going to specifically use
application helper dot RB open that up
completely empty so let's go in here and
throw some different functions inside of
here so let's say we want to have a
function that is going to get the season
based off of whatever time of year it is
so let's create a function close that
off we're going to create a time object
and time new and this guy is going to
provide us with the day the year the
weekday the year let me actually just
show it to you so if we type in year
like we'll do right here let's say we go
if time let's say we want to get the
month greater than or equal to three so
that would be March and time month less
than or equal to five so we're going to
use the meteorological sort of way of
categorizing seasons what we're going to
output on our screen is yay it is spring
now instead of month we could also type
in year dot year to get whatever the
year is we could type in day to get the
day we can type in W a day which is
going to return zero through six we type
in Y day which is going to return either
0 through 365
we could type in our which is going to
give us the 24 version of ours min which
is going to give us up to 59 SEC which
is going to give us up to 59 for our
seconds or zone which is going to give
us our time zone but we're going to keep
everything thing very simple here and
just stick with month at this moment
well then what we're going to do is
we're going to do an else if paste that
in there and say if the month is greater
than 5 and less than or equal to 8 in
that situation you can see here another
example of how to output your strings
you don't use puts like you may have
thought when I say everyone loves summer
then we go else if and we'll say a
greater than 8 and less than or equal to
10 in this situation we'll say put on
your coat because fall is here else
we're gonna say yuck winter and there is
our function then to keep everything
simple let's just jump into our home
folder where this is going to be the
view for our home thing we got here if
you want to call that function to
execute all we're going to do let's say
we want to throw this inside of P tags
then we're going to just say % is equal
to and then get whatever the name of
that function is so it's going to be get
season this guy right here copy that
jump back over into home paste that in
there and put it for cent sign close
that bracket off if I'll save it and if
we jump over here and go to our home
directory and gave me a little error no
big deal let's jump back over into our
helper directory close off our if
statement and file save reload it and
now you can see it says yeah it is
spring there's just a little function
let's go and create a couple more so you
get used to this so once again this is
in the application underscore helper
file and let's create another function
we can call let's say this one's going
to give the max value of a default value
that's thrown inside of here so we'll
say get random number and it will either
be passed a maximum value for the random
number or we will give it a default
value of 10 and to get a default value
in
we're going to call Rand and pass the
maximum value inside of it and that's
all we need to do whatever the result of
this is is automatically going to be
passed over to us now we'll open up the
home folder well let's copy this here
first jump into home I'm going to be
using exactly the same thing we did here
just close this off copy that paste that
in there get random number throw that in
there and let's say we want a random
number with a maximum value of 100 jump
over here reload the page and you're
gonna see 52 shows up so let's create
some more jump over into the help or
folder or the helper file we might as
well go and review some different Ruby
ways of dealing with things so let's go
and create an array and this guy is
actually going to generate a random
message by pulling data out of an array
so we'll say random welcome so what this
is going to be called and for this guy
let's say we'll have an opening for our
statement so this is the first item in
this array we'll say what a beautiful
day that will be one option that we can
have here inside of here and then we'll
say welcome to our site would be another
random way of opening up this and then
the final one would be thank you for
stopping by
let's go and create our second and third
potential sentence throw those in there
and we'll go and change this to the
middle of our statements and then this
is going to be the ending of our
statement there you can see I threw in
three additional statements inside of
that array and I'll throw three more
inside of here for the ending part okay
so we have our generic phrases now if we
want to generate what will seem like a
ever changing opening statement on our
home page we can come in here and put
quotes down inside of here then generate
a random statement from those different
arrays to do so we would just go opening
inside of these hash symbol right here
and if we want to generate a random
value between 0 and 2 we would throw a 3
inside of there like that and there we
go then we'll do that for all the other
potential ones this one's going to be
middle referencing are all right and
then the final one will be ending then
get random welcome copy that
jump over into our home page going to
call this method exactly how we
previously called them get random
welcome for that in there save it and if
we
load this page and I forgot to put the
little ending thing there no big deal
I'm down inside of here and and reload
and you can see that it automatically
created a custom thing so it says thank
you for stopping by bla bla bla bla bla
if we reload this this all change there
we go
welcome to our site we hope you find
what you need contact if you need help
and reload it and every single time they
go to the page we can see the number
there is changing as well as our little
message there's another way to generate
some random content on a web page and
since I'm covering how to work with code
inside of rails might as well come in
here and show you a looping inside of
rails let's create another one of these
methods and we'll call this one count to
ten generate a value for X equal to two
create another one called number list
and give it a starting value of one if
you want to do looping inside of rails
you can go loop do and then we can go
number underscore list and you're going
to have to whatever you want your final
output to be you're going to have to
store it in a variable and then return
it to the view that calls for it so
we're going to say number list and as
we're cycling through this loop we're
going to add to the value of number list
and we just need to make sure that we
come in here and get X and convert it
into a string so that it can be stored
inside a number list then we're going to
come in and Auto increment value for X
as we loop through here and since we
want to cycle up to ten we're going to
throw a break statement in here it says
we're going to break out of this loop as
soon as X has a value that is greater
than ten make sure we close off our loop
and then if we want to return to the
view our value that we have a number
list put a hash symbol and inside of
curly braces we go number list and
that's our final output make sure you
close this off there's the end statement
and jump back over into home we're going
to copy this guy right here throw that
in there and then we'll call our new
method we have which is count to ten
save that jump over here reload and
there you can see it outputted one
through ten now let's take another look
at the default layout that we're going
to be using for all of our different
pages and talk about how we can change
that it's first off let's look at it a
little bit closer you can see this is
application HTML er B and like I said
before the
is over in the views layouts and this is
generated for us automatically and from
looking at this as you can see we have
doctype HTML what that tells us is we're
going to be using html5 by default and I
have a link in the description to an
html5 tutorial to take a look at that
you see here it's automatically grabbing
our style sheets Java scripts and so
forth and so on now let's come in and
actually generate a layout that looks a
little bit nicer than what we've
currently been using yield this guy
right here is going to output whatever
the HTML is inside of the individual
home pages so this right here will we
have home well all of this is going to
go exactly right here inside of the body
section as you may have guessed now
let's say we want to style all of our
different pages well let's create a div
first off and let's give this an ID
equal to wrapper and then we'll get
those div right here cut that out of
there and we'll paste it down here at
the end of the body section now let's
say inside of our header section we want
to throw in a logo as well as a heading
for our main web page well you may ask
yourself well where exactly do I store
logos well all of your logos or images
you want to use in this situation we're
going to go into SP blog because that's
the name of our little application and
then you're going to go into app and
then you're going to go into assets and
then you're going to go into images and
right here is the logo for our website
so that's where you can store all of
your logos for your webpage now if I
want to be able to go in and access that
logo or get myself some room in the
header section and I'm just going to put
a bracket % is equal to and let's say
that I also want this to link to my home
page I'm going to say a link to and this
is going to be an image tag that I want
to load inside of here well then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to type in
whatever the name is for the image that
I want to load inside of there my alt
text I can then put here and I'll say
something like you think tank just for
the heck of it then after that if I want
to link to a specific page I'm going to
put a comma there put a curly bracket
and we're going to link to the
controller and in this situation I'm
going to link to a static page
going to be my home pages so I'm going
to say the controllers name is pages and
if we come over here to the controller
section there's pages controller that's
what I'm referencing well then what I
need to do is actually link to the
action that I want to call inside of
that guy so I'm going to say action like
this and I want to specifically go to
the home page whenever that's clicked on
put another comma at the end of that and
then if I want to also give it a class
so I'll be able to come in here and
style this image I put a colon and class
and let's say that I want to give this
the class name of website logo there you
go % and close that off % there we go so
that is how we're going to be able to
load our images in now let's say that I
want to also have a title for my web
page I'm gonna use just a simple link to
in this situation because I do not need
an image in this situation so I'm going
to say link to then inside of this I can
put in whatever the text I want to show
up there then I can also come in and put
in a link where I want it to go to
whenever this is clicked on so I have to
put a reference to the controller once
again we're going to say pages and then
the action that we want to specifically
call whenever it's clicked on and then
in this situation I'm just going to let
that be home again there's home and
let's say I want to also go in and give
this a class name no problem just type
in class equal to and we will call this
guy website title closed off with a
percent and bracket there we go now will
be the end of our header file and if we
reload this you're going to see right
there there is our little website logo
there is reddit and now let's go in and
style it a little bit better off what
are some other things we might want to
add to this well we might also want to
add in navigation so after our header
section let's go in and throw in our
navigation ID is equal to and we'll call
this horizontal nav like that throw this
inside a paragraph tags and then if we
want to specifically link to different
parts of our website % equal to we're
going to use link to once again we can
provide the name that we want for our
link in this situation I'll use home
again we're going to reference the
controller just like we did before if we
want to link to pages which
the controller's name there that is the
specific action that we want to call
make sure we put our little colon inside
of there and then we want to reference
the action we want to call which is home
in this situation let's go and do this
for all of the other different lengths
that we want for our website so paste
this inside of here our next one is
going to be about and about is going to
be what shows up on the screen
this is pages again and this guy is
going to be about because that's the
action we're going to be calling it's go
and create another one
paste this inside of here this one's
going to be directions there that is
everything else is the same except this
guy is going to be directions so that's
how we can link to all those different
things
now we created articles and users also
in the previous part of this tutorial so
how do we reference them well we're
going to give this a different name
let's call this articles there's
articles controller in this situation is
not going to be pages but instead is
going to be articles and why do I know
that because right here in the
controllers folder it's called articles
and the specific action I want to call
let's open this up just so you can see
it there we go and the specific action
I'm going to open up in this situation
it's going to be index so that's what
I'm going to put inside of there jump
back over here and type in index for our
action make sure we close that off and
then let's say we also want to link to
our users this is how we're going to be
able to link to all the different parts
of our site and in this situation we use
users and the specific action we'll use
here is also going to be index save that
and then make sure that we have a
closing tag for our navigation and
there's a nav and we come over here
remember there's no styling so this is
going to be ugly clicked on that and you
can see there's home about directions
articles we can click on them and see
that they show up okay bounce back over
here this is still in the application
this is the layout folder this guy over
here layouts application HTML now we can
define the main part of our site so
we'll type in main give this an ID equal
to content and this is going to surround
all of our content on our screen so
let's close that off and now let's go in
and style the web site so it looks a
little bit nicer so where exactly do we
style everything well most part
everything is going to be in the app
section so here's our app folder going
to open up the app part we're going to
look in assets then we're gonna look in
style sheets
you're going to see one that matches up
with our main application layout and
it's called application dot CSS I'm
going to get more into sass later on but
for now just going to keep this quite
simple bounce inside of here and let's
say that we want to set a hover change
for whenever a link is hovered over just
like we do in regular CSS we're going to
color and let's just throw a random
color inside here 0:07 EBD and I get all
my colors from the wiki colors website
if anybody wonders had that question
before let's throw in a background and
in this situation let's just make sure
this is FFF so that our color stays
white and we command make couple more
changes let's say that we want our body
to have a specific background color so
background I'm in here bounce over here
reload this just see how things are
changing a little bit there you can see
that backgrounds changed now I'm going
to go in and target the wrapper so that
we can have this part be white and then
the background bead whatever the
background is let's keep these open at
the same time so we're going to target a
div and a wrapper it's going to be the
name for our class soaping that up let's
make the margin for it auto let's make
the backgrounds for this white and we
can define our width as well as 800
pixels and our height let's make this
2,000 pixels
I'll save reload it and there you can
see the wrapper let's pay attention here
to get the padding and all that stuff
look a little bit neater I'd also like
to put some padding here for our header
section so let's go into the header
section let's display this as block
we'll add in some padding on this and if
you don't remember the CSS basically
going to be north is going to be
whatever so we're going to say we want
10 pixels of padding on the top 10
pixels of padding on the right 30 pixels
of padding on the bottom and then
10 adding pixels on the left side reload
this you're going to see that move see
padding change let's go in throw in some
more CSS styling say we want to have the
styling for our logo let's make sure
that it floats left and let's turn off
any text decoration now remember this is
a link so website logo and let's say we
want to float left and let's say we want
to turn off text decoration change that
to none let's also do some styling on
our website title and that's the read it
part right there going to be making a
bunch of changes on this let's say we
want to have the font size as 50 pixels
text decoration and change that to none
let's play around with the font weight
I'm going to be surprised as you are by
what comes out here let's change this to
bold display let's make it inline and
we're going to mess around with our line
height let's make it 90 pixels this what
I'm trying to do is Center this in the
upper part as much as possible and then
we'll throw in some padding to the left
so that the title doesn't bounce
directly right next to the image for our
website
and let's see how that looks let's
reload it hey there it is read it
alright so that looks good enough all
right so let's do a little bit more
styling here let's correct the
navigation part here what I want to do
is have the background be black so if I
want to target in the horizontal
navigation once again that is this guy
right here
so there's navigation right there and
you can see the name of it is horizontal
navigation that's when I'm playing
around with jump back over here so I'm
going to go target this class horizontal
Navis it's name and let's display this
as block again we want to throw in some
padding on this as well as we'll just
copy this paste that in there 10 let's
change this to 20 for the right padding
10 for the bottom padding and 10 for the
left padding is fine now let's change
the background color for this background
and change that to black save that
reload it there's navigation you can
barely see the color though so let's go
in and change the colors for all our
links in our navigation and we're going
to do
that by just referencing the class and
then specifically referencing the link
so right like that and let's get rid of
the text decoration change that to none
so there's no underline and let's say do
I start padding on there no copy padding
here throw that in there let's add an
additional left padding on this guy and
let's change that to 20 yeah it does
sort of butt up a little bit so let's
change that to 20 for the left padding
let's go in and change my font weight
and let's make all of those links bold
and let's change the color for this to
white because we know that'll show up
better and reload and there you can see
they're spaced out a little bit nicer
and they look pretty good
okay I know they're not beautiful that's
not the point I'm just trying to add
some styling so that you see exactly how
to add styling going to add your own
styling afterwards let's look and see if
there's anything else we want to do here
that's ugly alright so see how whenever
I put my mouse over top of these that
white shows up let's go and change the
hover text for that so horizontal nav
and if we want to target whenever we
hover over a la link hover and let's
change our background color to black so
that won't show up
save that reload it now when I hover it
doesn't change to black but it also
doesn't change at all so let's change
our text color whenever it hovers like
that let's change the 0:07 EBD and now
you can see it changes the blue whenever
we hover so that's a little bit nicer
and what else a final thing I'm just
going to target the main content section
and pad around all of our main content
so how will target that is just type in
May and then we'll throw in some padding
on this so let's just copy this paste
that in there and let's say that I want
to have top padding of 10 pixels right
padding of 20 pixels bottom of 20 and
then just leave this be 20 and there you
can say looks a little bit nicer there
you go guys that is how to do a whole
bunch of different things with rails I'm
gonna make a couple more rails tutorials
until I've covered everything probably
going to deal with login and session
management and things like that next
