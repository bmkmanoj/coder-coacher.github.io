11 of my web design and programming
tutorial if you didn't watch the
previous tutorial definitely check that
out if you don't know I mainly focus on
PHP right now but we're gonna move into
other programming languages for all the
people sending me messages as for me
what I'm going to cover JavaScript and
jQuery that will be coming up very soon
we're gonna continue doing here today is
going over classes and all the things I
haven't covered so far so here I'm
creating another animal class like I
created before and I'm gonna create a
private variable called name if you
remember from the previous tutorial
private variables can only be changed by
methods or functions that lie within the
class I'm giving a default value and
then I am going to create what is called
a static attribute or variable and a
static attributes value is shared by all
objects of the class it's like a shared
value that every class can access and
the value will change if those other
classes that are or objects that are
associated with the class decide to
change it or access it or do whatever it
is just simply a shared variable that
every single object will use and if one
object changes the value of this static
value that is going to be reflect it
whenever any of the other objects go in
and try to access this shared variable
so I'm gonna call it public obviously
and then define it as a static attribute
if you're confused by why I keep saying
attributes or variables it's in objects
you're supposed to call them attributes
instead of variables and you're supposed
to refer to functions as methods that's
why I'm doing that so what I'm gonna do
here is I'm actually going to count up
every single time I create a new animal
object so that's the point of this and
this is probably the most common way
that static variables are also used and
then I'm gonna create a construct file
function and I'm going to allow the
person to set the name for the animal
that they create however if they do not
give it a name I'm gonna sign at the
default value of no name and I'm gonna
echo here that the construct function
was called and I do this a lot in my
code whenever I first created obviously
they don't do it afterwards and I'm
going to set the name for this new
animal just like that by calling this
set named func
which I'm gonna create here in a minute
and here is how you access static
variables you type in self instead of
this followed by two colons and then
whatever that is called whatever that
static variable attribute is called and
here I'm just increasing the value of it
by one and now I'm going to show you how
to destroy an object when it's no longer
used you call the destruct function and
all I'm gonna do here is notify you the
destruct was called so you'll know when
a object has been deleted I'm gonna
create some functions here that are
gonna both return the value of the
variable called name as well as set it
and whenever I use the final keyword
that means that I do not want this
function to be overridden by any other
methods whenever any new classes extend
this animal class which I'm gonna
explain to to you exactly what that
means here in a second inheritance is
done whenever you create a new class
from another class and I'm going to show
you this in a moment
thus you borrow the data and the methods
that can be found there and you can then
overwrite them however if you do not
want a certain function to have the
ability of being overwritten you started
off with the final name and then it
cannot be overwritten and it would be a
good idea to have functions that both
return values as well as set values to
be assigned with the final keyword and
from last tutorial you know what that's
doing that's just returning by celebrate
returning that value I'm also going to
assign the final keyword in this
function and this is going to set the
value for the attribute name name and
then close that off now I'm gonna create
some other functions that I want to be
made public make noise most animals do
that now there's going to output
favorite food want to access that value
called this which is a reference again
to the object and then followed by the
attributes a name close that off and
there we defined a whole bunch of
different functions for this animal
class now we got to close off that class
and here I'm going to show you how to
extend that class by creating a new
class called dog and
following that by extends and then the
animal class name and what this means is
this class dog is automatically going to
get all the functions and all of the
attributes of the animal class that's
what we're doing here that's all we're
doing we can overwrite those functions
that don't begin with final and we can
change any number of other different
things first I'm going to create
construct again name is equal to and we
give it the default value of no name
start this off now if you want to call
the parent construct method you would
just start off with parent : : construct
you know run everything that is in the
parent or animal class for you
you're gonna pass the value of name and
you could also do this by typing in
animal Colin : construct so that's
another way you could call the parent
what it's called the parent class animal
is the parent of dog because dog is
extending the animal class and if you
don't define these construct and
deconstruct files the parent is
automatically run and here we're going
to overwrite the make noise function
that we saw up here make noise because
we know that dogs do more than just Gurr
they also bark and how you overwrite a
function is just simply by creating it
then whenever you call this new function
make noise it's going to run the dog
make noise version instead of calling
the parent but otherwise everything else
that isn't overwritten that's gonna call
that if you still want to call the
animal make noise its function this is
how you do that it's gonna call the
original but because dogs also bark I'm
gonna put bark bark in there as well so
that's how you create a new function
from a previous version and tell you
overwrite functions inside of there now
I'm gonna create a new object of type
dog my newest class and I'm gonna call
him Grover and I'm gonna create another
one just so you can see our garbage
collection is handled meaning the
calling of the construct function to
eliminate objects that are not used in
memory and then I'm going to use Grover
to call a new make noise function that
you just created or you use to overwrite
the original and going to call the favor
food function as well and this is how
you call the move function even though
you did not overwrite it with the dog
class it still hasn't and then if you
want to echo to screen the static
variable which will show you the number
of animals that were created you do that
just like this and I scroll up here I
made one little error this should be num
of animals and we found save that you
can see here what exactly what happened
well I created Grover a new object of
type dog so the constructor foul was
called create that new object and I
created another object tall constructor
file was called again and I had Grover
make noise so you see ger was printed
why whisker printed and bark bark the
reason why is we made a reference to the
original animal function or version of
make noise and then we followed that
with bark bark then we come down to
favorite food and it says my favorite
food is meat called the move function
that prints out walk around and then I
made a reference to the total number of
objects that were created because we
created this animal static variable or
attribute called num all animals and
since two objects were created you can
see it printed to the screen and then we
no longer needed these objects so it
called both the destruct files and that
is pretty much everything you need to
know about object-oriented programming
with PHP like I said I'm going to cover
some things in the future through
examples but polymorphism really doesn't
work with PHP because you cannot extend
functions and you can't do a lot of the
other different things that you can do
with polymorphism you can sort of hack
it and I'm going to show you some of the
hacks in future tutorials but this is
all definitely you need to know for now
so if you have any questions or comments
leave them in the comment section below
and up next I'm going to go over file
i/o all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
