of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm going to show you how
to read and write information to files
using PHP and start off this is very
simple you need to create what's called
a file descriptor just think of this as
an address for the location of your file
and whenever you create this with the F
open function you have to of course tell
it what file that you wish to use and
then you have to define what sort of
privileges you want to have when in
regards to working with this file so if
you put R in here that just gives you
read privileges for the file however
there's a bunch of other different
things you could put inside of here but
let's say you wanted to have read and
write capabilities with this file you'd
type in our plus instead of R and all of
the information that you would write to
this file would begin at the very
beginning of the file not at the end of
the file you could also get just writing
privileges again at the beginning of the
file with W if you type in W plus what
that's going to do is going to delete
the contents the current contents of the
file and give you read and write access
to the file at the beginning of the file
while I keep saying that over and over
again because a will give you write only
privileges that will appear at the end
of the file meaning that anything that
you send to the file is going to be
appended to the content that's already
there and if you type in a plus that's
going to give you read and write access
to the file okay so those are all the
different codes that are available to
you then after you get that information
from the file you're going to want to
call a while loop and you're going to
want to continue to pull information in
as long as the end of the file is not
reached and that's what that code right
there will do for you and again this is
the file descriptor and you want to put
your curly braces in there then you're
going to use a function called F gets to
return all the characters up to either a
new line or an end of file and I'm just
going to echo to screen all this
information put the file we're working
with inside of here in a break and I'm
going to end that and then print out
another break after we get all that
information out there on the screen and
that's all it takes and this is the
customer file by the way you want to see
what it looks like
comma separated you but it saved as a
text
format but that's all that is there and
if I file save this and jump over here
you can see it jumped in there and it
grabbed all that information and printed
it out to screen which is exactly what I
wanted it to do you can also read a file
and all of the information contained in
the file into an array and I'll show you
how to do that let's just delete that
and let's call this customers and you
just call the file function dot txt and
you don't need to put anything else in
there
and all that information is going to be
appended to an array so we're going to
have to call the for each looping tool
customers as customer and then what
you're going to do is you want to take
all of the information that is contained
in this customers text file being named
street city and state and you're going
to save those to individual variables
with this list function so I'll call it
name Street city state and I'm going to
explode that array stating that
everything that is separated with commas
should be sent into these variables that
I have defined over here and just like
that now State is going to have a new
line at the end of it so I'm going to
call the trim function on state to get
rid of that new line because I have to
be troublesome and let's say that I want
to echo out the screen name just like
that and then I'm going to copy this
input Street city state and again right
like that and then I'm going to close
off this for each loop and if I hit file
save jump over here you can see it took
all that information and printed it out
the screen with a little bit more
information in regards to what's
contained there and if I want to make
this a little bit easier to see
so everything separated put another
break statement there file stay and you
can see everything's all split up so it
took all the information stored it in
array broke it apart stuck it into
individual variables and then printed
everything out so it's pretty useful now
let's say that I want to I'm actually
going to save this guy right here I'm
going to delete this and I'm going to
stick this stuff between a comment block
because I'm going to want to reuse that
now let's I'm going to show you now
exactly what it looks like if I want to
append information to the end of this
file and this will not work unless you
have writing access to said file so if
you get an error that you can't write to
this file that
why you have to have the proper
permissions to be able to do that so
it's an arrow that may come up okay so
let's say I want to add a new customer
and let's say his name is Rick and Yul
is at 219 almond Street okay how would I
append this information with the f8
function and the file descriptor that I
want to write to boom just like that and
you should always call F close on a file
when you're done with it so I could did
right there and now I'm going to show
you how you can read that information
into a string customers is equal to file
get contents this is going to read
everything into a string for you and I'm
going to explode this time based off of
a new line that is in the string and
then this is the same you're going to do
exactly the same thing in this for each
block that's why I saved it I'll go file
save jump over here and you can see that
everything printed out here to screen
even the new customer that you added to
the file right here and the other thing
you can do with PHP is grab information
off the web so let's say file 2 is equal
to F open and because there's been a lot
of attention in regards to this let's
jump over to a working version of
WikiLeaks and know by the way I do not
have anything to do with WikiLeaks I'm
not affiliated with them I just hoped
some people set up some mirror sites and
then I put a bunch of information on my
website and ever since I've been getting
barrage with emails thinking I run a
hacker or website which I do not just
believe in a cause that's it ok so I'm
going to grab this page off the web and
I want to read that information
obviously I'm like a trite - it's on my
website and I'm going to read it in text
you could also read it in binary but not
much point that and again I'm going to
look for the end of the file
- inside of curly brackets I'm going to
append what I got off of there using the
F gets file what this is going to do is
it's going to strip out any tags in the
HTML file that you pull over and it's
common to say that you want the first
124 characters that's what that stands
for
just always type 124 could always do
what you wanted to do close that file
off and here I'm going to show you how
to write all that information you just
pull it off that website
- another text file the other double
cloner and i want the ability to write
text all right so that's going to pull
all that information from this specific
website and pull it over here
and I'm going to save it to the string
and then I'm going to save that to this
text file that I have on my site
okay file save reload it and it doesn't
look like anything happened but if we
click on just the facts you can see that
it grabbed all that information and
saved it to the file that I have here
the text file so there's a whole bunch
of different things you can do with file
i/o with PHP have any questions or
comments leave them down below till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
