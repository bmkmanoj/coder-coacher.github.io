new tutorial on how to make Android apps
I'm going to specifically be using
Android studio but if you use eclipse
feel free to use it I'll make sure that
everything still makes sense if you
don't know how to install Android studio
I have a link in the description
underneath the video I also have another
link under there for Android beginners
if at any point in time any of this
confuses you and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it alright so here is
Android studio starting huh and there it
is so the very first thing we're going
to do is just go into new project and
I'll explain every single thing here
first you're going to type in your
application name I'm just going to call
this hello again and of course I have
all the code I also in the description
under the video and this is very simple
it's just going to be your application
name then down here you're going to see
module name just leave that set for app
and basically a module is just going to
contain everything you need for your
application to be able to run you're
going to have package name and you're
going to have to type in something
unique here I have new think-tank type
in something else and the whole purpose
of the package name is to make sure that
everything you do is unique this is the
location for all of your files which we
set up previously in the tutorial on how
to install all this stuff right here
we're just going to leave the minimum at
this point in time set for 8 and this is
just the minimum version of Android on a
device that's going to be able to run
your application and we're going to set
our maximum at 19 now there's gonna be a
new version of Android coming out very
soon don't worry I'll automatically
switch but you normally don't have to
worry about it because Android doesn't
change that dramatically from version to
version and most of the time they're
backwards compatible changes so not a
big deal down here you'll see language
level this is something you don't really
need to worry about but if you want to
know what it is basically in Java 6 the
override annotation no longer applies to
interface methods so this turns that
capability back on like I said if that's
confusing don't worry about it you don't
need to know any more than that and we
come down to theme now basically styles
or themes are going to specify the look
of your app Android is going to provide
a whole bunch of pre-made themes for you
to be able to use and but right here
well I basically just have a couple so
I'm just going to keep this very very
simple and just have a low light and
dark action bar now I don't want to
click on this because I don't really
feel like uploading a icon but if I did
when I upload an icon inside of this
wizard I would
check there if you want Android studio
to automatically create an activity for
a year you're going to put a checkmark
there if you want to actually define
what is called an android library you'd
put a check right here and basically
what that is an android library is it's
going to contain source code and other
random resources that you'll be able to
share with other Android projects we're
not going to do that now you have
support mode and you can see right here
we could have a grid layout
automatically set up for us we could set
up fragments navigation drawer action
bar just by clicking inside of here but
we're going to pass on that as well so
let's come down here and let's click on
next
whenever we click on next we're going to
have a whole bunch of different types of
activities that we can have set up by
Android studio I'm going to stick with
blank activity but by the end of this
tutorial I'm going to take you through
every single one of those come down here
again and click on next and then
basically everything you really kind of
need to worry about is right here now
we're going to have a main activity
which is going to be your Java class
file which is going to be all the code
behind your application and then we're
gonna have an XML file called activity
main which is going to basically allow
you to design your layout for your
application but don't worry about it if
you're not an XML guru you don't need to
be and that is it I'm just gonna leave
all those at default and click on finish
and it's going to go and start building
that for me while we're waiting for that
I'm going to take you through the folder
structure of a Android studio project
alright so here we are basically the
idea folder is just going to contain
project specific data that is stored
here by Android studio don't worry about
it you don't need to know anything else
about it at this point in time then
we're going to have the app folder which
is basically your project module this is
your application and then you're going
to have a Gradle file I went over a
Gradle a little bit in my androids
tutorial on how to install Android
studio but basically it is going to
contain all the Gradle specific build
files we'll get more into that later
let's dive into the app folder however
and whenever we jump into the app folder
we're going to have the build folder
which is going to contain all your
compiled classes are to generate files
and other resources we're also going to
have a lips folder which is only to
contain all the libraries you import in
your project if a this is confusing to
worry about it I'm going to cover it
over and over again you're going to get
it and then whilst I've into our source
folder which is going to have the main
application code now inside the source
folder there's couple folders we're
going to focus in on here first I'm
going to focus on main inside of main
you're going to have a package name
which is going to make your application
unique and then you're going to have
mainactivity.java which is going to be
all the code for your application also
in the source folder and in the main
folder you're going to have a resources
folder and let's go through the specific
resources first you're going to have a
whole bunch of drawable folders and
they're basically just going to contain
images that are going to be stored at
different resolutions so your app looks
nice on every screen that it opens on
you're going to have your layout folder
which is you're basically going to
define the layout of your application in
XML like I said before and it's going to
be stored there and later on you are
also going to be storing many other
different layouts for your application
as they get more complicated then inside
of your menu folder you're going to have
a file called main.xml where you're
going to be able to define what is in
the menu for your application
you're going to have values down here
which is going to store standards for
your application like text colors
dimension styles and a whole bunch of
other different things and then finally
you can have an Android manifest which
is basically going to provide
information about your application so
that the Android device is going to be
able to run it all right so that's all
we need to do right now let's jump over
our project should be ready to go
alright so we got our tip of the day
let's close that and the first file well
first I'm going to do is I'm going to
jump up here and enlarge the text there
you can see all the text is real big now
so let's go move some stuff around here
basically you're going to have your
application be built right here you can
see right now it is just a simple hello
world this is a textview we're going to
be talking about those later on let's
just shrink this down and here's all the
folders I was talking about before see
there's idea there's app there's build
there's all the different folders you
can see right there's a whole bunch of
drawable folders okay we'll get into it
don't worry about it so it's going to
take a little bit time alright so like I
said whenever you first open this up
activity main is going to be showing on
your screen and you're going to see
relative layout you may ask yourself
what is relative layout well I'm going
to quickly explain all the different
layouts available okay so you basically
have linear layouts and they can either
be vertical or horizontal if these are
all the components that you want to move
on the screen basically they're just
going to stack them vertically that's
all let's do it then you're going to
have four
zonal linear layouts and they're
basically going to stack them
horizontally as long as they fit so this
one fits there this one fits there this
is not going to fit over here in this
little box so it puts it down here and
so forth and so on and you're going to
have relative layouts they are going to
lay out all of your different components
relative to all the other components so
if I want to put this guy in here and I
want it to match the parent the parent
is actually going to be the relative
layout all right so that's the parent I
want to match the parent and the parent
is fullscreen it's basically going to
fit inside of that area data phone we'll
put this guy in here I'm going to say I
want it to be below one which is going
to be this guy so it is below one and to
the left of 3 this is 3 that is 3 then
I'm going to say when I put this
component in here I want it to be below
1 it is and I want it to be the right of
2 which it is so that's how that fits
and then finally for the last one I'm
going to say I want it to be below 3 you
don't have to say below 2 and 3 just
below 3 works and then I want it to
align to the right of the parent which
is the relative layout and that's where
it is to the right and then finally we
have grid layouts they're basically
going to line up everything like a
spreadsheet in a table format very
simple you're going to have different
sizes and you're going to be able to fit
your components in in a really neat way
so that's all you need to know about
relative layouts or layouts in general
so let's go back to the code ok so here
we are and you can see right here match
parent we're going to match the parent
which is the screen here our activity
and we're also going to match the parent
for the height that's what that is we're
going to put in some padding and I'm
going to get into what's going on here
with the dimension stuff basically we're
going to have a dimensions folder that's
going to contain all that information
here I'll show it to you all right so
let's just jump over here and values and
there's the dimensions folder let's open
it up and there you can see you may be
asking yourself why is it done this way
well basically Android is big on keeping
everything in its place so if we want to
keep all of our dimensions for every
single thing and reuse them in a
consistent manner it kind of makes sense
to be able to define them in a central
location and then give them a specific
name then we can just use that name over
and over and over again and if we want
to change across our entire app this
from 16 to 15 we just do that and every
single place is changed so that's the
dimensions folder they're also going to
have a strings
folder down here open that up you're
going to define your text inside of your
strings folder and what's awesome about
that is we're going to be actually be
able to have multiple different strings
folders for different languages so
somebody is French or speaks another
language it's automatically going to
translate which is very cool and again
everything is in a central location so
it's very easy to make changes so for
example if we wanted to come in here and
change this from hello world to hello
again we can just type in hello again
and it's going to change of course save
it but that's all we need to do then we
could jump it over into activity main
and as you saw right there it opened up
when I was an activity man but it didn't
when I was there I get that question all
the time you just have to click on
activity main to get your little phone
to show up and you can see right here
says hello again now hello
again right there in the text view so I
was rather simple I'm gonna get into
context later on because they're a
little bit complicated and I don't want
to mess things up and I go into text
view if I wanted to create a brand new
guy here I'm basically just going to
have string this is reference to the
string by XML folder and then hello
world specifically and if we go in here
you can see low world and it says hello
again but it doesn't really matter so
that's how we're going to be able to use
different types of text and translate
and do all kinds of other cool things
very nice well we are here let's also go
into the Android manifest since we're
jumping around a whole bunch and here is
the Android manifest file now this is
just basic XML saying what this is
encoded in this right here is what we
call a namespace which is just going to
make sure that everything used in
Android is unique there is your package
which is also there so everything is
unique allow backup here we have that
marked is true and basically what this
is going to do is if your application
needs to be reloaded if you have this
set to true it's going to automatically
update all the information that was in
the application prior to that drawable
this is a reference to your icon and
then this is a reference to the style
folder which is going to contain your
theme come down inside of here again see
right here activity name this guy right
here basically what we're saying here is
this is the activity to launch when the
application starts this is basically
just the name for your application as
you can see right there there
mainactivity come down here inside of
intent filter basically an intent is
nowhere near as complicated as some
people make it and intent is just a
request for an action to be taken that's
it it's just saying I have the intention
to do something and that is it and then
under here what we're going to do is
we're going to define what action we
want to take the type of actions that an
intent could say it would like to take
is to do something like start an
activity which is what we're doing right
here or to start a service like
downloading data or to deliver a
broadcast which is basically a message
to other apps we'll get more into those
later but the intent filter specifically
here is going to specify the type of
intense an app can respond to and
receive by putting action main here we
are saying that the main activity class
is the one that needs to execute when
the app starts and then by putting
category launcher here we're saying that
it this application should appear in the
launcher as the top-level application so
that is Android manifest we can close
that don't need to do anything else with
it and let's jump over into
mainactivity.java and i'll go through
what's going on here whenever your
application starts the very first thing
that's going to happen is this method
right here called on create it's going
to be launched a bundle is used to pass
information between activities we'll get
more into that later set content view is
going to set the file activity main as
the user interface that we're going to
be using and let's jump over there right
now and start playing around with that
so we're in activity main again
now let's say we want to the text to be
bigger so we can actually see it here on
our screen to change the text size I'm
just going to come in here and I'm going
to type in text size you can see there
it is right there just hit enter and
then inside of this I'm going to put 40
DP now you're probably very well
informed that the abbreviation px stands
for pixels well D P stands for density
independent pixels and basically that
just means that images or text or
whatever are going to scale based on
screen density and the vast majority of
the time you're going to use DP however
in the situation in which you're using
fonts you're going to use SP which is
very similar to DP and is known as scale
independent pixels if you'd like to know
but basically use SP with fonts and use
DP for every single
thing else now let's say we'd also like
our text to be centered inside of the
application could type out layout and
normally it's very easy to see here but
because it is so big because I enlarge
the font it's a little bit harder to say
so I'm going to have to type in center
and I can see right there horizontal is
right there I'm gonna hit enter and then
I'm just going to put in true which I'm
just gonna type out and that's just
going to Center the text like you can
see right there it did now let's say I
wanted to add a button well I could go
and type out button and do all those
different things I could also come down
here into the design section and click
on this and then come over here to the
button and just grab it and drag it and
everything is going to be relative you
can sort of see that happen in there
right now I'm just going to drop it
right there and if I jump back into text
and click on this you're going to see my
button and everything has been created
for me right there
now I could leave this text right here
set as new button but we all know that's
not good it's actually telling me it's
not a good idea
so I'm going to do instead is I'm going
to copy this and jump over into
strings.xml right like this and I'll
just go and paste it in there like that
and I'm just going to go string name and
I'm going to type in button 1 text then
I'll get new button right here and paste
it right there I can copy this jump back
over into activity main.xml and now I'm
going to be able to go in here and just
put in an empress and string /and button
text and now it's happy with me now the
ID part right here you might be
wondering why that looks all funky by
having this ID inside here it's going to
allow us to interact with the buttons
and the text views over inside of our
code this part right here basically
means that we are going to be adding
another ID and there is a master file
called our dot Java which is
automatically generated this is saying
to add the button right here to the our
dot Java file don't worry about that and
never go in and start playing around
with the article Java file causes all
kinds of problems let's say I want to
give this a more descriptive name no
problem
there you go first button and you can
also see right here that it's centered
horizontally and it says right here
because this is a relative layout that
we want it to be below the textview and
that's basically all we're going to have
to do with our activity right now let's
jump over into this guy and let's say
something like you clicked and save that
back over into activity main and you're
going to say that it changed too you
clicked you can maybe see that I'll
enlarge it say you clicked okay let's
put that back again and now let's jump
over into mainactivity.java and start
writing the code so that whenever you
click on that button it's going to
interact with the textview can see up
here all the different files that we are
going to be importing now like I said
before the main activity is going to be
the main class for your application the
bundle passes data back and forth
between different applications but we
only have one or different activities
setcontentview says use activity
main.xml as your layout and if I want to
get a hold of our textview I'm first off
going to have to mark it final in this
situation because I want to use it in an
inner class I'm just going to type in
text view and I'll call it first
textview everyone I'm going to have to
do is I'm going to have to cast it into
a text view because what is passed back
is a basic component called a view so I
have to say hey this is a text view and
to actually get it I say find view by ID
and then specifically inside of there
I'm going to put our dot ID dot and then
I call it text view you can see it right
there
and there we go and don't forget to put
semicolon at the end and you can also
see up here that it automatically
imported my text view libraries that I
was going to use which is very
convenient and basically I'm going to do
exactly the same thing with the button
except in this situation I am going to
not have to mark it final because I'm
not using it inside of the inner class
let's call this first button I'm going
to have to cast it to a button again
find you by ID and the ID for this is r
dot ID dot first button and these of
course or just the IDS that I gave them
whenever I created them activity main
you could say this is called first
button and the other one right here is
called textview so there it is that's
why that's coming from jump back over an
activity main now if I want to tell the
button to listen for a click and then do
certain things I just go first button
dot set on click listener pops up and
then inside of this guy I'm going to go
new this is going to create a inner
class view dot on click listener there
we go
it automatically went and created all
that stuff for me which is awesome and
then whenever this is clicked I want to
set the textview text to different text
and
do that I just go first text view set
text there we go and I'm just going to
say you clicked and there it is and that
is how simple it is to have different
components interact with each other I
mean I barely even had to type anything
this guy down here is going to add
different items to our action bar but
I'm not using that right now and then
this one down here is going to allow you
to define what happens when different
action bar items are clicked on so
that's everything so let's run it
basically just going to come up here
click on run app and if things aren't
going well you're going to be able to
come down here and look at all the
different error messages I went more
into that in the previous tutorial on
how to install Android studio this is
going to pop up I can either choose a
device that I've connected to my
computer or I'm going to come down here
and just click on Nexus 7 which I set up
previously I can say use same device for
future launches and click on OK now the
first time you build this it's going to
take forever to run and that's just
great I'll doing what Gradle does but
then after as you run it more and more
it's going to get much quicker if you
can get a hold of an Android device I
would get a hold of one because it's
going to save you an insane amount of
time and they're not really that
expensive and here is the application
opening up and like I said this can take
a considerable amount of time whenever
you first start using it so bear with it
you have to wait for it to work hey just
turn your switch and here is your
application all setup says hello again
and you click shows up so there you go
pretty simple application but covers a
lot of course I'm going to be covering a
lot more information and be more than
happy to take your advice so please
leave your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
