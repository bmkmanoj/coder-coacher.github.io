51 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to draw the game board
in the previous tutorial which if you
haven't watched it you have to watch it
before you can proceed to this one we
created our asteroid objects in the
class for those objects and then this
one I'm going to create the game board
all of the code in this tutorial is
available underneath the video and you
should get it if you really want to
learn this stuff it's free so get it
alright so just like last time I'm going
to use sort of a modified unified
modeling language or UML here to define
my class diagram for my game board and
just to stay within my normal naming
conventions I'm going to call the game
board lesson 51 but it's the game board
so I got to think about looking at
what's on the left side of the screen
what type of things I'm going to need to
define I'm basically going to create an
object that's going to represent the
game board then I'm going to create a
method that's going to redraw the game
board and then I'm going to create
another method that is going to draw the
game board for the first time and then
make changes there after that are going
to be passed on and then redrawn okay so
I'm going to define of course I'm going
to need to know my width of my game
board so that's something I need and I'm
also going to need to know my height
form a game board say it's pretty simple
and then I'm basically just going to
have my main function just like always
in the past and it's going to return
nothing later on I'm going to do a more
perfect UML tutorial but just for now to
keep it simple I'm going to do
everything this way so then I'm going to
need to repaint my game board every
single time there's changes to be made
and I'm going to pass it the board which
is going to be of less than 51 and then
what do I need to do well I'm going to
call the constructor and this guy right
here is going to be passed the game
board which once again is named less
than 51 and it's going to return nothing
then quite simply all it's going to do
is execute code over and over and over
again and that is what we call a thread
alright so then what do I need to do
well I need to define what the game
board is going to start out as so this
is going to be another method called
game drawing panel and one of the things
that's on the screen obviously what's
bouncing around rocks so I'm going to
have to create an array list that's
going to be full of a bunch of rock
objects and then I'm also going to need
to have
access to the polygon array that's an
integer array contain all the X points
for all the polygons and I'm also going
to need to have access to the y array
for those polygons and width is going to
be a reference to the actual width of
the board and height is going to be
another integer that's going to have
represent the height of the board and if
I scroll that up right there I'm then
going to have a constructor called game
drawing panel of course and it's going
to run and return nothing after it's
done and basically what it's going to do
is call a method that I'm going to call
paint and this method is going to get
passed a graphics object it's going to
contain all the state information for
rendering of graphics and drawing shapes
and doing all those things that the
graphics object does for me and then it
is going to return void as well so that
is all I need just those couple things
right there
so now knowing that I'm going to jump in
and create my game board class on with
the code again you're going to see how
simple this is and that's just going to
define the layout that I'm going to use
for my J panel I'm going to go public
class I'm going to call this lesson 51
and it's going to extend the jframe and
that's what we're going to be drawing on
see just grabbing and reusing things
boom like that and I got all my class
information then using what's on the
right side of the screen I'm going to
define public static int and this is
going to be my board width and I have it
set up here so that it can be accessible
to my rock class and then I'm going to
do the same exact thing for my board
height throw that in there
white there you go and then we're going
to create this J frame or this game
board inside of main for now arge and
that is all it's going to do new lesson
51 right like that and there you go so
that's going to create the whole game
board so we have to create less than 51
so go public lesson 51 and then I need
to just define all the defaults for this
J frame or this game board so it's going
to have a size obviously and that size
is going to be board width and board
height real easy and then this then give
it a title even though it's not really
needed Java astra
and then this again sets default close
operation this is going to handle
closing this guy when I'm done with that
pretty simple stuff and then I'm going
to define my game drawing panel I'm
going to call it game panel going to be
equal to new game drawing panel call
that constructor figure that all out and
there is my game drawing panel see right
here this guy is going to create the
first version of the board for me that's
all that's going to do for me
random assay this add this new game
panel to the center of the screen so for
now it's going to fill up the whole
interior of the screen for me and then
what I need to do is execute redraws of
the screen every single time something
changes on the screen so to do that I'm
going to use a tool called scheduled
thread pool executors and I'm gonna call
it executors and then you go new yeah
this is a long one paste that in there
and then I'm going to throw five inside
of here and all that five means is
that's what we call the core pool size
and it's just the number of threads to
keep in the poll even if they are idle
and then we have to tell Java when to
execute certain types of code after a
certain given delay so to do that we're
just going to go executors schedule at
fixed rate so we got to say okay what
code are we going to execute repaint the
board and that's what we're doing here
and this which is a reference to the
game board itself the initial delay we
don't need to have an initial delay so
I'm just going to put 0 inside of there
and then I'm going to say every 20 and
then here I have to define exactly what
time unit I want to use so it's going to
be time unit no-look seconds so every 20
milliseconds I want to redraw the game
board and we can come over here and see
that we have an error and import the
time unit library so that's all fixed
and that's pretty much all we need to do
except for setvisible
show the frame on the screen so it's
real simple just breaking everything
down this is why object-oriented
programming so beautiful and very very
easy to work with alright so now we're
going to need to define our classes
first one is repaint the board and I'm
going to put implements runnable and
this is the runnable interface and by
creating this we'll be able to
continually redraw the screen
over and over and over again you know
we're going to go lesson 51 is the board
and then public repaint the board which
is the constructor whenever this is
called and the board is going to be
passed over to it and we just got to go
this version of the board which is the
one being used inside of this class is
equal to the board that was passed over
pretty simple then whenever you
implement the runnable interface you
have to create a method and you can see
that right here if you zoom in add
unimplemented methods just click on it
save yourself some typing and you can
see there's run so I can just delete
this all together get rid of this and
then inside of run we're just gonna say
the board repaint yourself and that's it
that's the code that's going to be run
over and over and over again so pretty
simple that's going to handle redrawing
my board for me and then now all I need
to do is define all my defaults and all
the things that are going to change as
the game progresses so I'm going to
create another class called game drawing
panel extends J component which is like
the master component and then I have to
like it says right here see there's
everything over here just keep referring
to the right side of your screen I need
to create an ArrayList that's going to
contain all of my rock objects new
ArrayList rock just like that then I
want to get the original X&amp;amp;Y points in
an integer array for the polygons called
rock so I'm going to refer to the rock
class here and because this was set up
as a static value in the previous
tutorial I can just grab that borrow
that from that guy paste that in there
oh and up here I forgot to type in rocks
which is going to be the name of my
ArrayList and then I'm going to go and
get myself the game board with right
like that and height less than 51 the
height then in public game drawing panel
the constructor for this guy I'm going
to create 50 rock objects and store them
in my rate list do this with a for loop
int I is equal to and this is going to
be changed later on so that it will be a
lot easier to define how many rocks are
going to be drawn to the screen I'm
actually going to have this be a static
value later on in the tutorial for now
this works I'm just going to go in
random start exposition and this is just
going to make sure that all the polygons
are in different positions on the screen
we don't want them drawing over top of
each other man call the random function
and also so these asteroids or rocks are
moving around at different speeds it's
going to be nice to have the random
value inside of there less than fifty
one board width and then give myself
some padding that's where the minus 40
comes in plus one and there you go I'm
going to basically be able to copy this
guy to create my random starting
position for my Y starting polygon
drawing part so here I just need to
change this to height there you go
everything else is going to be the same
then I just need to start adding my
rocks to my rock ray list so call the
add method and get a new rock and then I
can call get poly X all right and then
pass it over random starting x position
which is exactly what pops up there for
me
Calma rock get poly y all right right
there and you can see that it
automatically went and threw that in
there see saves me time whenever you set
these up right I'm going to pass over
that I'm going to have 13 points in each
polygon random starting x position and
random starting Y position throw a
semicolon there at the end and there you
go that's going to throw all the rocks
inside of that array list so that I can
use them pretty cool last thing I need
to do is create the paint method inside
of here so paint graphics G there you
are that's the guy and like I said
before it's going to handle all the
settings for everything in regards to
drawing and rendering and everything
else you could ever want to do graphics
setting is equal to and just cache G and
you can see it's asking me for another
library there you go
just imported that pretty simple it's
also asked me for another library for
graphics and they are just import that
then since I want this to look like it's
in outer space I'm going to go to
graphics settings and say set color set
that color to black and then I'm going
to create a black rectangle get width is
going to give me the size of whatever
this drawing surface is and get height
is going to get me the height there you
are there's the black background then I
have to set up my rendering rules I'm
just going to copy and paste those in
there you've seen that a whole bunch of
times that's just where we set up the
anti-aliasing and all that stuff
minimus
my paint color to white because I'm
going to be drawing those asteroids on
the screen and they are supposed to be
white and then I just need to create a
four loop that's going to draw them all
on the screen and this is going to be of
type rock this is the ArrayList name
that I'm going to use or what I'm using
inside of this code and then this is
going to be the temporary holding space
and then if I want to move the rock I
just go move and it moves see real
simple and then if I want to draw I just
go graphic settings and tell it what I
want to draw and there you go that is
