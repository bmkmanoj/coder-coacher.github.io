wordpress problem solved this is part 2
in which I'm going to go over some
common issues people have with their
WordPress websites and explain how to
accomplish a lot of different things
today I'm going to show you how to
create a static homepage how to use the
more button I'm going to go through
permalink security how to upgrade create
a favicon how to forward from one
website to another and a whole bunch of
other things one of the number one
things people want to do with WordPress
is to create a static regular old
website this is how you do it go over to
settings and your sidebar click on
reading and you'll see here it says
right here front page displays and it
gives you the option of your latest
posts or a static page if you click on a
static page in this radio button and
then select whatever page you want it to
be to be your homepage then you will
have a static homepage and then of
course you would want to also click and
create the page that is going to display
any articles that you post but you don't
necessarily do anything and if you do
create a post page leave that page pages
content completely empty another issue a
lot of people want to display more than
just 10 posts on their blog pages well
you can see here I set this to 15 and of
course don't forget to hit Save Changes
after you make all of those changes one
thing I see people who are new at
designing WordPress websites is they do
not know what the more tag is hence they
write this great big giant long article
this actually isn't that long but they
write an article that's 1,500 pages long
then they have their next post is
another 1500 pages long and so on and so
on people want to be able to very
quickly get to the content that is
important to them and find the articles
that are most important to them how do
you do that you create a way to what a
post that is abbreviated on your main
home page so all you need to need to do
is click inside of your content say okay
that's a reasonable length for me to
display this post and then click this
button right here which is the insert
more tag if you do that you can see here
if somebody does click on that a
specific page
it's going to show all of your content
but if they go to your homepage you can
see here there are abbreviations of
these gigantic articles and if you've
ever been my website you see my articles
are massive and where you put the insert
more tag you'll you will instead see
read the rest of this entry and it
provides a real easy way for people to
go to your website and see if there's
anything on it that is on interest to
them next up how to cut and paste that
sounds like something that is very easy
to do guess what it's not if you are
cutting and pasting from a Microsoft doc
file and you copy it directly into
WordPress and hit publish it's going to
be full of all kinds of nasty tags bad
text it's going to be a total mess also
often if you copy and paste from
somebody else's website you're going to
get the same exact thing what you want
to do if it is a non-microsoft doc you
want to click on this little folder
button here with a tee on it paste your
text into that box and then insert that
is how you want to insert information
into your wordpress page if it's copied
from somewhere else again if it's a
Microsoft doc file you want instead
click on the folder with a W and paste
it into there and hit insert another
issue that I see a lot of people making
if you do not have something called
permalinks set up on your website this
is what all of your pages are going to
look like to other people as you can see
here it says the web designer site com p
equals 32 wouldn't it be great if all of
your directories had keywords in them
you can set it up that way so that
instead of just having that p like we
saw before if somebody clicks on one of
your pages they're going to instead see
their keywords in the directory itself
search engines love this so how do you
set that up go back into your dashboard
again click on settings then you scroll
over here click on permalinks and then i
would personally choose month and name
that way you're going to get the date
everything's gonna be sorted nice into
directories and you can put your
keywords right here this is a fabulous
way to boost a lot of attention to your
website for search engines next up
there's a lot of hacker attacks going on
right now
with wordpress websites i'm going to
show you now the tools i use in regards
to plugins to protect my website and
ever since i installed these plugins
i've had a lot less hacks so i'm going
to come down here to my plugins section
click on installed what do I use I use
antivirus which is by sergey mueller and
what this does is it protects you from
people putting malicious code in your
comments section that's what this
specific plug-in does for you it's real
easy to set up you basically just in
click download and activate and it works
and the other tool that I know has
blocked people from doing malicious
things on my website is wordpress
firewall what this does is it blocks
people from attacking your text boxes
and putting malicious PHP code into your
website and hacking their way in what
this does is it actually will only allow
those people who are coming from your IP
address to be able to change anything on
the website so that's wordpress firewall
and that's by SEO ticket another thing
that people don't know how to do is how
to upgrade wordpress and also upgrade
plugins again I've on purpose left some
of these things fouled up let me show
you how to upgrade plugins you just
click on plugins you know one of them
needs upgrade if it's red win a three
there and it's going to show you in this
yellow box that this needs to be
upgraded it's real easy to upgrade just
click on upgrade automatically and then
you want to sit here and wait it says
attempting reactivation to plug in don't
jump to another page sit and wait and
says plugin reactivated successfully
great now you know that works if your
website does get hacked or occasionally
your dashboard will bit completely
mashed up and mangled what you want to
do is reinstall wordpress this is how
you do that click on tools in your left
sidebar see upgrade right here click on
upgrade and then what you do is you
click on reinstall automatically and it
will automatically reinstall wordpress
for you and you don't have to do
anything and this is also another
shortcut if you want to upgrade all of
your plugins all in one place what you
do is simply hit select all and hid
upgrade plugins and they will all
upgrade all at the same time so that's
another great thing I'm going to show
you how to create a favicon I on
surface used a tool that is a hundred
percent free it's called GIMP and it
works on macs it works on PCs and
obviously it works on linux computers
pretty much anything hundred percent
free this is how you create it first off
you're going to need your logo which I
have here you're going to need to copy
this logo so to select it hit copy jump
over into GIMP file new this is going to
be sixteen by sixteen you want to click
on Advanced Options in background color
you want to click on transparency click
on OK paste your logo inside here then
after you paste your logo into the
transparent background you want to click
on file and then you want to click on
save as fav a con as you can see right
here dot I see oh and you want to make
sure you click the right file type which
is an ico or icon extension right like
that and then click site then what you
need to do is use a tool like FileZilla
to upload the favicon directly onto into
the root section of your website and
then it will automatically work on every
browser aunt in case you don't know what
a favicon is and you're wondering what
I'm talking about you can see if you go
to my website this is a favicon right
here this is what I uploaded there it is
again and as you can see all
professional websites have favicons
associated with them you might also in
the heading section on your main HTML
page on on all of your HTML pages you
might want to put this link right here
and obviously you're going to change
directory to your root directory here
followed by whatever you favor con dot
IC o---- or logo dot ICO followed by
type equals image /i CO and this will
guarantee that every single browser
knows where your favicon is located and
finally people ask me all the time how
do i forward people from my old website
to my new website all you need to do is
put this tag into your index HTML page
in the heading section of course remove
your site and put in the site you want
them to be forwarded
two and you can see here there's the
number five followed by this semicolon
what this is saying is that you whenever
the person goes to your old website it's
going to wait five seconds before it
sends them to your new website and you
can change that to whatever you want it
to be well that's the whole presentation
I have one more word press
problem-solving tutorial ahead if I
still have not covered something you
have a problem with WordPress in just
leave a comment down below and I will
most definitely cover it I've made over
40 WordPress websites and i've taught
over 20 different people how to use
wordpress so i'm glad to help till next
