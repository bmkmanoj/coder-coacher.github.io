on how to win your fantasy football
league if you were hoping that somebody
would go out there and buy all those
expensive fantasy football magazines
combined all that information into one
tutorial and give it all the way for
free you're in the right place here's
what you'll learn what you need on draft
day rankings for the top 200 players
again based off of the expert guides I
combined all that information averaged
everything out and I'm going to provide
you with all that information in this
one tutorial how the average player is
drafting and by player I mean the people
you'll be competing against why the
schedule matters i'll provide probably
the most detailed amount of information
in regards to schedules and analyzing
defenses week to week in this
presentation and also how to trade and
wind a trick this is just a basic
overview of how I'm able to pretty much
win two-thirds of the time whenever I
compete in fantasy football and by when
I mean win the Super Bowl draft the best
possible team based off of projected
fantasy points I start there then in
week five I trade up with players that
started the first four weeks with a very
tough schedule meaning that there's a
lot of players out there meaning again
the people you're competing against
we're going to get frustrated after week
for whenever they lose the first four
games mainly because star players are in
really tough schedules and they're just
not performing as well as they should
I'm going to show you how to go in there
and take those players and trade and
then benefit from the weaker schedule
that then follows I'm going to teach you
how to pay attention to the schedule
during the season real easy and then I'm
going to go into once you make the
playoffs the trades that you need to
make to make the best possible playoff
team before the draft you need your
cheat sheet not only do you need it you
in paper form you're going to have it
pre-loaded into the auto draft the
reason why is most of the time you're
only going to have a minute 30 seconds
to make your pick and also along the way
you're going to be going in there and
checking off all the people that are
already taken this becomes almost
impossible especially because even in
the money leagues where you're paying to
get into them where you can win real
money only sixty percent of the people
are showing up so you want to take the
frustration of having to keep all this
stuff organized on paper and instead you
want to auto load it in there so that
all your pics are going to come in in
order also you're going to want to get
everyone's emails for trades in the
future during the chat session that's
going to proceed most drafts you're also
going to want to know which players are
being ignored and drafted later on in
the draft so that you can ignore them
and take advantage of them later on then
you also of course want to fill your
positions with the best available
quarterback two running backs two wide
receivers either wide receiver or we're
running back to paying upon which you
get tight end defense and kicker you
want to fill all those positions and
then worry about picking additional
players after that based off of all the
expert information that i found the
experts in general and this is all
ranked based off of projected fantasy
points they should michael vick first
now again they're not all saying pick
michael vick first they're just saying
that he's projected to have the most
fantasy points this season and you can
see right here that he's normally being
picked in the 8 slot by fantasy players
on average and then you can see
everything else is listed here just
based off of projected fantasy points as
well as the position in which they're
normally being picked you can see this
is just kind of a rough overview of some
misses that might be going on and so
forth i'm going to show you in a minute
how to get the complete list and no you
don't have to pay for it what you have
to understand is whenever your pic and
you have to really think about how many
really true great people are available
in each position you can see here in red
this is the quarterback you can see that
projected fantasy points drop off pretty
dramatically and then continue to fall
pretty dramatically and then level off
while the running backs are also doing
exactly the same thing so this is where
you're going to want to invest most of
your pics because here's wide receivers
in blue you can see that this really
really a nice sloping curve so your
first three rounds for the most part
almost always are going to be made up of
running back and quarterback pics and
based off of that information and the
projected fantasy points that we have
here I feel and the experts also agree
that Adrian Peterson Arian Foster and
Chris Johnson are definite first three
picks these guys have to be picked first
again based off of the expert
information that I got then you want to
look at Michael Vick and Aaron Rodgers
then you have tom brady and Philip
Rivers even though they're sheung really
nice fantasy points it's kind of
subjective on whether you'd want to take
them in this position or instead turn
towards a michael turner or LeSean McCoy
or whatever and all the other different
players we're going to get into it here
in a second and the reason I have Jamal
Charles started here is because he
has one of the toughest schedules in
regards to rushing as does ray rice so
I'm more than likely going to move these
guys down and bring in Michael Turner
and LeSean McCoy and some of the other
guy and let these guys fall lower in the
first round before I take them so it's
just me kind of laying things out and
based off of the understanding that this
chart saying you're definitely not going
to get it tight end you're definitely
probably not going to get a wide
receiver then on top of that you must
follow the schedule and what I got over
here is an example of what I got on my
website and again this is all free stuff
you don't sign up for anything I did
this all for you and what you need to
know here is white means that you're
going to be competing against a good
defense and all the ranks are in there
and as it gets darker that means the
defense is going to get worse and I have
everything broken down in regards to
opponent rushing rank as well as
opponent passing rank and overall you
want to look for long periods in which
we got our light areas here before you
would want to ask that person to make a
trade because they're going to be
getting frustrated during periods like
this and there's lots of teams out there
to have much longer periods where
they're going to get frustrated I'm
going to get into that in a second and
then on top of that you want to shuffle
your wide receivers around based off of
how good the opponent's past ranking is
in regards to defense from week to week
to week so your wide receivers are going
to change a lot while your quarterbacks
and all your other different position
players probably not so much what you
have to stand is very good fantasy
players trade constantly throughout the
season constantly trying to take
advantage in defensive capabilities
they're going to be going up again and
to be able to do that that means you
need to find an active league and get
everyone's email address so that you can
push forward the trades and kind of use
psychology against people throughout the
year I'm going to go over the importance
of the schedule based off of running and
what I got here on the left side are the
teams that have the easiest rushing
schedule so you have new orlean saints
number one Tampa Bay that added up so
what does this tell you that means
basically New Orleans the Buccaneers
Panthers the Eagles Colts all these
different teams going to have really
easy times rushing throughout the
totality of the season while teams like
the Pittsburgh Steelers Cleveland Browns
down through the Broncos we're going to
have a very hard time rushing and how
this equals out to real players is based
off of the good schedule you're going to
want to try to get Alan Garrett blunt or
Alice Sean McCoy or Michael Turner a
Joseph a dime and what's absolutely
insane is I was being able to pick
up these four players in most of the
drafts all in one draft which is
ridiculous and at the same time you
don't want to avoid players like Ray
Rice and Rashard Mendenhall and Peyton
Hillis because they were going up
against very very good rushing defenses
and this is going to translate into
major points meaning once again that I
was able to pick up legarrette blount
LeSean McCoy Michael Turner all on my
same team which is just crazy then you
have to look at the importance of
analyzing defenses based off of the
strength of the passing defense and you
can see here the Minnesota Vikings when
I don't think I'd get Donovan McNabb but
just understand that his receivers
probably going to do pretty okay during
the season because they have they're
going to gainst the worst passing
defenses and you have the Jacksonville
Jaguars Panthers Tampa Bay Buccaneers
all these teams are going to have better
than average passing years because their
schedules a week while the Pittsburgh
Steelers have cisco 49er Seattle
da-da-da-da-da are all going to have
very very hard passing schedules are
going to have an extremely hard time
passing in Arizona and Washington and
st. Louis again you want to look for
those players such as Josh Freeman's
Matt Ryan's David drawer Donovan McNabb
maybe as players that you'd want to keep
because they have such great schedules
in regards to increasing their
availability to pass and then you also
in a wide receiver area if you'd like to
get a Mike Thomas Kenny Britt roddy
white mike williams all these players
wide receiver DeWyze are going to be
very good why you're gonna want to stay
away from a kevin cobb Alex Smith Tony
Romo Ben Roethlisberger and so forth
because their schedules are very very
tough it's going to translate into major
major point because if you can pick up
am a tryna Josh Freeman and even pick up
a Mike Thomas Kenny Britt or mike
williams in later rounds which I've
consistently done throughout this
drafting period you're going to do very
very well and here's some of the
mistakes I'm saying people were picking
Vic and Rogers either very very late in
the first round sometimes second round
sometimes middle the second round I've
seen Rogers go in the middle of the
second round or they're picking them way
way way too early which means that
they're picking for our three star
running backs so this is a mistake i'm
seeing over and over and over again also
I've seen mendenhall Drew Brees Frank
Gore even matt fort tony romo Anquan
Boldin I've seen all these names picked
in the first two rounds it's just
absolutely ridiculous while rashard
mendenhall might be a good idea I would
never pick a frank gore or a hines ward
or it's just absolutely ridiculous and
in regards to
Steelers like i said before they're
going up against pretty good passing
defenses so I don't think Roethlisberger
walls sometimes we're going to do
particularly well this year I'm sitting
in a terrible but I'm saying that
there's gonna be other players and would
be much better off and then what's all
so ridiculous is I've been able to pick
up players like Michael Turner Roddy
White dallas clark cedric fence I've
been able to pick up Cedric Benson in
the 10th round same thing with joseph
addai a lot of these players are being
ignored based off the drafts that I've
seen frenzy picking is also extremely
common this year and what I mean by that
is let's say somebody picks a Mike Vick
and then the next person online picks up
an Aaron Rodgers well people have a
tendency to start going nuts and not
paying attention and you'll very quickly
i've seen this two drafts where
everybody just starts buying
quarterbacks and just totally ignores
the fact that there's great running back
so available and also on top of that
like i mentioned before even in money
leagues where people are putting their
money up i'm only seeing sixty percent
of people show up for the draft in
regards to trading a lot of people don't
know when it's a good idea to trade week
5 is your great time to be able to start
trade what you want to do is you want to
steal players from teams like an atlanta
san diego san francisco indianapolis in
baltimore why because their first four
games are really really tough in regards
to in or in comparison to the rest of
their schedule so you want to look for
players in those five core teams to
steal from to really boost up your
overall team also what you have to
understand is most fantasy players give
up around week five if you lose the
first four games of the season there are
numerous players that just say I to heck
with this and just give up so you want
to get in there while the goings good
and they're still involved actively and
playing the game so that you can take
away their players from them I moves my
trades and week five normally defined
how good I do during the year also
another thing that's extremely important
as as soon as you make the playoffs
start trading to build the best playoff
team you can possibly put together
meaning the best teams during the
playoffs and the Super Bowl the last
three games of the year and what I got
here is the best we have Indianapolis
and when I got here is how well they're
going to perform in regards to rushing
and also how well they're going to
perform in regards to passing again
based off the strength of the defense is
there going to be going up against in
the last three weeks of the season so
again this is rushing this is passing so
Indies going to be doing great rushing
wise
three games and then you can see the
same with Jacksonville Tennessee Atlanta
Houston Tampa so what this means is
you're going to want to build your play
on for your Super Bowl team around these
six teams that you see here on your
screen because all of them have very
easy schedules so what's that going to
mean well this is basically going to be
my dream play offers only Super Bowl
team I want Peyton Manning I already
know I'm how I'm gonna get them already
on top of that i want to get Matt Ryan
and Josh Freeman and most of my teams i
was able to secure those two players in
the draft also arian foster would be
absolutely fabulous to get but I've been
unlucky haven't got him yet Maurice
jones-drew is a guy that I've been able
to pick up quite easily Chris Jones and
again I've not been able to get because
in all my drafts I'm normally been in
the four five or seven spot I've never
been lucky enough to get into the first
three and then joseph addai but able to
get him in late rounds for some
ridiculous reason again Jacoby Jones
great guy to get up there and you can
get them way way way late Austin Collie
I've been able to pick him up on most of
my teams as well as Pierre Garcon Kenny
Britt Mike Thomas and Nate Washington
Dallas clerk has also been a very very
easy player to pick up and get on my
team as well as Marcedes Lewis or Owen
Daniels a great tight end backup side
band was secure Adam Vinatieri is a
fabulous picked I haven't had much
success getting him because people pick
him very early but I have had a lot of
success picking up the second best
kicker in the league being Matt Bryant
and that's based off projections again
as well as i'd also have a less success
and picking up raw Bernie honest and
this is pretty much commonly what I've
been able to get being that all my
positions have been in the fourth fifth
or seventh spot I've picked up Michael
Vick and Aaron Rodgers in those
positions in almost every single leg and
they're supposed to do fabulous so
that's great I've also been able to pick
up josh freeman consistently to use
later on in the playoffs if say Payton
gets hurt or I just don't have them
available LeGarrette Blount I've been
able to pick up LeSean McCoy Maurice
jones-drew michael turner joseph addai
and cedric benson be able to pick up
majority of those players throughout my
drafts as well as Kenny Britt rathi
white mike williams austin collie again
i mentioned before dallas clerks been an
easy get for some silly reason am I
defense for the most part either been in
atlanta they bears and then i mentioned
my kickers before based off all that
information here is my basic breakdown
for my cheat sheet and I'm not going to
leave this on the screen for you to look
at you can just jump over my website if
you want like I said this is all for you
guys I put it all together for you
you can see here here's all my defensive
rankings it's in a nice little spread
you can download it print do whatever
you want and then here's all my rankings
this is based off about what all the
experts are saying out there and a whole
ton of information here's my cheat sheet
here's the whole entire thing so if you
want to look at that that's just my
beliefs based off projections and what
the experts are saying a whole bunch of
other things so hopefully it helps you
out so here we are back to my cheat
sheet and like I said basically I'm
going to start off getting Adrian
Peterson if I could but I haven't any
luck I'm going to move downwards and I'm
going to move back up and then I'm gonna
move downwards just like you do with any
other cheat sheet but again you want to
pre load this into the system so you can
make sure you get these guys in right
order and you can properly track
everything doesn't seem like many people
are doing that also in the draft and
then there's just the rest of my cheat
sheet as things are going on but like I
said you can get it there's a link
underneath this video you can look at if
you want another thing I do is I'm
constantly thinking about the future
throughout the season so I've noticed
that a lot of people in my legs have
both Peyton Manning and Chris Johnson
these are two guys I definitely
definitely definitely want to secure for
my playoff team so I've already right at
the end of the draft started talking to
these guys about how I'm going to trade
them Michael Vick and LeSean McCoy in
exchange for Peyton Manning Chris
Johnson I'm getting a lot of positive
responses already from them again as
soon as I make the playoffs I'm making
that trade and on top of that if I have
to I plan on selling the farm to get
Reggie Wayne a piece outfit so that's a
basic overview of how I win at fantasy
football again if you have any questions
or comments leave them in the comments
