of my Java tutorial series today we're
going to cover looping and this is going
to be the first part of the tutorial
that actually is interesting and this
guy we're going to start off with public
class again just like before when we
call this Java lesson 4 and then just
like before we're going to create
ourselves a main function inside of here
so public again means it can be run by
anybody static means that it is called
by a class and void means it's not going
to return anything then we go main and
we go string together our string objects
whether they're there or not I'm gonna
get more into that in the later
tutorials of course and then the first
thing I'm gonna cover here is the while
loop I'm going to start off kind of
boring but we're going to get a lot more
interesting later on in the tutorial on
the major difference between the while
loop and the for loop which we're going
to see a little bit later is that the
loop iterator or the counter or just
simply the iterator is created outside
of the loop structure just as we did
right there and we're going to create
our while loop and what this guy's going
to do is it's going to print 1 through
20 out on the screen so less than or
equal to is needed if we want to print 1
through 20 if we didn't have that equal
sign it would only print 1 through 19
and then just keep it simple
system.out.print in the line put on
inside of there and then don't forget to
increase the value of your iterator in
this situation we're going to increase
it by 1 and if we run this I think you
know it's just going to print 1 through
20 out on the screen over here and
that's exactly what it just did
and now to make things a little bit more
interesting because remember I promise
you I'm going to make this more
interesting let's say you wanted to skip
over printing the value of 3 and then
while I'm doing this I'm also going to
show you what the continue statement
does will say if I is equal to 3 we want
to do something different and basically
that different thing is we want to
increment by 2 remember you want to do
this otherwise you could potentially
mess up all the other things you're
doing here and not print out the screen
the way you want to and then we're going
to use continue and what continue does
is it just jumps out of this iteration
of the while loop and jumps back up here
and it starts running the while loop
from the beginning or from where it will
left off so it's going to hit 3 we're
going to change the value of the loop
Raider from 3 to 5 in this situation the
reason why we're skipping the 5 is here
in a minute I'm going to show you how to
just print odd numbers except for 3 onto
the string so that's what it's going to
do it's going to come down here is going
to equal to 3 we're going to change it
to 5 and when I jump back up here and
then continue executing from 5 6 7 8 9
that's how it works
but if I just simply run this you can
see it's going to print 1 to skip 3 &amp;amp; 4
and then continue on printing everything
just as it was before so that's what the
continue statement does why that's
important is if we decided that we
wanted to only print odd numbers on to
the screen this situation we're going to
throw another if into here and then
we're going to go eye and we're going to
use the modulus to is equal to 0 and
this is how we can figure out whether a
number is even or odd and whenever you
would divide this guy by 2 and it comes
back as 0 you know in that situation
you're dealing with an odd number so
we're going to come down here and we're
going to increment this guy and if we
file/save that you can see that it
prints 1 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 and 19 so
that would be a little trick there using
an if statement to only print odd
numbers and now I'm going to get into
the other things get a little bit
interesting here that you can use inside
of these different looping structures
all of them actually I'm going to use
the break statement I'm going to say if
I is greater than 10 at any point in
time I want to break out of the loop
altogether and what that means is it's
going to terminate the loop all together
and it's Jona jump down here to the end
of the Wow area right there and it's
going to continue executing afterwards
and if we execute this you can see
that's exactly what it did continued it
printed one skipped 3 then printed 5
then 7 and then 9 it hit 10 and the
break statement end of the loop
prematurely so that's the difference
between the continue and the break and a
little bit of information on the while
loop as well now let's do something a
little bit more interesting let's come
in here and let's just delete all of
this and let's start over now I'm going
to show you how to calculate the value
for pi so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a double and I'm going
to call it my pi it's going to be 4.0
this is going to be my starting value
for pi and pi is 3.14
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah goes on forever
and ever and ever
I'm going to show you how to calculate
it and then I'm going to have my store
value from my loop iterator in my loop
and this will make sense in a second so
let me go J is equal to 3.0 and if you
want to calculate pi there's a comment
what you do is you would go 4 minus 4
divided by 3 plus 4 divided by 5 minus
4/7 see it's the same thing you start
off with 4 that's this guy up here and
then you're going to subtract 4 divided
by 3 add 4 divided by 5 and it goes 3 5
7 9 and on and on and on it's going to
continue putting 4 divided by whatever
the next odd number is so I'm going to
figure out how to do that I'm gonna
leave that on the screen there just so
you can look at it so if I want to do
that let's start off real simple just
understand this is a very basic version
of how to calculate pi let's say I want
to do this 11 times so I want to make a
calculation 11 times to get closer and
closer and closer to PI and the more
numbers I add up here the closer to the
value of pi we're going to get so if I
want to calculate this I go my pi is
equal to my PI - and I'm going to go 4
divided by j + put these brackets around
this again make sure you get your
brackets in here right + and I'm going
to go 4 divided by j + 2 and get my
closing brackets there and then I'm
going to increase the value of j by 4
and then I'm going to print out the
screen system.out.print line I'm going
to print out the value of my pi as we
get closer and closer to pi and then on
top of that after this is all over I'm
actually going to print PI out the
screen and all the code is available
underneath of this video I'm going to
look at it I'm going to say this is
going to be the real value of pi yeah
and if any point in time you don't quite
get what I'm doing here just leave a
little comment below and I'll be more
than happy to answer any questions and
if we execute this you can see that it
printed out some calculations here that
are going to get proceeding ly closer
and closer to this value of pi so it
goes from three point four six six six
to three point three three three it's
way off but the only reason it's way off
is I haven't performed enough
calculations so let's instead do 8001
and let's try executing this guy again
and you can see it's getting closer and
closer to PI now
three point one four one and if we
continue going at this rate like let's
say we do a hundred thousand and one you
can see that it's getting very close to
the value of pi so now we have three
point one four one six and here it is
three point one four one five nine and
then if we just continue you can add
million I mean you know it's a computer
it's powerful it can do anything that's
just a nice interesting way of using a
while loop to actually do something so
let's get rid of all that again let's
say you wanted to execute a while loop
until the user says to stop well just
create a string and I'm going to call
this cont Y or n is equal to I'm going
to give it a value of capital y then I'm
going to create an int H is equal to one
and in this situation since I'm going to
be waiting for user import I'm going to
use our little scanner well that we
talked about previously so I'll load
that in here so we can use it a little
library that allows us to capture user
input and then right here before main
I'm going to create my scanner object
it's going to monitor this keyboard
input scanner I'm gonna call it user
input you can call whatever you want
user inputs just the name I made up
scanner and then remember system dot n
which is going to monitor the keyboard
okay so now I can accept user input and
then we can go while cont Y or n and
let's go equals ignore case a situation
ignore whether they enter a uppercase or
lowercase Y so split that inside of
there create our while loop I'm gonna
get a system out print line and what
this guy is going to do is it's going to
continually increment H and print out
values on the screen as long as the user
says that they want to see these values
come out on the screen let's just change
this to print and say continue Y or n
space there I'm going to go to new Y or
n is equal to and we're going to say
user input and then next line what this
is going to do is it's going to accept a
string input from the user
that's all this guy's going to do for us
let's accept that and then save that to
continue wire N and then up here check
whether it was a Y or anything actually
is going to cancel it out if it's not an
upper case or a lower case
it's going to end the loop and then here
don't forget to increment H add a little
typo there and up here let's just make
that uppercase and now we can execute
and you can see it printed out one two
the screen is saying continue if I put a
y in there it's going to print out
another one if I put a capital Y it's
going to print out another one if I put
an N it's going to cancel out but just
so you know I'm going to put a J in
there and it's going to end it all
together so that is another way to
continued using a while loop based off
of user inputs so that's also kind of
interesting and now we don't need any
other different things inside of here
because I'm going to go in here and
start showing you how to use do-while
loop I never use the do-while loop like
ever
I'm just not acclimated to using it
maybe you are maybe you will be who
knows but either way it's important to
understand how it operates and pretty
much the only difference between a
do-while loop and a while loop is that
you use a do-while loop when you want to
absolutely guarantee the code is going
to be executed at least once and like a
while loop you're going to use your loop
iterator or initialize it outside of
your looping area and you just go do and
some people put the little bracket there
I like to keep it everything consistent
put it down here I don't personally
think it matters it's up to you I'm
going to go system.out.print line and
then we'll just go okay and here we're
going to increment K and instead why
don't we make this 10 just to really
show you exactly what's going on here
and then at the end of it you go WOW k
is less than 10 okay so while k is going
to be equal to 10 here right from the
very beginning so with a while loop this
normally would never execute but you're
going to see here that it doesn't check
the value of K before it goes through
this guy and if we execute it you'll see
that and you'll see that it actually
still prints out 10 even though it does
not function here and you could actually
come in here and do whatever you want
put in a hundred thousand and you can be
certain that it's going to come through
here execute all of this code on this
line and this line and then check if it
should have executed so that's the
difference between the while and the
do-while loop and also one of the
biggest mistakes is people forget the
semicolon so definitely don't forget
that and then finally we have our for
loop and it's just another looping tool
for Java and the basic layout for it is
for and then you're going to declare
your iterator your loop iterator or your
or whatever you want to call it put a
semicolon then define the conditional
for continuing looping through this guy
and then at the end you're going to
change the value of your iterator so
let's make one let's just go for I'm
going to go int I'm going to go L is
equal to 10 and then we'll this is going
to continue to iterate as long as L is
greater than or equal to one semicolon
MFL and in this situation we're going to
count backwards and don't put a
semicolon right here we don't need it
and come down here put our brackets and
everything inside here is going to
execute system print line and in this
situation we're going to print L out to
the screen of course don't forget out
and if we execute you're going to see it
prints ten nine eight seven the whole
way down to one and one thing that's
kind of interesting is if we took this
guy right here system out and try to
print it outside of the for loop it is
not going to work it's going to throw an
error and you can see that that's
exactly what it's doing here and the
reason why is you declared this value of
L or this variable attribute of L inside
of the for statement so it only exists
inside of the for statement that's just
one thing to sort of worry about or
think about then just to cover some
other things that are kind of different
about the for loop you can actually
declare your variables outside of the
for loop if you would want to be able to
use them so let's go into M and so there
they are they're declared outside and
you can also use multiple values inside
of your for loop so and also initialize
multiple values so let's say we have m
is equal to 1 and n is equal to 2 right
like that
and then we can put our conditions in
here and of course you can have multiple
different conditions semicolon and then
we can also iterate by more than just 1
or D deck Lemaitre we're going to call
it same as I'm doing right there with
that shorthand notation it's equal to 2
and this provides for just another way
to print out numbers in lists print line
and in this situation of a printout M
plus is equal to and this is sort of the
long way to print out 1 through 9 onto
the screen here and we execute you can
see that it prints out 1 through 10 on
to the screen there's a whole bunch of
different ways to look at Lu ping inside
of Java leave any questions or comments
below next time we're going to cover
methods or functions depends on
we want to call them til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
