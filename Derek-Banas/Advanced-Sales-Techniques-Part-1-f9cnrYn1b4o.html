sales and closing strategies tutorial
this is gonna be a seven part tutorial
on how to dramatically improve your
sales today I'm gonna focus in on
figuring out why people decide to buy
from you however before you watch this
video you technically should check out
the video get people to like you which
is all about rapport strategies you have
to completely understand rapport to be
able to sell effectively join P wrote in
and said can you provide a selling
system and sales script I can use I need
sales strategies that work I prefer
selling value but I'm open to any ideas
any tips on cold calling as well well
John P already did two tutorials on cold
calling I used to write scripts for
major corporations that they used for
tell of marketing efforts here I'm going
to cover pre-programmed responses fact
finders identifying needs handling
objections and closing strategies all
people have pre-programmed responses to
certain situations these automatic
responses tend to be learned rather than
pre-programmed at birth for example each
person has pre-built beliefs that they
use to make decisions such as expensive
equals good educated equals intelligence
long lines at a store mean popular size
equals strength and expert opinions
equal true when people hear words
unconsciously they picture that word in
their mind in a certain way you should
get others to associate good feelings in
relation to your product or service by
comparing those benefits most important
to them with what you're selling and if
you create good rapport this should be
very easy for you again to learn how to
create good rapport people check out get
people to like you it's on youtube as
well as articles on my site a new
think-tank calm now I'm going to briefly
go over the yes set and in a tutorial
that's coming up I'm going to completely
go over it but this is still important
information to understand when this
technique is used in connection with the
creation of a yes mindset it is easy to
get others to see things your way the
creation of a yes mindset is
accomplished by getting a person to
agree with your comments multiple times
this will then get them to be more open
to listening to your benefits or
listening to you period another way
people make decisions is based off of
returning a favor for a favor the need
to return a favor is ingrained in us if
as a society we all just did what was
best for us alone
we would have never grown it's only by
working together that we have been able
to create the world we now have if at
all possible try and use this technique
to build your relationship with a
prospect but make sure that your gift is
not too large you never want the
prospect to look at the gift as a bribe
we also have any dramatic need to
maintain consistency throughout our
lives once we have made a decision to do
something we feel a great deal of
pressure to continue doing it in fact
acting in a consistent manner just makes
sense the opposite would be a person
that constantly changes their mind as
with all the other techniques we use to
make decisions they are used to save us
time and uncomplicated lives period
research has also shown that if
something stands to impede our ability
to follow consistency we will do
whatever we can to stay on the current
track this is one of the most important
rules you need to learn in this
presentation in your presentation you
must prove your selling consistency all
you're selling is their ability to
continue on their chosen path if you get
that your sales are going to
dramatically increase you get them to
feel that your advice is consistent with
their past actions by confirming that
they took specific actions in their past
that led them to this point and indeed
to buy the product or service that
you're now offering them here's an
example of how you could use consistency
to sell I could say you bought your
accounting software because it allowed
you to maintain orderly financials you
stated this isn't important because it
saved you time in the long run because
time is money the more time you save
will equal more money in your pocket
hence when my product saves you 300
hours per year it will pay for itself in
3 months on top of that you can see that
after three months my product will be
making you money right there are a
couple other consistency tips it is
important that they positively affirm
each statement you make as you're
describing what you're doing for them
you need to get them to commit that yes
that statement is true after each
statement and you have to understand by
getting someone to make many many
commitments throughout a sales call we
dramatically increase the chance that
they will agree to a final sale remember
always that any commitment or sale no
matter how small is the beginning of all
those that follow the best types of
commitments are non coerced made in
front of others written down requires a
little bit of effort and of course is
freely chosen bandwagoning is another
way that we make decisions we determined
what is correct
finding out what the majority of people
are doing in fact 95% of people imitate
the actions of others rather than try
and initiate their own solutions the
degree to which we will follow others
actions immediately is directly related
to the degree of uncertainty we feel and
indeed if we feel that people the same
social status as us are doing something
we are also more likely and feel more
comfortable following their lead what
you must ask yourself is how can you
present your product or service to
induce the need to follow the herd we
have a deep-seated sense of duty to
follow those in a position of authority
people have actually gone to almost any
lengths on the command of an authority
in fact we are actually trained from
birth that this principle is more
important than any other we are taught
that we should be obedient to proper
authorities and disobedience is wrong so
what you must do is figure out how to
present your product or service in a way
to induce the need to fall on Authority
we also of course buy from people we
like this is why so many salespeople ask
for referrals from a person after they
buy a product or service from us with a
referral in hand we can now approach a
person not as a stranger but as a person
their friend said they should meet with
I did a whole entire tutorial on
referral strategies you should
definitely take a look at that if you
want to improve your referrals and if a
referral was to turn away the
salesperson under these circumstances it
as if they have actually turned away
their trusted friend research in fact
has proven that a person armed with a
referral versus one that doesn't
increases their chances to make a sale
by 50% so make sure you get as many
referrals as possible people also have a
hard time resisting not taking advantage
of an opportunity if they believe they
won't get a chance to get it again even
flawed items are in great demand today
if they have but one quality scarcity
these actions come down to one guiding
principle people seem to be more
motivated by the thought of losing
something then they are interested in
buying something of equal value this
principle is especially true in those
circumstances of uncertainty loss plays
a large role in all human decisions
research has shown that if we tell
someone that an item is in short supply
or the cost of manufacturing the product
is going to go up you're almost
guaranteed that they'll buy more of it
here's an appliance store example that's
often used first off a salesperson sees
you looking at a product they walk up in
state I see you're looking at that they
then review the advantages of the
product they then either tell you sorry
too
tell you that when sold or the sale ends
today or let me see if we have any of
those left
you've basically just sold the person
you walked up you told them how great it
was and you told them they couldn't have
it this is something that's used or was
used very often in the past in appliance
store sales or any high value for sells
such as that the greatest obstacle to a
sales person is the dreaded we have to
think about it the best defense that
objection is to prove that unless they
make an immediate decision to buy they
will have to purchase the item at a
higher price later or they will lose the
opportunity to buy it all together you
might be asking yourself why is this
Garrity principle such a powerful part
of our decision-making it's really easy
we know that the harder it is to obtain
something the better the item is so if
you can convince a customer that
something is scarce and hard to get
ahold of they instantly see it as a
quality item even stronger is our need
for freedom if an opportunity becomes
less available we lose the freedom to
get what we want
when free choice is limited the need to
retain our freedoms makes us go
absolutely wild and what drives us to
want something more at this point it's
surely psychological to make sense of
our heightened craze our brain begins to
assign positive qualities to the product
that may not even exist and in fact if
we actually see something become scarce
right before our eyes we want it more
than if it is something that has always
been seen as scarce for example how
would we feel if we saw a pack of people
descend on a product right before our
eyes let us say that only one of those
items was left in the aftermath how hard
would it be for you to ignore that
product and just move on stores take
advantage of the scarcity principle
every single Christmas when they list
their products are drastically reduced
and have signs on them that say
quantities limited normal everyday
people were so crazed that they actually
Stampede over others to get those
products there may in fact be no other
motivating factor stronger than the
pairing of scarcity and rivalry and if
you can throw in a loss of freedom you
really have something so you as a
salesperson must figure out how you can
utilize the scarcity principle to speed
up the sales process in part two of my
sales and closing strategies I'm going
to show you exactly how to figure out
why people that will decide to buy from
you period if you have any questions
