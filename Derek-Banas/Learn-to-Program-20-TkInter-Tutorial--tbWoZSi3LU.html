20 of my learned program series and this
part of the tutorial we're going to use
TK inter to actually make Python
interfaces and this is going to be part
one of a TK intro to to tutorial that is
going to go on for a couple different
videos and specifically we're going to
learn how to create graphical user
interfaces or gooeys with TK and TK is a
cross-platform GUI toolkit that's going
to provide things called widgets which
in the actual real world or are things
like buttons and scroll bars and things
like that that we're going to use to
build our interfaces and TK enter in
particular is a Python interface that is
going to be able to work with TK and
another awesome thing about TK enter is
it's going to be included for all
versions of Python 3.1 and above for
both Macs and Windows as well as on
linux and if you haven't watched
previous parts to the tutorial i provide
a link in the description and i have a
lot to do so let's get into it alright
so the very first thing we're going to
do is we're going to come in here and
actually test the TK enter is actually
working so to do so we're going to go
import and TK enter like that and then
go TK enter dot underscore test right
like that all you need to do and run it
and you're going to see this little
window pop up here and if you see that
you know everything is wonderful and
everything is working and so forth and
so on so you can close that now what
we're going to do is we're going to
import some modules we have here and so
I'm gonna go TK inter and I'm just going
to import everything just to keep
everything nice and simple and then I'm
going to go from TK enter import t TK
alright so we have the modules that
we're going to need and why don't I just
go and do a simple hello world thing so
the very first thing we're going to do
is we are going to create a TK object
and route is going to be the main window
that's going to surround our interface
it's the window itself that pops up on
the screen and to do so you just go
route is equal to Tk it doesn't have to
be called route but it's very common
that everybody calls it route and let's
say that we want to come in here
and give our window a title we can just
go something like first GUI like that
and let's say we want to put a window in
or a button button inside of our window
we can do that as well we just go ttk
and button like this and routes and
there's a whole bunch of different ways
to add components change components do
all kinds of things with components so
as we go through I'm going to show you a
whole bunch of them so we could say
something like Hello TK enter and
that'll be the text on our little button
and then we'll just use grid here which
is a simple layout manager we'll get
into the details here later on but it's
just the way of structuring where the
different components or widgets are
going to be placed inside of our window
and then finally we're going to come in
here and call main loop and this is just
going to keep our root window visible
and our program running until they
decide to close it and if we run that
you're going to see right here that our
little window pops up you can see their
first GUI there's where we set the title
and here is where we threw our button
inside of there okay so that is our
first entry into the world of TK enter
and if you're wondering about all the
different components that are available
you're going to see here are a whole
bunch of different components we have
buttons and labels and canvases and
menus and menu buttons and radio buttons
and a whole bunch other different things
which I'm going to show you some of them
in this for the tutorial and the rest of
them as the tutorial continues so let's
do something a little bit more
complicated again we're going to need
this so that we have our TK object that
we'll be using to add everything and
work with all our little tools and also
one of you want to use here now is a
frame and a frame is just a widget
that's going to surround other widgets
so we'll go frame and we'll pass in
route inside of there and then also what
I'm going to use here is what's called a
TK enter variable and I'm going to use
it to change the text for one of our
label components so I'm going to command
go label text is equal to string
variable and then let's go and create a
label as well as a button and maybe set
some attributes so I'm going to go label
this doesn't have to be called label
it's just what I called it here you can
call it whatever you'd like and we'll go
label then you're going to add in the
frame that you want to put this label
inside of it's just boxes inside a box
it's real simple stuff and here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go text
variable is going to be equal to and I'm
going to make it equal to label text
this guy up here and then I'm going to
change it afterwards also let's say we
want to throw a button inside of here we
can just go button once again the frame
that you want your button to be pushed
inside of and you can also set the text
for your button or any of your
components just by referencing text and
say something like click me and then
what we'll do down here is just
reference this guy up here and change
the text inside of it and that's going
to automatically change the text inside
of our label component and how you do
that is you call set and I'll say
something like I am a label just to keep
it simple now what you need to do is
instead of grid we're going to use
another geometry manager here that's
called pack and pack is just going to
position the widgets inside of our
window for us so we'll just go label and
pack and then let's do the same thing
with our button and call pack on that as
well as well as our frame and call pack
on that and if we do all that and run it
whoops got a little bit of a bug what
happened here whoops my little thing
where I always do uppercase camelcase
lettering is sort of ingrained in my
brain so make that a lowercase B and run
it again and if you do you're going to
see a little window pops up here right
here and it says I am a label and click
me and you click on it doesn't do
anything in a moment here I'll get into
event handling but you can see right
there an example of how we can change
the text that is inside of our label as
well as in some of our other
so now what I want to do is jump in and
talk more precisely about how the pack
geometry manager is going to work for us
now PAC is a very simplistic geometry
manager and all that means is it lights
defines how all of your components are
going to be laid out inside of the
window you create so geometry manager
sounds complicated but that's what it
does and pack specifically is going to
position widgets by allowing them to
define their position so things like top
and right and bottom and left inside of
the window also in comparison to other
components that are inside of there and
it's also going to allow them to define
their fill direction which means how
they will be stretched into the windows
so that's going to be in the X or the Y
direction you can also have both be an
option as well as none and now I'm going
to show you a couple examples of how we
can do this so once again we're going to
use root here and once again I'm also
going to create frame just going to
surround all of these guys and we pass
route to it and then let's come in here
and just create a label and a whole
bunch of buttons and show how by
changing the different attributes we can
have these guys work together so I don't
need to have a reference to the names
for these components so I'm not going to
actually store them in a variable I'm
just going to create them throw them on
the screen and let them do their thing
so I'm going to go to text and here we
could say something like a bunch of
buttons just to throw something inside
of there and I'm going to call pac----
on that and you're going to see the pack
basically is just going to throw that on
the screen
and not do anything positioning wise now
now I'm also going to create some
buttons here and I am going to have them
be positioned and I'll keep the text
really simple here so for the text I'm
just going to have this B button 1 and
then specifically with tack I'm going to
say that I want this to be put on the
leftmost side of the screen and make
sure this is an uppercase left and I'm
going to say that I want this to fill in
the y-direction
and let's also have that the uppercase
going to go and create four buttons here
just so we can see a whole bunch of a
different examples and how they work
together let's change this to button two
and three and four I'm going to have
this button right here actually line up
on the top and I'm going to have the
fill direction and this guy B in the
exposition and this one I'm going to
have it B on the right and the fill
direction on this is also going to be in
the x-direction and then let's also come
in and change this to left and the fill
direction B X and then we can come in
and just go frame and pack like that and
run it and you can see exactly how all
these different guys are being
positioned inside of here so let's zoom
in a little bit so we can see it a
little bit better so b1 this guy we're
saying we want that to be in the
leftmost position and to take up
everything in the Y directed the y
direction so there's no components above
or underneath of it b2 is going to be in
the top and it's going to completely
fill everything in the x-direction that
it can possibly fill then b3 we're going
to have that B on the right so that's
why it is on the right and b4 is on the
left as they are both defined there and
they're going to take up as much in the
x-direction as they possibly can okay so
there is a simple look at the pack
geometry manager and it's not used that
much unless you're using an extremely
simple interface
what however is used a lot is the grid
geometry manager and we're going to look
at that next
now the grid manager is the most useful
of all the different geometry managers
that we have here and basically what it
does is it lines up widgets' on your
screen in using rows and columns like a
table or a matrix and I'm actually going
to create two of these guys so basically
what's going to happen is each cell is
going to be able to hold one widget but
it will be possible for a widget to
cover multiple different cells so just
think of a table and it rows and columns
and there's little boxes inside of boxes
and things like that and what we're
doing is basically defining where those
little boxes go so we're going to come
in here
and we are going to create a label that
would I have no reason to actually have
to have a reference to this widget so
I'm just going to go label and root and
then I'm going to define the text that I
want this label to have so let's say I
want to have something like first name
and then this gets to the grid part of
the geometry manager so we're using the
grid geometry manager you're going to
see grid there and then I need to define
some things so I want it to be in the
top row and the rows stored at with the
zero index so I'm just going to go row
and 0 I'm then going to define sticky
and have that be West and sticky is
going to define how the widgets going to
expand so the wage is going to expand
either in the north northeast east
southeast south south west west or
northwest directions and you're going to
use these abbreviations north northeast
Northwest West East you know you get it
so those are the different ways that
we're going to be able to expand these
different components or widgets and then
you could also come in and put padding
there's a whole bunch of different
attributes that are available I'm just
going to keep it a little bit simple
here though so I'm going to say the
padding around this component or widget
is going to be 4 pixels and then let's
come in and let's say if we want the
user to be able to enter information
we're going to use the entry widget for
that and we can say grid and this is
going to be on the same row as we did
with our label we are however going to
put it in the second column which is
going to be the number one column this
guy we're going to have it be sticky to
the east and we'll go and throw padding
as well with this in the y-direction
equal to four so this is going to be
padding on the left and right this guy
is going to be padding on the top and
the bottom and let's go and do two more
of these guys just to do something here
so let's go and grab that throw that
inside of there this guy is going to be
changed to a last name we want this on
the second row so we're going to change
that to one everything else here is
perfectly fine we're going to change
this to one as well this is going to be
the second column so
we'll leave it exactly like that and
then let's say after that we decide we
want to throw a button on the screen we
can say button root is what's going to
contain it and let's say we want the
text on this button that's going to show
up to be submit and then we'll come in
here and do grid again and we'll say
that this is going to be on the third
row and we can do all that different
stuff and run it and you're going to see
it shows up much like you would think
there's first name there's the entry
where you can enter information and then
you have to submit where we're going to
be able to click on that and submit that
information somewhere so pretty cool
stuff now what I want to do is to create
a little bit more complicated type of
design and this layout is going to have
a label and then an entry on the right
side of it that's going to be 50 pixels
in width you can also define two pixels
for all of your widgets it's then going
to have a button on the right side and
then underneath that what we're going to
do is have a label followed by a bunch
of radio buttons and then on the right
side of that label the radio buttons
we're also going to have a label that is
going to have some check buttons
underneath of it so let's go in here and
create it so we'll say that we want a
label this is going to go in the route
window we're going to go and put
something like description and that's
going to be something that they're going
to be able to fill in we're going to say
that we want a grid and it's going to be
on the first row and so to do that we'll
say row is equal to zero we want this to
be in the very first column so we'll
also have that be zero and then we want
this to be on the west side of the
screen so we'll say sticky and west and
then we decided that we wanted to have
an entry box that they could enter
information in so we'll go root we said
we want it to be 50 pixels in width so
we'll set that to 50 go into grid and
find how that's going to be positioned
so it's going to be once again on the
same row as our label so we'll have that
be zero and then to accommodate the
width that we want to work here let's
just go in and we'll do something like
column is equal to eight
and you'll play around with things like
this until they are positioned properly
and then we'll come in and we will do
button and roots and our button is going
to have submit inside of it and then
we'll do a define our grid here again
and with this guy once again it's going
to be on the same row as all the other
different guys and here I'm going to
well actually let's change this to 1
sorry about that and let's chat and
change this column right here to b8 and
we'll run that see what's going on got a
little bit of bug name error named W and
remember these are always supposed to be
uppercase letters I should remember that
but I don't sometimes and when I run it
you can see right there description and
then there is the entry box and the
submit button and whenever I'm designing
interface as well first off I draw them
in with paper and pencil and then go and
create them from there but we also would
benefit greatly by just going and
creating each row of the interface one
by one don't try to do it all at once
otherwise it might get confusing alright
so now what do we want to do well we
want to have a label and then we're
going to have a bunch of radio buttons
underneath it so we're going to create
our label and we're going to have
something like our quality we're going
to define all where exactly one will
place this using grid once again we want
this on the second row so make row equal
to one we want this to be directly
underneath of our label here so we're
going to have that be in the same column
as the other label that we have on our
screen and we want the lineup also so
we're going to make sure that we have
sticky and West on there if we want to
make some radio buttons we can just go
radio button and once again it's going
to go inside of the root window and then
we could do something like new good
polar and damage to describe the quality
of our product so do something like new
and then we can assign whoops let's make
this new like that and then we're going
to let's say one two give it a value so
that we know which radio button was
clicked on we could say
one and then define our grid we want
this underneath of the labels so we're
going to define our row is going to be
equal to two and we want this in the
same column as our label so we'll have
that also be zero and so that everything
lines up sticky is going to be equal to
West and let's come in here and let's
copy this so we can have a whole bunch
of different radio buttons so one two
three four there we are have the next
one inside of here be something like
good and then we could say pour own the
last one we could say that the item is
damaged and really simple stuff
everything else is going to be exactly
the same all we need to do here is just
change the rows that we're going to be
working with so let's just come in here
and change that to three and change that
to four and then change this to five and
let's run it see if we got everything
right and you can see that it's pretty
much exactly what I wanted at the base
so we're going to be able to come in
here and change all of these different
values except they are all selected here
and how we can fix that is compile you
coming in here and changing the values
that are signed so this is going to be
two and three and four and let's run it
again and now we can see we're getting
what we want so now we're going to be
able to check one of the radio button
button items but all the other ones are
not going to be selected so there's only
going to be one option for that now what
I want to do and if you don't see your
little thing pop up you might be down
here so click on that or it might be
hidden behind the window or something
like that now what I want to do is come
in here and have another label that's
going to have some check boxes or check
buttons underneath of it and that's
going to go right in here once again all
you need to do is reference the columns
and rows and everything will go exactly
where we want it to so we're going to
come in and do another label and this is
going to go root and the text is going
to be benefits and that's enough
information and
we will go grid and now I want it to be
right next to the other guy so guess
what we're just going to use all of this
so that's going to put it right next to
it the only difference is I want it to
be in a different column so I want it to
be to the right so I'm going to increase
the column by one and there that is now
if I want to use check buttons or
checkboxes we just go check button once
again root is going to define where it
goes
text and we're going to say free
shipping is maybe an option for our item
that we're trying to sell here and then
we'll do grid we're going to change our
row to the row underneath of it so let's
just change row to 2 and then column is
going to be equal to 1 and then sticky
is going to be equal to west and let's
go and just copy this and throw another
check button underneath of it and let's
say another option that we have here is
bonus gift I'm just coming up with stuff
out of my head here if you haven't
caught on with that and I want this to
be in the next row so change that to 3
the column is going to stay the same
everything else is going to stay the
same and we run it and there you can see
so there's a little bit more complicated
type of GUI interface that we were able
to create there and it's just a matter
of figuring out what rows and boxes
everything needs to go into now as the
last part of the tutorial I'm going to
show you how events work with TK inter
so I am going to create outside of this
little box area a function is going to
be called whenever a button is going to
be clicked on and it's going to be
called get some and some event
information is going to be clicked or
passed into this function anytime an
item is clicked on and let's see what
we're going to do with that well let's
come down here and create the interface
first and then jump up here and worry
about the function after that so once
again we're going to use root and create
the TK object and then what we're going
to do is we are going to create some
entries so I'm going to call this number
1 entry is equal to and if I want to be
able to get access to the information
that is stored inside of these entries I
cannot put grid at the
and I have to add the positioning
elements afterwards as I'm going to show
you here in a second so I could say
something like entry and route like that
and then if I do that I'll be able to
reference this and grab information out
of the widget later on so then I'm going
to go nom one entry and I'm just going
to use PAC here just to keep it nice and
simple so I'll say that I want this to
be on the left side and let's go into a
couple more and all this is going to do
is take two values entered in the
entries and sum them and update to the
interface I'm also going to put a label
inside of here in this situation I have
no reason to change the text inside of
the label so I'm just going to leave it
the way that it is and it's going to
have like a plus sign inside of there
and then I can call pac---- on this and
once again have it be positioned on the
left now we'll add our second entry
inside of here so let's just change that
to two and that too and we'll leave
everything else here exactly the same
and then we're going to have a button
that's going to be the equals button
it's going to add up all this stuff so
I'll just call this equal button like
that and create our button and here just
go text is equal to and I'll put an
equal sign inside of there and then I
want to bind a event handler to our
button and now what I want to do is bind
the left mouse button whenever it's
clicked that it is going to actually
call this function and execute it up
here and how you do that is you just go
equal button and then we go bind and
then we'll define what event I'm
specifically looking for and the event
I'm looking for is the button 1 1 press
which is going to be the leftmost mouse
button and then I'm going to define the
function that's going to be executed
every time that button is clicked on and
of course I have to come in here and
pack my item or my widget on the screen
and I'm once again I'll just go left
just to keep that simple I then want to
create another entry so that I will be
able to update the some information on
this
and I'm just going to call this some
entry and some entry right there and now
we'll go up into our function and
actually define what exactly is going to
be changing whenever the button is
clicked on if I want to get the value
that was input by the user in the entry
I can just go num1 and it's going to be
a string so I'm going to convert it into
an integer and I can go num1 entry like
this and then get like that and let's do
exactly the same thing for an AMA to
throw that side of there and we'll
change this to num2 and i'm to entry
like that we can then sum these two
values together so we'll go num1 plus
num2 oops um two and then if I want to
actually insert the sum of those two
values in our sum entry I can just go
some entry and call insert throw zero
inside of there and sum which is the
value that I want put in the entry and
if I run it you're gonna see this little
guy pops up inside of here and we'll be
able to come in and do something like
three and four and equals however if I
do something like five like that you're
going to get a surprise oh look at that
it went and added them up but it put
that inside the textbox so let's go and
correct that how we can delete the value
inside of there is just goes some entry
once again and we go delete and pass
zero inside of there and then end and
run it again and here we are and now we
can use it the way we think we should
use it which is five and six is equal to
and then change that to eight and equal
to and now we get the right answer okay
so there is a whole bunch of things
about TK enter and like I said there's
going to be a whole bunch of other
videos after this one explaining pretty
much everything you'd want to know about
TK enter and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
