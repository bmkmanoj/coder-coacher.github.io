tonight might be the end I'm gonna try
to beat the Talos principle thank you
for joining me this should be exciting
and nerve-racking I might have a nervous
breakdown okay while I was waiting for
for this stream to start I did this
little Tetris thing here just so I could
get into what is probably going to be
wicked hard puzzles I know I mean I
think still say the hardest puzzle was
the last puzzle before the tower but
this one's pretty hard also yes I can
see all of your messages so let's see
what we got here
oh here's another thing this woman is
falling into depression so as I try to
figure out this puzzle hopefully she
doesn't do anything horrible
alright so that was that chick talkin
alright so what do we got here ok so
what I think I there's keys and there's
a gate where's the gate at oh no I saw a
gate oh it's a gate right there
so I guess I gotta get the gate and get
the terminal so all I need to do is jump
on our hit record jump on this grab it
then take the box over there get the
robot to grab this come over here
something to that effect I'm just gonna
like do it and and you know just see
what happens so cuz this often whoops I
don't wanna do that I want to jump on it
and then jump on that and then get this
oops
and then he'll take the box over he'll
come get it you know so that should be
okay enough time thing I hope so I think
I'm thinking this right oh wait a minute
what am i doing crap this one I've never
played this game before so I all right
you know I've never played this level
before right no this isn't right
I'm not thinking it right uh oh shut
that off
mmm okay so all right so I have this
over here and I'm you know this is a
live stream and I'm trying to solve all
these puzzles live because I like to
torture myself actually you guys told me
to play these games so all right so what
I need to do is I need to jump up on
there but that's after so I need to give
my time myself time to jump up in there
okay so I'm gonna do this okay so so I
come over here I jump on this and then I
go over and I jump on top of that thing
and I grab the box and everybody's good
and then I come over here put this down
there that's underneath the keys right
let's verify that yes it is
let's go and then I'm gonna get the
platform and I'm gonna put the platform
here and then I'm gonna put the Box on
top of the platform and then I'm gonna
jump on top of the platform and then my
robots gonna come over here and it's
gonna jump up on here and then do I need
to like jump some more to make sure I
can hit the keys just I think that's
right okay
I don't know something to that effect so
there's that and there's this so let's
do that so I'm gonna jump up here and
then I'm gonna jump up here and then I'm
gonna grab that and then I have to wait
for myself to come over here and do
whatever it is that I do and I'm gonna
put that on top of there jump up on top
of here and then take me over there
hopefully this is gonna work
jump up on there and then jump and it's
not working okay yeah I mean I have to
be closed right how on earth did I not
hmm
well how was I miss thinking this hmm I
mean how else do I get up there is there
something else what's there a box here
so there was a box here and then I put a
box on top of it mmm this is crazy all
right
I was jumping I was jumping while I was
on that bogs I mean there's no other way
I can think of this is like the last
puzzle I did I was like I know this has
to be the way yeah I was jumping I was
jumping I guess jumping all right
let's try it again this is water and ice
in this episode is sponsored by
coca-cola I wish it was no it's not so
if it was I'd obviously be drinking coke
instead of water alright so let's see if
I can think through this again is there
another box
no there's nothing else hidden here
anywhere I went up this ladder all there
is is the keys there's nothing out it's
out there I can't bring anything through
that purple gate anywhere even if there
was there's no way of I didn't there's
no way of jumping off of here and
grabbing the keys is there nope see that
kind of gate there's no way of climbing
up here and up over that fence no I'm
not allowed to cop to climb gates
there's nothing that I can jump to is
there no this game never has things like
that where you're you're doing jumps
it's all puzzle based I can't think of
anything that would make me taller
can you carry the box up there well the
box was already up there it doesn't
matter has to be it right let's try it
again just doing the same thing again
okay so we got that that gives me time
to jump on there and then get that and
then I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna come
over here let's make sure it's directly
underneath the keys I think that's why
that's there so let's drop it down and
then we'll go over and we'll get this
platform it has to be this right what
else could it be
so stand here get on top of it it'll put
the Box on then I'll put myself on and
then come over here jump on top of it
and then jump John oh oh I'm Pilat more
this time give myself a lot of time to
do all this all right so
do that okay so jump on top of this jump
on top of that so you guys in the chat
seem to think that I'm doing the right
thing so hopefully I am platform on top
of there okay I'm on top of this now
he's gonna go jump on the box I don't
need anything else oh you think you guys
think I need to get the platform also
wow that was oh okay oh my god did it so
somebody thought I needed this in my
hands but I didn't so alright cool keys
and here is a terminal yay one down two
to go
so I need to open up the thing sacred
numbers all right that's what I want
because that's where they have like
codes hidden floor pass five six five
okay any of this stuff I need to know I
don't know if anyone's ever going to
read this but if you do if we succeeded
then I want you to know that obviously
under stayed until the last moment I'm
leaving too don't worry about that I'm
gonna try and solve all these puzzles
tonight and I wait and forgot the
doggone number five six five okay so
I have tons of recipe videos I actually
sort of just ran out ideas so here so
show current operating parameters floor
access control let's strike it's to
write select for to reconfigure that
would be 5 &amp;amp; 5 6 5 5 6 5 and enter yeah
sort of ran out I have tons of cooking
videos but I sort of Irene had ideas and
some of the ideas I have had I am exit
this utility so I guess I'm done with
that right
alright so next to the next floor and I
used to think that I needed to try to
take the parts but now I don't believe
that anymore
so five six five or five subsided I used
it so I don't need anymore
okay so I can go to floor 500 really
want to beat this game tonight even
though I think the likelihood of that
occurring is probably pretty slim but
I'm gonna give it my best
what are your next programming is going
to be about games games games games
games that's all I'm doing is games for
well over a year you guys told me you
want me to do games videos and it took
me forever to start it but now that I'm
starting it I'm bound and determined
that I will make game videos though the
next pac-man video will be up tomorrow
by the way
for anybody that's following that
tutorial ruby is Ruby on Rails is a
pretty good system if you like it I I
just use PHP just because I'm always
well I wrote I wrote software for a
shopping cart using PHP for ever ago I
mean literally forever ago and it worked
and so I sort of stuck with it oh boy
this was a hard one
so that's why I continue to use it
all right so what I wanna do here I
probably don't want to do those
immediately let's mine out strike
getting these out of the way maybe
something like this and I like to get
these things out of the way if at all
possible
hmm just so hard
definitely not right let's just put that
back over there
can i yes let's try something this
well I kind of need this I feel like
this is wrong yeah this is definitely
wrong in it I'm gonna try and get rid of
the z shaped things here I'm gonna just
start over again
so sort of mess up everything so let's
put that there and then let's get rid of
this
somebody asking me how long I've been
programming since I was 10 years old 30
years a long time the goal here is to
get rid of these Z shapes because
they're always the most complicated so
that's what I'm gonna get rid of first
okay so I get rid of all those now I
want to get rid of
I kind of want to seal this off with
that seal this off with there now I'm
getting a more manageable thing now
let's go and flatten the whole thing off
with this I want to go and get these
things out of the way cuz they're the
last of the complicated things where
should just go and that should keep
everything nice and simple
maybe now I feel like I felt something
up again oh no I didn't this will go
here whoops yay wow that was really
complicated I can't imagine what the
last one's gonna be like geez huh takes
like all the life out of you oops here's
the last one
consciousness
that will persist
when my brain dies I will be
I've lived my life never turning away
from the dirt even if it scares me
I can face this face my own end
it was good to be human
all right so it doesn't sound like Alan
Alexandra made it well I got this gun
here I need to stop downstairs was a
jammer as well as a box in with the evil
robot there's something over here for a
fan and a pressure pad and there's fans
everywhere and obviously there's this so
is there any way for me to get in here
and get this fan all right let's get
that I don't know if I'm gonna need to
maybe put the robot you know the
exploding robot if you've never seen
this game that there's a circle they are
a robot down there and if it goes up
near the gun it will explode or I wish
without getting shot
well maybe go get the jammer how am I
gonna get the jammer up here though
yeah what game should I play next guys
any ideas so I really don't know I was
gonna play the Stanley parable but then
somebody told me it's not actually
really a game it's it literally doesn't
matter what you do I don't I don't know
you guys have any advice on
I like playing puzzle games obviously
whoops well hmm outlast 2
is outlast to a puzzle game well looks
like I need to get that other
do you make this fan work
oh the button over there make the fan
work Wow this is a complicated puzzle
yeah I'm not very good with stories if
you guys don't remember I played I
forget what it was it was very story
driven game and I hated it I mean the
game was fun but as a stream I thought
it sucked
rising zero dawn it was a fantastic game
but for a stream
I've beaten portal already so kind of
defeats the purpose these are mainly
really really complicated puzzle games
that I haven't beaten already so you
know you like you get to see it sort of
play out live I don't know somehow that
became my thing might not remain my
thing for forever but
hmm
hello Nicholas Carlson it's so cold I
mean I say this all the time and you
guys probably think I'm strange but I
think it's very cool that you got to
talk to people from multiple different
countries ah I figured it out just do
this because I never go anywhere like
ever jammer oh no no no I died well at
least I think I figured out something
all right so what we need to do at least
from what I'm gathering here is I need
to get this fan put it on here he's
gonna go through there all right so I
got the box what do I want to do with
the box I don't know
aha your trap okay so I got that well I
need to get those things up there so I
need the box and the jammer so let's put
this on top of that and then let's get
this and put that on top of this all
right how do I make that fan work why is
that thing over there blowing
Hiroshi game it's and I suppose again
okay after the stream I'll go through
all of your but keep believing a request
and I'll go through everything and make
a decision based off of what you guys
want to its otoku how hard is it the
program a compiler
it's not that hard operating systems
obviously a lot harder wait a minute oh
I forgot that I didn't take this off of
here so let's take that off of there put
that on here that'll get that open all
right so to get my stuff up here I need
to stop that thing from blowing in here
oh well this thing's here for a reason
and I know I can use a recorded version
of the jammer to jam this maybe hmm yeah
I could definitely stretch how to build
a compiler over multiple different
videos absolutely definitely more
complicated okay and then let's do this
jam that okay so it's wait
and then let's pick it back up again and
put it back on there yeah you got to
work let's try it okay so that should
jam and there's a button over there
which I think makes that fan work
if I stand on this oh yeah baby
I think it worked yes awesome
this key I'll tell ya I don't know how
many games I've played that have been as
rewarding as this game like when you do
something in this game you feel like you
actually accomplished something I mean
it's not like some stupid you know
achievement it's like I actually did
something it's awesome
alright let's jam this let's go and get
this I mean the witness was kind of like
that but this is like a whole new level
of of like awesome games definitely one
of the best games I've ever played so
thank you whoever told me to play this
game because it is awesome oh there's a
fan over there so I'm gonna get it this
fan put the fan over there I'm just
assuming I just got to keep moving this
stuff up that there's gonna be something
up there oh well I can go up there can i
huh
all right what do we got up here all
right come back up all right so I have a
gate and then I have another gay and it
looks like that might be the end of the
thing
so all right so I need to get up there
with a jammer oops
how do I get down there we are all right
cool
the bait you basically make a simple
operating system it wouldn't be that
hard
oh I can do this whoa oh yeah all right
well I'm stupid wait a minute wasn't
that the recorded version of myself yeah
whatever
hey I'm gonna die what am i drinking I'm
drinking water whatever I'm trying to
think I have a what do they call that a
I have a mental condition what's it
called
I have a thing in my head that if I do
ice if I can solve problems better I
when I'm doing my work I'm always
chewing ice it's a stupid it's an
addiction so just cut right to the chase
I'm addicted to doing good I do it
whenever I'm trying to solve problems
it's like a stupid thing it's a thing
that I used to focus so that's what I'm
doing
ice water here's what I'm drinking yeah
nervous tic I have all kinds of nervous
tics
I'm a mental case actually all right
let's take that off of their owner oh
yeah I can do this robot all right good
all right so I think my original concept
was good
I don't like gum
never liked chewing gum my teeth aren't
messed up my teeth are actually jacked
up a little bit my front two teeth and I
like jacked up it's mainly cuz I used to
grind my teeth I used to be a
stockbroker forever ago and it wouldn't
like totally stressed me out and I used
to grind my teeth but I got over that
but my teeth is still messed up and I
just never fixed them alright
now how did I solve this before I don't
think I can blow the evil thing yes I'm
: it's funny how that big that comes up
and like every single string I don't
know if I guy I guess I did something
that showed that I was colorblind or
something
all right so let's do that
yes well when I was a stockbroker it was
a distressed job I was a stockbroker
during when Enron was going on and when
the I became a stock broker right after
right after all the tech stocks exploded
in 2000 so yeah it wasn't a good time to
be a stock broker
oh here do this like that
wait till is crossed alright awesome and
it will go back up here
gonna steal that I don't know if I need
it we could put that there yes I went to
school for electrical engineering
it keeps bothering here and then I went
for illustration and the reason it
sounds really strange but I was trying
to get a job in the special effects
industry and that's the reason why I did
that and I ended up not getting a job in
the special effects industry but
whatever I'm happy so who cares no I
didn't work for Enron I was a
stockbroker when the whole inrun thing
happened I didn't work for anyone no I
didn't know her for Enron I don't want
that that myth to get out there and no
I'm not going to do any tutorials on I
have done a couple videos on stock
market but not anything that comes close
to giving investment advice
all right I have to focus here so don't
die again guys all right so
okay so I think what I need to do is
this and then get this and jam it and
then that'll allow me to get the other
jammer
oh no oh okay that was smart that time
all right good good to be smart
and now I want to do that right I think
yeah I would the only investment advice
I could honestly give people that I
think is pretty good advice anyway is
the same advice that Warren Buffett
gives by S&amp;amp;P 500 index as cheapest
humanly possible mm-hmm and just hold it
for forever
that's what Warren Buffett's us and you
can look that up if you don't believe
why I would lie about something like
that I have no idea all right so
now what I need to do
this is the mix the last puzzle I think
okay so hit the jammer or hit the record
have this jam go
have to really think this is confusing
okay so this okay so I should be able to
get this right without dying crap
okay
I don't know if I did the right thing
there
I don't know I just did the right thing
there or not
tonight gymnast without dying if I die
again I'm gonna be very upset
Oh
with Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy
wait oh there's my dreamer
Oh give me a little mini heart attack
okay okay so I should
Oh No
yes did it I think it'll work I think
it'll work whoo wow that was stressful
guys and I think I did it oh boy what's
that I think I did it Wow okay where's
the terminal
I don't
there should be a terminal here right
hmm wow that was really stressful
it's cool be able to beat it and there's
a gun don't want to get shot I have
doesn't matter
what have you done oh I have you
ascended the tower why have you betrayed
my faith in you I did it
turn back I command you just like
something on fire
I forgot I opened up stair access that
was our first covenant and you have
broken it I've been taught of my
half-decent singing but I have no idea
what the coconut song is though you were
deceived into coming here by that snake
to destroy the snake I believe is was it
samsara I don't know what the coconut
song is it's never heard of it okay so
please listen to me
yes the tower leads out of this world
it leads to freedom I need a red oh
there's a dude over there is that my
supposed to free him or something why
can't there are no red prisms so let's
see if I can for him I'll be cool oh
there's another red blue and a pair who
we got out
oh it's Shepherd shepherd Shepherd was
the one who was helping me on it oh
that's cool
oh did he open up a red fence no all the
stories really awesome in this game
that's one of the best parts of it there
does anything
well there's he opened this off
so maybe I'm supposed to go up here am I
supposed to put this on there oh okay
cool
so he's gonna get on here and then I
guess take it off and then he got that
what's he gonna do
ooh red awesome oh I have to send him
back so he can help me across again all
right yeah oh this game is so cool
all right so now I go through here where
are you going dude am I supposed to help
you again I don't know what he's doing
it's doing something ok so that's a red
any other Reds I don't know Sanny
let's do something oh it opens that gate
somebody says put it back
all right so now what
yeah a whole bunch of people are
watching tonight thank you welcome
everybody oh oh why did he do that I
don't seem to make any sense there's
something I can do here blue I'm just
I'm just sorry guessing I don't really
even know what I'm doing right now
there's a blue so there's a blue thing
down there but I'll need that do i oh
there's a blue thing over here what do I
do is that what I'm supposed to do
oh he just flew oh oh you put a gate
down for me awesome oh wait a minute
there's a robot over there and there's
another one over here this is Shepherd
who's this do I have like one oh that's
samsara I can't remember Shepherd was
the I guess Shepherds the good wine oh
he's going this way I can't touch him or
anything
Oh
all right so I guess I'm supposed to fly
oh alright and there's a red thing there
or am I supposed to fly again am I
supposed to make the prism fly
for the well I guess I could try this
I don't I'll see what happens I guess
there's a box Oh what do I want to do do
I went the box over there or the prism
over here
crap I don't know how about I put the
box there and then over here I want to
somehow get this red thing lit up so
where's the red thing can I see that oh
and everything's falling apart is there
a time limit in this oh look there's a
red thing there so I'm supposed to just
get oh boy I feel like I'm on some sort
of time limit
guys
is that right yes I feel like I could do
this for anymore
I just feel like this
okay so let's get through here and I
didn't open
I need to put it on stalks
something there and now there
I died okay so there's a time limit go
fast go fast go fast go fast go fast I'm
not a huge fan of games that have times
I guess I have no choice oh he's out up
here I'm not gonna be able to look at
the chat sorry guys because this is just
too complicated
ha
all right oh I don't need to do anything
right except go up this elevator yes
yeah there's a time limit on the game
just to make it harder because the team
isn't hard enough I have time limits now
oh boy all right so there's this and I
think Shepard is like nice kind of
kitten no Shepards cool when he's trying
to help me and then samsara however you
pronounce that is trying to mess me up
for some reason
where's the other blue one at there it
is oh this is the thing that makes
Shepard fly right okay then Shepard will
come over here he'll lower the bridge
I'll run across this we will run
together like champions whoops he's
gonna beat me I will run over here
come on Shepard quick quick quick quick
quick I will fly did I figure out which
there's a jerk
did I figure out I want to be on that
side right hmm I think I want to be on
that side so and I can't go up that
without hat so what I'm gonna do is go
over here and then I'm gonna get the box
and put the box here well this is a
weird puzzle shoot the box over and then
I want to go up here run over there and
then get this off of here put the Box on
there I think I'm going fast enough I
hope
and then back like this and now I should
be able to get that and where's the
other red one at Rose the other red one
over and there it is like that and then
that should be allowing me to get into
that gate I don't fall off eager okay
got it
jammer missing something I'm missing
something I'm missing something
oh he's over there mrs. done jam him
yeah he is a jammer awesome
sorry guys I can't read the chat right
now because I'm trying to move quickly
here ooh I did it I think awesome okay
next one no way back he's over there
what's up a fence moves that over there
I need to get to that does he need this
fall oh yeah yeah he has a pressure
plate over there pressure plate put this
on there and then I'll stand on it then
he'll take that put them on a pressure
plate and then bring something over
or shoot something or do something oh
you got a prism oh he's gonna give me
the prism he's not coming
or is he coming oh he just flew okay so
they're not stirred ah alright good
hopefully I'm keeping my time good
got it
as long as the process continues there
is order there's a jammer my supposed to
unjam this oh that's a jerk didn't it
yeah that's see I'm sorry I don't like
him I don't think I'm supposed to do
anything with him wait a minute did I
see something on the corner yeah there's
a box over here
what do I do with it do I supposed to
fly with it but what am I supposed to do
here am I supposed to get up to that
platform only thing that makes sense is
that I need that box to be a little bit
taller or something like that let's see
if that's right but I can't get on the
box oh I could jam the box or I could
jam the fan then put the box on it then
get on the box let's see if it works and
then do it alright good poof time limit
early things you have to make decisions
quick
alright good there is an elevator and
it's in the up position and then there's
this but I can't get that um and then
there's I'm some sort of fan over there
a gate and there's another jammer oh
jeez wait a minute
is there a way to get Shepard up here
maybe
because he's not here whoops oh there he
is oh my god samsara um
she's filled uh well there he is
ah well he's getting the elevator maybe
alright let's try that because I can't
think I need his help and can't do this
any other way so this how do I did we
have all the answers we need what our
meaning can we find in a world that has
no see if this is right because it's the
only option there is is he here
I guess we very good so then he'll come
down here hopefully stand on that pad
awesome and now I can get up here oh and
I want him to come with me
so do that awesome
all right now what oh let you in there
now what are you gonna do you gonna
stand there
ah the red things over there and I need
to get it to this what is impeding that
oh I can make the elevator go down again
right it's up right yes
make the Olivera get on okay I don't
have a prism though I have is a jammer
that's all I need right
yes yeah I think he can do it I think he
can reach the Reds right super
and then
whoops did he die what happened oh no
did I kill him oh I have to open this up
with the jammer great ooh
fan
I beat it I think I beat it
you were always meant to defy me that
was the final Drive
but I was I was scared I wanted to live
forever
oh there's a gate
so I somehow killed Eva him by defying
him I don't know it's just as pretty
thank you
took me for her to beat these game
look at this
oh there's a terminal let's see what's
on it
it says type transcend to authenticate
child program parameters and begin the
upload process okay it's a suspending
active process done collecting
experiment data done analyzing logic
performance satisfactory child program
independence check so we let your will
be done past forcing him shutdown done
saving child parameters for Talos gold
dis done trophy ran free will
to perform nomadic extended lifespan
activation successful initiating gold
disk upload waiting for gold disk data
so this has been a VR simulation kind of
like I assumed early on it says gold
discs received data transferred into
Talos unit simulation process fulfilled
deleting the simulation destroying
composite objects
removing elements undoing ruleset
clearing memory bring resources
terminating open programs racing old bad
dawn have a nice day up there I am I'm
guessing
all right gasps beat it oh this is a
heck of a challenge I'll tell you so
basically the whole thing was a
simulation guessing that everything was
a simulation except for Thank You
manatee doesn't exist anymore I don't
believe that was a simulation I believe
that was all real
yeah the whole thing was basically an
artificial intelligence training
to make the robot ready for the we live
in the real world
pretty ridiculously awesome game I'll
tell ya that is amazing mm-hmm well guys
that's it
beat it I'll tell you I didn't know if I
could at some points in time so this
game was ridiculous all right so anyway
thank you all for joining me it's been a
blast
especially for the people that have
stuck around for a long time so pretty
awesome and tomorrow upload the next
part of the pac-man game and I always
hang around for a while after the video
is over to talking and chat whatever
games you want me to play next tell me
