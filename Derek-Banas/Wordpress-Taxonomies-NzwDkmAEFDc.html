of my wordpress theme tutorial today I'm
going to show you how to make custom
taxonomy is inside of WordPress and
don't get confused by that what I mean
by that is just like you see here on
this sample website I have a bunch of
recipes well if I decided that it would
make more sense to actually create
special tags with the label ingredients
and then keep them separate from my
normal tags inside of WordPress I could
actually do that and it would help me to
better categorize and group all the
information on my website and if you
were looking for a tutorial on actually
making themes I provide a link to that
above but I found that this is kind of a
neat little trick and you can see over
here under the posts section you can
categorize your posts you into certain
categories as well as give them certain
tags or keyword phrases so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna make a custom new
one of these guys we're gonna be able to
use it inside of our posts so how you
create that is actually quite simple I'm
gonna open up my text editor and this is
text Wrangler but you can use any free
things the only reason I use text
Wrangler is it's free and it works for
me then to define this guy what you want
to do is go into your functions.php file
which is inside of your custom theme
show you how to make this guy here all
in one video it's actually very easy the
first thing you want to do is latch on
to a hook inside of WordPress and
specifically what I'm going to latch on
to is the eye NIT and what this guy does
is it will call whatever function I tell
it to call whenever WordPress is
initialized that's what the int stands
for the ini T stands for and this is not
a special function it's something I just
made up out of nowhere but you would
like to have these all be totally
different you want these names to be
different so this is the function it's
gonna be called one one for us is
initialized at the end you put a
priority zero being the most important I
technically don't know if that's a good
idea but everybody else does that even
people in the WordPress community so
must be perfectly fine so now what I
need to do is I need to call a function
being the create ingredient taxonomy
function and it doesn't have anything
sent to it then inside of here you need
to call a very specific WordPress
function it's called register text Alana
me write like that and then you have to
pass on some information first I'm going
to
ingredients and this is going to be the
name used to identify all the data that
is put in the wordpress database so
that's what that is then I'm gonna
define that I want to be able to define
these Texel enemies for all of my posts
I could also put the links or pages
there in fact it should be post page or
link those are the very specific things
you would type in there if you'd like to
have those instead of putting them on
post and then at that point you have to
define an array and I'm going to have
this be hierarchical and what that means
pull the browser up tags if we open this
up here real quick or not hierarchical
you cannot put parents and then have
these all divided however categories are
hierarchical as you can see here you can
define different parents whenever you
define a new category well I decided
that I want to make or at least have the
option to do that I don't know why you
wouldn't I mean really just provide you
with an additional option if you ever
decide you want it and then you just put
inside here true if you want that
capability then you define the label
which will define the name for the
taxonomy on the site and inside of the
dashboard in mine is going to be
ingredients because this has recipes
assigned to it and it makes sense to me
then you type in query underscore var
and what this allows you to do is if
it's marked true it'll allow you to
search for posts based off of the
taxonomy z' that you create for them
gonna make that true as well and then
finally we have rewrite and again i this
is another thing i don't know why it
wouldn't always be true what this will
do for you is whenever you search for
posts using these custom taxonomies it
will put up informative urls so for
example if you would search for garlic
it would put garlic in the URL so that's
also a great thing and it's also
potentially a good thing for search
engines if it shows up and there you go
you got that all set up inside of there
so if you file save it and then we jump
over inside of this guy and then we're
gonna reload this page now you can see
just that easy ingredients is found
right here so let's say i want to go and
start adding some new things into here
so i'll put garlic and just keep this
simple and again i could put all these
guys into different parent areas if I
wanted to but I'm just gonna leave it
this way then we can add new category
and then let's say I want to use
jalapeno and there so I got jalapeno and
garlic
well I now will go into my post area and
then this one right here I dunno
well then on the right side give me the
option of putting garlic and jalapeno
well there's garlic and jalapeno in both
of these so let me click on those both
and we'll update that and now we'll be
able to search using those custom
taxonomies and just for the heck of it
let's create a tag cloud so that I can
show you how this might work so let's go
into my sidebar second dot PHP file come
in here right after the subscription
area that I have and it'll define a tag
cloud now I don't have all these
different things in this taxonomy so
it's not going to show 50 million
different things like if I loaded all of
the current tags in there which would
make sense I just simply want to show
you exactly what you'd have to do if you
wanted to reference this information in
a tag cloud for example I'm going to
show you here first how to create a new
tag cloud using posts and then I'm going
to show you how to easily change the
taxonomy on it so if you're going to use
post go right like this and then post
tag that's how you would reference that
you wanted to create a post tag cloud
right here and then just to show you a
couple other things you can define with
this function you can define what you
want your smallest or least common tags
to show up in regards to the size so I'm
going to say seven points you can also
say what you want the largest one to be
in regards to points here I'm going to
say 20 and of course you could also
define unit and you could also put a
limit on the maximum number that would
actually show up just that easily and of
course you'd want to close that off and
then close off the PHP section fleet
file save that and then we jump over
into key care for example you can now
say the tag cloud for all of my tags and
I could easily come in here and do
exactly the same thing using my new
custom taxonomy again remember I don't
have all entities set up so it would not
show up very nice but all I'd have to do
if I wanted it to be based off of the
ingredients I would just type in
ingredients that's it that's all I
changed and we file save that jump out
here and reload it and you're now going
to say garlic and jalapeno show up real
real tiny because I only have one recipe
assigned to that so there's how to
create custom taxonomies use
WordPress kind of a neat little trick
and it's a great way to better organize
your information it also is a fabulous
tool if you plan on creating shopping
carts using WordPress have any other
