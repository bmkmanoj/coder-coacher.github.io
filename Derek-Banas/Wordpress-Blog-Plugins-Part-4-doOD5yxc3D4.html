in my wordpress plugin video series
where i cover all of my favorite plugins
that I use on a constant basis and this
is my website I'm gonna cover the rest
of the plugins if there's something that
is not being covered I know ecommerce
has been shown as an interest I plan on
covering that in the future as well as a
calendar plugin father the reason they
didn't include that is because and a lot
of the calendar plugins recently were
broken with the most recent upgrade of
WordPress well on with the plugins
alright now it's time for sexy with
marks just go into your plugins page
again and hit activate and it pops up
another way you can access most of these
plugins which I don't often do is to go
over here and look for a configuration
panel in this case and there's a whole
host of other ones and what is great
about sexy bookmarks as it gives you a
really easy way for people to
disseminate information to everything
imaginable what I do a real easy way to
check these off because there's a lot of
these how many people actually use is to
select none and then click on those
popular and for some reason it leaves
out Facebook in myspace linkedin google
bookmarks blogger check that and I think
that's pretty much everything and then
what you can do is plug in your Twitter
account ID enter your information should
open yahoo Buzz there's all kinds of
little neat little things you can do
here I usually instead of clicking on
just sharing it's sexy as this sharing
is caring you can do it everyone I
usually put it in below content menu
location post pages or whole shebang
posts and pages show an RSS feed Yammer
on onion menu for mobile browsers I
would
checked just like they say in there and
you go through your website after you
install that it took so long and phone
sexy before would it be great if every
time you posted something on your
WordPress website and it automatically
we code your Twitter Facebook MySpace
page
yeah would be great and here it is
socialite click activate boom got it
setup go down here and click on settings
they're socially out here and here is
the configuration I keep everything set
up here URL wise ZZ GD pet setup then
what you do enable Twitter you would
just click in here type in your Twitter
username your password if you don't want
to aggravate people I would do update
Twitter with post is created and I would
uncheck update post boy if I post is
edited I've really is aggravating so
make sure you uncheck that shortened
URLs leave that checked then you enter
in all your Facebook information again
you want to shut off this update status
on the wall what the post is edited add
links to the wall when the post is
created yes and linked to the wall when
the post is edited and new and here's
where you put all that information in
regards to myspace is long and that is
basically all that you do and that is
socially if you'd like to turn your
website into a really cool smartphone
application then you need to install
WordPress mobile pack here it is click
install what's great about this is
automatically downloads themes and if
somebody comes on your website you see
here WordPress Mobile automatically
downloads all of these different themes
and looks for you and if anybody goes
onto your website with a smartphone it
automatically converts your website into
this nice ain't easy smartphone type
website so if you want to pretty do it
this is what the website would look like
it's very very easy to use and pretty
much all you need to do to make it work
it's click on activate WordPress mobile
pack okay the final plug I'm going to
talk about this article here is WP audio
what it just simply hit activate on that
and what it allows you to do is to embed
mp3s and podcasts and so forth and so on
into your pages and we do that let's go
to pages your left sidebar clicked on it
see here radio interviews after you
activate each reference to the audio
file and then followed by class equals o
WP audio that's all you need to do and
automatically will embed your mp3s or
whatever type of audio files that you
have directly into the web page and
it'll look like this so it's nice and
classy little tool and you can say right
there just exactly how it works
so that's WP audio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
