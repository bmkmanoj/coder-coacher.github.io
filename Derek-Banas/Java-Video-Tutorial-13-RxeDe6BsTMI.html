13 in my java video tutorial series
today we're going to do the last of the
simplistic things to learn about inside
a job everything after this is going to
be a lot more complicated today we're
going to focus on strings and string
builders and I have just the basics laid
out here that of course you understand
and up here I'm importing my arrays
library because I got to use that a
little bit later on so let's just jump
right into what I'm going to start off
very very simple some of the stuff
you're already going to know and we're
going to get into more complicated
things as we go on all the different
methods available are all going to be
presented here so this is how you create
a string and make sure you surround all
of your strings that you create with
quotes and not apostrophe is very
important put apostrophes around
characters and not strings there you are
just created a string of course you know
that and there of course is an
apostrophe so let's go ahead and let's
talk about escape codes so let's say you
want to create another string and you
have to use a quote inside of it for
whatever reason so let's say you're
going to put he said which would be a
good situation where you'd have to do
that well if you want to put a quote
inside of here you have to put a
backslash and then the quote you can
just go in here and I'm here that's all
fine and dandy and then of course you
want to put in another one you just put
a backslash in another quote so that's
how you would do that and common escape
codes or new lines and then you have
things like back spaces and then you
have apostrophes of course because
you've seen that already and then you
also have your quotes which you've seen
already and then also backslash you'd
have two backslash the backslash
otherwise it would get confused want to
combine strings of course you know how
to do this system in line we've already
done that 50 million times and you could
do this in any different number of ways
let's a put random string inside of here
put a little space inside of there plus
and got to quote so that's one way that
you could go and print out that the
screen and there you can see I actually
printed it out screen on the right side
of the screen and of course you could do
print primitives so let's just create an
integer and let's just call it num 2 is
equal to 2 and you could easily come in
here and put num two in there instead of
that and that's going to print out num2
just like that so there you can use
primitives you can use anything inside
of strings to print this stuff out
really simple simple stuff well actually
in the first
part of this video tutorial I showed you
how to convert primitive types and those
would be bytes shorts and Sloane's
floats doubles and billions in
combination with first byte dot to
string depending upon primitive you're
going to have to put a different type of
thing in here so short I'm going to
convert a short to a string you have to
put short dot to string and all the
codes available underneath the video
it'll really really help you understand
a little bit better if you go and
download that of course it's all free
and if you want to convert from a string
to a primitive you have to use the
applicable integer for this situation
and then parse int and you can see all
those different things here just make
sure if you want to do a parse long
again this is to convert a string into a
primitive you're going to put long dot
parse long so that's how that all works
and you've seen that in the past and
previous tutorials and other
explanations so I'm not going to spend
too much time on that now we're going to
create a couple more strings here so
let's go upper case string is equal to
and let's type in big like that and
let's create another string and it will
be called lower case string and put big
in there except it's going to be lower
click now if I want to do a comparison
between different strings let's just do
this with an if statement I can go upper
case STR and I can type in equals equals
method and then if I want to compare it
to another string which is an object as
you can see here Eclipse is saying hey I
expect an object here well I'm just
going to type in that and let's go and
scroll that up and let's print out a
message they are equal which they are
not because and you can see that it's
just not going to print out anything and
the reason why is equals pays attention
to upper case and lower case so these
two things as far as equals is concerned
or not equal because this is upper case
letters and it says lower case letters
however if you wanted to ignore case you
just change this to ignore case use a
different method and in this situation
they are going to print up as you see
they're equal so that's two different
ways to do quality comparisons between
strings treat a couple more strings here
alright created two strings there I want
to do some more manipulations on these
guys so if I wanted to find out what
character is at a specific index and
just like arrays everything in a string
is
index values so a zero B is one two
three four okay so I can go in there and
find out what exact character is in what
specific position so it's just print
that guy out so I can do something like
a second character like that and then if
I want to find out based off of the
letter string what character is at a
specific index position type in the
character at method and it will tell me
exactly what that is and you can get
these characters and use them in other
ways other than just printing on the
screen and as you can see it printed
that out there's numerous different ways
to do pretty much everything inside here
and you could also do compare two so
let's go in here and type in letters
compared to that is another method for
you and let's compare it to more letters
and see what happens then I'll explain
exactly what is going on here prints out
a negative five and the reason why is
compared to if the strings are equal is
going to print out a zero
if however when comparing these two
strings and they're comparing them based
off of alphabetical order okay so that's
what job is doing here in the situation
in which letters which is ABCDE comes
before more letters in the compare to
method here see it's that's how it's
comparing letters to more letters so if
letters comes be for more letters you're
going to get yourself a negative number
which is what happened right there and
it also makes sense since this is a b c
d e and this is f g h i j k alphabetic
order that's how it's playing around
there however if letters comes after
more letters you're going to get
yourself a positive number that is how
the compareto function works if you want
to check whether a string contain
certain things no problem you just type
in letters and type in contains just
what I wanted to find out if that string
contained ABC of course we're going to
be able to find that with that new
awesome method and there it is true
comes back so you know you get a boolean
value you could also check if letters
ends with a specific number of
characters pretty simple so let's see if
it ends with de and we know it does is
no real point even bring that out and
also just like ends with there's a
starts with method that's
available and it's just going to tell
you does the string start with whatever
number of characters you put in there so
there's no real point going over that
you could also find out the starting
index position for a certain number of
characters inside of a string right like
that and you could say that it's going
to print out those different values and
you're also getting a seed one ends with
say it ends with de which it does so it
prints out true and in here index of CD
and it's kicking back too and the reason
why is this is 0 1 2 C is index value
too so that's another way to look at
these different guys and you can also
specify the index to start searching
from in that situation and that is with
index of you type in the string to look
for and the index start position so if
you wanted to start searching after the
third character you would come in here
and type in would actually be 2 but you
would type in the index position to
start searching from and then the string
you are looking for and of course you
could also use last index of and it
works just like the index of except it
starts from the end of the string you
are searching instead of from the
beginning of that string so as you can
see there's a kind of a lot of
duplication and some of these methods
that's why I bother to go through all of
them now if you want to return the
number of characters in a string of
course that's also very easy to use and
typing in length right here and I think
you can guess that that's probably what
it's going to do so you type in letters
and you type in link and that's gonna
kick back the actual number of
characters in the string and you can see
here link is 5 and that's exactly right
then also if you wanted to replace
certain different characters likes for
instance let's say you want to replace
ABC with XY so it doesn't have to be the
same number of characters here and
replacing these three characters with
these two characters you would use the
replace function to do that and as you
can see that's exactly what it did it
replaced the ABC with the two characters
x and y and we can delete some of these
things here we don't need them another
thing you can do is create a string
array using the split method so let's go
string and I'm just going to call this
letter array it's equal to and then we
can just go letters dot split and then
inside of here you have two it's going
to pop up reg X which stands for regular
expressions we'll get later into that
but what we're going to do here is you
have to provide a delimiter is what it's
called in this situation
going to put a delimiter as nothing and
that just means how do you want to
divide these characters up that is all
that means so in this situation we don't
have any space between these letters but
let's say everything was divided by a
comma so you have a comma B comma C in
this situation well in that situation
the delimiter if you wanted to divide
all the characters off would be a comma
then what it's going to do is it's going
to put a B and C all in separate
compartments inside of an array now you
can put anything inside here like I said
a regular expression allow you to do
really really funky crazy awesome thing
but in this situation we're just going
to stick with this basic concept so in
this situation I'm basically saying I
want everything to be divided up into
separate spaces and let's go and split
all this different stuff up so let's
just type in letter array and then if I
want to print an array out the screen
I'm gonna go raise dot to string and
you've seen this guy in the past right
like that and you can say it printed out
the array ABCDE
right there on your screen that's not
exactly what you wanted to look for
because it's C it actually put a little
space in here for what precedes a and
you know it just doesn't quite look
right so what you want to actually do in
that situation I mean it's not common
that you're going to be separating
different characters together however if
you would want to put those characters
in different compartments let's create a
character array and do pretty much same
sort of thing except we're going to go
letters to care and now it's going to
provide us more of what we're looking
for as you can see it printed out right
there so it just separated all the
different characters and put them all in
separate compartments another neat thing
you can do is actually get different
parts of the string to print out the
screen using a substring function so
we'll just go letters dot substring and
yes in this situation for some god-awful
reason they decided to not go and put an
uppercase inside of there and let's say
you wanted to start at the second index
which in as you know is one and you
wanted to go through the fourth one you
wanted to print that out the screen
that's exactly how that's done and as
you can see it prints out BCD and then
you could also force this to be
displayed as uppercase just by putting
the add a to uppercase method right
inside of there and then of course
there's also a to lowercase which is
going to force it into lowercase mode go
in here and create another string and
we'll call it R and string
is equal to and I'm gonna throw a whole
bunch of whitespace into this there's
just a whole bunch of extra stuff there
now if you wanted to get rid of this
white space it's real simple let's just
take RAM string and call the trim method
on it and that's exactly what it's going
to do it's going to delete all the white
space at the beginning and the end not
inside of the string itself now whenever
you're dealing with strings I'm gonna
throw kind of a big word at you a string
is what is known as an immutable and
what that means is every single time you
change a string in any way it doesn't
delete the previous version of that
string in memory what it does is it
creates a brand-new location in memory
for the string over and over and over
and over again now this is kind of time
consuming so if you're planning on
making a ton of different edits to a
string you should use what's called a
string builder because a string builder
basically gets a block of memory and it
continues to use it it doesn't recreate
the string over and over and over and
over again but other than that they're
very very similar so if you want to
create a string builder you just type in
string builder and let's just go Rams SB
and then you just type in new string
builder right like that and let's just
give it a random value literally okay
now I'm going to show you a whole bunch
of methods you can do ok so if you want
to for example append something to the
end of a string builder this is how you
don't do that just go and type in R and
SB because that's naming my string
builder and call the append let's come
in here throw another string in let's
just type in again and you can see that
it prints out a random value again it
appends that extra information on the
screen and just so you know this that
change that we just made right there is
not just for that line of code it
actually makes a permanent change to
this string builder say the again part
is still there because I've gotten
questions about you know exactly what's
going on there and if you want to delete
certain information inside of here well
you know there's a delete method and
let's say we want to delete from 15 to
say 21 which is in essence going to
delete the again port that you just
added with the append and you can see it
did out now remember before I said
whenever you create a string builder
what it in essence is doing is providing
you a certain amount of space in memory
well if you want to find out
how much space and that space constantly
changes based off of any changes you
make to the string well you can call the
capacity function capacity function is
going to tell you how much total space
you have in memory and it is allocating
you currently 30 characters worth of
space inside of your strengths and if
you wanted to increase that size what
you just do is type in again your string
builder and then you type in in short
capacity and you say how many characters
do you want and they're typed in 60 so
now if I call this capacity function
again it's going to print out 60 instead
of what I've had before so let's just
cut that out of there and you can see it
provided me with sixty two characters
worth of space what in short capacity
does is it guarantees it's going to be
at least 60 in size however it could be
bigger than that now if you wanted to be
able to come in here and find out what
the length meaning the number of
characters that are actually inside of
the string you call the length function
just like we do with strings and you can
see the difference between length and
capacity however if you wanted to trim
the size of the capacity down to the
actual size of the string you call trim
to size and that is exactly what it's
going to do it's going to make sure that
your capacity is equal to your length
and you can see that now the capacity is
equal to length 15 and 15 so there's a
way to force it to do whichever you want
and again these are for string builders
what we're doing here if you wanted to
insert a certain string or anything
starting at a specific index so let's
say if after I want to change the word a
into another what I would do is I say I
want to start at index 1 and I want to
put on another after that that's exactly
how I do that with the insert method
another random value as you can see I
just want to put it right inside of
there real easy and if you wanted to
create a string oldest B just call the
two string method and that's going to
convert your string builder into a
string and rather than repeat myself
string builders also have a lot of the
same functions as strings such as
character at it works exactly the same
for a string builder as it does first
string and then index of also works
exactly the same and last index of works
exactly
and substring also works exactly the
same there's a whole bunch of things
about strings and string builders leave
any questions or comments below the last
