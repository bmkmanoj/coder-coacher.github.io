new XML video tutorial series I recently
asked you guys what you wanted to see
and I received tons of emails asking for
this tutorial so here you go on the
screen you can see eclipse it looks
exactly the same in every single
operating system and it's free that's
the reason why I use it no over here on
the left side of the screen if you do
not see project Explorer or easy just go
over here and click on window show view
and then click on project Explorer and
it will pop up on your screen just like
that also inside of Eclipse I prefer to
use the web editor but of course there
is an XML editor but use whichever one
you like I just like the web editor
specifically and all of the code is in
this tutorial is available in a link
underneath of this video the first thing
we're going to need to do of course is
create our XML file so I'm going to
right click on source over here inside
of a directory and if you don't have
anything over here you can go file new
and create a new project or whatever you
would like to do on there but since I
already have one I'm just going to right
click on source go new scroll down so I
get two other click on that then you're
going to have this handy dandy little
wizard pop-up here inside of this XML
directory right here I'm going to come
down and click on XML file and click on
next and I'm going to change the name of
this to tv-shows dot XML click on next
and I'm gonna let this set us create XML
file from an XML template and click on
next and I'm gonna let all this be
exactly the same and click on finish you
can see right here what is called the
XML declaration and it just states what
version of XML using as well as my
encoding now XML like you probably know
is known as extensible markup language
and it is used for storing information
as well as describing the structure of
information however it is also used for
transporting information it is not a
language but it's pretty much just a
series of rules for organizing data now
if I want to display this information on
a screen I'm going to use what's called
an XSLT stylesheet and in the next part
of this tutorial I'm going to go over
what you can do with XSL files I'm just
going to type is equal to and text /x SL
because that's what it is and H
reference is going to be equal to TV
shows but XSL and then close off that
guy right there then what I'm going to
do is create what is known as the root
element now there
can only be one root element and this is
going to contain all of the other
different nodes that are inside of our
XML file that we have here and I'm going
to call this guy TV shows I like that
and you can see that almost every single
element that you ever create is going to
have a closing bracket now I'm not going
to use all this stuff right now I'm
going to wait until a later tutorial to
go over exactly what's going on with
that now after I've created this root
element inside of it I'm going to create
a whole bunch of other different nodes
they're going to have a whole bunch of
information in regards to television
shows so I'm going to tab this in here
so it's a little bit easier to say I'm
going to create a new element called
show and of course it's going to have
closing tag as well now it's very
important to know that XML is case
sensitive so show in lower case letters
is much different than show in upper
case letters just pay attention to that
and element names inside of our XML file
can begin either with a letter of course
like I have here or an underscore or
they can start off with a colon like
that those are the different things you
can have and of course you can have
numbers afterwards but you can't have a
number is the very first thing inside of
one of these guys and if you would like
all your XML nodes to show up unedited
just like you see here on the screen
what you would do is just put a bracket
an exclamation mark another square
bracket and then see data bracket and
then after our little show part here
bracket bracket and in this other
bracket and if you did that whenever you
show this inside of a browser is going
to show all these individual nodes and
instead of showing any type of stylized
nodes but we'll get more into that later
on and that's definitely something you
could play with on your own okay so now
that I've created this of course I have
to define all the different elements
that make up what I'm going to be
referring to as a show so I'm going to
say name of course and I must say life
on Mars is going to be one of the
elements that I'm going to put inside of
here another thing is I'm going to put
the release year for this show 2008 end
date and I'm just making these up
that's what XML is it allows you to
define your own tags and pretty much
come up with whatever you want to show
on the screen end date and then I'm
going to put Network that this show is
on and then you can also add attributes
to any of these at different individual
elements so let's say I want to have
inside here whatever if you do add any
attributes you have to put those inside
of quotes and then here I'm going to put
ABC and then network right like that
then I'm going to link out to I'm going
to call poster in this situation and I'm
going to give it an attribute called
href and this is going to link out to an
image for said TV show online and I just
bounced out there online and got this
great big giant huge jpg name and
remember put the double quotes inside of
there I'm also going to come in and say
width is going to be equal to 214 pixels
and height is going to be equal to 317
pixels and this is one of the only times
in which we're not going to need to have
a closing tag because this whole entire
guy is going to be self-contained with
that forward slash and a closing bracket
and then I'm going to come in here and
also go viewers and you can also define
units for let's say so let's just say it
was gonna represent millions of
different viewers and then inside of
here I'm gonna go seven point eight two
which was the average number of viewers
for said television show let's just keep
that all nice and neat it's very
important to know that for the most part
inside of these different tag areas you
can pretty much put anything that you
want to put inside here however there
are what are called five character
entities in which you have to put in a
specific code and you cannot put in just
whatever you want another thing that I
don't think I mentioned was if you want
to put comments inside of here that's
exactly how you do it and here all this
top the different character entities
that you have to type in if you want an
ensign to show up on the screen going to
have to type and AM P and then a
semicolon if you want an apostrophe to
show up on your screen you're going to
have to type in and a POS and a
semicolon if you want a greater than
sign to show up you have to type in and
GT and a semicolon you want a less than
to show up and you're going to have to
do this a lot you have to put in and lt
like that and if you want double quotes
to show up just as raw data you have to
put in &amp;amp; quot right like that so those
are the character entities that if you
want to use them inside of your XML
document you have to use these special
little codes with them but more on that
later on don't want to confuse you if
you didn't understand
don't worry about it and then basically
inside of this XML file we're going to
do exactly the same thing over and over
and over again so might as well just go
in here and copy this and I'm going to
throw in two additional shows the next
show I'm going to throw in is going to
be life on Mars again but this is going
to be the British version and so it
began in 2006 it ended in 2007 country
UK BBC Sam just putting in basically the
same thing I'm going to have to jump out
onto the web and grab the poster for
this okay got that row that inside of
there and the width and the height is
going to be exactly the same number of
viewers is 6.8 million in this situation
you can see I'm just thrown into out of
here and I'm gonna scroll down and throw
in another television show let's say
Freaks and Geeks
again in 1999 ended in 2000 country in
this situation is going to be us
networks going to be ABC not need to
change that grab the image for this guy
paste that in there
and then this is going to be 6.7 million
viewers and right there is a sample XML
file in the next part of the tutorial
I'm going to show you a bunch of neat
ways to style it using TV shows XSL
