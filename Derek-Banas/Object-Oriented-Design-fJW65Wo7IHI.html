oriented design tutorial today I'm going
to show you how to create a UML design
from scratch and begin this whole entire
presentation now UML is going to be used
to design software blueprints and if you
haven't watched my UML tutorial you
might want to take a look at it and
there's a link above design patterns on
the other hand are used to reuse the
expertise of others to design software
that is optimized and understandable
while knowing UML and design patterns is
nice being able to use them to create an
excellent object-oriented design is the
goal of this tutorial
and the critical goal in object-oriented
design is to assign the right
capabilities to the right objects and in
this tutorial as well as the second part
that's going to follow here I'm going to
go through both the analysis and design
stage now the analysis stage is going to
focus on creating a requirements list
and other things like that that you're
going to see in this part of the
tutorial while the design phase is going
to focus on designing objects and
figuring out how they will work together
so after this part of the tutorial in
the next part I'm going to take you from
a simple idea the whole way through the
UML design process to the final working
code so let's get into it because
there's a lot to do okay here I am in a
basic text editor and I'm just going to
call this coin flip for now and if you
can't see this beautiful screen but
either way I'm going to store it off
right here and the whole entire program
we're going to be creating here sounds
really simple but believe me this is the
way to learn in this process you want to
keep it as simple as possible because
things can get crazy real fast
now in this use case rather than draw up
everything I like to most of the time
just type everything out so basically
we're going to have two players and a
player at random and I'm doing this all
out of my head so if I slip up here or
there please forgive me so we're going
to have two players and one of the
players is going to be chosen at random
to offer predictions on what the coin is
going to be so we're just going to come
in here and we're going to type all of
this out okay so we got that the other
player and this is all the stuff that
our program is going to have to do for
us gets the other option so if one goes
and decides heads the other one
automatically needs to get tails and
then
coin is going to be flipped pretty
simple and then the correct guess wins
and we're going to have to put that
information out on the screen so that's
going to be handled in the use case
description then we're going to go
through and figure out a couple other
things and I covered this in my use case
tutorial but and putting everything
together here so my trigger is going to
be a player at random offers a
prediction of a coin flip so that's
going to be the trigger that's going to
set everything off then my actors all
the people involved well there's going
to be a player who makes the first
prediction another actor is going to be
a player that gets the other option
there's going to be a coin involved so
it's going to pertain it's going to be
an actor and then I'm going to actually
have coin game be outside of everything
else and consider it an actor as well
alright so now I know all the different
parts are going to be at play here so
now I need to look at some preconditions
two players are available so that's
something that we definitely need to be
able to have available for us to be able
to have this thing go and a coin or a
fictional coin anyway is going to be
available can't think any other
preconditions and this is just the whole
idea here just get everything out on the
screen and the goal is going to be one
player wins and the other loses so
that's our goal and we're also going to
print that out to screen now I'm not
available
or failed conclusion you know what we're
going to do if our system fails we're
just going to guess that everything is
going to work out because this is going
to be pretty simple and any extensions
or alternatives I'm going to leave for a
later tutorial so there we are those are
the two things that we're not going to
be doing here that are normally in use
case diagrams and then we're going to
get into our steps of execution this is
probably the most important part so
what's going to happen a player at
random is picked to predict the coin
flip so this is all the stuff we're
going to have to program and then the
player picked
offers a prediction of the coin flip
we're just going to go step by step
through what we think is going to happen
well I think that's done so we're going
to say the other player gets the other
coin flip option
so like I said before if one chooses
heads the other one by default is going
to get tails makes sense I don't think
anything else needs to be going on here
so I'm going to look at my actors here
this is what I'm basically doing here
it's thinking about my actors so there's
going to be two players a coin in a coin
game and I'm basically defining here in
the steps of execution what they need to
do so the coin is going to be flipped
and the result is provided and then a
winner and loser is picked and displayed
on the screen and is there anything else
I'm going to do how about we offer them
to try again and I can't think anything
else I remember it sounds simple but
there's a lot of things going on here so
now based off of getting this together
I'm going to also create an object model
and it's going to document the main
objects in the system and the main
fields they're going to have and then on
top of that how those different objects
are going to relate to each other and
I'm also going to make a class diagram
in a sequence diagram so let's go and
start doing that okay so here are our
main parts that I'm going to try to
document on here right there so there's
my steps of execution so the next thing
I like to do is create what is called an
object model I'm going to shrink this
down so I can actually create the whole
thing here on our screen and I'm also
gonna get these couple pieces I have
everything that's available here on this
screen you're going to be able to see
after I'm done with it there will be a
link underneath of the video so you can
play around with this stuff just like I
am okay so the object model I'm looking
over here and I remember my actors so I
have two players involved so I'm just
going to come over here click on that
and then I'm going to go player so
that's going to be an object and before
I do anything else let's just go and
figure out what all our players are
going to be and all of our actors are
going to be I'm also going to need a
coin come over here and create a coin
and then the final thing I'm going to
use is a coin game which everything's
going to be inside of that so now I need
to think about okay well what fields am
I going to use actually let's think
about this a different way
let's connect all these guys and figure
out exactly how they're going to work
together connect their lines okay so
everything's going to be connected and
then over here I'm going to put in
exactly what actions are going to take
place myself a little bit of room move
this guy over there so what the actions
are going to take place between
the coin and the player well there's
going to be a coin flip so I'm just
going to work this all out and how many
players do I need if well I'm going to
need two players so I'm going to put
that in there and how many coins do I
need I only need one so there you go
so that's going to figure out exactly or
show how many these guys relate and how
they relate and all that other stuff
well actually the coin is also going to
relate to my coin game which is also
going to be important and how is the
player and the coin game going to work
together and I'm using a program called
omelet if you're wondering where all
this stuff's coming from okay so in the
coin game there's going to be two
players involved and also there's only
going to ever be one point game itself
so I'm just going to call that one and
how are the players and the coin game
going to interact well the coin game
itself is going to contain the players
because that makes sense the coin game's
going to have a coin in it as well as
two players so let's just grab this guy
here and let's just make this real
simple I'm just going to say includes so
there we are now I know how these guys
are going to interact and we're just
moving along here includes also probably
makes sense down here with this guy and
how many coins am I going to have and
how many coin games I'm gonna have one
coin game and coins I'm still gonna have
one of those so I know that so I know
how many different types of these
objects I need to instantiate so I'm
going to have two player objects and I'm
gonna have one coin 1 coin game and that
is gonna really tell me a lot sounds
like it doesn't tell me much but it will
so what type of things are my players
going to have well I'm gonna give them a
name just to separate them apart from
each other so they're a little bit
easier to understand or tell what's
going on and then coin option is also so
it's going to be either heads or tails
each player is going to have either
heads or tails as an option and the coin
game itself now the coin game itself is
going to have players I think I'm going
to store those as an array and these are
the sort of things you have to think
about and then I'm going to also have
the coin itself so the coin game is
going to have two players and it's going
to have the coin and my coin what fields
it can have it's basically going to have
coin option that's it heads or tails and
that's it so that's how to create an
object model so there's a use case model
and here's an object model now based off
of that I'm going to create a sequence
diagram and here is my sequence diagram
this is going to be a little bit more
complicated of course I'm still going to
be using all this stuff over here so so
now I need to think about okay well what
pieces am I going to need well remember
over here I said offer to try again well
one of the things one of the ways I can
do that is by using an option inside of
this so that's going to be an option and
then on top of that let's say that the
condition for that is going to be flip
again just keep it simple I want to
think about what variable names make
sense overall here but at the same time
I just want to get move and get some
stuff accomplished okay so everything's
going to basically be wrapped up inside
of this option then I'm probably going
to have all this take place inside of
the main program itself just thinking
out loud all right so the next thing
that kind of makes sense is to get all
of my actors involved and that's what
I'm going to do so I'm just going to
grab these okay so I have a player a
coin actually two players a coin and a
coin game so I'm just going to grab
these guys here these classes and let's
get in here and start putting them in
the right place so I paste those in
there move this around so now that I got
that I'll set up just grab one of these
classes here and this guy is just going
to be called coin game so there's coin
game and the next thing I'm going to
need is a player so in this situation I
know that it's going to have a name so
I'm just going to call it Claire one and
say it is of the class player so there
we ever got that and get rid of this
altogether don't need it
what else do we need well we're going to
have a player two and it's also going to
be of class player and then what else do
I need a coin take that guy over here
and I'm just going to say the coin and
it's going to be of the object type coin
so pretty simple and then what do we
need to do well need these guys here can
connect everything start drawing those
in and basically I'm going to take these
steps over here and convert them into a
sequence diagram and it sounds like a
lot of work but believe me in the end
and will end up saving you want mence
amount of work because you're going to
have everything
all worked out that that guy and each
one of these is going to need a little
thing hanging down here a lifeline and
this for now I'm just going to leave
down here so what's going to happen
well player one or one of the players is
going to be picked at random to decide
on what the coin flip will be how do we
do that in a sequence diagram well we're
going to use alt in that situation so
I'm just going to copy this guy drop it
in there so there that is and then
whenever you use alt basically going to
have two possibilities or at least two
possibilities in this situation so I'm
going to say if random player is equal
to player 1 well in that situation I'm
going to perform certain actions and the
actions basically going to be the player
one's going to have to like do stuff for
me so there's that you don't really like
the way this is all laying out here so
I'm going to move them over a little bit
okay so in that situation then I'm going
to have to run certain different types
of methods so I'm gonna have to grab
this guy over here and this guy right
here copy again continue drawing this
out let's just spread this out and know
exactly what's going to happen here I'm
basically going to lay out what is going
to occur in our sequence diagram in the
for instance in which player one is
chosen to be the guy who gets to make
the first decision in regards to the
coin flip and I'm also gonna grab this
throw that over there so you have to
think about this give it a good name
that makes sense I'm basically going to
say that I want this to be called get R
and coin auction that's coin game is
going to ask for that and the attribute
there aren't going to be any attributes
in this situation and then the return
value is going to be a string so that is
basically what we're going to do we want
to find out heads or tails what is your
option so that's what's going on there
so I'm going to have these line up and
then there's going to be a response and
that response I'm just going to copy
this drag it down is going to be called
player's pick so there we are so that's
what's going to happen in for instance
which player one gets to decide on the
coin flip well that's going to happen a
player two because player two still over
here you know hoping to do something
someday
well player two is also going to have
to have some things go on with it and
what player 2 is going to do we're going
to actually set the coin value for it
because it doesn't have a choice so if
player 1 chooses heads well player 2 by
default is just going to get tails so
we're going to have to figure out how we
want to do that grab this here so this
guy's going to send it a message as well
and this guy's basically going to say
hey we know what your coin value is
going to be you don't have the option to
set it yourself so we're going to call
this instead set coin option and we're
going to pass in a string and then it's
not going to return anything so there we
are so that's when I happen in the
situation in which player 1 gets to
choose player 2 is going to get whatever
the default is I know this is kind of
crazy I doubt anyone's ever done a video
tutorial like this before
so now we need to divide this up into
our alternative in which player 2 is
going to get the option it's actually
going to be pretty simple basically it's
going to be the absolute opposite and
come down here later 2 is going to get
to choose and I'm not going to draw the
lifelines in here just to keep this a
little bit more simple and this is going
to be exactly the same and then the
response is going to be exactly the same
we're going to send back whatever the
pic is that's going to also have to be
built in logic wise and then this also
needs to be changed to alt for
alternative and this guy actually needs
to be copied as well and in this
situation it's going to be well what are
we going to do if the random guy chosen
was player 2 instead of player 1 and
then basically we're going to do exactly
the same thing again or layer 1 we're
gonna set its value so let's just copy
this copy paste and we're not going to
have it do anything either so there we
are so we figured out the logic behind
exactly what we're going to do based off
of which player is chosen to be the
first one in line in regards to what
happens whenever you know what coin
slipped alright so now what do we do
we've done absolutely nothing with coin
yet so let's get coin coin needs to be
flipped
you don't remember say player is offered
a prediction the coin flip the other
player gets the other coin flip option
the coin is flipped and the result is
provided so we need the coin to be
flipped so let's do that and for now I'm
going to say the coin game
is going to create the coin but we don't
know that's necessarily going to be true
but for now it makes as much sense as
anything we need a coin and it must be
flipped so do that and whenever you're
going to create a new object just send
create as a message in a sequence
diagram and there it is so coin is going
to be created that's what this guy over
here is then we have to decide exactly
what's going to happen
this guy actually goes up here because
that's the end of alternative and let's
connect these guys ok so what are we
going to do now that our coin has been
created and we're going to send it
another message our coin game is going
to send another message that is and that
is to fire another method up so what are
we going to call this method I'm going
to call it get coin option and it's
going to return a string which is going
to be either heads or tails so there we
are got that and then from that it's
going to return whatever the winning
flip was as a string so I'm going to
call this winning flip and there we go
so then what do we do ok so we know the
player 1 and we know player two's values
and we also know what the coin flip was
well the next thing that we're going to
need to do is decide who won so we're
going to do that bring this guy down
here and we're going to check if player
1 1 or whether player 2 1 and let's do
the same thing here for player 2 drag
that guy up there just so it's a little
bit easier I'm moving a little bit fast
so I'm leaving a little bit of stuff out
ok so now that we got that all set we
need to ask player 1 and player 2 if
they won so that means we're going to
call another method here and what I'm
going to call it well I'm going to call
it did player win and I'm going to pass
the winning flip to it and then the
return is actually going to be a void so
I don't need to have anything on that
I'm just going to cut it off altogether
and how do I want to respond in regards
I'm just going to actually output to
screen whether player 1 or player 2 this
is just me guessing again like I said
I'm doing this out of my head so I'm
just going to have the players
individually say yeah I won or yeah I
lost I'm not going to do anything other
than that so get this this and then
we're going to have to find out if
player 2 1 and how are we going to do
that
in exactly the same way at least that's
how I decided
I think that makes sense and it's just
going to have a canned return here and
there we are and I think that's it it's
open this guy up again okay so we can go
through this real quickly we could say
okay well what do we need to do with our
sequence diagram and did we achieve it a
player at random is going to be picked
to predict the coin flip okay flip again
this part up here with the option is
actually going to be based off of step
six so we're going to get that out of
the way right away because we have to go
through the whole entire process we have
to say a player at random is going to be
picked to decide on whether heads or
tails and which player gets to choose
first and that is going to be handled by
alt and then the player picked offers a
prediction and this player here won it
was picked and his prediction is players
picked so okay that works the other
player gets the other coin flip option
okay set coin flip option so it's going
to get the other so that means it
doesn't have a choice but we still want
it to have a choice so we're going to
send players pick in this string right
here over to player two and say hey
player one in this situation chose heads
you get tails you don't have an option
otherwise this is player two getting the
option to pick and returning it to pick
and then sending that alternative pick
over to this guy and then what do we
need to do okay the other player gets
that a coin is going to be flipped well
before our coin is flipped it needs to
be created and that's exactly what's
going on right here with this guy coin
is created then what happens coin is
flipped and the result is provided so
get coin option is going to come over to
coin and say hey what did you get and
it's going to say well I got this
winning flip I choose heads for example
and it's going to pass that back when
it's flipped the result is provided and
then a winner and loser is picked from
that and did player win is the method
it's going to call player one and
winning flip is going to be either heads
or tails whatever shot back here we're
going to pass that over to this and this
guy should actually be set up like this
technically it should be set up as void
in a situation because remember I said I
just want the players themselves to say
yeah I won yeah I lost and other than
that in this situation I'm asking player
two so that's it
so the only thing left to do now now
that I got all my logic worked out is to
create a class diagram
this is easy now and here are going to
be in my class diagrams I got those all
set up here so what am I going to need
well of course I'm going to need to have
player is going to be one of my class
diagrams and what did I say the players
are going to have in common well let's
go up here player name and coin option
okay so I've got that and I want my
fields to be private if at all possible
so I'm going to say name with a negative
there means it's private string and what
was the other thing I said coin option
and I'm also going to make that private
so coin option and it's also going to be
a string and then what methods am I
going to need well I'm going to get the
methods that I need from my sequence
diagram so what methods do we have here
get coin option is going to be one of
them ah Set coin option is going to be
another one in the situation where I
need to set the value for the coin get
random coin option is going to be one of
them as well which means that the heads
or tails is going to be chosen at random
and well so I'm just looking down here
at the players and what methods are tied
to them get coin option did player win
that's it so I need did player win let's
just select it and set coin option I'm
gonna copy that jump back over to the
class diagram paste that inside of here
and get random coin is gonna be the
other one so it's going to be what goes
from coin game over to the players
that's what I'm doing here and I'm
creating everything based off of what I
had in my sequence diagram so now I
basically just have to transpose
everything up here so get random coin
options gonna be one of them I'm also
going to have get coin option because I
don't know that I need that but like I
said I'm working this out and I'm
thinking there might be a situation that
I'm not thinking about in which I'm
going to actually need to return
whatever their option was I might be
wrong right now but I'm gonna put it in
here for now because it can't hurt and
basically it's not going to receive it
any attributes and it's going to return
a string what else do I need
set coin option well that's just right
there and I'm also going to have this B+
or public I mean set coin option and
what's it going to get passed it's going
to get whatever the opponent flipped I
think that makes most sense opponent
flip and that's going to be a string so
it's either going to receive heads or
tails whatever the opponent flipped and
it's going to choose the opposite later
on figure out the logic behind
Klee how I'm going to do that and what
else do I need well get random get Rand
coin option and it's going to return a
string and then the last thing is did
player win and it's going to be past
winning flip which is going to be a
string either heads or tails and I said
before that I decided it's not going to
do anything except just print that
information out so there you are there's
my class diagram pretty cool stuff and
you can see I hope you can see
everything's being pulled from the
sequence diagram so let's get rid of
that and I know nobody's done a tutorial
like this ever
and I'm guessing nobody's watching me
right now if you are by chance do me a
favor and say yeah I actually watched
the whole tutorial because nobody does
niche tutorials like this as far as I
know anyway okay so what other objects
are we gonna have we're gonna have a
coin so I'm going to say coin object and
what's the coin gonna do well let's look
so here's my coin over here what did it
do it's going to have a coin option set
okay so it creates get coin option so
it's going to have to have a coin option
inside of here as a field and get coin
options going to have to be something
that's returned and that's it so coin
does that makes creating that object
really easy come in here paste and so
it's going to have coin option actually
I can just delete the name part off
you're hear from the players okay so
that's that and then get coin option get
coin option it's already there and it is
done look at how easy that was so there
we are
now I also got my coin object also all
set so that's cool and let's delete that
then what's left
coin game that's it we're done so that's
pretty cool the next part is tutorial I
will actually write all the code so this
is going to be coin game and what's coin
game gonna have well that's the whole
entire thing here that's coin game right
here so coin game like I said before I
can maybe see a little bit better up
here it's going to have a player's array
and it's going to have a coin so that's
going to be field and other than that it
doesn't really do anything it's it's
calling all of this stuff it's calling
all the methods for all these other guys
so what do I really want it to do I want
coin game basically to do almost nothing
except start the process of calling all
this stuff so that's why I'm gonna have
coin game to come back down into coin
game so remember I said there's going to
be players and this is going to be a
player array and also what else is going
to be in here
the coin and it's going to be of object
type coin so there's that and those were
both gonna be public let's call this
players some play is okay and then the
last thing is gonna be--start game
