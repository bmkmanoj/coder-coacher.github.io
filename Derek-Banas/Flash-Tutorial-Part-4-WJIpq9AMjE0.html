4 of my flash cs5 tutorial today I'm
actually gonna teach you some animation
I start off real basic with a basic
bouncing ball animation but then I'm
gonna get into something that whatever
people say it for the first time it
normally amazes I'm going to show you
how to create a globe inside a flash
really really really easy first to the
bouncing ball we're gonna do here is I'm
gonna create a keyframe inside of flash
by hitting f6 and I'm gonna jump over to
the ellipse tool and I'm just gonna
create a basic circle perfect circle
you're on the screen and I'm using a
gradient on this guy and if I would want
to edit this gradient in any way I just
clicked on a gradient tool I'm moving
the gradient around here on the screen
just to make us and my realistic ball
then I'm gonna jump down to frame 30
create another keyframe by clicking on
f6 and I'm gonna take my ball I'm gonna
move it down to the bottom of the screen
might also be useful I'm gonna click on
View and rollers so that I can have
rulers here on the screen so I know
where the actual ground is here that I'm
gonna be working with then I click
anywhere between those two images I just
put there on screen and click on create
classic tween I'm gonna come over to
easing and to make the ball look more
realistic I'm gonna change this to
negative 100 so that it falls in a more
natural way now of course a ball that
just Falls like that doesn't look very
realistic so of course I'm gonna squash
it down so that it hits and actually
acts more like the ball would really
look so I'm going to go to frame 37
create another keyframe and this time
I'm going to scale and I'm using the
tool bar mainly so you can see what I'm
doing I could sit here and click on all
kinds of shortcuts but you're not really
gonna see what I'm doing so I'm gonna
make the ball sort of act in a
reasonable manner yeah I'm gonna create
another tween except amount of take the
easing up to a hundred in this case and
then I'm gonna jump over to frame 45 and
creating another keyframe and in this
circumstance I'm gonna stretch the ball
back into ball form put it back down on
there I'm in here great on a classic
tween and you can see the ball kind of
acts more like a regular ball would I'm
gonna come into easing again and make
this negative 100 you can tweak these
different things until you get exactly
what you want and then I'm gonna jump
the whole way out to frames
seventy-five create another keyframe
except in this circumstance I'm gonna
move the ball up except I'm gonna move
it not quite so high as it was before
then I'm gonna come in here creating
another tween men here
and increase the easing you can see how
it reacts as the ball falls and a pretty
reasonable way and to make it a little
bit more realistic I'm going to create
another layer drag it down underneath
and this time I'm going to go to this
first keyframe and Oval tool and on the
screen I'm going to draw a shadow here
except I'm gonna actually make it white
and move it down to a more reasonable
area and I'm gonna come to the point
right whenever the ball hits I'm gonna
create another keyframe here and then
I'm gonna come into my shadow area and
I'm gonna decrease the size on the
shadow just something much more
realistic and I'm also going to change
the color on the shadow to say gray and
this is when the ball starts to leave
the ground again create another keyframe
I'm gonna come down here create another
keyframe and I'm going to actually copy
this jump down to this keyframe they'll
eat it and go in and paste in place with
the white and then I'm just simply gonna
come in here create a simple shape Twain
great another shaped wing create another
shape tween and if I jump back to frame
1 you can see it kind of a realistic
looking ball bouncing with a shadow also
at the same time those are two different
ways to do shadows inside a flat and now
I'm gonna show you how to create a
spinning globe inside a flash so I'm
gonna need a couple extra guys here and
I'm gonna need a globe first then I'm
gonna need my land
and then I'm gonna need my mask and then
in a globe area of course I'm gonna
create a globe in the center of the
screen yeah I'm gonna make its color
it's blue
bring the gradient down in here make it
look a little bit more realistic zoom
back in and then for the land area now
I'm gonna put a keyframe down in here
also have sex remember and then for the
land I actually took a picture of the
earth that I found online and then just
converted it into vector art like I
showed you how to do in a previous
tutorial and if I get that actual
artwork here it is I'm gonna copy then
jump back over in the scene one which is
my working area click on where I want
the land up here paste it then I'm gonna
drag the land that I have here over in
front of the globe click down here at
the very bottom in frame 40 I'm gonna
click on insert keyframe just so you can
say the f6 is obviously better and then
I'm gonna move the land back across the
screen to another point in time and then
I'm gonna jump to the globe and copy it
jump up to the mask area click here edit
paste in place go to frame 40 create
another keyframe and then turn this
frame right here into a mask like I
showed you previously and then go back
in here and create a classic tween and
after I do that there's your globe
spinning globe that's all it takes to
make a really realistic looking spinning
globe inside a flash so that's how you
do basic ball bouncing animation inside
a flash and this is how you even do a
lot of 3d sort of looking things so
basically all I'm doing is blocking out
everything with that mat and you know
we're gonna be using masks a lot in
animation so you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
