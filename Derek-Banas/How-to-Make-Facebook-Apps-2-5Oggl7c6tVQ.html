of my facebook applications programming
tutorial where I will teach you how to
make Facebook applications and pages and
pretty much anything else inside of
Facebook if you didn't watch part one
definitely watch it because in part one
we built this part of the Facebook
application and now we're gonna continue
adding onto it if you remember last time
I had little icons down here which were
thumbnails for other YouTube videos and
how I want to set this up is the
person's gonna be able to click on those
icons and it's automatically going to
load the new video right up here
dynamically on the screen so let's get
into the code alright well this is where
I last left you off and right here is
where I'm pulling in the YouTube video
from before and I'm gonna start writing
another script and I'm going to explain
this as I go along
there's a lot of JavaScript in here but
it's like I said I'm gonna do my best to
make it understandable even if you don't
know how to program so what I'm gonna do
here first is to create a scripting area
and that's all you do type in stripped
and then type text/javascript and here
I'm gonna hide JavaScript if the person
doesn't have that available to them and
then I'm gonna close off this area right
like that now I'm gonna come in here I'm
gonna go grab my thumbnails well the
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
need to track where I want to put line
breaks so if I show three thumbnails on
the screen I then want to insert a line
break you're gonna see how this is done
in a second I'm going to create a
variable I'm just gonna call it insert a
break like that I'm gonna give it a
value of 1 and we're gonna see here in a
minute if you want any of the code it's
available underneath the video and it's
heavily commented then what I have to do
is create an array of videos and all
this is is a box that's going to contain
all of the codes for you to all my
YouTube videos that I want to put inside
of here okay so I get a copy of all of
those codes and if you don't know what I
mean
every video wait right after it says
youtube.com/watch question mark v is
equal to there's a code right here so I
got a copy all the codes for all the
videos that I want to insert and that's
all this is it's a whole bunch of those
codes all saved in a little box that we
call an array in programming languages
then I'm going to call document.write
which is a JavaScript function and all
its gonna do is insert a break statement
so that I can have division between the
video and where the thumbnails are going
to occur then I need to cycle through
all of these codes that I put here an
output everything on the screen that I
need for each one of those some nails to
show up I'm just gonna type in 4i in
array of videos and all this is gonna do
is it's gonna loop through all of these
guys right here and output different
things on the screen so I want to print
an image tag which is HTML with the
source being the default YouTube
thumbnail and if you didn't know this if
you wanted to get the YouTube thumbnail
for any video just type in HTTP I am G
dot youtube-dot-com forward-slash of I
forward slash and then put in like this
code for example with a forward slash
and then default JPEG and this right
here would output that guy right on the
screen so knowing that what we're gonna
do is we're just gonna cycle through all
of these different images and output
them on the screen so what are we going
to do we're gonna call document right
again which outputs whatever we say onto
the screen and we're gonna say the image
because if you want an image to show up
on the screen you have to use an image
tag in HTML then class and this is going
to be important because it's gonna allow
me to make changes whenever this guy's
clicked on this is just a name that is
given to each of those pictures and then
source is equal to what are we gonna do
we're gonna copy this part right here
copy and paste that inside of there then
when I close off this quote see there's
different quotes being used you know a
plus and we're gonna call array of
videos right and that's the name for
this array up here and then we're gonna
end it with default dot JPEG so it's
just copy that put that inside of there
and close that off except we need to put
in the double quote here that's for
source so we'll put that inside of there
and then another thing I want to do is I
want to create an alternative text
inside of this guy but the double quotes
inside of there and then leave the
single quotes which is going to
encapsulate this whole entire string
and I'm gonna say Plus and I want to
copy this again so I want this stored in
my alternative text and you're gonna see
why in a minute okay so paste that
inside of there and then say plus and
then we're going to close off that and
/this is going to close off our image
tag that we're creating and there you go
so this is going to output each one of
those individual thumbnails onto the
screen just by cycling through all of
these different codes that's what's
going on with that now what I want to do
is I want to insert a line break after
every three videos so that's this is
where the line break variable that I
used before and I'm gonna say after
every three I want to insert a line
break you just need to use these opening
and closing curly brackets anytime
you're gonna want to do that document
right right like that man I say insert a
break is equal to zero and then right
after this I'm gonna say insert a break
and whenever you put two pluses what
that does is it automatically increments
it so it's gonna set it back to its
original value of one so that's what I'm
doing here I'm setting it to zero and
then I'm setting it to one and then this
is going to continue to insert line
breaks so that all the images are
divided on two separate lines so we can
come in here and get rid of this and
then I'd also like to put some space in
between the videos and the thumbnails
and this bottom part right here that's
real easy to do right after script I'm
gonna come in here and put some
additional line breaks if we file save
that and I use a tool that is called
FileZilla it's available on every single
operating system what I'm gonna do is I
made my changes there so I'm gonna come
in here and I'm gonna upload those
changes into the directory that is on my
website and whenever I do that if I
reopen this guy and reload it you can
see now that I have images here on the
screen however currently if I click on
any of them it doesn't do anything so
what I want to do here is I want to set
it up so that when I click on these
thumbnails that the video up here is
going to automatically change sounds
like it's really hard but it's really
not I'll just jump back into our code
and the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna come up into my Style section
and I'm gonna edit those thumbnails now
down here whenever I was creating these
thumbnails you can see here I have
classes equal to
my teeth ohm which is YouTube's thumb
well if I want to edit those images
inside of here I'm going to type in YT
thumb right here which is the class name
and that's the reason why there's a
period in front of there I'm gonna close
that off and then I'm gonna come in here
and I'm gonna go margin is equal to five
pixels which is gonna give me a little
bit of space and then I'm going to say
margin and this is gonna be five pixels
every 20 pixels and I'm gonna say margin
the left is equal to twenty two pixels
so there you are I just styled those
thumbnails I'm gonna file save it jump
back into FileZilla upload it and then
reopen this guy and now you can see that
my thumbnails are distributed across the
screen but they still don't have the
capability of changing the video if I
click on them they are gonna have that
capability in a second so now what I'm
gonna do right under here where I am
defining my jQuery library inside of a
scripting area again if you're writing
JavaScript code or in this situation I'm
going to write jQuery code you have to
put it inside of script tags and what
I'm gonna say here is this is a jQuery
command it's real simple though I'm just
gonna say whenever the document or the
web pages ready or loaded I want to run
a function right inside of here then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a variable it's gonna call it
linked to you what this guy is going to
contain is the URL for YouTube any
YouTube video I'm gonna use this over
and over again I'm just saving that
inside of a variable then what I want to
say is whenever the image or the
thumbnail is clicked I want to call a
function named change the video it's
gonna change dynamically the video
that's shown on the screen on jQuery how
you do that it's put a dollar sign and
inside of quotes from you teeth um I
just showed you that a second ago and
I'm gonna say bind which in essence is
gonna say any clicks on those thumbnails
are going to resolve in a function being
called that we're gonna make here and a
half a second called changed all of it
yeah that's all that does it says
anytime a thumbnail is clicked with this
class named YT thumb and there's the
click I want to call this function then
what I need to do let's scroll this up
so you can see it better is I'm going to
create a function again and guess what
it's going to be called changed video
have to close off that function and then
I need to close off this jQuery area and
now I need to do that is I need to close
this curly bracket and I also need to
close this brace here first thing I'm
going to do it let's close the curly
bracket and then close the brace and put
a semicolon inside of there then I need
to get the alt value for the thumbnail
that was clicked remembered down here
whenever we were putting all these
thumbnails in right here alt well the
value that I'm gonna get is taken from
array if it is and this is the code that
I want to get so I want to get the code
for the video that I want to display on
the screen so I'm gonna come in here and
go VAR I'm gonna say video code is equal
to then I'm going to type in this and
all this is is a reference to the phone
nail that was clicked that's all that is
what's saying this thing that was
clicked I want you to get me the
attributes for alt or the value of alt
so I'm saying the button that was
clicked I want the alt value and I want
to store it in a variable called video
code I'm gonna create another variable
and it's gonna be called new video hello
see your location and then I'm gonna say
link to you tube which is this guy right
up here I'm building a URL that's all
I'm doing here and then I want to follow
that up with video code which is this
guy right here and building a URL and
then I want to end it with question mark
W mode is equal to trance parents I went
over with that did in the previous video
and then I need to assign the new
YouTube URL that I just created to the
source for the video that is on the
screen and that will cause it to change
dynamically now however this guy is not
a class but an ID and if you scroll down
here you see ID YT video all right
whenever you want to go in there and
make changes to something with an ID
instead of a class you put a hash symbol
in there and you type in YT video and
then if I want to change the value of
the video that's being shown again I'm
just going to type in attr or attribute
and say this time that I want to change
the source new video location and I'm
giving the source of this value that I
just created right here in this variable
and if we file say over that open up
FileZilla
upload it and then jump back over here
and reload this guy you can now see that
when any of these thumbnails are clicked
but it's automatically dynamically going
to change the video that you see up here
on the screen and also we put some space
in here so that people will be able to
comment there's a link to this page
right here if you want to go check it
out and there's a link to all the code
underneath of this video feel free to
use it in any way possible I'll be
making a ton more of these videos over
the upcoming month leave any questions
or comments below otherwise the next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
