3 of my how to make videogames tutorial
and this part of the tutorial going to
completely finish up pong that means I
am going to program the AI paddle as
well as the splash screen and user
interface and everything else that comes
up like always all the code is available
in the description underneath the video
and if you haven't seen the previous
parts of the tutorials you should watch
those otherwise you will be confused and
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so here we are once again I'm using
the windows version of unity but it
doesn't matter you can use Mac OS you
can do whatever you'd like
okay so let's make the right paddle
actually do some stuff now I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to go to
scripts and create and c-sharp scripts
and I'm going to call this AI paddle and
click on that guy and double click on it
and it's going to open up inside a
visual studio and there it is alright so
you've got to think about what I'm going
to need to do with the AI paddle well
basically its movement is all going to
be based off of the movement of the ball
so I'm going to need a reference to the
ball so there and let's just call it the
ball that works out pretty good I am
also going to want to have a default
speed for my paddle I'm going to make it
the same speed as I have for my ball
which is going to be 30 and I'm probably
going to increase that depending upon
how hard I want this paddle to be
defeated in regards to that and then
there's something else
it's called lerp and basically lerp is
going to be used to smooth out movement
over time and what I mean by that is
let's say we we have our paddle moving
in a direction and we say we want to
move it from this position to this
position and then from there to the next
position
well that could either be really jerky
or if we use something called lerp which
is a method reom see here in a minute
it is going to be a smooth transition
from one position to another position
and you're going to see what that looks
like and I'm going to have something
that I call lerp tweak which is going to
allow me to sort of tweak how smoothly
this guy or this paddle is going to move
on our
screen you know what else do I need well
I'm going to need a reference to the
paddle rigidbody because we're going to
be moving that so I'm going to go
private and rigid body 2d and I'm just
going to call that rigid body of course
and then I'm going to come down here
inside of start and initialize this guy
and I just want to get a reference to
the attached rigid body in this
situation so I'm going to go rigid body
is equal to and we use get components of
course
so get components and I know that I'm
looking for the rigid body in this
situation and there that guy is that's
basically all I need to do in regards to
that now once again since we are going
to be using rigid bodies for movement
here we want to update each time the
frame changes but we want to do it with
with good bodies that means we use sixth
update instead of regular old update and
what are we going to have to do inside
here well we are going to want to check
if the ball Y position is greater than
the paddle Y position and if so make a
change and otherwise if the ball Y
position is less than the position for
the paddle in that situation we will
move in an opposite direction so we're
just going to move our paddle tell our
AI paddle to move as the change in Y
occurs for our ball and that's how it's
going to be able to track the ball and
then send it back to us so how do we do
that I'm just going to say if the ball
make sure to spell that right the ball
and we use transform for position
information position and we specifically
are interested in the Y position because
that's how we're moving is greater than
transform and this is going to be the Y
position for our paddle well then we
want to do certain things and what
specifically do we want to do well we
want to create our vector two Direction
new vector 2 and we want to move upwards
so we're going to put 0 inside of there
because we're not moving on the X plane
and one inside of there because we are
moving on the Y plane now what we want
to do
is we want to use lerp and what it's
going to receive is two vectors and then
it's going to smooth the movement over
time so we're going to go rigid body and
velocity is equal to vector - and
there's ler I'm going to go rigidbody
whoops
make sure it's up that way velocity and
then we're going to take direction and
multiply it times speed let's move that
down to the next design and then we are
going to put our lerp tweak inside here
so this is just going to allow us to
have a way to sort of tweak how that
smooths out the movement for our paddle
and then you're going to pass in time
Delta time and whenever you use
time.deltatime what you're basically
doing is defining that you want to move
the paddle a certain distance in
reference to the game's framerate and
I'll get more into that as the tutorials
continue then what we want to do is
handle situations in which the balls Y
position is going to be less than the
paddles Y position we're basically going
to do the same type of thing here so I'm
just going to copy this and then I'm
going to say else if when I'll get rid
of the if part and just paste that in
there like that and I'll say V ball
transform position Y is less than the
transform position what in the Y
direction for our paddle and here I'm
going to change this to negative one
everything else here I believe can stay
exactly the same
duh yes indeed it can otherwise I'm
going to say else and create another
vector here direction is equal to new
vector 2 and this is going to be 0 and
call normalized on that as well even
though don't really have to and then we
will go rigidbody velocity is equal to
vector 2 thought lerp rigidbody velocity
and then we're going to pass in same
stuff let's just copy this paste that
inside of there and there we go
alright so the AI for our paddle is all
done that's all we needed to do for that
we can save it and now we can go in
there and
set up the user interface that's going
to show these scores for both of our
paddles so we're back inside of unity
once again what I want to do is go into
the hierarchy so let's go right here
and I'm going to go create and I'm going
to go UI and text that's going to create
our canvas that we will be able to have
our user interface elements show up on
now we have to select canvas and set
some things up over here so that
everything lines up real nice I'm going
to come in here for render mode and I'm
going to change that to world space I'm
going to get the event camera that's
this guy right here I'm just going to go
and grab our main camera and drag and
drop it directly inside of there right
there
dynamic pixels per units I'm going to
change that from 1 to 10 and reference
pixels per unit we'll just leave that at
100 and I'm just basically just scaling
the canvas so that it fits in on the
camera itself now I want to go in and
create my little text elements I already
created one right here so let's just
select that and I'm going to call this
left score UI and enter on that and then
after I do that I can make additional
changes to canvas so let's select canvas
once again and let's come over here and
position it I want to have my positions
all be set to zero so all this is going
to be zero I'm going to scale it down
because you can see if I scroll out here
that the canvas is bigger than my camera
area so I'm going to come in here and
scale that down so let's go and try
point oh nine and point oh nine and
point oh nine and you can see now that
its trunk itself down a lot better and
everything else can be left exactly the
same so now I want to go and get my left
score UI and when I selected it you can
see that it's way down here in the
bottom of the screen I'm going to make
sure that I have this guy up here
selected and I'm going to drag it up and
put it right above there I don't know it
looks good enough doesn't it let's go
and change the color on it well it's way
too big also so I got that selected and
let's change our width from 160 to say
like 80
and what else can we do 10 tight let's
just leave that authority that's fun
scales all won or perfectly fun the text
since this is going to be a score I'm
going to start it off with zero and
Ariel I'm going to have this be set for
bold and I'll leave that as 14 that's
perfectly fun and let's come down here
and change the color to white because my
background is black so it's not going to
show up yet to have it that way just
come in here and select a whoops select
a white not a black there we are there
we go and let's see how that shows up
and you can see that it's right there
let's go moving around a little bit more
something like that and let's increase
the size of it let's try twenty-one or
something and that looks a little bit
better and let's go and play it just to
see what happens so we don't have any
errors we can say okay so that looks
that looks good enough okay this isn't a
masterpiece game here I'm just trying to
cover as many things as possible alright
so now we got that we can come in and we
can create another text element so we're
going to come in and go down to I
selected canvas right clicked on it UI
and text and then this is going to be
write score UI so right whoops
score UI works fine where is that guy
gonna be so it's left score you can see
it's right there in the center of the
screen so let's go and grab it and move
it up say right in this area and let's
go and change some different things just
like we did previously we're going to
change the width to 80 and Heights fine
all is fine that the dust change this to
bold change this to 21 let's change this
to white so we can see it there is and
let's change the default text to zero
just like we did previously
oops don't want that to enter in there
and then we can go and look at it and
you can see that it's not in a good
position here right now so I want to
zoom in on it and make it a little bit
better I'm going to right click so I can
drag it down there with my hands and
let's just bring it in something like
that
alright so that's good enough so there
you can see that those all line up and
that's all we need to do with that guy
now what we need to do is go into ball
dot CS and update it
so that whenever the paddle or whatever
the ball hits the goals that these UI
elements are going to increase in number
okay so here is ball and you can see I
also went in there afterwards and put in
some comments way down here after all of
these other different methods I'm going
to create a function that is going to
update those UI text elements that I
just put inside of there and so it's not
gonna return anything and I'm going to
call this increase text UI score and
it's going to receive a string which is
going to be the text UI name that we
want to increase the value on it's what
I want to do is find the matching text
UI components I'm going to go VAR text
UI components is equal to and to do that
we go game object and then we say finds
and put inside of there the text UI name
and then from that we go get component
and what are we looking for we're
looking for a text element so we just
put that in there and there we go now we
have a reference to that guy let's get
rid of this there we go and that's not
text alignment let's get rid of that and
that's giving us an error because we
need to come in here and import a
library to be able to mess around with
the user interface and that's going to
be a Unity engine dot UI and now that
error is going to go away as you're
going to see here let's scroll down
there it is the error went away now we
do need to get the string that's
currently stored inside of that element
and that's going to be our current score
so we need to go and convert it from a
string into an integer so we're going to
go parse and text UI comp like that and
then call text and that's how you get
the text from a text element we are then
going to increment the score by 1
because we scored a goal and then we
will call text UI comp text and this is
how you assign a value back to a text
element you need to convert it into a
string and that's how we converted
all right so that is how we are going to
be able to go in there and edit the
scores for our games and now we need to
go up here and are we looking at here to
look for where the ball actually hits
one of the goals and that's right here
so let's just go in here and this is
where we will be editing and what do we
want to do well if it hits one of the
goals we will update one score if it's
another goal we will update a different
score so we want to find out what the
ball collided with the name of the goal
and we go game object name and if it's
equal to the left goal well in that
situation we're going to call our
function increase text UI score and
we're just going to pass in right score
UI which is what we want to increment
and then otherwise if it hits the other
one which is going to be our right goal
well then we want to call the left score
UI and have that get updated all right
so I think you got most of that all set
up looks good let's go test our programs
out forkin come up here and hit play up
why is I know why fluttering let me have
to go back and assign it so let's go and
get our right paddle there it is
and we'll go and get our AI paddle and
drag it and drop it right on there and
then we need to go and get our ball and
drag that over and drop that in there so
that the script knows what ball to track
and let's save it and run it and you can
see the AI paddle is working beautifully
and let's go and see yep sure enough we
are also scoring points all right so all
that's working out now what we need to
do is go and set up our background music
and our splash screen and everything
will be done okay so to create our
splash screen what we want to do is we
want to go into our scenes area that we
have right here and right click on that
and then we'll say create and we're
going to create a brand new scene
there's that scene and I'm going to call
this splash screen and then what I need
to do is make a script that is going to
load the main scene after a few seconds
and so to do that we're going to go into
our scripts area and right click on that
and go create c-sharp script and let's
just call this splash screen because
that's going to work perfectly fine and
that that is and then we'll double click
on it now we are click on reload and
here is splash screen and we're going to
need to go get a new library here so
we're going to go using unity engine and
scene management and this is going to
allow us to switch our scenes and what
we're going to need to have in here as
properties is the next scene that we
want to load so I'm going to go public
string scene to load and also we're
going to have another public attribute
here it's going to be the number of
seconds to wait before we load a new
scene so I'm going to call this seconds
to scene load and inside of snore inside
of start to initialize this guy I want
to basically wait a certain period of
time and then call a function and how
you do that is use a function called
invoke and you say what function you
want to call and there that is and then
you tell it how many seconds to wait
before you call that function so there
that is then we need to create this
function so open next scene and we don't
need update and this guy in this
situation so let's get rid of it and
then we're going to say avoid open next
scene and open that guy up and then
inside of it we call the scene manager
and load scene and the scene to load
alright so that's how easy it is to wait
a couple seconds and then have different
scenes open up what I did I go and
accidentally chop off one of these curly
brackets yes I think I did all right I
have that all set up and we don't have
any other errors that's all we need to
do for setting that up so let's save
that we're back over inside of unity and
we can go and change our scenes here so
when I open up my scenes and I'm
change to the splash screen just by
double-clicking on it don't have much
going on here so right click move this
towards the center and zoom in here a
little bit that all works perfectly fine
and then I am going to attach this
script that is going to change the
scenes the splash screen one two our
camera so I'm going to grab that and
drop it right there then we'll have the
scene to load and the time to wait until
it loads let's change this to time the
wait two three seconds and then this and
then what we're going to need to do for
scene to load is to put main scene
inside of there so just go in there and
type it in and there's main scene okay
so that's all set up now we can create
our user interface which is just going
to be the text that says pong on it just
by going create UI and text directly
like this we're going to set up the
canvas in exactly the same way we'll
just click on this and change this to
title or something like that or pong
title pong title that works out fun
click on canvas over here render mode is
going to be world space just like before
the camera is going to be our camera so
just grab the camera over here drop it
directly inside of there we're going to
change our position on this to zero for
all of these guys if it's perfectly fun
we're going to scale it to exactly the
same way we scaled us before so 0.09
0.09 and point oh nine and then we're
going to change dynamic pixels per units
to ten just like we did before way down
here you can see this is where pong is
we're going to drag that guy whoops
let's well what's just going here and
grab it like this we're going to grab
him put them in the center of the screen
and let's name this poem and let's go
and make this Arial bold and let's go
and make it like 30 or something and
rest that looks fun and let's play
around with the text size for pong let's
just put it like this that looks
perfectly fine and take it up to I don't
know 26 something in that area looks
pretty good
and I could play around with the size
and so forth I only need two and then
what I'm going to need to do is
basically setup
build settings and that's going to be
where I define all of my scenes and how
they load and to get to that I come over
here and I go file and then I go build
settings and then I'm going to go add
open scenes so that's going to be my
splash screen right like that and I can
close this and then I'm going to save
everything so I'm going to go file save
scenes and then I'm also going to go
file save project and then I'm going to
change to our main scene like this and
I'm going to go file build settings once
again and I could say add open scenes
and make sure the splash screen shows up
before I should be well whatever it
shows up before the main scene you don't
have to hit anything right now in
regards to build or anything it's all
going to work perfectly fine and then
I'm going to define my background music
and to do that inside of my hierarchy
once again I'm going to well I'm going
to do this in well I'm going to do this
in the splash scene splash screen scene
whatever you want to call it I'm going
to go in the hierarchy I'm going to go
create and I'm going to go audio and
then I'm going to go audio source sounds
I'm going to give it a name and I'm just
going to call it music because that's
what is so there's music and then with
that selected I'm going to go and get my
audio clip and drag it in there so
sounds and there's the techno background
music so let's grab that guy and rub it
directly inside of there and I'm going
to check on loop
there's loop right there and I'm going
to turn the volume way down so let's
play around with that get that down a
little bit lower so you don't hear it
really loud then I'm going to create
another function or another script
called continue playing music that is
going to make the music that is playing
in the main first scene it's going to
play in into the next scene whenever it
loads otherwise you don't set it up this
way then it is going to automatically
destroy the music whenever the new scene
loads so I'm going to go scripts create
C sharp scripts and I'm going to call
this guy continue playing music and
that's exactly what it's going to do
double click on that click on reload and
this guy start it up and then inside of
here I can just go into updates and
I don't want to destroy the background
music whenever a new scene loads all I
have to do is go don't destroy on load
and define this game object whoops this
game object game object and the
background music will keep playing even
though the scene changed okay so we're
going to save all and then we're going
to check our work to see how everything
worked out here we're pretty much done
and there you can see is pong you can
also hear the music whoops oh it's
working so why did the music shut off
let's go figure that out and I know what
wasn't working what I need to do is get
music inside of here and then attach
continue playing music to it so drag it
drop it right there
everything should work out fine now so
I'm going to go and let's lower the
volume a little bit on this so it's not
quite so high and let's go and play it
and you're going to see it's going to
wait a couple seconds hear the music and
then this is going to work the AI paddle
is working the scores are going to work
as you're going to see and so forth and
so on now of course I can go in there
and you know tweak this and do other
things with it you can do that for
homework or whatever and as the tutorial
continues I'm going to make more and
more advanced games so if there's any
game you'd like to see that's reasonable
that I could you know making a short
number of videos please leave those down
in the comment section and just like
always please leave your questions and
your comments below and otherwise til
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
