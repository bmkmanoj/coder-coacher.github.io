2 my free TV presentation where I give
you a bunch of reasons why you don't eat
cable like I said and showed in a
previous tutorial free digital
broadcasts look the same as cable the
best digital antenna I reviewed was the
RCA int16 50 and the best digital
receiver i reviewed was this in well sat
97 TA if you want to see the reviews and
the installation instructions please
refer to my previous tutorial but people
are asking what if I miss my show well
ABC provides between five to six
episodes from all of their current shows
cbs.com sometimes provides entire
seasons and other times just the last
episode CBS also provides access to many
older shows like dynasty star trek 90210
twin peaks and Twilight along with many
more NBC com through their site and also
on hulu provides normally the last five
to seven episodes of all of their
current shows they also have a bunch of
older shows available like Knight Rider
the 18 magnum p.i and Miami Vice among
many others Fox provides the last five
episodes for all of their current shows
a CW provides the last four to five
episodes for all their current shows us
say provides one or two episodes for
their five or six original series the
syndicated shows they broadcast like law
and order on cable are not available on
their site MTV provides just some clips
from a couple of their current and a few
of their older shows and a couple music
videos CNN provides tons of clips from
all of their shows and specials and even
have a feature in which you can pretty
much watch CNN live online where they
automatically just start dishing out all
of their current and newest videos
cartoon network provides full episodes
for a select number of their shows and
some clips also ESPN provides random
clips and headlines from their shows FX
only provides clips for some of the
original programs and there's really not
much here The Game Show Network is
pretty much
same and most of the other networks
provide little to no content all of the
news sites such as Fox News MSNBC CNBC
etc provide almost the same content as
CNN and most of them have the feature
that I mentioned with CNN where it'll
automatically just continually load all
the newest videos for you so it's pretty
much like you're watching those stations
for free so what other shows are
available Netflix is a pay to view
service that both provides online
viewing and videos through the mail
which I'm sure you're aware of I used to
get Netflix but I thought the video
selection available online was way too
limiting also because I used to write
movie reviews I've seen thousands of
movies so I wasn't too excited by the
movies that were available either online
or through the mail also there is
YouTube which you may be watching this
video on there are many extremely
popular shows that can only be found on
YouTube to see the best shows by the way
go to youtube com click on the Browse
button at the top of the screen and then
click channels and those channels with
the most views are displayed on your
screen but you may be asking yourself
and I thought every movie and show is
available for free online well yes
pretty much every television show and
movie is available online I leave it to
you whether you want a pirate or steal
other people's content but megavideo is
probably the most popular site for
finding what is called pirated content
online there are many other sites that
don't host but instead provide links to
tons of movies and TV shows probably the
biggest of these is surfthechannel.com
finally there are free software packages
that will search for pirated content
from all over the web the most popular
at this time is a tool called views and
it can be found at viacom what it does
is it searches the content of many file
sharing systems or turrents for whatever
you ask for and it also has a built-in
video player in conclusion there's
really no reason to pay 60 plus dollars
a month for cable there is a
never-ending supply of entertainment
available online and right now regular
people are creating food network type
shows and giving all that content away
for free on sites such as YouTube this
trend will most likely continue and the
consumer will
you to benefit hope you enjoyed this
presentation until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
