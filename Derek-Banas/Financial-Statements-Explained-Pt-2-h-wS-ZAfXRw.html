two of my financial statements tutorial
where I'll explain everything there is
to know about financial statements
specifically in part two I'm going to go
over a bunch of different transactions
and how they affect your balance sheet
and your income statement specifically
we're going to cover how to add earnings
week to date to retained earnings which
is very simple how to pay off the loan
that your uncle provided to you whenever
you first started your business and if
you didn't see part one you should
definitely watch part one of the
tutorial you're going to be really
confused here I'm also going to show you
how hiring someone to run your
caricature booth is going to affect you
and taking out short-term loans as well
as the two different accounting methods
that are available to increase your
retained earnings you want to do this at
the very beginning of all of your new
transactions that will occur you just
take your earnings week to date which
was from the previous changes to your
balance sheet and roll those up into
retained earnings so you can see right
here I zero this part out and this
equals out to 385 but both the
liabilities and the assets are still the
same because we really didn't change it
now if you want to pay off your uncle's
loan from the last tutorial remember
your uncle gave you $100 and he said
that he wanted the loan paid off in
approximately a year's time and he was
going to charge you 10% interest well
since you're paying it off early he's
only going to charge you 5% so what you
want to do is you want to remove one
hundred five dollars from your cash
which you can see I did right here then
remove one hundred dollars from notes
payable since you no longer owe him that
money and remember in notes payables a
long term debt that requires interest
payments and then you want to remove
that additional five dollars from your
earnings week to date which will pay off
the interest part of the loan if you
want to buy supplies everything is going
to be affected right here on the left
side of your balance sheet
meaning specifically cash and inventory
whether it's raw materials or finished
goods in this case it's going to be raw
materials so we're going to buy $200
worth of raw materials as you can see
right over here and we're going to add
that $200 here and decrease cash by that
same $200 but the right side the
liabilities per your balance sheet is
not going to be affected now from the
last tutorial we prepaid one half of our
total rent charges for our
booth at the local mall which equaled
out to 120 dollars and it was a prepaid
expense because we were not going to
actually use the benefit of this expense
immediately so we held it over until we
actually wanted to use it what happens
when you show up at the mall and that
money really truly is due plus the
additional 120 dollars for all the
rental charges at the mall well you
would want to eliminate your prepaid
expenses as you can see right here I did
you want to decrease your earnings by
the total of 240 dollars your total
rental charge which you can see I did
right over here and then you want to
decrease your total cash amount by 120
dollars and that will pay for your
rental of the booth at the mall and also
zero out your prepaid expenses that were
due and pay the additional hundred
twenty dollars it was due so that's how
that affects your balance sheet now we
come to your income statement
specifically we're going to get your
friend mark to sell and draw caricatures
for you over the weekend and you offer
to pay him $400 for his time and you can
see over here in the income statement
mark was able to earn a total of $1000
the beginning inventory was nothing but
as we saw previously we bought $200
worth of raw materials we want to put
that amount here since mark sold all of
the caricatures ending inventory is
going to be zero so we want to subtract
from one thousand our total costs of
goods sold which is going to be equal to
200 that's where that comes from to get
your gross profit of $800 and then you
can see down here all your additional
expenses being rent of $240 paying the
employee which is Mark and the interest
on the loan which accumulated from the
transaction with your uncle and that
creates a total number of expenses of
$645 which leaves you with a net profit
after cost of goods sold and total
expenses of $155 you want to then add
this profit to your cash as well as your
earnings week to date or your weekly
earnings on your balance sheet and you
can see here ad sales minus the cost for
marks time to cash which I did right
here and you want to move your net
profit amount from the previous income
statement on the previous page of $155
over here to your earnings week ending
and whenever you add all of these
numbers up you will come to $640
remember balance sheet must always
remain balanced now I'm going to go into
the two different accounting methods
that exist there is the accrual method
and what you do under the accrual method
we've actually been using the accrual
method you counts all sales and expenses
here regardless of whether cash
exchanged hands so if you made a
purchase on credit that was counted as a
purchase
even though cash was unaffected by that
as well you sold photographs to one of
your friends for fifty dollars and that
was put into accounts receivable again
cash was not affected however your
earnings were so just remember the
accrual method makes changes to your
total earnings whether money exchanges
hands or not and then you have and by
the way this was created whenever credit
was introduced into the business world
so that is where the accrual method came
from then you have the cash method here
we only count transactions if cash is
exchanged and that is the basics of the
cash method cash method is normally used
for tax benefits that it provides
because it produces artificially low
profits which means less taxes and I'm
going to give you an example here
that'll explain all this here I'm going
to give you a very specific example
we're going to sell $750 worth of total
product four hundred and twenty five
dollars which is going to be made up of
cash two hundred fifty is made of
credits I'm going to give you a
beginning inventory of $50 and we're
going to buy a hundred fifty dollars or
enough supplies to create a hundred
fifty caricatures here which is going to
give us a total of two hundred dollars
of inventory available for sale we're
going to sell out meaning our ending
inventory is going to be zero and our
total cost of goods sold is going to be
two hundred dollars and this is what it
looks like this is the accrual way of
processing all that and here is the cash
way again remember cash of 425 credits
of two hundred and fifty four hundred
twenty five whenever you add those two
numbers up though here is where the
credit is being
used and here's where the credit is
being ignored this is the cash method
again beginning inventory is not
considered cash so it is ignored in the
cash method of accounting as you can see
here you're also going to see later on
that you're not allowed to use inventory
at all in the cash method so this is
actually that is the reason why this is
really zeroed out again we purchased the
markers on credit so we do not show them
in the cash method but we do show them
on the accrual method this gives us a
total available for sale of $200 and
here a total of 105 once we subtract out
our cost of our inventory or a cost of
goods sold from the sales amount you get
a gross profit of $320 while in the
accrual method it's 550 and then you
subtract out your cost for rent on both
of these sides and you can see with the
accrual method you had a total net
profit of theorem 10 well on the cash
method you had a net profit of only
$80.00 so this is why use the cash
method tax benefits that is it it makes
it look like you have a lot less money
coming in even though if you want to
bring in new investors or get loans to
the bank it is 100% legal to show the
bank this income statement wow you would
only show the government this income
statement so that's the sort of benefits
you gain from using the cash method but
again cash method you're not allowed to
have inventory in port 3 I will continue
explaining financial statements if you
do not quite get it yet believe me
you're going to get it here there's two
more tutorials ahead and by the end
you're going to understand all the
different financial statements available
to you if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below and I also provide a link
