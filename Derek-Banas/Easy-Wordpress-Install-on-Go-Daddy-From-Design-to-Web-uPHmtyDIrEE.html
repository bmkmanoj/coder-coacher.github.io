affordable websites and search engines
will love today I'm going to show you
how to install wordpress on a godaddy
account that previously was not set up
I'll pre-installed with WordPress and
i'm going to show you the easy way to do
it and in a later video i'm going to
show you a more complicated way and that
is the way that most other domains
handle the installations of wordpress
for stuff you want to go over here to
your mind product section and click on
hosting then i want to set up WordPress
on an account this one right here I want
to go to manage account now I want to
click up here up here on your
applications now I want to click on
blogs over here on the left hand side
and I want to go down here click on
WordPress this is an up-to-date version
most up to the date as of this moment I
want to click on install now I could
read this but I choose not to maybe you
should I agree
I want to go and install wordpress on
this account right here and as you can
see here I'm completely compatible with
WordPress being that i have mysql 4.1
and version 5 so I'm definitely going to
be able to install so I click on
continue now I want to leave the
database description set as WordPress
and I want to type in a password that i
will remember choose an installation
directory will comfort and this is
telling me where the information is
going to be installed this is going to
be my base directory so you'll go
directly to my wordpress account
whenever anyone goes to new think tank
calm my administration name I believe
has ad men
asking me to retype in that information
it's going to put my email account in
here in my blog title and then you click
on finish
that is basically all there is to do I
haven't given doing daddy a request for
them to unstart work for us and they did
it and I am ready to go from that point
as soon as everything's updated which
normally takes about three to five
minutes high in the next video series i
will show you the long and hard way of
installing wordpress was really not that
long at heart thank you for your time
you have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
