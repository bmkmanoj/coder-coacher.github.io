objective-c tutorial in this one
tutorial I'm going to teach pretty much
everything you'd like to know about
objective-c and also as a side effect
I'm also going to teach a lot about how
to program in C because they are quite
similar I'm going to be programming
using Xcode but for the Windows users
out there I'll also show you exactly
what programs you need to run this code
because it will run on a Macintosh Linux
or on a Windows machine so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay so for
those people that are on Windows this is
what I suggest if you want to be able to
compile objective-c programs you would
either use Ming w org and download mingw
or go to cygwin comm and download this
and you'll be able to compile all of the
objective-c programs that I have here in
this tutorial now let's jump over and
start writing some code no like I said
I'm going to be using Xcode here but I'm
also going to be using the terminal or
command line to show you how to execute
those and I just opened up Xcode and I'm
just going to click on OSX application
and command line tool and click on next
I need to give this a name I am going to
call this objective-c Tut for tutorial
I'm going to leave Derrick baños in
there and then here you're going to put
a unique thing so I just put my website
backwards and I'm going to start off
actually by writing a C program and I'm
going to work my way towards Objective C
I'm gonna click on next and it's going
to say where do you want to save this
I'm going to say that's perfectly fine
and I'm going to open that up and
whenever you open up your file inside of
Xcode you're going to see all this stuff
what we want to do is we want to come
over here on the left side of the screen
and specifically open up main dot C that
is going to be where your code is going
to execute and like I said this is a C
program right now
now basically like I said the code in
the main function right here is what is
going to be executed any time you run
your program and if you're wondering
what these attributes are right here
whenever you would run your application
from the command line or the terminal
you would be able to pass in the number
of words being passed into this function
as well a list of those words inside
them in array and I'll demonstrate that
here in a second but first let's focus
in on exactly what printf is you've
probably seen this before
basically all print
is going to do is it's going to print
whatever words you have inside of these
double quotes and then the backslash n
is for a newline which just means skip
to the next line let's come in here and
let's use the array that could be
potentially passed inside here just see
how that works or what the heck let's
just run it and see what happens so you
can see here I just ran it and
HelloWorld shows up down there so that's
all printf does it just prints out
whatever you have here on our screen
let's delete this and let's do something
a little bit more advanced for looping
I'm sure you're aware we're very often
going to use for loops and they are
structured inside of C and Objective C
in exactly the same way first we're
going to initialize a variable and let's
just have it be I is equal to zero and
this guy right here is going to change
in some way as the for loop loops and
performs actions that you see right here
over and over and over again as long as
this condition right here remains true
so I'm going to say they want to
continue looping and we're increasing
the value of I as long as I has a value
that is less than argc this guy right
here whenever we pass an array which is
just a bunch of boxes that contain
values into the main function what this
is going to do is to allow us to iterate
through all those different things so if
you send in a sentence that was
something like I am happy I am and happy
would all go into different boxes inside
of an array and they would have a label
or index of 0 for I 1 4 a.m. and 2 for
happy and it's probably better just to
look at this or if you have programmed
you've seen this already before and this
is just shorthand notation right here
for increase the value of I by 1 that's
all that means
so we're going to do is cycle through
this array and I'm going to use print F
here again and I'm going to say Arg and
this is going to be the argument type
that we are increasing right here and
I'm going to put a percent sign followed
by D which means that we're going to be
placing inside of there an integer or a
value that does
a decimal place and a % in an S which
means I'm going to be passing in a
string and then a new line which means I
want to skip to the next line after it
does that here I'm going to then send
the value for I and put it right here
and then I'm going to get the value for
our array that's passed inside here and
put an eye there and remember like I
said everything's going to start off
with a zero n n increase a zero one two
three as you're going to see here in a
moment now I'm going to use the command
line on purpose just to execute this and
I opened up my terminal or command line
and I change the directory to where I
have all of these files listed and I'm
going to show them all right here you
can see objective-c Tut that's the name
of the project I created so let's just
jump inside of there and then you can
see the main dot C file which is the
name of the file that's over here on the
left side of the screen now if I want to
compile this program I'm just going to
go GCC main dot C and you're going to do
this on Windows as well and I'm going to
type in standard is equal to C 99 and
now if we hit LS we're going to see a
dot out is there and that is the guy
that we want to execute and to execute
that we're just going to then go dot
forward slash a dot out and then
followed by whatever you want your
string to be to pass inside of there and
here you can see there is the command
passed in here to this array as well as
each of these string values also passed
into the array and you can also see the
indexes that those are all passed into
just wanted to cover exactly what all
this stuff means you're not going to use
it very often but now you know as well
as you have an overview of exactly what
for loops look like and what printf does
but we're going to get more into that
later if you use an objective-c and you
want to get rid of this bar over here
which we're not going to be using that
much you can just click on this little
guy there and that'll go away and
likewise if you do not want the debug
area over here you could come over here
and click on this guy and that'll go
away as well and then we'll just have
our output from our application that's
running here on the screen didn't
mention it here but this includes
statement is just going to include a
whole bunch of functions that we'll be
able to use functions like printf to be
able to do all sorts of other different
things which will demonstrate here as we
go on and now I'll jump into the
different variable types that we'll be
able to use to store data
now basically there's a ton of them we
have short and I'm going to also say
exactly what we're going
have to use here if we want to transport
a value stored in this variable over
inside of here inside of the string to
be printed out and in that situation
it's going to be % day just like we had
before likewise you're also going to use
% D with integers and with Long's we're
going to be using % LD floats or values
that have a % are going to use % F
doubles which are just like floats
except they're quite large are going to
be using L F then you have characters
which we're not going to be using that
much but if you ever feel the need we're
just going to use descent sign see
there's a couple other different
datatypes but we're going to focus in
here on strux as well as pointers as the
tutorial continues and a struct is just
a custom data type which is better to
understand once you see it and a pointer
is going to hold the location of data
somewhere inside of your memory so what
we're going to do right now is I'm just
going to bounce around and create all
kinds of different things I'm going to
start off by creating a float and let's
call this F temp and whenever you're
defining the names for your variables we
usually use camel casing which just
means the lowercase letter followed by
an upper case for each individual word
you want to focus in on for your
variables such as creating a data space
for me to be able to store information
now I'm going to use printf again and
this time I'm going to allow the user to
enter information so I'm going to say
enter temp in Fahrenheit and we always
want to put a semicolon here at the end
of our statements now if I want to get
information from my user I could use
scanf and what i'm going to do here is
I'm going to define exactly what
datatype I expect which is going to be a
float that's what's going to be sent to
the user and then we're going to put and
f10 and we're going to get more into
what the and part is in a little bit but
for now just put and and a half temp
whatever the variable is now what we'll
be able to do is create another float
and this is going to be C temp which is
going to represent Celsius here I'm
going to perform a little bit of math
I'm going to say I'm going to want to
get the Fahrenheit temperature and
subtract 32 from it and divide by 1.8
and that is how we perform subtraction
as well as division and now after I
created that I could then go printf to
find exactly what I want to put here I
want to put a float and let's just say
i1
one decimal maximum after that float I'm
going to put the F right there and
degrees Celsius and we'll throw in a new
line as well and then after that of
course we have to say what we want to
the value of the variable we want to put
right there and that's going to be C
temp and if we execute that you're going
to see down here it says enter temp for
Fahrenheit and let's just say I say 70
degrees it's going to Chuck back 21
point one degrees is what that would be
in Celsius something that's also useful
to know is exactly how big of numbers we
can store in these guys basically
whenever we say something has a datatype
what we're really saying is hey computer
I want you to set aside a certain amount
of memory which we have a limited amount
of for the data type that I want to
store there now the biggest integer that
we could possibly store and let's just
call this big int is two one four seven
four eight three six four seven and what
we're going to do is we're going to
prove that that is the biggest integer
that we could possibly store and we're
going to put in an integer is what we
want to store there then we're going to
get big int and add one to it well
you're going to get a negative number
and this by the way is the absolute
smallest number you can store in an
integer so just be aware that there are
size constraints in regards to how large
of the different data types we're going
to be able to store now along is also a
whole number type however we're going to
be able to make much larger Long's as
you can see right there that's the
largest long we could possibly create
and if we want to save that and we want
to execute this you're also going to see
that that gives you a negative number
and that is the absolute smallest big
long that we'd be able to use so pretty
much every data type in one way or
another is going to have limitations but
there's outside libraries we can use
whenever we want to be able to work with
bigger numbers like that if we want to
be able to find out the absolute minimum
float that we could possibly work with
you come in here and let's put a cent
sign and E and there's actually a
constant that is going to tell us
exactly what the minimum float is
there's also a constant to show us what
the maximum float is and we can execute
that but as you see right there it
actually says undeclared identifier what
are we going to do what that basically
just means we need to include another
library and in this situation we want to
use the math library and we're also
going to want to use a float library now
if we run that you can see right here
both the most negative of floats that we
could create in our system as well as
the highest possible positive value we
could store of course those are also
going to be decimal places however it's
very important to know that whenever
we're using floats or doubles that they
lose precision after six digits and we
just come in here and demonstrate that
so let's say I go and create a float
give it the value of pi and then we'll
go point and we'll go one two three one
two three and then a one remember it
only has precision up to six digits and
then we can come in here and try to
print out seven digits of accuracy and
then go PI plus in actuality we could
also have the computer tell us straight
off
how accurate is how many digits so we'll
say precise decimal digits and have that
print out as well and remember this is a
C program but like I said anything
that's done in C we could also do an
objective-c and if we run that you see
right there one four one five nine two
six this is one four one five nine two
six even though we went in there and
added an additional digit it completely
ignored it you can see right here
precise decimal digits goes up to six so
now that we spend a lot of time on
different variable types let's get into
comparisons and being able to perform
different actions depending upon a
situation so let's create an integer
here equal to age and that would be 13
I'm going to put we can use an if
statement that's going to say if the age
is less than or equal to 6 in this
situation then and say something like
you are in kindergarten
like most other programming languages
we're also going to be able to come in
here and go else if and put in another
condition let's say age is less than or
equal to 13 and then finally as the
final condition we could say something
like you're in high school and there we
go and if we execute that you're going
to see you're in elementary shows up
here and the reason why is this is equal
to 13
so if Sande else's and elf if statements
work in C as well as Objective C in
pretty much the same way as other
programming line
images and the different comparison
operators this is a comparison operators
that are going to be available to us are
also very similar to other languages
we're going to have less than greater
than less than or equal to greater than
or equal to equal to and not equal to so
there's all the comparison operators so
what do we have in regards to logical
operators
well logical operators are basically
going to allow us to combine comparison
operators and we have and we have or and
we have not it's better to come in here
and just demonstrate what those look
like so we could do something like if
and we could say age is greater than or
equal to 12 or age is less than or equal
to 13 we could then print out something
if that indeed is true which in this
situation it is and it prints out you're
in elementary right there basically what
this is saying here is when we were used
thus illogical operator or if this is
true or if this is true then I want you
to perform whatever is inside of there
if on the other hand we decided to use
the and logical operator we come in here
and create a boolean for example now
let's go and import something up here
standard full create a boolean type I'm
going to say is elementary let me go
equals and throw in the same statement
we have before but in this situation
we're going to have and and what that's
going to say is this is going to get a
value of 1 or true if age is indeed
greater than or equal to 12 and age is
going to be less than or equal to 12 if
this isn't true and this isn't true then
we're going to get a false or a value of
0 and a boolean is it going to represent
true or false or it's going to represent
0 or 1 just like I said before so in
this situation I mean here do another
for an F statement put a D inside of
there because it's going to give us
zeros or ones like I said before and
then is elementary and you can see
indeed is an elementary and it comes
back with one or a value of true then
finally to cover the last logical
operator we have the knot statement all
the knot statements going to do is it's
going to turn truths in two falses and
falses integers or zeros and ones and
ones into zeroes and then we could do
something like not and yes indeed we
could use true here
if we execute
you're going to say it turned the treu
into a zero so those are all the
different logical operators another
thing that we have here for performing
comparisons is the ternary operator so
let's go and create another boolean
we'll say something like is High School
like this and what the ternary operator
is going to do is it's going to assign a
value depending upon the comparison so
I'm going to say if the age is greater
than 13 then I want you to assign a
value of 1 2 is high school so it's
pretty much used in comparisons in which
you're going to have either or come true
otherwise if this comparison is not true
we want to assign the value of 0 to is
high school save it and run it and
you're going to see is in high school
comes back as 0 another thing to keep in
mind is when we are using if statements
if you would come in here and create an
integer called J and give it a value of
10 or whatever this guy right here is
not going to be available outside of
here and we could prove that right now
like this and execute it and it's going
to say build failed and that just means
if a variable is created inside of an if
statement and later on if it is created
inside of a function that does not mean
it is going to be available outside of
said function or if statements or for
loops or wild loops which we're going to
get into more here in a second now let's
come in here and take a look at some
things we can do with math basically
what we're going to be able to do is
perform addition subtraction
multiplication division as well as
modulus which is actually done this way
however if you would whatever want to
put a percent sign inside of here inside
of printf you would just double it up
just like I did right there if we
execute that you're going to see exactly
how those work exactly like you thought
and if you don't know what modulus is
it's just going to return whatever the
value is of the remainder after a
division another thing you need to do
here is cast and that just means to
convert from one data type into another
so let's say we go prune up and we want
to get 3/2 is equal to and we want to
float in this situation we could do so
and here what we're going to do is we're
going to say 3 divided by and if we want
to cast the 2 into a float you just put
this inside of here if you wanted to
convert a float into an integer you
would
inside of there instead and you can see
right there now it's going to be able to
put in the decimal places and I covered
this before but if you wanted to shrink
that down to only show two decimal
places just point point two inside of
there you're going to say that it goes
and only shows two decimal places
instead of as many as it feels like
showing I think it's important here is
order of operations so let's say that we
go print out and we'll be able to see
that if we go two plus one times three
is equal to that is going to give us a
different value then if we used brackets
inside of here paste that in there
except in this situation we're going to
put these brackets around here and what
that's going to allow us to do is to
perform the addition first and then the
multiplication thereafter you can see
exactly how that works whenever we put
the brackets around it it's going to add
this first and then perform the
multiplication otherwise it's going to
perform the multiplication first and
then add 2 to it another thing it's
important to understand is shorthand
notation that is available so let's
create an integer give it a value of 0
if we would then come in here and say
something like I plus plus is equal to
and then put that in there for the
integer what this is going to do is it's
actually going to first get the value of
I currently and place that right here
and then it's going to perform the
addition afterwards otherwise if we
would instead put the plus plus right
here it's going to form the addition
first and then after do nothing so save
that run it and you can see that's
exactly what it did went through here
printed the first value of I then added
one then came down here added one and
then printed the value out on the screen
so there's little things like that can
really hang you up another thing to know
is there's also there's all kinds of
shorthand notation we also be able to go
i plus equal to and let's say 5 what
this is going to allow us to do is add 5
to whatever the value of I is so we'll
go I plus equal to 5 run that and you
can see that it printed out right there
because it has a value of 0 and there's
also going to be shorthand notation
that's going to allow us to go i minus
equal to 5 or whatever it's going to be
and we're also
to do that with multiplication as well
as division now I could go into all the
different math functions that are
available but that would take forever
basically we're going to have ceiling as
you can see right there which is going
to deal with rounding upwards floor
which is going to deal with rounding
downwards you're going to have absolute
values square root exponents I mean
there's there's tons of different things
that are available to you
logs and powers I'll just let it to you
to go and explore the different math
library and all the different things
that are available for you right there
okay so now let's take another look at
looping now we already talked about the
for loop and you can see we're just
going to initialize a variable give it a
starting value and this guy what it's
going to do is it's going to print out
odd numbers from zero to not so we just
throw in our condition once again and
that's going to be ten and we're going
to increment it again using shorthand
notation like before and then down
inside of here there's a couple other
little key words we can use here's our
if statement and we're going to say in
this if statement if I ever reaches the
value of nine what we want to do is jump
out of the loop all together how could
we do that we would just throw a break
inside there so that's one thing what's
commonly used with loops another thing
let's say that we also if we ever get to
the point where I is equal to seven and
we want to skip printing seven it's
quite easy we would just type continue
and won't continue does is jumps back up
to the top of the for loop and continues
going of course this is going to be
incremented however and then if we just
want to print out odd numbers we could
say something like if I and then use the
modulus statement with two which is if
it's an even number is going to give me
a value of zero and if it's an odd
number it's going to give me something
other than zero which means we're going
to be printing out all of our odd
numbers in that situation I'm going to
go I and then I'll go and print out the
number so there we are and then throw
our integer on there at the end and if
we run that you're going to say that it
prints out one three and five it doesn't
print out seven because whenever it hit
this
point it continued never got down to
this point and then prints out five and
it never prints out 9 because 9 jumps is
completely out of the loop so that is
how we're going to be able to use for
loops now of course there's also Wiles
as well as do-while loops with a while
loop you're normally going to create a
variable outside of the app the actual
looping structure let's just call it J
and in this situation when you say wow J
is less than or equal to 10 and we'll
say print out and we'll just say J and
pronounce the integer in this situation
there that there and then another thing
that's common with while loops is we're
going to increment our variable inside
of the while loop itself and if we run
that you're going to see that it's going
to succeed and it's going to print out 1
2 3 4 all the way through 10 then we
have the do-while loop which gets a lot
of hate for some unknown reason what a
do while loop does that's different than
a while loop is you can guarantee that
it's going to loop at least one time
every time you use a do-while loop
because it loops through whenever we say
pin do and then it checks the while part
of it so we'll say wow and let's create
something let's do like a guessing game
or something so let's say int and guess
like this come down here and we're going
to say that we're going to continue
looping through this as long as the
guess is not equal to 15 so we can go
inside of here and then inside of this
guy we could say something like printf
and guess between 0 and 20 so we're
going to say guess a number between 0
and 20 and then we're going to store
whatever they put inside of there inside
of scanf so you say D that's we're
expecting an integer in this situation
going to put and inside of here you're
going to see here in a moment why that
is needed and then whenever we run that
guy you can say guess between 0 and 24
take then 1 it's going to ask us again 4
and then if we type in 15 then it's
going to end so there's an example of a
do-while loop
that brings us to functions what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to jump up
here outside of the main air
and this is where I'm going to be
creating all my functions and basically
how why we would use functions is it's
going to allow us to both reuse as well
as better organize our code while I'm up
here I might as well also talk about
global variables a global variable is
going to be able to be accessible
meaning its value is going to be
accessible in every single function that
is inside of your file and how you
create one is let's say I have pi value
so if we have functions up here outside
of main as well as inside of main we're
going to be able to access all of those
or access all of those and another type
of version of this is what we would call
a static variable and a static variable
will only be accessible by functions
inside of this file because otherwise we
could have Global's that also would be
accessible from outside of it just by
including them like we included here as
you can see let's create a function so
I'm going to say first void what void
means is it doesn't return anything
after the application or after the
function executes we're going to be
getting a string here so we're going to
be using character star name once again
I'll show you what that means here in a
second we're using pointers and here we
have height and then we're going to have
another float which is weight these are
going to be values they're going to be
passed inside air we're going to be
getting names heights and weights all
passed inside of here and then inside of
this function we're going to do
something with these guys what we're
going to do in this situation is we're
going to get the height that they passed
in multiply that times 12 and then
multiply that times 2.54 which is going
to get us our height in centimeters and
I'm just making up stuff to do here so
we could also convert our weight to
kilograms by multiplying that times 0.45
3 5 9 2 and then we can come in here and
say printf and get it the name that was
passed inside of here centimeters tall
and way is and have two centimeters for
that kilograms and then we can just
throw in the name the new height as well
as the weight and now that we have our
function defined we can just call it and
convert data and we could pass in Derek
for example or why don't we go and do
this because I want to show you
something else name is equal to dark and
then we'll pass in name here and then
for our height we can say six point two
five and then for our weight we could
say 179 and if you save that and execute
it you're going to see down here it goes
and prints all that information out and
does all those conversions one thing
it's very important to understand is if
we would come in here and say something
like R and F and then try to print out
our height which we defined inside of
our function up above so here's height
right here and here is height right
there but height is not down here and as
you can see it has an error and if we
click on it it's going to say use of
undeclared identifier height anything is
declared in a function or an if
statement or for loop cannot be accessed
from outside of it and another thing
that's important to understand is let's
say we came up here and said name is
equal to fill and then we came down here
so up there we change the name to fill
from Derrick we wouldn't then be able to
come in here and say name and main yes
or we'd be able to do this is just not
going to give us the result that maybe
we expect so if we execute that you're
going to say that Derrick shows up even
though Phil supposedly was changed up
inside of here and the reason why is
what if we pass these values up here
we're not passing the actual variable
we're just passing a value and right
after I demonstrate our next function
we're going to create that's going to
allow us to return values versus void
which doesn't allow us to return them
I'm going to come in here and I'm going
to create a new function that's going to
return a float it's going to receive a
float and two floats and then it's going
to return none one plus num2 and we'll
be able to come down here throw printf
inside of here once again and we could
say something like five plus six is
equal to and point one get our float and
a newline and of course we could call
the sum function pass that in there and
it's going to return a value just like
we expected it would there you see five
plus six is equal to eleven so now let's
talk about pointers now
data like I said before is going to be
stored in memory at an address and
memory is just like a bunch of boxes and
the data type that you define for those
boxes is pretty much going to define how
many boxes you're going to need so if
it's a data type that is expected to be
large then you might use a long or
something along those lines
however if it's supposed to be really
tiny might use a short or even an
integer so what we're going to do is
we're just going to start off here and
dig more into pointers so let's create
an INT and let's just call it random
numb and give it a random value now if
we want to come in here and get the
address location for it just go ran numb
location we're going to be able to by
putting P inside of here for a pointer
and then to get it we have to go and
random number that's where that and is
so this guy right here is going to
return the address in memory for this
variable right here execute it and you
can see there it is a hexadecimal number
and why that's going to be valuable as
we're going to be able to store these
addresses and so forth and pass them in
functions if we would want to come in
here and store a address we're going to
both or first off we're going to use the
same data type or whatever we're going
to be storing and then we're going to
follow that up with star ad or random
num and then get the address for random
num right like that so that's important
to know if you want to store an address
make sure the data types are the same
and then put a star before it or like
that pointers are nowhere near as
complicated as they seem it's just
addresses and passing addresses and then
getting access to data inside of those
addresses we could then come in and
store a new value in that address by
referring to star ad our random number 5
4 3 2 1 for example and we just copy
this to save a little bit of time random
number value and then like this and then
change that to an integer run it and you
see right there 5 4 3 2 1 is showing up
right there so if you want to store the
address for a variable you start off
with and and whatever you want
store inside of there so this is the
address of that if you want to change
the value then if you have the address
you proceed it with a star and then
store the new value inside of there
something else that might be interesting
is even though we change the value the
memory address itself is still going to
remain the same so we can say random
number memory location for example and
in memory location we're going to be
getting a pointer and then put the +
symbol here of course if we run that
you're going to see that yes indeed the
memory address is exactly the same as it
was before ff7 AC trust me it's the same
thing even though we change the value
and if we wanted to we could also come
in here and get the total number of
bytes for our integer in this situation
so random number is and to do that you
go % + Z u and we'll get the bytes for
that and to get it you go size of and
then pass in whatever the random number
is or whatever the variable is you want
to check you can see here that that is 4
bytes now something that's really neat
is previously we're sending by value to
functions what if we want to do instead
send the actual variable and then you
would be able to change the value there
and then it would also stay true inside
of the main function so let's go and
create an integer called number 2 3 4 5
and we're going to create a function
called change number just to prove that
this works now to pass the address we're
going to go and and then number right
like that and then after we do that
we're going to verify that the number
value that we changed inside of the
change number function which we're going
to create here in a second is going to
remain the same outside of here now what
we'll do is come up here and actually
create that function it's called change
number oops
inside of here outside of the main
function and this isn't going to return
anything so we'll have it be void then
I'll have change number now if you're
going to be sent an address for a
variable you're going to put the star
inside of here instead I'm just going to
call it number again
have to be but that's what's going to be
here and then to change the value of the
address that was passed inside of here
we're going to put the star in front of
number and call it 97 whatever so
they're changed there so what we're
going to do just to verify we're going
to give number the value of one two
three four five we're then going to say
that we want to change it and then we're
going to verify that it was indeed
change and if we execute you can see
that nine eight seven six five was
indeed changed and it changed inside of
main because we passed the memory
address and not a value something else
that's really interesting inside of C
and Objective C is we're going to be
able to create struck switch I talked
about before it's basically going to
allow you to create a custom variable
with more than one data type so let's
say we wanted to create a struct and
let's call it superhero we could then
define the name so we'll say real name
like those and then another string
inside of here and as you can see that's
what these are these are character
arrays and they're using pointers as
well for wondering why they had stars
inside of them and we don't you know
wouldn't only store strings inside of
them we could store Heights and we could
store weight just make sure that you end
up with a semicolon we would be able to
come in and use this struct the
super-heroes struct and let's call it
Superman and we'd be able to assign
values very often like you might feel is
normal with dealing with objects so real
name just make sure it's the same thing
like we have right there and Superman
again equal to Superman Superman again
and we could assign his height and
Superman weight and that if we would
want to come in and use all of that data
we just assigned we could then come in
and say there's a string we want to put
is the hero feet tall and weighs %
pounds and then if we wanted to get the
values that are inside of there it's
easy we just go Superman dot real name
and Superman super name height weight
execute that and call
Kent is the hero named Superman he is
six point two five feet tall and weighs
235 pounds so that is the gist of Si and
all of the comparisons between C and
Objective C now what I'm going to do is
focus in 100% on Objective C and talk a
lot about objects and all of the
different functions available only with
Objective C okay so I'm back inside of
Xcode and this time I'm going to create
an objective-c application so we're just
going to go application command line
tool again is going to work perfectly
fine and we're going to go next
this time we'll change this to Objective
C and I'll call this effective C type
two and again just whatever your name is
and some unique identifiers click Next
where you want to store it and there you
can see everything opens up let's get
rid of this for now we are going to talk
about that in a moment and you can see
here once again we have what is called
dot M file is also also referred to as
an implementation file so there we go
but this is the main part of our
objective-c application now the
foundation part this import up here is
known as the foundation framework and
it's going to contain many fundamental
classes you're going to use your
Objective C programs and of course we're
going to be importing a whole bunch of
other classes in here real soon see down
here there's main again and we can get
rid of this stuff right here I'm going
to talk about NS log and how it differs
from print F but first off let's talk
about auto release Pole now as we create
objects memory is going to be set aside
for our application as well as our
objects and whenever those objects are
no longer going to be needed there is
going to be memory that is going to be D
allocated so that that memory will be
released for other parts of our
application an auto release pole is
going to do that for us
you also will often hear about a RC or
automatic reference counting and
basically what that does is it just
automatically for us signals for the
destruction of objects when they're no
longer needed
so that is why we're putting all that
stuff inside of Auto release pull with
our
little curly brackets now NSLog is going
to work exactly like printout for very
similar anyway you can see right here it
opened up and it printed out hello world
the only difference is it's also going
to put out like a timestamp there we're
going to be creating a lot of objects
one of them is going to be an NS string
and this is a string and it is going to
more specifically it's going to be a
string pointer and very often whenever
you are creating an object and you want
to define it but not give it any real
specific information you're going to
assign it the value of nil which means
that it is a non-existent object inside
of memory and all of these non existence
objects inside of memory are actually
going to point to the same place because
this is a pointer right here once again
in NS log you know start off with the @
sign and I could say something like
location of nil these are always going
to be the same and it's a pointer of
course and we could say something let me
just point it nothing like that and
you're going to see the location in
memory for nil and it is always going to
be the same 0 X 0 let's now come in here
and actually create a real NS string and
it's just a string that's all it is
so we'll just go in a string or a
pointer to the string in memory I guess
is what I should say and we can come in
and we go at and then we could say
something like there we go and because
NS string is actually an object it's
going to have a bunch of functions or
methods F say or refer to and now I'll
show you how to deal with them first
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
the NS string objects and show you how
to interact with objects that way and
then I'm going to show you how to make
custom objects so size of string there's
actually a method inside of the inner
string object that is going to give us
the length of the string make sure you
put that column inside of there and I
want to cast this to an integer and how
you would call the quote objects length
method or function is write like that
put it inside of brackets put the name
and then put whatever the method is you
want to call and if you do so you're
going to say size of string is 40 that
means it has 40 characters and if you
count all that up you'll find
now that that is true so that is sort of
the weird objective-c way of calling
methods but you can see how that's done
now to do something a little bit more
specific to NS strings let's say that we
wanted to come in here and get a
specific character let's say we want
character in the index of five here
we'll actually get the character there
is another method character at index
five and that's how you pass in an
attribute to a function or method inside
of objective-c colon and then whatever
you want to pass inside of it also a
little bit different from most
programming languages and you can see a
character at the index of five is H and
if you count it you're going to see that
that is indeed true you also will be
able to come in here and create a
dynamic type of string so you could say
my name is equal to and by dam dynamic I
mean that right here this is a non
dynamic it's given a value and it's
assigned here we could put in a variable
and you know dynamically generate it
however if you wanted to do that
what we'd have to do well first off
let's come in here and we'll say let's
create a string name is equal to Derrick
like that and then inside of here to
create a dynamic string we go string
with format exactly like you have right
there then after this we put at and then
we put something like - and there's
going to be the new string that we're
going to be adding inside of there and
then name right like that and that is
how you would create a dynamic string
you could test if two strings are equal
you're going to be using boolean
different type of boolean inside of here
versus what we had previously with our C
part we call this is string equal and
how we could compare whether they are
equal is is equal to string is the name
of it then you're going to put in my
name like that whatever string you want
to compare it to
and here we're saying is the quote
string equal to the my name string well
of course that's going to come back
false and just to prove that you can
still use printf see there's printf even
though we're inside of an objective-c
program or application so we can say are
strings
equal and then we get our answer right
here is string
equal if we run that you're going to say
that the answer are strings equal comes
back at zero or false if you wanted to
convert an NS string into a regular old
string you could of course do that as
well it's a little bit weird because
we're going to have to use what are
called nested messages this is known as
a message right here whenever we are
calling a function or method inside of
the object that's a method we actually
put that messages inside of messages
here I'll just show you what that looks
like can also create constants with Co
NS T and in this situation you're going
to need to do that so see a string is
equal to and we can say my name could
also change it to uppercase string if
you'd like to just throw that in there
just for the heck of it and if you
wanted to convert this into a regular
string string you would follow this with
utf-8 string like that you don't need
the uppercase string part here I just
put that in there just to do it this is
the part you need to do if you want to
convert from an NS string over into a
regular old string like we have right
here and we close that off so what this
is going to do is it's going to create
an uppercase version of this guy right
here my name and let's use printf again
and to get it will go you see a string
like that and execute it and there you
can say it made the name uppercase and
it converted in and regular string and
printed it out because that's what we
have right there you could also come in
and combine strings and we'll just go in
a string say something like hole quote
and to do that and this is what I mean
by nesting or inner messages right like
this say there's one of them and then
there's one there
so we're basically making it uppercase
and then we're converting it into a
string so then make sure you caught that
so if we want to combine strings we go
string by appending string right like
this and we could say my name so we're
going to tack my name on the end of the
quote string we could then come in and
search for strings how we do that is we
define NS range like this and we could
call this search result is equal to and
we could say whole quote and then we
have to define range of string and then
an axon and
whatever string we specifically are
looking for I'll just put my name inside
of there and this doesn't have anything
to do with whether it's uppercase or
lowercase it will find it either way
then what we could do is we could say if
search result dot location is equal to
NS not found and we could print on its
log inside of here say something like
string not found else in that situation
that means it was found and we could say
something like print up Derek is at
index Lu and is Lu long it's going to
tell me the index it's at and how much
space it's going to take up and to get
that information we go search result and
location there you can refer to
attributes or properties or variables of
the objects by using just a regular old
dot operator and then search result
again and then if you wanted to get the
length for it that's how you do that I'm
going to show you a whole bunch of these
guys like I show you every one of them
but you can see index 42 and it's five
long and there's five characters so you
can see that's true we could also come
in and replace a substring by defining
at what index to start replacing and
then how many letters to replace how
we're going to do that is within its
range again and let's just call this
range is equal to where you go NS make
range like this and we're going to start
at the 42nd character because that's
where we said it was and then we're
going to say five characters is how many
way we're on we want to replace and then
we can go constant character and let's
say we want to call this new quote is
equal to and we could go whole quote
followed by and then string by replacing
characters in range after you do this
enough you'll eventually get used to
using it there it is string by replacing
characters in range Objective C is a
little bit weird there's some strange
sort of things that wants you to do here
but either way then you type in your
range with straw
it automatically knows what you want to
put inside of there and let's just say
that I want to come forth and say I did
not create that quote but it was an
anonymous quote so we'll just put
anything on inside of there get rid of
all this stuff and then let's also
convert this into a regular strain utf-8
string like that and like that and then
we could print that out so I'm just
print four enough and new quote and
there you can say dogs have masters
while cats have staff and you can see
that it replaced my name with a non or
anonymous now one thing it is you should
know about using NS string is this is
what is called an immutable object
sounds like a big word it just basically
means that once you assign a value to it
that value can not be changed we're
going to be creating new arrays every
single time we make any type of changes
if however you wanted to have strings
that could change you're going to
instead use NS mutable strings so let's
say we wanted to create a grocery list
for example we could do so and this is
going to be an S mutable string like
this if we wanted to define the initial
capacity but knowing that it could
definitely change we're going to say
string with capacity and then give it a
value of 50 we could then append a value
to this string by just going grocery
list and append format and then put in
all the different things that we would
like to add to it we can go string like
this and then we could say something
like potato banana and pasta and that's
how we could append to our mutable
string first your list if we want to put
these values inside of here we're going
to put % and ampersand and then just
grocery lists like that make sure you
come in here and put an @ sign in there
did it data and there you can see it
printed out all of our grocery list
items we come in and delete characters
in a range also with the mutable string
we're just going to say grocery list
again and then we'll define the start
and the end so to do that delete
characters in range like this and then
this is going to be NS make range like
that and then we're going to say start
at the first and then go to 8th out
and delete all those characters we can
see here exactly how these would be
changing there you can see potato banana
pasta here we deleted the potato part
off of there could also come in and
insert a string at index
grocery list again and then we could
just go insert string that's on and we
could say Apple close that off at index
and then change that to 13 renowned our
grocery list again there you can see
apples on there now we could then also
come in and replace characters in a
range we're going to say grocery list
again replace characters in range
exactly like that we're going to say NS
make and we'll say we start at the 15th
and 5 characters long and then with
string we're going to change that to
orange and then we could print out our
grocery list again and there you can see
apples been replaced with orange and now
we're going to take a look at how arrays
work inside of objective-c so NS array
is the name for an array inside of
objective-c and let's say we have
something like office supplies we could
then define them by putting the @ symbol
like this followed by all of the
different things you want inside of here
so we'll say pencils and arrays are just
like boxes inside of boxes that all have
indexes or labels or whatever you want
to refer to the mast and we'll go paper
would then be able to access the
different values inside of these guys by
going NS log at and let's say we want
the first item inside of here we get
that first item by % + @ symbol and then
remember the first item inside of an
array is in index 0 start off by
counting to 0 and then we can come in
here and print all of them out if we'd
want again we're going to do the same
sort of similar thing that's on and off
supplies and we put the odd symbol in
error again and this time we'll just
type in office supplies no specific
anything and run that and you can see
that the first thing in our array is
pencils and you can see right here
office supplies and it's going to print
all of those out all at one time you can
of course search for items inside of
here again we'll just create a boolean
value and we'll check to say or check to
see if it contains an item to do so
office supplies of course is an object
and one of the methods inside of it is
contains object that guy right there
we'll just put inside there exactly what
we're looking for which is pencils and
then we can come in and check and souls
need pencils whatever you want to put
and D execute and you can see right here
need pencils comes back true that means
true that the pencils are inside of the
array could also get the number of items
inside of our array quite easily at
symbol and let's say we want to say
total and let's convert this into an
integer have to do that cast and then
we'll just call office supplies again
and the specific method we want is count
again comes back is two and we know that
that's true now that we know that the
pencils item is inside there might be
useful to be able to jump inside of
there and get the index of it so NS log
at index of pencils is at and then here
we're going to put Lu and this is going
to be an unsigned long that's how we do
a cast for that and then to actually get
the index we go office supplies again
followed by the method called index of
object there it is and then we just tell
it specifically what we're looking for
and in this situation that is pencils
semicolon and index of pencils is at
index zero
now again NS array by default is going
to be immutable which once again that
just means that it is not going to allow
us to change it it is going to have to
create a new array each time if you want
to create a mutable array that you can
add objects to you go announce mutable
array and let's say that we want to
create one called heroes this is NS
mutable array of course and we can
define a capacity to start off with but
like I said we can add to it ray with
capacity and let's just start this off
at five we can then easily add heroes by
just going euros add object and then we
can put in Batman or whatever you want
to put in here and we'll throw a whole
bunch of these in here we could then
easily also come in just by calling the
heroes method and insert an object
inside of here let's say hey we forgot
Superman so let's throw him inside of
there and we can say
where we want to put them at index and
let's throw them in the second index and
so automatically going to make room for
them and let's show exactly what we have
here and there you can see it printed
out all the heroes Batman Superman
Wonder Woman Kid Flash
all of them all in one place now if we
can add items of course we're going to
also want to be able to remove items we
can go heroes
remove object and let's say that we want
to remove flash we can do that we could
also remove an object at a specific
index so heroes remove object at index
like this and let's say we want to
remove whatever is an index zero there
we go just did that we could also come
in and remove objects by name so heroes
remove objects identical to and let's
say we want to remove Superman we could
then go in range and define a range for
this NS make range and change this from
zero and then change this guy to one and
then finally we could actually iterate
through our array and to do that just go
for start at zero that's the first one
while I is less than if we want to get
the number of heroes that we have heroes
count and then go and a slog and print
all of those out on the screen and of
course we can refer to them all by
whatever their indexes and there you can
see it printed out Wonder Woman and Kid
Flash
which were the only heroes left after
all the other changes we made and now
it's time for us to create our own
custom objects and to do so we're going
to come over here to our project right
there
we're going to go object right there and
then file new we're going to select Coco
class and click on next we're going to
call this guy animal and subclass of
nsobject which is the number one object
that is used for everything and click on
next and then we'll click on create and
here you're going to see it actually
created a header file and this is where
we're going to be declaring our instance
variables or properties or attributes or
whatever you want to call them as well
as the methods and then in the EM file
that is where we're going to be
implementing or writing the code for our
methods so we're going to start off in
our header file and you can see right
here the
object that it is going to is the
superclass for our animal object it's
going to inherit everything that is in
the nsobject and in the header part dot
h this guy right here that's what we're
in right now we're going to define our
attributes for our objects and these
attributes are not going to be directly
accessible however getter and setter
methods are going to be automatically
generated as long as you want them to be
and how we're going to create those well
first off let's say we want to create an
attribute that is not or a variable or
an instance variable where we want to
call it that is not going to be set of
all what we would do is go at property
and read only this is not going to have
a setter method generated for it
automatically and let's just say that
it's an n/a string and it is called name
so that is how we would create something
that could not be set from directly for
our object however instead we're not
going to do that for now instead we're
going to allow this value to be changed
now let's think about our animal and all
the other different attributes that
should have it should also have a
favorite food probably let's make that
an NS string create another one property
and a string and maybe it'll have a
custom sound that it uses let's also
create a primitive inside of here
property float weight and just remember
if it's a primitive it's not an object
that means it doesn't need the little
star inside of there which is our
pointer and then we need to define
different methods that we want to use
inside of here well every time you
create an object it is going to call an
initialization for object which is going
to set certain attributes that we might
want to set so those are automatically
generated by default for us but let's
say that we want to come in here and
define a custom way for us to initialize
our files now again remember we're in
the header section here so what we're
going to do is define what will be
returned so an instance type which is
going to be specifically an animal
instance and then we could say something
like init with name and let's say that
whenever this is created it's
automatically going to be passed a
string have to put the star there and
let's say that it's going to be possible
to create an
animal object and pass in a default
value let's go and create a couple more
methods let's say we have another method
there are objects going to have that is
not going to return anything and it's
going to be void and the negative for it
whenever we put that there that means
that this is an instance method which
means it's a method that's specific to
objects that we create of type animal if
we put a plus sign in there however that
means is a class method and a class
method will not be accessible whenever
we create an animal object we'll get
more into that here as we go on so let's
say this one is just get info it also is
not passed any attributes while this
doesn't really have much to do with an
animal I'm just trying to think of
something let's say that we want to
return a float which is going to be
weight in kilograms let's say we have a
really smart animal that can do
conversions if you wanted to create a
method here that is going to receive a
float that's how you would define that
and you could say weight in pounds is
the attribute that's going to be passed
to this method so this is going to be
the method name or the function name it
is going to return a float right here is
going to receive a float right here and
the float that it receives is going to
get the name weight in pounds we could
also set this up so that we will be able
to return a string and in this situation
go to put to the store inside of there
and let's call this one talk to me and
it is going to receive and then a string
sent to it and that NS string is going
to be whatever the person's name is and
it's going to pop out a little bit of
information directed it whatever the
person's name was let's say that you
also want to receive multiple different
parameters well this guy is going to
return an integer and we're going to
call the method here get some and it's
going to receive an integer let's call
that number one and then we can go to
the next line here and say next number
and this is going to be an integer and
number two in this next number right
here this can have any name you
or what it is what's important here is
get sums the name in the method it's
going to receive two attributes one
being number one and in the other one
being number two both of which being
integers it's going to sum them and
return those as an integer
well now what we're going to be able to
do is jump into the animal dot M file
this guy right here and implement all of
those methods that we just created now
you can see it has a reference to the
animal dot H file which is where we
defined what we want to create and here
let's say we want to throw in the
initialization file where the
constructor is it's very often called
let's do something a little bit
interesting here let's come over and
open this guy up and then let's
specifically come on down here to where
this guy is right here click on that
then down inside of here we're going to
click and we're going to go in it see
right here Objective C and NIT method
that's going to allow us to drag and
drop this over here it's automatically
going to put in all the code that we are
going to need for initialization method
that we want to create this is the
default it's called a net remember over
here we defined we also wanted to have
another init with name so one is going
to set the name if it's available and
the other one is not because it's not
available and this allows us to think
about a couple other different things
whenever we have self inside of here
self refers to the instance being
initialized because we have no idea what
the animal objects name is outside of
here so anytime this is like this and
many other programming languages so
anytime we want to refer to an instance
by itself then we would just use self
inside of here this is a call to the
superclass and it's going to perform any
initializations that are needed there
and the superclass is going to be
nsobject this guy right here and then
down inside of here what we could do is
we could say self for the object being
created we could change the name or
create a default name of no name
whenever the object is generated and
then we'll know that our animal hasn't
been assigned a name yet now what we can
do is we can create our customized and
knit and how we're going to do that is
this again is going to reserve an
instance type and that just means this
animal instance type it's just a generic
way to refer to initializations
and in this situation we have and
it with name and default name you can
see all those things automatically
popped inside of there as we define them
here see default name all this stuff
automatically jumps right in there makes
it very easy to create these methods and
here what we're basically going to do is
the same thing we have here except we're
going to actually define the name that
we want to use which in this situation
is going to be the default name that was
passed inside so default name right like
that now we need to define all the other
different methods that are going to be
needed that we defined in our header
section so let's come in and define get
info first off let's just make this
really generic let's go and it's log and
for now we're just going to have this
just be random info like that we could
then go and get our float method we're
going to create we could then go and
define our weight in kilograms method
that we went and created and
automatically generate that for us and
we're just going to take weight in
pounds I'll apply that times 0.45
3 5 we had another one this one is going
to return an integer and this is get
some say it automatically generated all
that for us here we can just go return
and then this would be number 1 plus
number 2 it comes down to one of our
last methods we defined which is talk to
me again and a string like this make
sure you put the star inside of there
and then let's define talk to me and in
this situation we're going to define ans
string which is going to be let's put a
response inside of here it's equal to in
a string string with format and here we
can say hello at symbol and then my name
so whatever name they pass inside it's
automatically going to respond as if it
knows who that person hits and we could
say return response okay so now that we
have those objects defined we can go
back into main dot m and start playing
around with them so if we want to create
a new animal object we just say animal
and let's say this first animal is dog
pointer to the dog object and we're just
going to come in here and go animal
which is defining the object type
allocate some memory for me and then
we'll call an it which is going to
initialize everything for us that's how
we create
in dog objectory in wall object we could
then call for a method to execute dog
let's try get info and that's how we
would call that just like we saw
previously we're going to want to come
up here though and import our animal dot
H file sure you do that otherwise you
won't be able to call all these if we
wanted to get a value that is stored
inside of an instance just use an S log
something like the dog's name is and
then to get the dog name will just say
dog name like that automatically that's
called a getter and they're
automatically generated that's a way to
get the name for our dog we could then
also come in and set the value set name
that's how it's done and let's say we
want to call our dog's spot no it's
going to be called spot now and run it
just to show that everything's working
here say random info printed out that's
what that method did dog's name starts
off as no name and then it gets changed
to spot so just to show you that the
objects are working here and we'll
create an animal objects we could also
call the custom in it that we generated
let's have cat is equal to to call the
custom Annette we're going to go animal
allocate memory just like we did before
except in this situation where you go
and knit with name remember we provided
that and in this situation we'll say
whiskers is the custom name and if you
don't remember that's from over here
da-da-da-da-dah c init with name so
we're calling that instead of calling
this initialize file now you don't
always need to access variables using
dog name like this we're also going to
be able to come in and get those using a
dot operator and let's just do that with
cat here the cat's name is so in sign at
and we can just say cat dot name and
then let's just call all of the other
different functions we created here just
to show that they work let's say we go
180 pounds is equal to and let's get
this converted into kilograms F kg and
once again to call for that method to
execute we just go whatever the methods
name is weight in kilograms and then we
pass in 180 there's the attribute and
there that is again we can
just to come in here and pass in
multiple attributes just to show you how
that's done so three plus five is equal
to and that's going to return an integer
and passing multiple integers or
multiple attributes we're going to go
get some call the method that we want to
pass in there and we want to pass in a
three and then the next number we're
going to pass in is a five we want to
pass in a string inside of here % @
symbol and here we'll get a dog talk to
me and then we'll pass in my name and
there you can see I executed all those
and how they all work ok so there's
multiple different ways to deal with
multiple different types of methods with
different types of attributes and
different types of return values all on
custom animal objects the other thing is
neat is we're going to be able to create
let's say another animal type let's say
a koala bear that inherits all the
attributes or variables from the animal
class as well as all of the methods
automatically and we just come in here
and right click on this and say new file
this opens up and we're going to say
source class and we're going to say next
and we'll call this koala and subclass
of this is going to be of animal and
objective-c of course nothing else is
going to change there and then just
click on create and now we have a
subclass named koala that's going to
inherit everything from our animal class
and how we know it inherited everything
from the animal class is there it is
right there that is how we know that
it's inheriting all that stuff now in
the header file for koala we can come in
here and override methods for example so
let's keep this nice and short and a
string and let's say that I want to
overwrite the talk to me I could
overwrite everything if I want keep
everything the same here in our header
file then jump into this koala port
right here again and a string and the
method I want to override jump into here
and just get this just to save some time
talk to me paste that in there and we'll
say hello bah dah dah dah dah says and
then we'll get the koalas name to show
up inside of there and how we can do
that again is self dot name that's how
we refer to that so we went and
right at that guy we could then create
custom methods that are only available
inside of koala jump over into our
header section and let's say void form
trick let's call it that and it's not
going to receive any attributes and then
we'll create another one void and we'll
call this one make sound just to show
that we can create them all of these
guys save that jump over into koala and
then what's define all those so - void
form trick there that is I'm going to
find what it's going to do slog and
we'll say that we want to put the name
of qual inside of here whatever that's
going to be forms a handstand self name
there it is and then we'll define also
other guy and that's make sound and a
slog they'll just say he owns self name
now we jump back over into main and make
our quality ice stuff so it's an object
it's koala object and it is a reference
it's an object let's call it herbie is
equal to and it's going to be koala
object going to allocate it some memory
say we want to initialize it by name but
make sure we come up here and actually
reference the koala header file there it
is
and then pass inside of here it's
calling kirby so now our koala has a
name and then we can demonstrate our
overridden method that we created here
and we can call our herbie method talk
to me and then pass inside of it my name
see how that changes and actually i
think i'm going to take those other
methods i created in a koala and
demonstrate something else so and if we
run up unexpected da-da-da-dah up make
sure we put an app symbol right there
whoops make sure we take that out of
there
and execute it there you can see hello
Derek and hello Derek sorcerer B so
that's how we overrode those and how
they work now categories are going to
allow us to split our class into many
different files and at the same time
keep our file size is manageable and how
we're going to create a category is once
again come up here right click on this
file new and then we're going to click
on Objective C file not Co class
Objective C file click on next then down
here click on category and I'm going to
call this exam and the class specific to
it is going to be animal and click on
next and then click on create it's going
to create animal plus exam dot H now in
our header file that we have here for
animal exam at run time we're going to
be able to add methods as part of the
animal class and what this one's going
to do let's create something that's a
boolean and call it checked by that and
create another one say it returns
nothing and get shots then we'll be able
to save that jump over into the
implementation file here dot m and
implement these guys so let's go and
create a boolean check by that and what
it's going to do just keep it simple
we'll do return 1 for true save by
default it is checked by the vet and
we'll go and find the other guy get
shots and s log and we'll say whenever
this calls it's automatically going to
say that whatever the name of the object
is got it shots there you go real simple
now well we'll be able to do jump back
over into main I like this and let's
continue working with her B we could
then go and it's log at did since I'm at
check if her we got it shots of course
we could have that set to a variable and
turn it on turn it off and get her B's
name followed by her be checked by that
and then also her be get shots and call
that method and then get that to work
all we're going to need to do is import
that category and that's just animal
exam automatically is going to place
that inside of there and all that's
going to work and there you can say did
herby receive shots yes her we got it
shots
other thing we can do is allow files to
import a category but at the same time
block access unless the class is a
subclass so we're not going to be able
to work with anything unless it is a
subclass of this class that we're
working with so we're going to come over
here right click on this file new file
again source this is going to be an
objective-c file click on next and I'm
going to call this protected this is
going to be a category as well actually
it's called this vet category type
animal click Next
great or that is jump over here to the
header file and then instead of that
this is going to be called protected
let's define our method we want to
create here void and then let's call it
get exam results something would be
maybe private I'm able to jump down here
and implement that get exam results and
it's log and we'll just put something
exam is fine doesn't matter no what we
can do is jump back over into animal
implementation area right here and then
let's say something like in the get info
area if we wanted to specifically call
that we could just very easily come in
here and go self get exam results of
course we have to come in here and
import this there's that animal that and
then get exam results close that off and
that's always it was to add that
protected method that of course we're
going to call that we could just come in
here and get a dog and get info of
course and that would automatically call
that as you can see exam is fine print
it out there on the screen now just to
say I've covered pretty much everything
I'm also going to cover protocols and I
started doing that a little bit with
Herbie the Koala and we're just going to
come in here again right click on this
and say new file accept and Objective C
file is fine and we click on next and
this is going to be a protocol right
here and I'm going to call this beauty
contest
and a protocol is just going to be a
bunch of properties and methods that any
class is going to be able to implement
and you can see it doesn't have any
animal class or any other reference to a
class click on create and here is beauty
contest which is going to have just the
header file part of it
and here we're just going to define the
methods and then stick them in any place
that we feel like putting them and I
like I said I already started doing this
with the koala forum
trick there it is so generated that jump
over into the koala and you can see I
didn't need to define it right here I
just need to come in and define that I
want it right here
beauty contest there it is and now I can
jump directly down into the
implementation and define perform trick
and look cute or whatever I wanted to
put inside of that so let's come in here
and go look cute where's Boyd cute and
we'll say Herbie acts super cute or at
least that's the way it works because
its name is Herbie so and name and
that's in the Koala implementation file
and if we jump back into main we can see
that we can just go like this
Herbie look cute that's going to call
that and then Herbie form trick and then
to implement that you're just going to
have to go over into your header section
right here and add that in as well so
beauty contests like this close that off
if I'll save that jump over into main
execute it and there he is
Herbie act super cute Herbie performs a
handstand really easy to slide those
methods in right there now to make sure
I cover just about everything I'm going
to go over a block around an anonymous
function in objective-c how you would
create one of those is you would define
whatever your types going to be we're
going to say at say I want to create an
anonymous function called get area then
we're going to define exactly what is
passed into it so the height as well as
the width are going to be passed inside
of it you're then going to assign the
block to get area how you do that
there's that carrot symbol float then
we're going to say float with float
height to find exactly what it is going
to do it's going to return the width
times the height to get our area and
then make sure you put a semicolon at
the end of that then you're going to be
able to come in here and just use it so
we say something like at area of 3 wit
and 50 poit and that's going to be a
float and then we'll just be able to go
get area just like any other thing by
passing in 3 and 50 and you can see
there it worked so that's how we create
blocks enums are going to be used
whenever you want to define a custom
variable with a set of constants and how
you do that is just go enum let's say we
want to do like
we ratings or something like that could
come in here and go poor is equal to one
okay
is equal to two I don't know great is
equal to five so forth and so on and
then if you wanted to assign those
values you go enum ratings which is the
name of it and matrix rating or for them
movie The Matrix and you could just
define great inside of there and you
just go matrix since on you matrix
writing like that up make sure you put a
semicolon right there and there you can
see matrix 5 shows up automatically then
the final thing I'm going to talk about
is dynamic binding and this is basically
going to allow us to create objects
subclasses that all have a superclass
type that they would share ok and to
demonstrate this what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go into my animal header
file this guy right here and I'm going
to initialize a new method and this is
going to be void and it's going to be
called make sound save that then jump
over here into my implementation file
and fun it right like this this is very
similar to what we call polymorphism
just allows us to refer to a group using
the superclass and let's say that it
just goes ger the default animal sound
is go let's go then and create another
object so file file new and let's call
this this is going to be a coca class
next let's call this dog again some
class of animal objective-c click on
next yes create it and then inside of
the dog file well I want to jump over
into the header section first inside of
this we're going to well actually I
don't have to do anything it's
automatically is going to get the make
sound method of course however I'm going
to override it and I'm going to say Boyd
make sound this is in the implementation
file of course and it's logged and here
I'm going to say something different so
we'll just say blank says wolf and then
refer to the dog's name over in the
koala did it tada what yes I
automatically I went and put make sound
inside here so the koala and the dog are
both going to
totally different sounds that they make
and that's going to allow me to come in
here and demonstrate dynamic binding so
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
dog let's call him Grover equal to dog
allocate some memory let's initialize
him with name also let's come in here
and import dog H there's lies with name
and his name is going to be Grover
now what I can do is create an array and
refer to everything as animals and SRA
allocate some memory and then I'm going
to knit with objects in this situation
and the objects I'm going to put inside
of it is going to be Herbie and Grover
that last part being nil now I can
create some generic IDs which are just
pointers to any type of object type
they're as generic as anything could
ever be I'll just refer to them as
object 1 and we'll say that these
animals just what I'm referring and I'll
say object at indexes and I'm just going
to put 0 you can see I'm working with
the most generic type of object possible
and I'm throwing those into this array
and we call this object to animals
object there is the second object in
that tier and now I can just come in and
go object 1 make sound and object to
make sound and it's automatically going
to call the correct one well change this
to index and when you execute it you can
see automatically Herbie says yawn and
Grover says wolf so there you go guys
I'm going to also include a couple other
different things on my website that I
didn't cover here but I covered so many
different things just when to cover as
much as humanly possible please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
