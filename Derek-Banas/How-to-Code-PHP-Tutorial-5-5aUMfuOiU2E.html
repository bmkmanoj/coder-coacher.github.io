5 of my how to code PHP tutorial today
I'm going to cover cookies and sessions
there are two main ways for you to store
information on your visitors and this
will help you create a more dynamic
website cookies are used to store
information on the visitors computer
much like you do with the raise cookies
are stored as a key value pair many
people are afraid of cookies because
they think those websites that use them
are tracking their every move for this
reason it may be hard to serve up the
dynamic content that you want there are
workarounds for those visitors that have
cookies shut off and I'll show you those
soon
you must be warned that cookies must be
sent before any other HTML code or an
error will be thrown so make sure your
PHP code is the first thing the browser
sees before any HTML code web sites have
even been banned if they make this
common error
don't worry I'll show you exactly how to
set them you create a cookie with the
setcookie function its general structure
is set cookie obviously followed by
bracket whatever you want your variable
name to be the value you want to assign
to it if you want to assign an
expiration date and a whole bunch of
other things which I'll go too thorough
here in a minute you could create a
cookie by just defining a name and a
value like this example here where I
define the value George to the variable
first name expiration tells the browser
how long you want the cookie to exist if
not set the cookie will be stored until
the browser is closed so you probably
want to set this value if you entered
the following as a value of expiration
being the function time followed by the
plus sign of 3600 the cookie will exist
for exactly one day 60 seconds times 60
minutes path and domain to find who can
access the cookie data this limits other
websites from seeing your cookies
security allows you to set that the
cookie data should only be sent over a
secure HTTPS connection if the value of
one is set then a secure connection is
required you can set as many cookies as
you like with repeated calls to the
setcookie function the variable name in
this case doesn't
start with a dollar sign like other PHP
variables but it also cannot contain
spaces and is case-sensitive it is
common to create cookies that reference
to visitors name user ID products they
have that cart email and etc I leave it
for you to decide what you'll store in
your cookies you must however remember
these rules cookies can only contain
four kilobytes of data and you can only
store 20 cookies total on a visitor's
computer after you create a cookie it's
easy to check if the visitor has any
cookies saved on their computer when
they return just check for cookies with
a reference to the key name you set with
the setcookie function this statement
will check to see if you stored a
variable key on the visitors computer if
you find it perform whatever actions you
like if not make sure you provide
another appropriate action such as set
of cookie after you know the cookie has
been set you'll be able to retrieve the
value by referencing the cookie array
all of the cookies you said are
available by calling the dollar sign
followed by an underscore and cookie in
uppercase letters followed by whatever
variable you assign there just place the
name of the key in that cookie array and
you can do whatever you'd like with that
information to delete a cookie just set
the value to nothing with a setcookie
function like this and that's just about
all there is know about cookies now I'll
explain how to use sessions in PHP the
difference between cookies and sessions
is that visitor information is stored on
your server with sessions you can store
an identification number in a cookie or
you can use sessions without cookies by
sending a session ID from page to page
I'll explain all this with a few
examples now I'll describe some
advantages and disadvantages of sessions
vs. cookies advantages of sessions they
allow you to store a lot more
information than cookies they are more
secure because the information is stored
on your server if the visitor has
cookies shut off you can still gather
information
however the disadvantages our cookies
are easier to work with and using
cookies are slightly quicker you start a
session by calling the function sessions
start at the beginning of the file just
like you did with cookie when this
function is called it will send a cookie
with the session ID called the phpsessid
the idea will be a series of 32 numbers
and characters you create a key value
pair with statements like this here I'm
creating the
or variable and assigning the value of
Paul what a visitor returns to your site
you can check for the setcookie and then
access those variables previously stored
on your server here is how you would
check for the cookie if this statement
comes back is true you can perform your
series of actions with the session you
would then access those stored values by
calling for the values stored in the
session array here's an example where
I'm going to use the function a cow to
first off with the string the first name
it is followed by whatever value is
stored in the variable name first there
are three PHP functions you can use to
eliminate session data a function unset
to delete a single variable like this
you delete every session variable with
the following statement here and finally
the function in session destroy' will
eliminate all session data altogether
the main benefit you will gain from
using sessions is that you can store
information on your visitors even if
they have cookies set off like I noted
before you can accomplish this task by
passing the session ID from page to page
the value you append to the end of the
URL is called a session ID and is stored
in a constant variable you define in
your code with the name s ID to use
sessions in this way you can't use
cookies and also you have to tell the
browser not to use cookies with this
statement that I have right here also
when your user clicks a link or you call
for the user to go to a new page append
the S ID at the end of the URL you can
access the variables in the same way you
did before when you use cookies and
sessions together and that is the end of
part five of my how to code PHP tutorial
in the future tutorials I'm going to
actually take you through real working
PHP code that accesses databases and
does a whole bunch of tricks that people
use all the time the first block of code
I'm gonna cover is how to create login
scripts until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
