3 of my angularjs tutorial in this part
of the tutorial I'm going to cover JQ
light as well as how we can modify HTML
elements how to add/remove replace HTML
elements dynamically as well as custom
directives and transclusion if you
haven't watched part 1 &amp;amp; 2 of this
tutorial series you absolutely have to
otherwise you could become quite
confused and like always all the code is
available in the description underneath
the video and you should take a look at
it and I have a lot to do so let's get
into it okay just like always over here
I have the atom text editor and on the
right side of the screen I have Chrome
and I'm saving all of this information
on a web server so let's just start
writing some code now down inside of
here I already created the controller
and inside of that I am going to define
my directive and I'm going to call this
JQ l - directive and just keep it quite
simple then I'm going to input some
information in here that I'll be able to
play around with so I can put some
information on some baseball players so
I just have everything set up as a list
and then another list underneath of that
and you can see exactly how all of that
is structured if you want to pause your
screen or like I said otherwise I have a
link to the code in the description and
of course it's all free and I could save
that and you can see exactly how that's
all structured there on your screen and
now I'm going to jump over into my exam
9gs file the one I'm working with here
is angular Tut 9 HTML and just because
there's been some questions about it
this is the basic structure of all the
folders I have a top folder it's called
angular Tut all the HTML files are
inside of there then inside of there I
have a directory called Jas and all my
JavaScript files are inside of that so
hopefully that clears up anything you
might have a question about now over in
my exam 9 J's file I'm going to start
adding in some JavaScript code to play
around with this stuff first thing I'm
going to do
is called directive and I'm going to
refer to jaql directive and just a
review from previous part of the
tutorial whenever you use any uppercase
letters like I have right here with jql
directive over here in the HTML you are
instead going to make that lowercase and
then put a dash inside of there instead
so now let's just continue writing all
this I'm now going to define function
and then I'm going to say return
function and this is going to receive
the scope as well as the element that is
tied to this directive as well as any
attributes for set element then what I
want to do here is show you how to get
all of the children of an element that
is tied to our directive what we could
do is we could say players is equal to
element children we're going to be able
to play around all these guys and what I
mean by that is I'm going to tie into
all of the children elements of the
directive and what I mean by that is
every single thing that lies between
this opening tag right here and this
closing tag down here now I'm going to
come in and create another variable
called list of players and just give it
no value here to start off and now I'm
going to cycle through all of the
different child elements that I have
inside of it so just so is equal to zero
we're going to continue to cycle as long
as elements exist and of course I have
to increment I now I'm going to come in
and mess around and modify some of these
HTML elements so for example I could say
something like if players and target an
individual player with an index here and
then I could check if the text for that
element is going to be equal to Barry
Bonds for example if so I can then edit
that element so we could say something
like we want to target that element that
matches for Barry Bonds and I could
change the CSS color for it so let's
just go color and let's make it red I
could also come in
add an attribute to it in exactly the
same way by going attr
for attribute and then let's say that we
want to create an attribute called
number with the value of 25 we can do
that I'm then going to come down here
and also define my controller and it's
called main controller and I could just
say function and let's say that we want
the scope and then we could just leave
that open and have it not do anything
and if we reload this you're going to
see the Barry Bonds is now red and it's
also going to have the attribute of 25
which will actually verify here in a
second let's jump over here you're going
to see that I have a class defined here
called Thicke and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you how to add that
class to an element as well so we're
just going to get outside of our if
statement and we're going to instead
apply a class to the Hank Aaron element
so we're going to do the same thing here
we're going to say players and we're
going to check if the text in this
situation is going to be equal to Hank
Aaron and if it is I'm going to here
apply add a class that I define the
Thicke class and I just do that with add
class and then specifically say Thicke
reload it now you can see that that's in
bold Hank Aaron right there
and basically what EQ is going to do for
us is return an element at a given index
if you didn't catch that
and of course text is going to return
the text that is inside of that element
now let's say I want to list all of the
children elements that I have inside of
here let's just go right outside of the
list itself and let's just define a
little title here so we'll say children
in list and then here I'm going to
create a span where I'm going to list
all those children so I'm going to give
it an idea of children list and then
close off that span and throw a couple
break statements in now bounce back over
here and we're still inside of the for
loop part but we don't want to be inside
of the if part of that and now what we
can do is say list of players and take
each of the individual players or
children in this situation it's going to
also contain all the averages and
homeruns and on-base percentage and all
that other information that I have there
because they are all children and then
let's say that I want to separate all of
them with a call
and that will the semicolon of course
now what I'm going to need to do is come
in and select an element and in this
situation I'm going to select by ID
because that is how I defined a children
list right there and then I'm going to
add in the list of players that I just
defined right here
so how we come in and select an element
is we can say angular element and then
go document query selector and then find
the ID that we were searching for make
sure we put it inside of quotes though
and that's going to be children list and
then change the text inside of there I
can just go list of players like that
and if we reload you can see right there
I have children in list and then I have
a list of all those different individual
children elements all separated with
commas let's go and add a little bit
more HTML to this guy so that we can
list some more information
we added Barry Bonds number two as an
attribute so let's say we want to go in
there and grab an attribute we can do
that so we could just say Barry's number
and again we'll just target a span put
that information inside of it give it an
ID so we have a way of actually
accessing it now let's just call this
Barry's number and it's also come in
here and check to see if the Hank Aaron
name here is in bold just as another
thing to check so we'll say something
like is Hank bold and it will just name
this Hank bold and let's also come in
here and access and display Barry's ID
and we'll just call this Barry ID and
then I'm also going to show you how to
use toggle so I'm going to throw a
button inside of here and I'm add a
click event to this guy so that whenever
it is clicked on it is going to toggle
between being bold and unbold
so we'll just call this toggle bold and
then close off that button and I think
that's all we're going to need to do so
let's jump back over into the JavaScript
now up here we added an attribute for
number and we added a value of 25 and of
course we want to display that and let's
reload this again see right there is
Barry's number so what I want to do is
instead come in here and
put the number value inside of there so
I'm going to go first and get the value
of an attribute I'm going to call this
Barry's num and to get a value of an
attribute you go angular element
document quarry selector again and here
specifically I'm going to target the ID
of Barry and then I want to get the
attribute that is associated with that
who has the name of number okay so now I
got the attribute now it's a matter of
putting it right here inside of that
span that we created a second ago so
we're gonna be doing it's pretty much
the same exact thing here most of just
coffee this he's that inside of there
now instead this is going to be Barry's
number varies num that's what I'm going
to be targeting in this situation and
then if I want to change the text for
that guy
I can just go text and then put Barry's
number inside of it which is the
attribute that I just grabbed right
there and I bounced over here and the ID
for this is actually Barry's number so
let's make sure that we have that side
of there where we go we got Barry's
number inside of there and if we reload
you can now see the 25 showed up let's
enlarge not just so you can see it a
little bit better it's a little bit
messy but you can see it better okay so
that's how to get attribute values and
set attribute values and so forth and so
on
let's try removing a class so in this
situation we added the Thicke class to
the Hank Aaron name right here so now
let's go in and remove it we're going to
do is come in and target that specific
ID so that's Hank and then we just say
remove class just like you might have
thought and the class that I want to
remove from it and reload and now you
can see that that class no longer has an
effect on it we also have this guy down
here where it says is Hank bold we can
go in and check to see if an element has
a class on it so we'll say something
like is Hank bold and find out
specifically we'll go angular element
document query selector again here we're
targeting hank once again and here we're
going to change this to has class make
sure you put that little quote inside of
there so now we have that now let's go
in and put that information right here
which is going to be true or false and
the name of the span there that we're
going to be inputting information into
is Hank bold and then here we're just
to come in and go text and then we'll
put is Hank bold inside of there
and you could say that false shows up
and the reason why it's false is because
we took that class off of it so there
that is we're also going to be able to
come in and get the value of a property
as well as set a property so let's go
farm bury ID is equal to angular element
again query selector except in this
situation we're going to be searching
for bury instead that ID and if we want
to get property for it we just go prop
and then we'll put ID which is the
property we want to get ahold of and
then we can come in and set that guy so
bury ID which is going to go exactly
where you think over in the HTML bury ID
and then we'll just change its to text
and then we'll change this to bury ID
which is coming from this guy right here
and you can see the Barry shows up right
there let's come down here inside of the
controller and I'll show you exactly how
to toggle a class so we can just go
scope dot unbold which was the name that
I gave this guy over here this guy right
here button unbold that's the method
we're going to be calling on this and
just like we did previously we can say
function and then angular element
document kori and we're going to be
targeting Hank again in this situation
and then instead of saying remove class
in this situation we'll say toggle class
thick everything works out perfect
reload that you can see there it's
unbolted and if I click on this now you
can see it's bold let's click on it
again you're going to see that it's
unbolted there's a whole bunch of
different ways to play around and change
different HTML elements now I'm going to
create some custom directives and as
well cover how to append prepend remove
and replace HTML elements okay so now
I'm going to be an angular tut 10 dot
HTML and exam 10 J s and I already have
controller here this is the main
controller and then I have to come in
and define my directive so I'm going to
go div and we go BB player list and the
directive over in the JavaScript is
going to be BB player list as you're
gonna see here in a second you must have
just cut that out of there and I'm gonna
say that this is going to be equal to BB
players
then here what I'm going to do is define
the item to get from the array and I'm
going to do that by saving it in the
attribute named array item and
specifically going to get name and then
I'm going to throw a filter inside of
here just so I can demonstrate something
else will say upper case filter and
close off that div and that's all we're
going to do HTML wise now we're going to
do a whole bunch more over in the
JavaScript good see I already went in
here and threw in some information so we
can play around with that once again
we're going to be able to create this
directive you can see right there it's
exactly like I showed you in the HTML
and we're going to do it once again with
the module directive method and we're
just going to pass in the name of the
directive and here is our factory
function first going to come in here and
this is going to be the link function
and it's going to link the HTML with the
directive as well as the data in our
scope and like I said before it's going
to be receiving the scope as well as the
element that is tied to our directive as
well as any attributes that are tied to
that specific element now if we want to
get the data by passing the value
associated with our directive to our
scope object we can save our data is
equal to scope attributes and BB layer
list and you can see right here I have
DB players and over here you can see
exactly the same thing this is what I
want DB players is what I want all right
if I wanted to be careful I could come
in and verify that I have an array of
data even though I know I do and just
try and show you a whole bunch of
different things so you could say is
this an array and pass in data for that
and if that comes true what I could do
is get the item to display from the
array item attribute array item is equal
to attributes array item I can go and go
list element is equal to and here we're
going to do is angular element is going
to wrap the Dom element as a jQuery
element and we do that by going
angular element and ul and if it bounced
back over here again so it's basically
going to create an unordered list with
all this data listed inside of it and
it's basically the UL element anyway is
going to be the container in which all
of my li elements are going to be
assigned to it so to assign those Li
elements to the unordered list I just go
list element and then cycle through all
those different elements until
everything is all full so I'll continue
to cycle through them as long as I have
information to put inside of it and then
we just need to append that information
so angular element once again and here
we're going to be putting a list element
inside of it let's jump down to the next
line and say text and scope and eval and
eval is going to eliminate the filter
that I have over here in the HTML that's
why through uppercase inside of there
just to show you how to get rid of a
filter if you would have one inside of
there and it's always a good idea
because you never know what might happen
and then we'll go array item and data
member we're cycling through all that
data and that's how we can create our
list elements now let's say basically
what we did was it created an unordered
list with all these different list
elements inside of it make sure we go up
here and close off that list element
right there
and now if we reload this you can see
that all of our player names are inside
of there now let's say that we want to
come in here just so we know more about
how to append and prepend and add and
remove different elements let's say we
want to add a span after our list that
we have here to do so we would just go
list element and after angular element
and then we can put inside here exactly
what we want to show up inside of there
so we can just create a span and let's
say we have the ID for this as maize
let's just have this be single quotes so
we don't have to back slash anything so
single quotes then close that off and
then throw text inside of that span
which is going to be equal to Willie
Mays close off that parentheses get rid
of that extra one and reload this and
now you can see Willie Mays shows up
right there so that's how we can put an
element after another element let's say
we want to add another span before our
list or
other element doesn't matter what it is
doesn't have to be a span in that
situation we would use prepend an
angular element once again and here we
can put whatever we want inside of there
so span and let's give this an ID which
is equal to cob close that guy off and
then we can go and put our text that we
want inside of there and we'll just say
Ty Cobb another famous baseball player
if you never heard of them it's gonna go
right up there we can reload and you can
see there it is we could also come in
and remove elements to do that you just
go angular all this can be dynamic I'm
just sort of trying to keep everything
nice and tight here to do so you just go
to document and queryselector once again
and then you just say what you want to
target we're going to target by ID here
because that's what works and we'll put
maize inside of there and then to remove
the may is span that we have inside of
there we just say remove and with the
maize disappeared sadly enough could
also come in and replace an element so
let's say let's go Gehrig and let's
create a span inside here just show
another different way of doing things
give this the ID of Gehrig and then put
Lou Gehrig inside of here and then close
off that span and now we'll go far and
it will say something like replacement
is equal to angular element and here we
can use Gehrig HTML instead if we'd like
and then go angular element document
query selector and we'll say we want to
replace the cob element with our Gehrig
element that we just created we could
say replace with our replacement and now
Lou Gehrig shows up there instead of Ty
Cobb so that is how we can create both a
custom directive as well as how to
append prepend remove and replace HTML
elements and now we'll take another look
at how we can make another different
custom directive okay so now we're in
angular Tut eleven dot HTML and exam
eleven is I'm going to keep this very
simple we have our main controller right
here and then I'm going to have player
and name is going to be equal to Barry
Bonds and then close that off and what
this guy is going to do is pull in data
based off of the value we have set
here for an attribute so if we want
Barry Bonds information it's going to go
in there if we want some other players
information it's going to go in there
instead and with the directive it is
going to come in here and completely
replace this guy and instead put in the
element that we define over in RJ's code
so I automatically went in here and
threw in some different information that
we'll be able to pull in and here what
I'm going to do is create a directive
object so I'm going to contain all this
information so it's just going to be
blank to start off now I'm going to come
in here and go directive restrict and
set that to e and that's basically just
defining that we are going to be using
an element directive instead of an
attribute which you saw in the previous
example or a class or a comment and
normally I'm only going to either apply
using either elements or attributes
because it's easier to figure out what
or where the directive was applied to in
those situations can be quite confusing
if you're applying classes and that's
why I personally just don't use them
you're then going to come in and define
a template and the template is going to
be filled with the data and this is
going to replace the element over in
your HTML so I'm basically just going to
come in here and I'm going to say player
and we get the name of said player add a
skin player dot average you can see
where I'm pulling this information from
down here let me just go average width
once again player and if we want to list
their home runs we could do so say home
runs and a once again player dot OBP and
that's going to be on base percentage I
have to define a little bit more
information we're also going to have to
come in here and go directive scope is
equal to and scope is going to define
what is unique about each element well
if you look down here well all of its
unique but it makes sense to have the
name be used in this situation so I'm
going to say player equal to name
then we're going to say directive
compile function and get the element and
the attributes and compile is going to
be called during the initialization
phase set all this stuff up we're then
going to create a link function the
going to receive the scope the element
of directives associated with any of
that elements attributes as well just
like before
here let's define it in a different way
trying to show you a whole bunch of
different ways because you can often see
many different ways of doing this stuff
with angular we said it receives the
scope the elements associated with the
directive and the attributes and here
I'm going to bind a click event to this
new element that we create on our screen
so I'm going to say element bind and put
a click event on it and we'll say
function when this element is clicked on
we can say element and change the HTML
or the text for it and we'll say
something like berry disappeared when
that's clicked on and then close that
off and on here we'll return our link
function and then after this guy we can
return our directive I don't think I
need to do anything down here with the
controller nope
if we save that reload you'll see if we
enlarge this a little bit Barry Bonds
had eight point two nine eight average
Dada Dada you can see what all that
information is being pulled from you can
see that the template is what we're
displaying here on the screen and you
can also see that the bound click event
that we have here if I click on this
that it automatically changed the HTML
for us so here is a lot of different
things you can do in regards to creating
custom directives now I'm going to give
you a quick example on transclusion and
exactly how that works I'm doing this in
angular Tut 12 HTML and exam 12 Jas and
basically you're going to use
transclusion to add data without
deleting what is already there whenever
we were showing our previous examples we
were deleting everything or replacing
everything with our custom information
our custom template with transclusion
you just leave the information there and
define exactly where it is being left so
it's a big word but it's not really that
complicated so let's say come in here
and create a div and I'm just going to
call this e ex dir and then I'm going to
throw some lorem ipsum inside of there
just to throw something in there so
there we go threw that in there
we're not going to do anything else with
the HTML jump over into our JavaScript
I'm going to keep this very simple
because transclusion is a big word and
it doesn't need to be confusing so here
we're going to go app this is app 12
make sure I have all this the same yes
app 12 app 12 down here I have app 12
make sure you have that inside of there
back up here change that to app 12 and
I'm going to say directive target or
directive number e ex dir there's
capital D there in this situation it's
going to be a dash and a lowercase D
just a little silly thing that we need
to remember create our function and then
we're going to return the information
one here and we're going to say
transclude and set that to true and then
here we're going to define our template
and where exactly we want our
information that is already on the HTML
where this lorem ipsum to show up inside
of our template because we're not
replacing it we're just going to put
additional information inside of it with
it so let's say we want to create a div
and we want to put an h4 tag inside of
there and we want to throw more lorem
ipsum inside of there
let's call this more lorem what we're
going to do is come down here and say
app 12 controller going to be cantar
getting the main controller again
function gets past the scope though side
off it will store more lorem inside of
here I will just say something like the
amazing lorem story just to put
something goofy in there
and then jump back up here and now you
know what mortal room is and then we'll
close off that h4 tag and we'll close
off our div tag and we'll create another
div and where you want the information
that is already there or this lorem
ipsum that we have right here where you
want that to show up inside of your
template you're going to put ng
transclude and that is going to you know
define where that information that's
already there is moved to and if we file
save it you can see that it worked
exactly as we thought it would so there
you go guys that is some information on
jaql light and how to modify HTML
elements as well as how to add
replace and do a bunch of other things
with HTML elements dynamically as well
as custom directives and transclusion
and before ago just want to send a
special thank you out all my patreon

continue making the videos that I do
without your support and I just always
want say thank you and tell you how much
