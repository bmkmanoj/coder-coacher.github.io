20 of my android development tutorial
today we're going to talk about
fragments fragment activities list
fragments adapters and a whole bunch of
other different things if you missed
part 18 and 19 this tutorial you pretty
much have to watch them and I provide a
link to them in the upper right hand
corner
otherwise you'll be very confused and of
course all the code is available in a
link in the description for this video
so I have a lot to do so let's get into
it okay so basically in the last part of
the tutorial we created contact and in
this tutorial I'm going to be doing a
whole bunch of new things first I'm
going to add an ID number and a boolean
name contacted to see if we contacted
the person for our census information
then I'm going to bundle everything up
in an ArrayList inside of a class called
all contacts now basically previously we
had Census app which is our main Java
file or main Java class and then inside
of it in Census app we had something
called activity census app and then that
was an XML file and then inside of that
we had our fragment container and then
we took contact fragment which was our
fragment and put it in the container
just like that well also what we're
going to do this time is not only create
this class called all contacts with the
ArrayList but we're also going to bundle
everything and shoot it on to the screen
using fragment contact list it sounds
confusing but as I go here I'm going to
go real nice and slow and of course the
last time whenever we did all this let's
jump over to the code just to refresh
your mind here we are inside of Census
app this is what we use before and Here
I am making reference to the fragment
container and then down here I'm calling
contact fragment to fill the fragment
container with my fragment and if you
don't remember where the fragment
container is it is in activity sense
this app right here open that up and you
can see right there is fragment
container and if we bounced back over
into Census app and we talk about the
contact fragment well contact fragment
is up here click on that and here it is
and it just contains all of our
information regards to our contacts name
street city and phone number let's jump
back into the presentation to see what
that looks like when it's loaded in the
app and there you can say this is what
we had previously now we're going to add
contacted and if you can't see this view
it fullscreen it's an HD video so this
is what we made last time what we want
to do this time is create contact list
activity which is going to have all our
contacts from this stuff over here and
contact list activity is actually going
to take the place of census app and
we're also going to be making changes to
the manifest this this is tutorial is
going to cover so many things so most
unbelievable and then what we're going
to do is fill this activity with all of
our contacts and again we're going to do
that using the manifest but eventually
we're going to do this using a menu
system just trying to take this as slow
as possible so that's basically what
we're going to do we're going to edit
contact we're going to create all
contacts to store all the contacts in an
array list I'm going to create fragment
contact the list which is going to feed
all of the different contacts into list
item contact which is an XML file so a
whole bunch to do let's get into the
code okay so the very first thing we're
going to do go into contact Java and
we're just going to start adding a
little bit of information that I
mentioned previously so private and I'm
going to create a unique identification
number for every single contact I'm
going to call that ID number and I'm
going to create that here in a second
and I'm also going to create a boolean
and it's going to be called contacted
and I'm gonna give it the value of false
here to start off now inside of our
constructor I'm actually going to create
this unique identification number and
this is going to generate what's called
a type for facade Oh randomly generated
UUID and based off the information I
found if you would make one billion with
a be unique IDs every second for the
next 100 years the probability of
creating one duplicate over that 100
year period is 50% so yes the chances
are this is going to be pretty unique
and to create it I just call random UUID
and there we go now we have our unique
identification number now I'm going to
come down inside of this code
I don't know used to even do that let's
just stay up here and what I'm going to
do is create the getters and the setters
for these well I don't need to create a
setter for the contact ID but I do need
for the other one go in to source
generate getters and setters this window
is going to pause
but yes I want to be able to change both
getters and setters for contacted
however for ID number I just want to be
able to get it that's it
scroll down here insertion point I'm
just going to come down here and say
there and then I'm going to come down
here and say yes fields in getter setter
pairs because that's what I prefer and
of course they need to be public and
then hit OK then if we scroll down here
you can see is contacted yes set
contacted yes and we're also able to get
our unique identification number if I
file save that that's all I need to do
then what I need to do is go into all
contacts Java this is going to be a
brand new guy and inside of this I'm
going to store all of my ArrayList for
all of my contacts so there's only going
to be one of them actually and that
brings us to the point that this is
going to be what is called a singleton
which means it's going to be a class
that has only one instance ever and that
instance is going to contain my
ArrayList and I'm going to store it
inside of itself all contacts I have
tutorials on Singleton's and how they
work if you're at all interested if you
don't already know okay then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create what
is called a context now by creating a
context we're going to gain access to
the current state of the complete
application which is going to mean that
we'll be able to get information about
all activities from this guy and also
we're going to be able to pretty much
control not only every part of the
application but along with that we're
going to be able to control everything
that the app is allowed to access on the
device so I'm going to call this
application context because it's going
to allow us to pretty much do anything
we want with the entire application have
to get that library of course then of
course we don't want to forget our
ArrayList and our ArrayList is going to
contain contacts so put it in contact
well
have to put a bracket in there of course
and I'm going to call this contact list
because that is exactly what it is of
course we have to get the ArrayList
libraries and then I'm going to create
my constructor and in this situation I
want my constructor to be private
because I don't want people to go in
there and be able to generate these that
makes it a singleton now it's going to
be passed to context and I'm just going
to call this application context and
I'll show you in a second how to pass
that in and then we're going to go
application context is equal to the
application context that they passed in
and we can scroll this up a bit also we
know that if somebody does get to this
point where they are creating this
instance whenever there are no other
instances available
well that means our ArrayList doesn't
exist so we're going to go new ArrayList
and of course it's going to be of type
contact and there we are
now that we have that set up I'm going
to create a bunch of junk contacts so
I'm going to say Paul Smith is a contact
and later on like I said we're going to
be able to go in and actually add
contacts using a menu system but as you
can see there's just so much to do
there's no way I could possibly make a
tutorial that covers every single one of
those things so I'm going to set the
name to Paul Smith spelled right there
we go and then Paul Smith is going to be
doing some other different things for
example setting his Street and that's
all going to worry about doing right now
so set and this is street address and
I'm going to set that to one two three
Main Street and then set contacted do we
or did we contact Paul Smith and I'm
going to say yes true so that's how we
would be able to change the value for
what's going to end up being a check box
and then of course I need to add it to
my contact to list and we can just go
add and then inside of here just go Paul
Smith and there we go now what we're
going to need to do is do this for two
more that's enough and I'm going to have
Sally Smith and I'm going to
have of course I've changed out to Sally
Smith and then this is going to be one
to five Main Street and what she
contacted I'm gonna say no and then I
just need to go Sally Smith and throw
them in there right like this and now
Sally Smith the set up and then my next
contact is gonna be Mark Smith I'm just
gonna think that the mark of the Smith
family all lives next to each other
there's morkul if we go and let's say he
lives at one to seven main street and
was he contacted I'm gonna say no and
then I just have to go mark Smith and
throw him in here in a bunch of
different places just like it was Sally
and there we are and that is all we're
going to need to do with that
constructor that's going to set up our
ArrayList and it is going to create an
instance of this guy and then what we
need to do now is to provide a way for
them to get a new all contacts so
basically what this guy needs to do well
first off it's going to be public and
Static all contacts and I'm going to
call it get it's going to return and all
contacts instance and context context is
going to be passed inside of this and
then what I'm going to do to make sure
that I never create more than one of
these is to go hey does all contacts
having all value and if it does well
that means we haven't created an
instance of this class yet so we're
going to create one and to do so we go
all contacts is equal to new and call
the constructor from inside of here and
then to get the application global
application context which means of
course that this context is global to
every part of the application we're just
going to go context and then get
application context it's pretty easy to
remember even though it sounds
complicated and there we go now we know
that we got that and then otherwise if
it wasn't created doesn't matter we're
just going to pass back the one we
already have and there we go the other
thing that we might want to do and we
definitely want to do is to return the
ArrayList if the user decides they want
it so ray list which is a contact
ArrayList and then let's just call this
get contact list like that and then just
return what
it's not that hard and there we go
another thing we're going to want to
have eventually is a way to get a very
specific contact how we're going to do
that is just go public and of course a
contact is going to be returned and get
contact is going to be the name of it
and it's going to get a unique ID number
passed into it and then we're going to
cycle through all of our contacts which
are of type contact of course and the
contact will be our temporary storage
box and the contact list that we're
going to be searching through is called
contact list then as we cycle through
this we're going to say the contact
which is the contact that's in our
ArrayList well I want to get its ID
number and I want to see if it is equal
to the ID that was sent over into this
method if it was we want to return that
contact because we found it and if it
wasn't we're just going to return null
just to keep this nice and simple and
UUID didn't show up there so let's
import it I don't know why we didn't get
it previously there we go
and if we cycle through we see that
everything is set up wonderfully and we
can file save that and all contacts is
done now if we bounce back and look at
our little diagram we have here and we
cycle through we see fragment contact is
going to be held inside of the fragment
container inside of census app only
thing is we need to add contacted to it
so let's do that
so we find fragment contact and here it
is and let's look at the graphical
layout see it says name Street city and
phone number but we want to also put a
checkbox inside of there well I like to
use the graphical layout for a couple
weird things and I know my check box
isn't going to take up that much room so
what I want to do here is go into
layouts this guy right here and then get
table row and I'm going to take table
row and drag it down here and then
inside a table row I'm then going to
jump back into form widgets and find
check box and I'm going to take check
box and drag it down inside of there so
there's that guy well that means I'm
going to need to go into strings.xml
and create a string or what I want to
put inside of that checkbox and I'm
going to call this contact contacted
checkbox and inside of this I'm just
going to put contacted and there that is
file save it jump back over into
fragment contact XML then I have my
checkbox selected I'm going to come over
here click right there
change this to checkbox and then I'm
going to give it the name of contacted
checkbox and then come back over inside
of this so I can actually look at the
code and you can see contacted checkbox
is inside of there and the text is
checkbox well I want to change that to
the more descriptive phrase that I have
over in my strings out XML file so just
click on that and then contact contacted
checkbox and there you can see contact
it shows up inside of there and that's
all I need to change with fragment
contact XML well that brings me to
contact fragment Java this guy right
here and this was the guy that was going
to be stored inside of Census app as you
can see right here contact fragment well
since I changed contacted or I put the
contact a checkbox inside of here I'm
going to have to go in and set up some
listeners so the contact fragment will
handle everything in the right way so
I'm going to come down inside of this
guy and here are our editable text areas
and create a new one and it is going to
be a checkbox and I'm going to call it
contacted checkbox and then I need to
set up the listeners for it so let's
scroll on down inside of here
actually before we scroll down inside of
here let's go and copy this because
we're going to be doing a lot with it
scroll way down and right here looks
about right
I'm going to say contact your check box
so I need to initialize this guy so I'm
going to go check box and then I'm going
to do same thing as I did before when I
initialize these guys so I'm just going
to scroll up here and get all that
information the view find by ID copy
that scroll back down again W find by ID
and this of course is going to be
contacted checkbox if I'll save that and
now that we have that setup contact a
check box I'm going to setup the
listener for it and to do that
check box I'm going to say set on
checked change listener and then I'm
going to go new on checked change
listener and actually Eclipse is acting
up and acting a little bit strange so
rather than ignoring that what I'm going
to do here is I am going to show you how
to fix eclipse when eclipse goes wacky
first what we're gonna do is go up the
project click on that we're going to go
clean and then this box is going to pop
up and since this app is what is causing
havoc we're going to hit OK on that and
then I'm going to restart Eclipse and
after a restart you can see we're no
longer getting that little error in
regards to having problems finding the
contacted check box ID inside of our our
file so now we can proceed with what we
were doing before so now throw in our
curly braces and then we're going to add
our unimplemented methods from on check
change listener and that's going to be
on check changed and I'm actually going
to leave the to do on inside of here
however what I'm going to do is I am
going to say if true change to false if
false change to true and what this to do
is going to do is it's going to alert me
to the fact that there is something that
I need to do or correct in the future
but for now I'm going to make it very
simple whenever they check on the fact
that they actually met the person I'm
going to say contact set contacted and
then later in the future we'll just also
provide the option to change that to
false if they decide to shut that off
but for now I'm going to leave it that
way just because I like covering that
new topic and that's something I don't
think I've ever covered before and we go
file save and everything else is exactly
as it was before so basically at this
point we have contact setup all contact
setup and I also reviewed exactly how
since this app works how the fragment
container works and how contact fragment
is going to properly set up the layout
called fragment contact inside of the
census app doing pretty much everything
that we did previously because this
tutorial is getting a little bit long
I'm actually going to end
now because I feel like I covered a lot
of things and in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to cover how contact
list activity and all of these other
different pieces as well as our adapter
are going to work to show a list of
contacts please leave any questions or
comments below and of course all the
codes going to be available in a link in
the description otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
