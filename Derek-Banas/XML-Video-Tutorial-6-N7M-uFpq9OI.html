6 of my XML video tutorial today I'm
going to be talking about XML schemas
and I'm just going to jump right in here
and start making one and then we're
inside of Eclipse just like always I'm
going to go to source here go to new and
then I'm going to go to other and then
inside a little wizard it pops up in the
XML folder we have here I'm going to
choose XML schema and an XML schema file
is just used to describe an XML document
just like a DTD the my only major
difference is that you're going to use
very specific data types and also be
able to limit what type of data is put
inside of different elements that are
assigned to the XML schema file all
right then we're going to click on next
and I'm going to call this baseball
players dot XS d and all of the code
that is in this tutorial is available in
a link underneath the video and then
we're going to click finish then the
file pops up inside of here and here we
see the version of XML and the encoding
I'm sure you understand that I'm going
to go through here and make a couple
changes and also organize this a little
bit better first thing I'm going to do
is go up here and add XS to this and
what this is it's called a prefix and
this line in general is going to declare
which or URL is going to be assigned to
all of the different elements that is
contained inside of this schema and it's
also going to state that XS will be used
to separate all of those elements that
are assigned to this namespace I'm going
to get more into namespaces here in a
second it's basically just a unique
thing that exists that's going to be
directly tied to this called a prefix so
that we're able to separate and know
which elements we're going to be using
like I said put that on pause because
I'm gonna get more into that here in a
second right here on this second line
and I'm going to go in here and actually
put my URL inside of here right like
that I'm going to define the namespace
that's being used for elements in this
schema this very personal document that
I'm creating right here for myself and
then this guy down here I'm actually
going to give this as prefix as well NT
tbp I'm just going to copy this right
here and paste this inside here and now
explain exactly what all this stuff's
doing basically what you do is you use
namespaces to group your tags that
you're going to be creating inside of
here remember scheme is just like a DTD
you're going to define all of the tags
that you're going to have any XML files
that relate to this so for example if
you decided to use table inside of your
very customized XML file well of course
there is already an HTML
tag called table so in this situation if
you would want to separate your data
from the HTML tags we just go NTT BP and
then put a colon inside of there and
then of course in the ending tag you do
exactly the same that's exactly what's
going on here we're assigning this which
is called a namespace which is just a
unique thing that's all it is it doesn't
really even have anything to do with
this this isn't a file this is just a
unique location a unique ID like a
social security number or something like
that and it is assigned to a prefix that
is then going to be used inside of these
element definitions where we're defining
everything but throughout this guy we're
actually going to be using XS a lot
because we're going to be using a lot of
standardized schema tags that are
already defined and the only thing
you're going to have to use this prefix
for it's actually going to be the XS is
for all of the main global elements that
you define as well as their children
however you do not need to use this
prefix whenever you're using or
describing attributes and as we go
through here you'll understand this a
little bit better and this guy right
here is actually what is called a URI or
a Uniform Resource identifier and also
if you wanted to you could put a version
number at the very end of this and that
would be perfectly fun and that would
allow you to have multiple different
schemas and different locations if you
decided to change different things
inside of your and even though it's very
commonplace to use a URI inside here
just like we have here we could also
come in here and use a uniform resource
name instead and how you would define
that instead is to type in you or and
colon and then basically the exact same
thing we have right here I'm going to
change slightly such as copy that throw
that down inside of there the only thing
that we'd have to change inside of here
would be to put a colon right like that
and you could throw that guy in instead
of this URI this here but like I said
that's not really commonplace to do I
just wanted to cover it and then this
guy down here element form default
qualified means that all elements used
must be namespace qualified and only
top-level elements are included by
default so that's just basically saying
that if you're going to have this right
here that means that all the tags that
you're going to define are going to have
to have this prefix in front of them as
you're going to see here right away then
what I'm going to do is if you'd like to
use an annotation instead of a
to pass documentation information to
users of your schema this is exactly how
you do that you're just going to type in
access you're already using the prefixes
and type in annotation throw in a
closing tag and you're going to type in
XS documentation and then you could just
say something like this XML schema will
be used for bla bla bla bla bla okay so
that's just one way you can provide
additional documentation for your little
schema file that you have here well then
what I'm going to do it's not always
commonplace to do this by any means but
I'm going to actually define a root
element now normally you would just use
scheme as your root element but because
I'm creating all this I'm actually going
to create a root element that's going to
surround all of these other elements and
I'm going to call it baseball players
and that is all that I'm going to do
with that right now I'm going to come in
here and go access and you just start
describing all the different elements
that you want to use so I'm going to say
name is equal to player name like that
and then I'm going to say type is equal
to and here is what's different we're
going to be able to say that we want
this definitely to be a string this is
going to contain string data and how
this would actually translate whenever
you're using your XML file is it's
actually going to be player name I guess
that this isn't part of the schema this
is just going to be whenever you use it
in XML and you would say something like
John Smith and then you would have your
closing tag and throughout this tutorial
I'm going to show you what the XML will
look like as well as the schema for what
we're working with here so this is what
you're defining right here and you're
saying it must be a string and then here
is the XML version of that in which we
are definitely using a string and you
just continue to go through and I'm
going to show you a whole bunch of
different data types that are available
and you're just going to type in again
XS prefer the prefix and then element
followed by whatever you're going to put
inside here so I'm going to say name is
equal to current age and then I'm going
to define the datatype for it which is
going to be equal to XS integer like
that and then of course inside of the
XML it's going to be current age is
going to be the name of your tag and
then there's going to be a number that
doesn't have decimal places inside of it
we can actually just copy this save
ourselves a little bit of time paste
that down inside of there and let's say
also that I would want to do batting
average just to find my new tag however
if I'm going to be using decimals well
there you are that's going to allow me
to be able to use decimals inside of
here and some other common number
data types that exist or excess which is
going to be a positive integer and
that's obviously going to be a positive
integer it's not going to be allowed to
be negative and another data type that
would be in here would be negative
integer which of course I think that's
self-explanatory and we'll create
another element inside of here like
let's say starting is our player a
starter and you could throw in boolean
in this situation and the only values
that are available for a boolean data
type is going to be true or false or 1
or 0 and that is that those are all the
different values that are available and
we'll just keep on creating different
elements inside of here paste this in
here to eat born there are many
different types of data types available
to you and this will just be equal to
date and then the format for this guy
inside of XML is going to be like this
and then it's going to be your year year
and then you're going to type in month
in two digits and then you're going to
type in day in two digits and a way this
will translate is say 1986
Oh 210 exactly like that and then of
course there would be a closing bracket
for the date born if you want to get
more specific like let's say you want it
to do next game time and you want it to
get down to a specifics of what time our
next game would be the way this would
work ourself out inside of the XML would
be 14 : 1:30
: and then this would represent the
seconds for our date and that's exactly
what that would look like inside of HTML
as well and yes you can get even more
specific like let's say you wanted to
define the final game and you would like
to have the date as well as the time how
would you do that actually easy just
type in date time just like that and
then we're going to combine these guys
in a little bit different format let's
copy that and inside of the XML the way
this is going to look is let's say it's
2012 which is going to represent our
year Oh 9 is going to be the month then
your and a half days then you're going
to have a capital T and then you're
going to have your hours your minutes
and your seconds and that's exactly how
that would be defined inside of the XML
for this guy and let's just move along
here and create a couple more elements
again excess element let's say you
wanted to figure out a duration and
you're going to see in a second exactly
what I mean by that we'll say name time
and this would be the average amount of
time
that a player would be in the game again
I'm just thinking of some reason to use
duration and that would be like this
duration right like that and we're going
to close that elemental and then the
format for this inside of the XML is
going to be a capital letter P and then
a number which is going to be
represented by years and then another
number which is going to represent the
number of months and then another number
that's going to represent the number of
days and then the capital T telling us
that we're getting into time and then
another number followed by H another
number followed by M and n another
number followed by s and that's exactly
how it would be fun and if you'd like to
see a real-world sort of situation let's
say we're looking for 3 hours I'll put a
3 right there and 15 minutes right like
this and then we don't have any other
additional information well that's
perfectly fine we can just chop this off
like that and then since we don't have
any other information in regards to
seconds we can chop that off right like
that and that's how you would define a
duration of 3 hours and 15 minutes if
you play around with this I'm sure
you'll figure out the rest of it just
little codes you got to memorize or at
least have a cheat sheet it could also
come in here and define a URI that you
would like to link to and let's say it's
called picture and if you wanted to find
that you want to use a URI let's just
type in any URI exactly like that and
then all you would do is put a link to a
picture or any location on the web
exactly like this is a URI up here
that's all that is let's do something a
little bit more interesting here I'm
going to find a custom data type and
it's what's known as an anonymous data
type because it's going to be able to be
used once in the element that is going
to be named last tweet and we're just
going to come in here and oxs element
name is equal to last tweet exactly like
that and then we're going to close that
off and this is still considered a
simple type there you go simple type
exactly like that and then I need to
define exactly what my element that I'm
going to be creating here is going to be
based upon and what makes most sense to
me is for it to be based on a string so
I'm going to go in here and go access
and I'm going to say restriction and I'm
gonna say I want to base this on excess
string because that's what it's going to
contain a string value and then I can
define all kinds of
different rules inside of here like I
talked about before now if this is going
to be a tweet what I'm going to say is
excess max length and I can say value is
equal to 140 characters and close that
off and that is going to make sure that
the maximum length for this to be a
viable value inside of this element is
going to be 140 characters and I could
also come in here and define a minimum
length just like that and let's say that
I demanded it must be at least two
characters and while this would greatly
limit me I could also come in here and
type in length if I wanted to demand
that this tweet be exactly 140
characters but in this situation it
doesn't make much sense but if you
demanded that there would be a specific
number of characters inside of a
customized element based off of a string
like I did right here that's exactly how
you would do it and then whenever this
is actually used I know this looks
really really complicated but in the XML
it's just going to pretty much look like
this I hope I have a good game right
like that so that's how you would be
able to come in there and create a very
customized type and this is the XML
version of what you just created and
these guys right here these restrictions
that you're throwing in here are they're
called facets and a couple other
different facets that exist you could
say max inclusive and then type in value
and then inside of these quotes you
would put the highest number date or
time that can be used and then of course
there's also a minimum inclusive and
inside of these quotes again right there
you're going to put the lowest number
data time that can be used
you could also come in here and type in
total digits and inside of these quotes
you'd put the highest number of digits
that would be allowed inside of said
element and you could also do the same
with fractions so if you wanted to find
the total number of decimal places
inside of here well inside of there you
would put if you wanted five decimal
places you'd put a five inside of there
so those are a couple other different
facets that's the fancy name for these
restrictions that you're putting on your
different customized elements and you
could also come in here there's all
kinds of different things you can do
let's say you wanted to go and again
we're going to create a simple type and
it's going to be named position again
this is just a regular old element and
again I'm going to use a restriction
just like I did up here and this is
going to be a string and let's say
I wanted to use a set number of
different things so this is a baseball
player what I'm going to do I'm going to
create what's called an enumeration just
a bunch of choices that you have one of
the choices I'm going to say they have
to put in here as a valid string inside
of my element I'm creating here called
position is going to be pitcher and then
I can create a whole bunch of other
valid things that they can put inside of
here so let's say catcher or infielder
or out filter and that would tell them
exactly the different values that were
available to them and anything that
wasn't one of these four guys we have
right here would be considered invalid
we could also come in here and go access
simple type and go name is equal to ID
code and again we're going to use a
restriction here it's going to help us
do our job and it's going to be a string
however I'm going to make it very very
specific using what are called regular
expressions and I'm not going to get a
lot into regular expressions because
I've covered them so many times in the
past if you want to see a regular
expression tutorial check out my YouTube
page I have a gazillion of them so if I
wanted to say for example in a regular
expression that whatever is entered
inside of this element called ID code
should start with two digits that's
exactly how I would do that and then I
demand that it be lowercase letters or
uppercase letters exactly like that that
are either two in length or five so I'm
demanding that this be two digits and
then followed by either two three four
or five letters for this to be a valid
ID code and that's exactly how you can
make extremely tight and very
controlling sort of information inside
of all of your different elements that
you have here and if that is at all
confusing basically the xml is going to
be very very simple this is going to be
a valid ID code based off of the user's
restrictions and abs and there you go
there's a valid ID code version in the
XML that would match up to the element
that you just created here in this XML
schema I'm going to cover the rest of
this in the next tutorial but basically
I'm going to create another one of these
guys like let's say that you wanted to
be able to list a whole bunch of
different decimal values for example you
want to have a whole bunch of different
values period you could put anything
inside here so I'm going to go previous
average and this is going to allow the
user to enter a list of different
adding averages that are going to all be
separated by whitespace that's how they
are all set up and in this situation I'm
going to go X s and I'm going to type in
list and I'm going to go item type is
equal to and I'm going to say that
everything is going to have to be a
decimal right like that and that is the
only rule that I'm going to make but
what that's going to allow me to do here
is inside of the XML go previous batting
average exactly like that and then have
it so the user could type in point two
three four space to twelve base and then
to 5/3 for example and then of course
close out the previous batting average
in the XML file so in the next part of
the tutorial to continue going through a
whole bunch of things in regards to XML
schemas leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
