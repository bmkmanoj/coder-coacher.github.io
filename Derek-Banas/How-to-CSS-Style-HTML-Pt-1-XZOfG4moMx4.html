watching my HTML tutorials you probably
ask yourself when is he going to talk
about cascading style sheets already
well today is the day I'm going to do
something that's kind of daunting but I
think I figured it out I'm going to
completely go over every feature
available with cascading style sheets we
have to understand is when HTML was
merged with XML to become XHTML and if
you don't understand what I'm saying
that means you didn't watch my HTML
tutorials which are available right here
well when that occurred CSS took off
because now we were able to create our
own tags and the possibilities became
endless you define how you want to have
style your pages in regards to cascading
style sheets in one of two months you
either
embed the CSS styling directly into the
web page itself like this right in your
heading section right after the title
you would just start defining all the
Styles you want to use on that one page
and you would do that by defining a tag
you want to change and then how you want
to change it so in this case I'm
defining I want all my h1 tags to be of
the type Arial and by default sans-serif
and one of my text color to be purple
and I'll be explaining all these in a
little bit and then you want to close
the bracket and close the central sheet
and that is how it's done if you want to
embed however if you would want to link
to an outside style sheet right in the
same exact part right after the title
tags are defined you want to put this
link right here this part and this part
tells the browser that a style sheet is
available that you want it to go get and
style your page with at this location
right here now why is it preferable to
link to an outside style sheet it's
simple let's say you make a website and
it's 300 pages and believe me a website
that's any good at all can easily become
them bacon and the client says to you
hey I liked what you did with the header
tags but I would prefer that that color
be changed to red well if your all your
style sheets are
you're going to have to change that
style on 300 pages that is why people
link outside two style sheets just yet
so how do changes in one tag affect all
of the other here I'm going to explain
the way cascading works let's say that
you changed your body tag that is the
biggest tag you have available in
regards to changing your content why
because all your content lies in the
body table then those changes made in
the body tag are going to filter down to
all of your paragraph tags and then all
those changes going to filter down into
say your heading tags and all of the in
line statements again if you don't know
what inline means watch the HTML
tutorial but would not change the image
why is that because the image does not
have any text in it so that's basically
the cascading part and whenever you're
defining all of your Styles you want to
start with the biggest tag available
normally your body tag and then work
your way down to the paragraph tags and
then down into your headers and then
down at all your inline statements and
you can see here what I'm doing is I'm
defining for all paragraphs to be of
this font family then this font size to
be the default and then all the text to
be color purple your own defining these
individual tags to change the color from
purple to black and down here I'm
changing that all my anchors or links
should be of this different font family
so that's what's going on there there is
only one exclusion to this rule block
element definitions affect all inline
elements but not block elements that
reside in them example here we're going
to change the body text color to black
that's going to filter down to all of
the paragraphs because body is most
powerful we change the paragraph tag
text color to purple that filters down
to your italic tag and your bold tags
but not your two header tags here and
why is that
because header tags are block elements
when you make a change in a block
element and another block element
resides in that block element it will
not affect these block elements down
here so you're saying yourself well what
is block hell I forgot here are all of
your block elements block quotes divs
definition lists forms header tags
horizontal role ordered lists paragraphs
tables an unordered list now I'll
describe how to make multiple versions
of one tag let's say it customer once an
h1 tag to be different colors depending
on what title they are being used on is
that possible most definitely you just
have to define multiple classes for each
header and we'll show you in a second
even quicker way to do that but let's
keep it simple okay you have your
generic header tag right here and for
all of your header tags other than these
ones we're going to define the font
family as Times New Roman down this era
and we're going to define the default
font size be 14 pixels this is a comment
by the way and here we're going to close
off my HTML or my h1 tag definition and
I'm going to make some custom tags right
here being header tags dot purple
anything that I call in a tag format
instead of typing in each Wanek type in
each one dot purple those a header tag
is going to be purple and if I type in
h1 green instead of the normal age 1 all
that text is going to show up green now
I'm going to show you how to create a
default generic class that can be
applied to any tag all you simply do is
remove the tag up here I have h1 down
here I'm just going to simply define my
class with a period and then whatever on
with the name debatable as you can see
here this is the old way of doing
where I would define the header tag
class and whatever the name of the class
was I defined up here what I'm going to
do now is create a custom class then how
do I add this custom class to any other
element simple in the case of h1 I would
do h1 class equals and then put in
purple Seraph which is the custom name
for my class that I defined right here
and that's basically all we're going to
cover today but a ton more scumming as
you can see here I'm going to define for
you give examples of and example tags
and information for every single
property within cascading style sheets I
hope you enjoyed the presentation you
