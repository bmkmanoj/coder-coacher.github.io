my jQuery AJAX tutorial in this part of
the tutorial I'm going to show you and
explain to you all the code that went
into making the web page that you saw at
the end of part 6 of my jQuery and Ajax
tutorial like always we start off the
HTML code and get the jQuery library
ready for use when the page loads I
attach all of my event handlers to the
buttons that you will see in the HTML
code below you've seen this before in
the jQuery and Ajax event handler
tutorials in the past so I will not go
into detail exactly what's going on I
want to specifically draw your attention
to make sure you don't forget to have
the curly brace followed by a semicolon
at the end of this code however because
this is a common error made here is the
code I used to make the logo disappear
the rest of the page will move up and
the logo seems to disappear when I call
the function name tied the value 2500 is
the number of milliseconds I want it to
take before the image has completely
disappeared the function show will make
the image reappear on the screen the
HTML code that places the image on the
HTML page looks like what you can see
here in the third bulleted item this div
that I've defined down here the function
toggle will replace one block of text
with another again I'm creating a two
and a half second delay with the value
2500 the HTML code that will be
manipulated by toggle looks like what
you could see here in the second
bulleted items when the button is
clicked and toggle with the value of
2500 is called the first h4 element will
be replaced apply the one hidden below
it and if I click the button again they
change places with you each other again
and will continue to change places as
many times as you hit button the
fade-out function will fade the image
away instead of making it shrink away
like the hide function does the fade to
function will fade to the opacity level
that you define with the second
attribute you sent to it in this case
I'm saying I want the opacity level to
be set to 30% I then call the fade to
function again to make the opacity level
100% the fade in function is used to
bring an image back after it has been
deleted by the fade-out function and
fade in has no effect on changes made by
the fade to function these functions
pretty much do what their names say
slide up moves all
content up over the element that is
called on in the function slide down
slides the elements back down to make
room for the element slide down was
called on here we're creating a custom
animation with the animate function here
I'm changing a bunch of CSS properties
on the fly you can change the text using
any of those properties defined in CSS
and if you don't know them check out my
CSS styling HTML tutorial and you can
see here the rest of the HTML code that
goes into creating this animation web
page the code of course starts on the
left side of the screen and then
continues on on the right side of screen
whole way to the bottom in the final
part of my jQuery AJAX tutorial I will
explain everything there is to know in
regards to passing information to the
server and calling for PHP scripts to be
run and now I will show you the web page
you will be creating in part 9 of my
jQuery and Ajax tutorial in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
get text as well as XML data directly
from the server without a page reload as
well as communicate with PHP scripts
without a page reload if you watch right
here you can see when I click on this
button I got that text dynamically from
the server now if I type in any number 5
for example here and click on double
number I'm going to access a PHP script
on the server and get myself a result
and I can also pull customer XML data
directly from the server and put it
right down here by clicking this button
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
