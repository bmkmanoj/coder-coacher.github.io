3 of my learning XML tutorial today I'm
going to cover everything there is of
behind document type definitions as I
explained at the end of the last article
you create a document type to define the
rules that must be followed in your XML
markup a DTD defines what elements are
required and what attributes can be set
and what their potential values can be
every DTD must start with this line
right here this tells the processor that
this is an XML version 1.0 file the
character encoding used is of type UTF -
8 and that no external file is required
for this document to work and you can
see that by looking at the attribute
named stand-alone and the value that it
is assigned to it being no also make
sure when you are creating DT DS of that
element at list required PC data C data
etc are all Capitol the DTD prologue you
describe your DTD and falling ways with
comments you give a description of what
the document contains you start a
comment with a bracket followed by an
exclamation mark to end two dashes and
end it with two dashes and another
closing bracket you tell the interpreter
what version encoding and whether you
require any outside files to operate
with a statement like this you tell the
interpreter the location of any outside
required files with the following
statement that I have here note if you
don't require an outside file
stand-alone would have the value of yes
also you can refer to the location of
the needed file like I did in the last
example only if it resides in the same
file folder you could also replace the
file name customer data dot DTD with a
URL pointing and a DTD everything that
lies between two tags on an HTML page is
referred to as an element so the
paragraph tag that I am of here followed
by the text that's going to go between
that paragraph tag and the closing
paragraph is an element you can use DTD
to define a great deal of rules that
must be followed for all elements on the
page just to make myself clear from the
very beginning of
the paragraph tag including the text in
between it and the closing tag combined
that makes an element element is used to
define what data can be placed in an
element it also defines how many times
that data can be placed and in what
orders an example element definition
this statement is affecting data is
placed in the customer element it
demands that the data be entered in the
same order they are listed by not having
an occurrence indicator defined I'm
stating that there can only be one
customer ID with the question mark
occurrence operator I'm stating that
suffix can either be defined once or not
at all with the plus occurrence operator
I'm stating that there can be one or
more products with the multiplication
occurrence operator I'm staying that
visits can be defined zero or more time
now I'm gonna go over defining data
elements the any definition allows the
user to place any type of content in the
element and here is an example of how
you would do that with the child element
definition I allow the user to place
only other elements in the element and
you don't define this role with the word
child element but instead like I show
here in this example where I list the
names of those child elements in those
brackets empathy doesn't allow any
information to be placed in an element
and you can also use an or statement
this allows either of multiple different
types of data to be entered in an
element in the example we're saying it's
okay to add any type of character data
with the PC data reference or child
elements PC data is known as parsed
character data this is character data
that contains codes that at the XML
interpreter must decode parsed character
data would contain the following codes
that I show here in this example instead
of the + sign less than or greater seed
out on the other hand it's just straight
text that contains no character can you
define what attributes can be assigned
your elements with the at list name you
also use it to define the data type and
any default values with it the standard
format is as I show in this example and
a real world example might look like
this here I'm defining a attribute named
first name I'm assigning it to the
customer element and I'm saying that it
has C data in it and that it is going to
be a requirement that this information
be filled in the first two elements used
in the above attribute list definition
are self-explanatory so I'll define the
data types available C that accepts any
character data that doesn't include the
symbols and quotes less than or greater
than you can use their escape versions
which are as I show here an
identification number is generated to
uniquely identify an element much like
you do with a database a notation is a
non XML data that was specified with a
notation declaration and there'll be
more on this in a second if you're a
little confused an entity is an alias to
a previously defined block of text again
more on this in a minute you also can
use an enumerated list of values instead
of a data type an enumerated list is an
all-inclusive list of every possible
value and here's an example I'm creating
a tribute name suffix for the element
named customer and then I am saying that
the values it can contain would either
be BA MA or pH finally you define the
default value for the attribute all the
possible values for default value are
required which means exactly pretty much
what it says there must be a value fixed
means the value is optional but must be
the value assigned if used and here's an
example that in this example states that
if a customer is marked as new they must
be assigned the value of new implied
means the attribute is totally optional
in value defines a specific default
value here much like the previous
example I'm using the element name
customer I'm assigning an attribute
named new customer to it and I'm saying
if they want to use a value it must be
the text name with an entity you can
declare a type of variable name that
would represent a block of text and
here's an example of that where I'm
basically assigning this address to Lord
is address and I would be able to
reference that later by just putting the
+ sign in front of it it would
automatically throw the address directly
into the XML with this defined I can now
place an address anywhere
by just using this code that I show here
this is known as an internal entity if
it's defined in the DTD that is
referencing it an external entity is to
find in an included file you wouldn't
define it with this sample format that I
have here in which I'm referencing a URL
instead of content that is in the XML
file itself one of the great things
about external entities is that they can
reference images and other non XML data
just from completely clear you reference
the entity by typing the ant symbol
followed by the entity name and then a
semicolon also you cannot make a call to
an entity until you have already defined
it in your code external entities are
either parsed or unhorsed here I'll
explain that first data is either data
that is of type text or XML this data is
interpreted by the XML parser unhorsed
on the other hand is data that is not of
type of text or XML it could pretty much
be any type of data the XML parser will
nor this data because it doesn't
understand it and it will stay instead
look for a helper tool that will be able
to handle this data please note that on
parsed external entities are defined
differently so that they are passed on
to the proper helper you could define an
image with codes such as here here I'm
referencing an entity named image name
and I'm defining the location of it or
the URL and I'm saying it is of type jpg
we define the name of the entity
followed by the word system then we
include the URL address of the image and
data tells the parser that it needs
outside help to work with this image and
JPEG is a notation and I'll be covering
that next the notation element describes
the format of non xml data within an XML
document the basic format of a notation
follows right here with this example or
for the image I was talking about above
here is how you would define that
notation where I'm creating the notation
JPEG and I'm telling the system that
this is a JPEG with the image forward
slash JPEG definition here in part 4 of
my learned XML tutorial I will
completely cover XML schemas till next
