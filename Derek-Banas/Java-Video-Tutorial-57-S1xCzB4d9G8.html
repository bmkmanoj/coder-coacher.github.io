57 of my Java video tutorial series
today I'm going to show you all of the
rest of the code for flying the
spaceship around in pretty much any
direction that you could ever imagine
all over your game board and doing all
the other things we've covered in the
previous parts of the tutorial you
haven't watched part 55 and 56 of this
tutorial you should definitely watch
them for watching this because in 55 we
went from this simple list of just
things that we wanted our class to be
able to do and then progress the whole
way down to create all of the methods
and variables that we use previously
remember while this is a pretty good
game programming tutorial this is really
all about object-oriented design
principles when it gets down to brass
tacks so let's get into the code okay so
here we are again in spaceship dot Java
and I just have to add a couple more
methods this guy of course if I want
this guy to move I need to create a
method called move and that's what I'm
gonna do right here and this is also
simple because we're using
object-oriented programming now what
we're gonna do and we want to move this
spaceship around is increase the X
origin based off of our current velocity
for our ship because we're gonna have
the velocity of the ship increase as the
person holds the button down on the
keyboard so and we're just gonna refer
to other methods that we've created here
in the past we're just gonna go this
we're gonna say get X velocity right
like this and then right like that and
this is just a reference again increase
X position is way up here at 35 see
increase X position it receives a double
increment amount and then we're going to
increment whatever the center position
is for our spaceship by that increment
amount okay so let's get back down here
again now remember whenever we were
going through the creation of our UML
class diagram we decided that we wanted
the ship to go off the board and then
flip over to the opposite direction so
how are we gonna do that well simple if
statement and we're gonna say this get X
center which is the center X point for
our spaceship on the screen and we're
gonna say if that x value is less than
zero and we want to perform some
operations on it mainly we're gonna say
this again this is just a reference to
the space
set X Center and then we're gonna say
game board what so what that just simply
says is if the x position goes to a
negative number or off the game board we
want to set its position to the
rightmost point on the screen and then
it's gonna continue to move in its
normal way else and I like to do it this
way other people do it in different
other ways but I'm gonna say this get X
Center is greater than game board width
which means it went off the screen on
the right side of the screen
well in that situation we're just gonna
do the same thing again we're gonna go
this set X Center and we're gonna set it
to zero so because too far to the right
we're gonna set it to zero which is
gonna throw it to the leftmost point so
have pretty cool stuff and then of
course we're also gonna have to do the
exact same thing for the Y vector so
increase Y position we're just gonna say
this get Y velocity and there we are
we're just gonna get all those different
things and then we're pretty much gonna
do exactly the same thing here to make
sure that it stays on our game board so
just paste that down there and in this
situation we're gonna say get Y Center
and if it's less than zero this is
giving me an error because there should
be a capital B and that should be a
capital B like that and this is gonna be
changed to height so that just means
that if it goes up over the top of the
screen because remember the vectors are
all based off of the upper left hand
corner being the zero zero point so if
it goes up this way that means it's
gonna be a negative number so we need to
change that and of course change that to
Y and then come down here and change
this to height and Y and Y and
everything else there is the same and we
are done with the spaceship class so
let's file save that guy and then we're
gonna jump over into the game board so
that we can throw the spaceship onto our
game board now the best thing that can
happen here is to not have a lot of
changes that is the goal with
object-oriented programming we don't
want all the classes affecting each
other too much but since we are on the
game board we are going to be monitoring
mouse key presses and I think that
pretty much makes sense except
eventually what we're gonna do is have
all these handled by their own classes
meaning the mouse clicks so let's just
paste that in there and this is just
going to allow us to figure out which
he was breast and he held if you don't
remember from the past means that the
person is holding the key down and that
just means that we want the ship to
continue to thrust or go forward and
there we are we don't even have to come
up with anything original we just copied
and pasted that and that's cool
so now we're gonna have to go down
through the code and handle all the
changes that are going to occur because
the key was pressed and we're not
changing that many things which is good
when you're not changing many things in
other classes to make another class work
you know you're doing the right sort of
things and here we are this is the
magical location whenever we are going
to be monitoring rotation for the ship
and here we're just gonna say the ship
and we're gonna say increase rotation
angle and there we are pretty cool don't
have to change that many things you know
jump over into the spaceship and see
exactly what is going on with rotation
angle increase rotation angle as you can
see right there and what it's doing is
making sure that the angle does not go
over 355 or 360 so it's just keeping
that angle consistent and if it doesn't
it's increasing it by five degrees as
the person holds down the D key which is
represented by the number 68
in regards to the key code so that's
pretty simple and guess what we're
pretty much gonna do the exact same
thing whenever they hold down the a key
we're gonna rotate them in a different
direction so we're just gonna come down
here boom and then this is gonna be
changed to decrease rotation angle so
again it's very logical it makes a lot
of sense and now we need to scroll a
little bit further down here because we
don't have anything in here in regards
to what occurs whenever they hit the W
key or the key that we're going to use
to thrust or move forward the spaceship
based off of its current angle so I'm
just gonna go else and in this situation
I'm gonna throw the if-statement out
here and then we're gonna just copy this
because it's pretty much gonna be the
same sort of thing pasted if the
gameboard key is held equal to true yes
we want that and gameboard key held code
is 65 no that's not right we want that
to be 87 because that's represented by
the W on the keyboard now we want
certain things to occur here first thing
we want to do is set the movement angle
to the current rotation angle remember
we are both having a
angle that is going to remember which
direction the spaceship is going on the
screen as well as which direction the
spaceship is going to be currently
spinning on the screen
you don't remember from part 55 you're
gonna see here in a second so to do this
we're gonna go the ship again we're
gonna say set moving angle and this is
just going to set the moving angle to
whatever the rotation angle is because
remember we want the spaceship to go
forward that means the moving angle and
the rotation angle must be the same and
there you are now they're equal so a
pretty simple way to make your moving
angle in your rotation angle equal to
each other then what I need to do is
change the values of x and y based off
of the angle of the ship in that way it
will know whether to increase or
decrease x and y remember that as if
there's a vector on the screen like a
big giant piece of graph paper so to do
that I'm gonna go the ship and I want to
increase X velocity even though we are
increasing the velocity maybe it might
make sense later on to change the name
of this because the x value can actually
go up or down but for now I'm just gonna
leave it this way so ship X move angle
we're just gonna get the movement angle
and then to it we're going to pass the
ship and we're gonna pass it get moving
angle right like that and then finally
if we want to slowly increase the moving
angle we're just gonna put point one on
there
so that's going to increase the moving
angle incrementally and that's gonna get
me my X vector position for the Spenard
center of the ship now I want to get the
Y position this can be pretty much the
same thing increased Y velocity ship why
move angle then all the rest of this is
exactly the same and all the code is
available underneath of this video and
it's heavily commented so if you're
having trouble understanding something
go get the code and it will all be much
more understandable so we calculated our
X&amp;amp;Y positions for that guy and then
we're gonna go the ship move like that
and that's going to make sure that it
doesn't rotate more than 360 or less
than zero as we saw right here with this
move method that's all we're doing in
move jump back here and then after that
we need to move the ship to the center
of the screen or wherever the X&amp;amp;Y
position
are it's gonna start off in the center
of the screen to do that we're just
gonna go graphic settings translate
translate is going to allow us to change
the value of x and y and use floats and
all these other great things get x
center like that we just need to get the
center point for the show and there's X
and here is y and it will make sure the
ship moves to that x and y position so
really simple and then we just need to
also allow it to rotate our ship and
we're just gonna call the rotate method
as well and you just need to change this
to radians because everything is going
to be handled in degrees the ship and
get rotation angle and if we file save
this guy and execute it now we're gonna
be able to do all kinds of cool things
with our ship
so there is our spaceship right there on
the screen and you can say all I'm doing
is using three keys a to rotate it
counterclockwise z to rotate it
clockwise and then W to thrust it and
then as you can see it also goes off of
the screen and reappears on the other
edge and you can also see that as I hold
down the W key the velocity continues to
increase however if I flip my rotation
angle around it's gonna take a while to
get it to slow down a bit air there you
are
and I can also do all kinds of other
really cool things so that is how you
move a spaceship around in a near
infinite variety of different spaces
it's starting to look like a real video
game like I said all the code is
available in a link underneath the video
