6 of my si video tutorial today I'm
going to cover five things you've guys
fast for many times being structs unions
enumerated types linked lists and
recursive structures if you didn't watch
part 5 I spent a lot of time talking
about structs there so you might want to
take a look at that and I provide a link
in the upper right hand corner and aside
from all of that I have a link to all
the code in the description for this
video and it's heavily commented and
recommended for translation so I have a
lot to do so let's get into it ok I
briefly want to give a little
presentation here just to get our minds
in the right mindset now as you may
remember in the last tutorial I talked
about weight and height but you may say
to yourself but there are many ways to
weigh and measure things like for
example weight might be in pounds or
grams or kilograms and a measurement
might be in centimeters feet or inches
is there a way to store all those
different types of weights and
measurements or just pure data all in
one variable let's say for example we
are selling oranges now we could sell
oranges on an individual basis we could
sell them for pound or we could sell
them as orange juice how can you store
data of different types or basically is
it even possible well the answer is a
union basically what a union is going to
allow you to do is store one piece of
data that can be of a different type it
can be an INT a short float basically
declaring a union data type is like
saying a variable is sometimes an INT
and other times a float or some other
data type but never both at once
and I want to make it very clear you
cannot store more than one value in a
union variable and I'm going to show you
later on in the tutorial exactly why you
can't do that so probably the easiest
way to get used to a union is to just
basically create one so we're going to
use type def again so that we can give
it a very specific name then you follow
that with Union and then at the end of
this you're going to have exactly what
you want your new data type to be called
I'm going to call it amount now I'm
going to guess here that nobody's going
to buy two hundred and fifty five
oranges for one hundred $14.75
individual
when they could buy a pound for ninety
six ninety so what I'm going to do if
they are buying oranges on an individual
level I'm going to guess that that is
going to be a short however if we are
also going to allow them to enter in
pounds that's definitely going to be a
float and also ounces are definitely
going to be floats as well and I'm just
going to leave that as ounce so okay you
have your new customized datatype all
set up how exactly are you going to add
values to it well there's actually a
couple different ways one of them is
using what is called the designated
initializer and it's just a big word
basically this is your data type you
just created it's called a mount and
we're going to create a variable called
Orange amount and we're going to give
the specific ounce part of this the
value of 16 and that is how you do it
another way that you might be able to do
this is to again create a mount and then
you could go Orange amount obviously you
can't do this at the same time because
both these variables have the same name
but you could go Orange amount and if
you wanted to set a value specific to
the individual or the short version of
your customized data type you could do
it that way so you can either do it this
way or you can do it that way basically
you're gonna do this a lot and then the
reason why is very often you're going to
also use this way of adding values
instructs which I'm going to show you in
a minute so get comfortable with this
even though it's a little bit funky
looking now I want to again reiterate
something that I think is the reason why
people get confused by unions because
really they're not that complicated what
you must understand however is a union
only holds one value at a time it may
seem as if it can hold more but that is
merely a coincidence because values are
actually stored in a block of memory and
it is possible for you to use a
different conversion character and make
it seem like multiple values are stored
in memory and I'm going to show you
exactly how that would work and why that
adds to confusion okay so we basically
have these two guys here and we
have an ounce and an individual as it
would seem what I want to do now is go
print F and say orange juice amount and
then I'm going to say that I want two
decimal places and it's a float and I'm
going to put the size in here as well
how many bytes put a column at the end
and then I'm going to go orange amount
which is my variable name that's how I'm
gonna get the value back out just the
same way I put it in and I'm gonna say
ounce and then also I'm going to do size
of orange amount out now this shouldn't
work and let me show you why you set
this value up here then you created this
this changes the value for orange amount
but the reason why people think it will
work is because very often it does as
you see right there see 16 + 4 shows up
but I'm going to show you exactly why
you can't rely on that here in one
second right after I show you the proper
way to do this
we're gonna go number of oranges change
this into a D because it's a short this
guy up here what if we're gonna be
working with size of can say exactly the
same I'm gonna say individual and I'm
gonna say individual save that and there
you can see this actually makes it look
like both of the values are stored
inside of there no not really
and now I'm gonna show you why that is
true another weird thing that happens
before I leave this let's just change
this to F file save bounce over here say
16 shows up inside of there say you can
mess around and do all kinds of weird
things here you're playing around in
memory now what we're going to do is
we're going to go orange amount and
pound and this guy is also going to be a
float and if we look up here you can see
pound and ounce are both floats while
individual is a short so what would
happen if I come in here now that my
value for orange amount is a pound and
also a float and I'm just going to
change this into pound and change this
into pound save it and if we zoom in you
can see indeed that everything shows up
exactly as it should however once again
if we go in here and change this to f4 a
float and execute now you'll see 16
shows up there again so it's testy when
you are using a union
and you don't want to rely on these
results because they can just be wacky
sometimes and not work the way that you
think that they should now I'll show you
exactly how you can use a union inside
of a struck so here we're going to go
typed up and create a struct then inside
of it I'm going to go character and
let's say that we have a brand then I'm
going to use my new amount Union I'm
going to call it the amount this time
and I'm going to call this orange
product now we're actually going to be
able to initialize this struct using the
designated initializer just like we did
previously and to do that we're going to
go orange product and I'm going to call
this product ordered is equal to and
here I'm going to say Chiquita which I'm
not sure if I spelled that right but
either way now if I want to add a value
to the amount this guy right here what I
need to do is go dot the amount dot
ounce is equal to 16 and that is going
to be the way that we add values to this
truck to using the designated
initializer and another reason why the
designated initializer is kind of useful
now if I want to print this out I'm also
going to use the dot operator let's say
I go you by 2f bounces of oranges throw
in that comma and then if I want to get
out my values I just go product ordered
the amount and then I'm gonna say ounce
because that is the specific type that I
want to pull out of there then I'm going
to say product ordered brand and execute
and you'll see it says you bought 16
ounces of Chiquita oranges right there
clear that back and that's going to
bring us back to the problem that we had
above where we had potentially bad data
if the wrong conversion characters were
entered there's actually an easy way to
solve that problem but first we need to
learn about enumerated types now
basically what an enumerated type is
there's type tough again just going to
type in be new and you're going to use
one of these guys whenever you know that
you will never ever need anything but
the values that go inside of here so we
have
of individual abbreviated ounce and
pound those are we're pretty positive
going to be the only types of data that
are going to be stored inside of that
now let's say we go quantity and this is
going to be homework for you guys
because you're always asking me for
homework I'm going to have quantity type
be individual and your homework is going
to be to put this guy inside of the
struck and make it work I'm sure you can
do it alright so now let's say we go
orange amount individual is equal to 4
well what we can do now is check what
exact type of data is coming in so if
it's individual we can do a completely
different thing for example we could say
printout you bought and then we know
that this is going to be a short oranges
like that and then we can get it by
going orange amount individual else if
quantity type is going to be an ounce
don't forget to put that brace in there
well then we know that we're going to be
dealing with a float we could say
something like ounces of oranges and
everything else is the same and then
call for the ounce version of this else
we get rid of this all together we know
that we're going to be dealing with a
pound so change this into F and then say
pounds of oranges and again that final
comma and then get the pound amount and
I actually forgot with the enumeration
type up here to go in and type in
quantity sorry about that you definitely
have to give it a name and then we use
the name right there okay let's save
that and execute and there you'll say
that you bought 16 ounces of treated key
to oranges and then it also says you
bought 4 oranges and if we would go in
here and change this quantity type to
ounce you can see you bought 1.5 ounces
of orange it shows up inside of there so
that covers unions enumerated types
different ways to use Struck's confusion
it might be caused with conversion
characters and the fancy name designated
initializer so up next I'm going to
cover also a fancy name a recursive
structure and
a linked list okay so for this one I'm
going to go in here and create myself
another struct and it is going to be a
product you're going to find out here in
a second why I have to give this a name
and also remember if you do want to do
type definition you have to put product
here at the bottom and let's say that we
have a little store and in our store we
want to track all the different products
we have and also the price so how
exactly would I then store a bunch of
these products inside of a computer
program well you might say well why
don't you just go in here and go product
the products and we have 20 products to
sell and we're gonna create ourselves an
array well there's one really big
problem with that and that problem is is
array has a fixed length there is
however something that does not have a
fixed length and that is known as a
linked list basically a linked list can
store an unlimited number of items I
mean obviously if you have enough memory
to hold all that data and it's going to
be called a linked list because it
contains an item with information such
as name and price but it's also going to
have a link which is going to be a
pointer to the next struck in the list
and that is what is going to create a
recursive structure which is just a
linked list that has a bunch of structs
inside of it that's all it is so what we
need to do is go struck and product and
this guy is going to point to the next
struck in our linked list and that by
the way is the reason why we have to
have product here is because we
reference product here before we get
down here so there you go if you don't
do that see will get confused another
side benefit to linked lists is you're
going to be able to insert new items
into pretty much any place in the list
if you decide to reorder them and it's
also pretty easy to put values inside of
it so let's go and let's just start
creating some products that we want to
store so we'll go tomato and let's say
it's 51 cents then we're supposed to
have the link to the next struct in the
list but it doesn't exist yet so we
can't do that so
just going to put null inside of there
and let's just say we have four items
total or five items total in our store
tato say the potatoes dollars 21 a
pounds
lemon dollar 69 a pound milk 309 a
gallon and then finally let's create
turkey look sure we make this lowercase
that will cause confusion and turkey and
let's say that our turkey is a dollar 86
a pound okay so we just created a bunch
of Struck's
now we have to turn them into linked
lists it's actually pretty easy to do
all we need to do is go tomato and next
which is this boy right here
whoever we have to get a pointer to the
next struck in the list so we just get
an ampersand and potato because potatoes
the next item in the list now we're only
going to have four of these because
turkey isn't going to have one so we're
going to leave that as null for now then
what we need to do is take potato and
put potato down here and then we have to
look at the next item in the list which
is lemon then take lemon put lemon down
here of course you could do this in a
function or something and lemon points
to milk and then finally milk is gonna
point to Turkey but you may ask or you
may remember that I said you could
easily insert values you actually can
pretty easily delete them as well but
I'm not going to get into that there's
homework for tea as well
let's say you have apples that you want
to start selling but you don't want
apples to be after Turkey you want them
to be after lemons for example it makes
more sense there we go I have to create
an Apple struct dollar 58 null and then
basically if we want it to show up after
lemon what we need to do is go lemon
your next is now going to be equal to
apple and Apple your next is now going
to be equal to milk there we go
but now what if we want to print all
this information out to test that we
actually did this right no problem I'm
going to do this in a function and as
you're gonna see as this tutorial
continues we're going to be using a lot
more functions when we're actually
writing real programs we have to go
create it put it down here it's not
gonna return anything so put void in the
front and what's it going to be
receiving well I guess I should go down
here and point out exactly why I put
tomato in here tomato is the first item
in the list that's the reason why tomato
is in there I want to send it the first
item and basically say after that get me
all the other items until none exist
think about how we're going to figure
out when there are no more items to
print okay so we're going to be getting
a product pointer put a P in front that
four pointer and I'm going to say
products it's the name alright so what
do we basically need to do here well we
need to continue printing out names and
prices while the value for next for our
struct inside of our linked list is no
longer equal to null that's the answer
to the question I just asked and that's
going to signal the end of the list
otherwise if next is not equal to null
we want to keep on going so we're going
to use awhile because I said wow
something is going on I want to keep on
doing it so while loop sounds like a
good thing to use and I'm actually going
to show you multiple different ways to
print out these values in the struct I'm
going to use this notation with your
struct name followed by whatever and I'm
also going to use the notation it looks
like a little arrow so just so you know
so we're going to go print F and we're
going to keep this simple we're just
going to say a string which is going to
be the name costs and then we're going
to print out the price and then use both
the notations just so you're comfortable
with them P product and if I want name I
do that but the easier way to do it at
least the prettier way to do it is to
use a little arrow like that and then of
course after that is done we want to
change P product and make it equal to P
product and get the next pointer and if
we save that and execute you can see
that everything printed out and we have
no errors that was a lot of fun going
through all those different things if
there's any confusion out there please
leave your questions and comments below
and I will definitely cover them maybe
even fit them right into the tutorial
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
