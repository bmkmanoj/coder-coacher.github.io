show you some more things that I eat by
the way I lost 79 pounds in about six
months and I eat like a pig as you can
see on the left there's a muffin in a
cereal bowl the muffin is Anna's zekiel
for nine muffin loaded with fiber inside
there is cereal that's all brand bran
buds then vegetables yes I eat this
entire plate of vegetables this is how
you roast vegetables and make them taste
real good they're all frozen throw them
on a pan stuck them in the microwave now
I'm going to take them dump them on a
pan already have my oven set at 425 I'm
going to stick them in the oven plate
empty with all those vegetables I'm
going to eat this this is a garden
burger garden veggie burger this canola
oil by the way is what I use to coat
pans these garden burgers by the way it
tastes a lot better if you cook them in
the microwave and em fry them for a
second on a very short spray of canola
oil yes this is a potato I eat a potato
almost every single day Coke Zero no
calorie soda you brew national deli
mustard
guess what zero calories and yes I eat
ketchup the amount of kept chip that
you're gonna put on a normal sandwich is
gonna equal normally about 20 calories
unless you are a ketchup fanatic yes you
can eat bread this is Wonder Bread
I can eat two slices of smart white
Wonder Bread and it's the only gonna
cost me a hundred calories in about five
calories of fat or something and 5 grams
of fiber and then there's a tomato and
an onion but I'm missing something
not one not two three bottles of beer
yes you can drink beer on a diet just to
understand this is 500 calories here
real good beer by the way so if I take
what I ate for breakfast that equals out
to slightly over 400 calories if I take
what a for dinner that equals out to
about 430 calories and here's 500
calories guess what I keep puts me in
right at exactly how much I want to eat
in one day
right around 1300 calories so anybody
that says you can't eat potatoes red
beer or carbohydrates probably beer
would be last on that list doesn't know
what they're talking about I lost 79
pounds in six months doing just that
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
