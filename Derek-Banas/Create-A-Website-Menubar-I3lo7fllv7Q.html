tutorial on which I'm going to show you
how to make this guy right here I'm
doing this tutorial because Peter sent
me a message and said that he's having a
hard time getting a job because he
doesn't know how to do website layouts
so I created this tutorial for best
results you should probably also check
out my create style sheet website
layouts that I provide a link to and if
you need to brush up on your HTML or CSS
I also provide a link to those two
tutorials as well well in the CSS style
sheet tutorial I showed you how to
create this top bar this sidebar this
middle content area and this footer this
is just a div this is just another div
this is just another div and this is a
div that is set for position right that
is all it is
remember CSS is just boxes every single
thing is a box in this menu bar which is
new is also just a series of boxes the
whole entire menu bar is encased inside
of a div as you can see over here on the
right side of the screen just a box
that's all it is and it's called menu
inside of that is a table and then you
have a row that is of type no class
right like that nothing special about it
then inside of there are a series of
columns in this situation we have seven
columns and the earth type menu normal
and the way I have everything set up
whenever you put your mouse over this or
hover over it all that happens to this
column in this table is it changes color
and it signals for this div to show up
that contains another table as you can
see here that's it that's all it does
and then whenever you hover off of it of
course it makes that div disappear might
sound like it's really complicated to
make this div appear and reappear right
no it is not all I need to do is just
change the class on this div from
display:none which means it's not
displayed to display inline and
position:absolute that's all I need to
do that's all the CSS code that is going
to change whenever we create this menu
so let's just jump right into it and
I'll show you exactly how to style this
whole thing in HTML all right this is
really cut down so there's not a lot of
clutter inside of this HTML file so that
I'm sure you can get a hold of
everything what are we going to have to
do we're going to actually do the smart
thing in this tutorial we're going to
link to an external stylesheet it's
going to hold all of our CSS code and H
reference is going to point at
the location of said stylesheet so
that's it we're going to make that here
very soon and it's also going to be very
simple whole idea this tutorial was to
explain everything as easily as possible
and here I'm linking to an external
javascript file and it is called menu
dot J s right like that so I linked to
my stylesheet and I linked to my
javascript file everything's looking
super now I get to come down here inside
of here to the body section and actually
create the menu itself so what am I
going to have to do I'm gonna have to
create a div and this is also how I
often layout websites with these
different boxes and so forth so that I
can keep everything all organized so I
go div ID is equal to and then I'm going
to call it menu nothing really special
about that then we're going to create a
table and it's going to be of type nav
bar which is a class that I'm going to
define and it's going to be 800 pixels
wide and you could obviously make this
any size that you'd like right like that
and then I have to create my table row
which is just the row that's going to
contain everything like I said it's real
simple it doesn't really do anything
just a row then we're going to define
our columns and that is defined with TD
class is going to be equal to menu
normal each of these columns is going to
have a default width of 160 and on
mouse-over I'm going to call a
javascript file that is so simple it is
going to simply be called expand and I'm
going to pass the ID for this guy which
is going to be menu normal to a function
called expanded JavaScript and on Mouse
out which means the mouse moves off of
this column I'm going to call another
function called collapse right like that
and then I'm going to have to actually
put a name inside of this column and I'm
just going to put it inside of a
paragraph tag and I'm just going to put
menu one right like that okay
scroll up so you can see all of this
code right here on the screen so then
inside of each of those columns I'm
going to create another div and it's
going to be of class menu normal and
it's going to have a width equal to 155
close that and then inside of there I'm
going to create another table is equal
to menu width is going to be equal to
155 again and then I'm going to create a
table row table column
class equal to guess what menu normal
and then this is going to contain all of
the links and here just to keep it
simple I'm just going to type in page
HTML and it's going to have class menu
item and I'm going to call it item one
and I'm going to close off that link
that is actually these guys right here
so these are just rows inside of here
with links so that's all they are
nothing that complicated and actually
most of the hard work is done enough to
close off this column and close off the
row and guess what all of these are
going to be the same so we can actually
come in here and copy this if we want
four of these on make four of them super
duper and then what do we got to do we
can scroll that over there next thing we
have to do is close off our table right
like that and close off the div close
off the column close off the row lets
off the table and then close off the
entire div there you go that's going to
create one menu item that's going to
drop down and what's crazy about this is
we're actually going to be able to
create additional menu items just by
copying and pasting this code that's it
and this closes off the body section I'm
going to get back into that in a second
but this is all the code that goes into
creating one menu bar item and the menu
bar as a whole so now I get to just
create the JavaScript and the CSS code
okay as per the JavaScript I'm just
going to come in here and type in
function expand is the name of it and
I'm just going to say s come down here
create a variable call it TD make it
equal to s VAR t is equal to TD call a
function called get element by tag name
and it's going to be a div element which
is this div element right here this is
the div that we are looking for and
we're going to say get the first div
element that exists inside of here but
it's it really doesn't matter because
there's only one and then we're going to
come down to TD change its class name
equal to menu hover and all this codes
available on my website by the way for
free there's a link in the underbar
right there so we're just changing the
class name in here we're going to change
the class for the div which is going to
make it appear on the screen that's it
and one more function collapse is going
to do the absolute opposite so collapse
comes in here we're actually going to
use this same code right here actually
we're going to use this all this codes
the same so we're
create a new variable two of them
actually in precisely the same way and
the guys that we're messing with here
just so you know is going to be this
table column right here that's what this
represents and this div right here so
that's what we're playing around with
and we're going to change these to
normal and change this to normal if you
close off the function all your
JavaScript code is completely done so
now we're going to create all the CSS
code so here is the CSS file and I'm
going to actually come in here and
define what a table column will look
like if it is normal in its normal
position meaning not being hovered upon
create some basic padding for zero
pixels remember want this to be as
simple as possible color the text is
going to be white font weight is going
to be bold vertical alignment is going
to be at the top and this is just
setting the vertical alignment to the
top of the div that's all it is doing
remember we're playing around with this
column right inside of here
and we're aligning it to the top of this
that's all we're doing right there and
it's online right like that background
color right like that so that is all the
styling that goes into that basic column
inside of that table nothing too
complicated and I love to copy and paste
if at all possible so we got to create
menu hover and this is going to stay the
same here we're going to change the
color to black we're going to leave this
be bold we're going to leave vertical
align be top and we're going to need to
change the background color to blue
whenever you hover over top of that
column or that little box that has menu
one inside of it then we got to create
this div down inside of here where this
is going to be really complicated just
type in div dot menu normal because it's
normal look is to not be displayed so
we're just going to say display:none
don't display it and then we're going to
also put in here position equal to
static and this just says you know go
with the flow of the rest of the page
that wasn't very complicated and then
I'm going to copy and paste this guy
again and menu hover this is for this
div right here this is the box that
bounces down onto the screen whenever
you hover over top the menu item just so
you don't get confused scroll up here a
little bit border we got to give it a
border because it now is on the screen
and I'm just going to say solid why
just to be simple about it and
background-color right like that and
then to make it display on the screen
we're going to type in in line here and
this tells the div to generate an inline
box with no line breaks that basically
just says come on to the screen and then
we're going to change position to
absolute and this is going to position
the element relative to its parent which
is going to be this column right here
it's just going to line everything up
real nice-like and that is the core of
the code that you need to make this menu
work I'm going to jump in here and
create just some basic stuff like the
body just kind of as a review font -
family this is going to set font family
for the whole entire thing right like
that set the font size for the whole
entire thing and remember this is
totally separate from the web page so if
you make one change here it's going to
affect every single page site-wide so
that's awesome and here I'm setting the
margin on the left to 3 pixels then I'll
just copy that and type right in here
super and we're going to say that we
don't want any padding on this and then
close that off so that just sets the
default body styling and we're also
going to come in here and style anything
that's paragraph I'm going to say
padding top and this stuff really isn't
that important it's just sort of just
showing it to you to be a completionist
so that you see it all table dot nav bar
you're going to see how important the
nav bar is which is not at all I'm going
to do is change the font size on it to 8
points the margin to 0 pixels because
it's not bored I want to act like it's
almost not there the border to 0 font
way to bolt
roll that up and table menu I'm going to
change the font size to 8 points margin
and padding they're going to be 0 as
well and paste that in there except I'm
not going to worry about the border all
right so that's all done well what have
I not handled here basically only one
thing what happens to these guys when
you put your mouse over them this is
going to be handled also very very
simply but I'm also going to show you a
world of different options so that you
can make this as complicated as you want
so I'm going to come in here and I'm
going to do all the styling for all of
those links and this is going to be
amazingly easy just a
a menu item link text-decoration:none
color white that's the text remember
text color is going to be white I'm
going to create padding of 2.5 pixels
background color just like that blue
border bottom 2.5 pixels
solid white display is going to be block
and that just means to display a line
break before and after this guy okay so
that's whenever it's just a simple link
what shall simple it's going to be to
define every single other possible
property this link can have I'm going to
go paste paste paste so come back up
here again here it is in its most
simplistic of formats well what other
things can a link be well we can also
have a visited format guess what we're
not going to define anything different
because it's a menu it doesn't really
make sense to define that but you could
then hover we definitely want to do
something different when they hover over
top of it so what I'm going to do change
this to black and change the background
color to light blue and guess what I'm
also going to do the same thing when
it's active which means when they click
on it it's just going to stay the same
here so it's going to be black and light
blue and I just changed those lines of
code and that is eat I don't need to do
anything else with this CSS code I know
it looks like a lot of stuff but it
really isn't so now I just have to come
in here and take a look at all the work
I did in regards to this menu that I
created and you can see here it is on
the screen right here this just created
one main bar and then there's a div with
a table inside of it and everything else
works beautifully but you're like hey I
feel gypped I want more menu items no
problem I'll just open up menu 2 and I'm
just going to come up here to the column
area that's labeled menu normal down to
where it ends which is going to be right
there and I'm just going to copy and
let's say that we want to create put
some separation between that row we want
to create seven of these so I'm going to
go paste paste alright so I just copied
and pasted those file saved it and you
can see it created all those menu bars
for me every single one of them is
exactly the same and if you want to
change any of these individual items
that show up in
side of here that's quite simple to do
obviously we just come in here and
change this from menu one to whatever
you want it to be called and then inside
of here you could also change these from
item one to item two to item three to
item four and so forth and so on
but you might say hey I still feel
gypped you originally showed us a really
nicely laid out graphic with all the
sidebars and all that stuff well that's
going to be really hard to implement no
and actually not really we'll just take
the code that I created and the CSS
stylesheet website layout tool and here
it is there's the body that surrounds
everything there's the header and all
the CSS code that goes into creating all
those different things and this is
really the only complicated thing about
that tutorial and that's not even
complicated remember the only reason why
the sidebars floating there is because
of this guy right there okay so let's
say I want to take the menu and insert
it into this to make a complete web page
boy that must be really hard no it isn't
jump over here what we got to do is we
got a link to our external stylesheets
and our external javascript code so copy
that jump over here right under title
paste that in put a tab in if that makes
you happy
then jump over here back to where we
created the menu just go to the top of
this div and scroll to the bottom of the
screen down here to the bottom of this
div copy jump over here where we want
this to show up and we want to the menu
to show up actually after the header
part of the web page so what do we do we
go after the header div and we paste in
our menu and if we jump over here an
open menu three just you can see that
I'm not messing with you that's all it
took to build this whole entire website
I could have created this entire thing
and I don't know 15 minutes so that is
how to create an entire website layout
with a title bar footer main content
area sidebar as well as a menu bar
remember all the codes at new think-tank
commlink in the underbar if you have any
questions or comments leave them below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
