show you a way to put in a interactive
polling system and an interactive
questionnaire system on your website
without paying anybody anything using
google docs embedded techniques I know
that sounds real complicated what I'm
going to go through this as slow as
possible so that you understand it what
I did here was I created a questionnaire
system based off of something called
myers-briggs to help people that visit
my website figure out what job is best
for them now what this is is the this is
a google docs created form system you
can see here they enter their initial so
they can find themselves as a result
because i don't ever ask people to
subscribe to anything answer all the
questions and then go down to the bottom
and hit submit and that and then after
they do that it sucks out all their
results over on this page here and
there's the results so i give thy put
everybody in two different systems
different types of people different
types of personalities that i refer to
as the guides or as providers
communicators and so forth which I then
go under hang out explain them all is
named you can see here though whatever
people answer the questionnaire this
automatically updates and I'm able to
even do graphing systems to show how
everybody voted so you can see there's
more techies visiting their website met
announced and it's descriptions but I'll
jump over here to actually show you what
the spreadsheet looks like the generated
always first off you click here and
create your form but i'm going to show
you that in a minute what is a little
bit odd about Google Docs is if you edit
the form data in any way that it
automatically generates it normally
breaks the whole entire thing so make
sure that you create different sheets
and you can see down here I've created
one two three sheets the first sheet do
not touch just to allow that to be only
the information Google
grab from reform then you should be
perfectly fine over on sheet2 I then
quantify all of that information and you
can see right here exactly how i did it
i use the exacto you can see here it
says she won ! see to that is referring
to see two on the first sheet and then
what i did was i typed if exact their
answer was take over a business someone
started put down the number three and if
exact again same thing is equal to start
my own business give them the number
nine otherwise zero and that is how you
would pull that information in I would
then want to edit this information
instead of editing the rod animals I
don't want to bring my google document
so little tiny bit buggy but general
it's fabulous told it nobody seems
really think demand okay so here I
basically have the answers to all their
questions well over on sheet 3 I then
quantified if their answer represented
the way God if in a circumstance would
answer I would put a an additional point
Laura would add to the overall guide
personality type and you see how I did
that see here it's a sheet too ! c2 and
what this basically does is if they
answered as a guide in any of the
questions it adds one guide count and
that is how simple that is basically I
add up all the guide answers arts
dancers and then from that point decide
what type of person they are so you can
see over here you can also do
interactive graphs or charts and so
forth but I'm going to actually show you
right now how to create one of these
system
you're not used to the system go to
google.com click on settings and go to
Google account settings click on Google
Docs
then you wanna do is go create new
spreadsheet
they're going form create a form then
you want to tell you this would be the
title of your questionnaire explanation
of it there's different themes for your
forms that you could choose here you can
choose to email and see responses I mean
it's just really great so let's type in
something what fruit and then
you
what do you prefer help text by one I
can say it and get a text answer
paragraph multiple choice check boxes
all sorts of options i'm going to choose
multiple choice and then apple
click on this to make a required
question here you would end it here you
would duplicate a question here you
would trash a question then get done and
then you want to save it
and then you would see here based off of
how they answer i left the sample
question on that's why it's there but
based off of the answer that they give
you that's going to appear right here
and that's basically how you set up a
forum now if you wanted to take that
information and quantify remember we
don't want to change anything that we go
through here on a sheet what you would
do is if I go back to the my other page
and Google Docs and go back to the
guidance counselor now if I go back
to my other page you can see this your
sheet one again we don't want to edit
them go to sheet to take all the
information check the answers and then
give numbers based off of that answer
and then over on sheet 3 maybe to take
all this system what is actually on the
website and it is available to the world
so everybody can see all of this
information now if you wanted to share
that with people you would just quickly
go over here click on share and get link
to share and whenever you click on get
link to share it's actually going to
give you the length is some kind of
password so I can't do that but you just
simply flip go and get the link to share
and then dump that it's gonna be an
embed script you want to dump that into
your website and everything will just
work right on a time and if you create a
chart it's going to work in much the
same way
now if you wanted to add a chart like I
did right here are in bar graph you over
here to insert and hit chart and this is
what the chart system looks like then
what you would do is put in your letter
number code for each oh how you know on
your spreadsheet in here so this would
develop a span and if i wanted to
quantify all the data from say a 82 d
eight then i would just simply type that
in here and it would automatically make
the chart here so let's just do
something simple here just do I for to
je eat
and you can say it automatically pulls
all that data and creates the bar graph
then you can give the Charter title
define with horizontal vertical axis is
to find if you want to legend and do all
sorts of other neat little things with
it then you would just click on this
chart button right here if you wanted to
publish on your website and click on
publish chart and it would give you a
link directly to this chart basically
how you would set up a Google
questionnaire / polling system on your
website I think it's pretty easy it's
all basically just type in the
information in I gave you all of the
different codes in regards to formulas
that you can use but if anything was a
little bit complicated it still is a
little bit complicated feel free to
comment below thanks for watching a
