my jQuery / Ajax tutorial today I'm
going to show you how to be able to
select pretty much any of these
different elements on this web page I
know it's a mess don't worry about that
we're going to clean it up and then
dirty it up again with a bunch of
different selection tools that are
available with jQuery first thing I want
to explain to you is that Ajax ray
synchronous JavaScript and XML is not a
programming language it's just a series
of techniques used to dynamically change
webpages communicate with a server
without page reloads and what jQuery
does is it allows us to do this cross
browser on any browser extremely easily
and also at the same time jQuery adds
numerous different functions as well as
user interface widgets and plugins that
will really save you an immense amount
of time
Ajax can completely be done using
nothing but JavaScript but jQuery makes
that process a lot easier you're going
to see that today now whenever you first
want to install the jQuery library or
framework whatever you want to call it
it's a series of functions and tools and
so forth it can automatically add to
your scripts this is what you do just
type in script type and then define it
as a JavaScript file and here what I did
was actually linked to the jQuery
library that's available from Google
what this will do is depending upon
where in the world your client is who's
looking at your website it will
automatically load in the closest
version of this library and you can see
here I'm specifically loading in jQuery
1.5 what's really great about this also
is if this becomes one point five two or
one point five six this is going to be
smart enough to automatically load the
best newest version of jQuery 1.5
directly in here for you to be able to
use and just to give you an example this
whole entire tutorial for the most part
is going to be just example example
example but let's say you wanted to
select all TD tags those are column tags
inside of tables using just JavaScript
well if you saw my JavaScript tutorial
if you didn't you should probably watch
that this is how you would do that get
element by tag name and write like this
you'd have to type all that stuff out in
jQuery all you'd have to type out is a
dollar sign and then TD and that would
allow you
select the same thing as all of this
type and would do for you so that's just
one of the reasons why people use jQuery
it is so extremely easy to use saves you
a ton of typing and the same is also
true if you want to get element by ID if
you'd want to select all the different
h3 tags in the document they lie inside
of a paragraph tag you just type in P
for the paragraph tag dot h3 there you
go now you can access and change
dynamically any h3 tag that lies inside
of a paragraph so that is how you do
some of those things I'm going to get
into some specific things that you can
do with jQuery to get you real excited
so let's just go down in here and this
is just basic HTML there's nothing
really fancy here I'm going to show you
how to get things based off of ID names
based off of class name is based off of
where they lie inside of other elements
and so forth and so on just a bunch of
random things this is just a bunch of
random information over here nothing
that important well what I'm going to do
here first is I'm going to call jQuery
since I have it loaded in the document
and I'm going to say document whenever
you are ready for me to execute and
that's what we're doing right there I
want you to execute this series of
functions that I lie inside of this
anonymous function we went over this and
my JavaScript tutorial how to create
anonymous functions in jQuery is
actually known is what we call a
namespace but I won't get into the
specifics of that right now because
they're not really important but let's
say you wanted to select all the TD tags
that lie over here on the right side of
your screen and automatically add
padding so this table doesn't look like
such a mess exactly how much work would
go into that and of course before you we
want to start typing this in here we
want to make sure we close this off by
ending that curly bracket right there
and then by putting an end right there
with that parenthesis okay so now this
is all closed off and everything I put
inside here is going to be executed as
soon as the document is ready which is
absolutely awesome let me scroll that
off okay so what let's get back to it
I'm going to select all the TD tags
inside of the document here on the right
side since I want to do some CSS editing
to type in CSS and then I'm going to
call padding which is a CSS attribute
that we're able to edit you can edit all
the different CSS attributes and I'm
six pixels ten pixels on the right right
like that and that's it I just did it
and let's jump over here and you could
say padding's been added right there
dynamically that's been added and this
also could have been triggered through
an event that occurred on the webpage or
any number of other different things so
that's kind of cool let's say we want to
match all elements of class here oh well
over here you can see this is a list the
beyonders unknown Galactus is a melon
and these two guys are here as well and
they both have the class of hero so
let's say I want to be able to come in
here and grab those guys and just so you
know what I mean here they are over here
see a class equals hero for these last
two guys hopefully get that alright so
we're going to go back into jQuery again
we're going to type in dot H ero which
is how you define that you want to grab
a class named hero and then we're going
to come in here and your CSS and we're
going to say that we want to edit the
color which is the color of the text you
really need to know CSS to use jQuery
and just by putting a little bit of code
inside of there you can see these two
guys are now red which is awesome let's
try some more let's say we want to match
all Li tags let's just list item tags
with the class name villain well come in
here and you define that you want to
find the UL element and then you want to
look for specific Li tags of type class
of villain and you want a CSS style them
and you want to change the background
color to yellow and we're not really
doing this what I'm demonstrating here
is how to select different elements
based off of what you're looking for
we're not doing this for us that extra
to make this look pretty you can see
Galactus was the only villain so we
highlighted him in yellow and that's how
we did that know could also decide that
we want to match everything of ID this
is important you go and search for ID
names in a different way how do you do
that use the hash symbol and we're going
to say numbers and this whole entire div
here is called numbers and then let's
just say we want to come in here and do
some CSS styling just to make my life a
little bit easier go in there and type
that and background color and let's say
we want to change this to gray okay we
just did that and this whole entire day
is going to be gray now and it is
beautiful now if you wanted to actually
match multiple different tags inside a
jQuery that's also easy so let's say
want to match all the
h3 tags and all the th tags well you
just separate them with a comment you
put as many in there as you want and
again let's say we want to come in here
dot CSS background color and then let's
change this to orange so that stands out
and we do it and we do it now every h3
and th tag has set a background color of
orange so that's how you would be able
to trigger multiple different tags
inside of here you can also match all h3
tags that are immediately preceded by a
paragraph tag okay so you can do this
for any of these different tags that are
available in HTML so I'm saying okay I
want the next h3 tag that is preceded by
a paragraph tag that's what that means
right there that plus sign and then I
want to come in here and change that to
purple and we do that h3 tag let's just
figure out exactly this is it's going to
be this guy right here it's going to be
this little super guy h3 the most
important numbers that's going to be
affected and you can see that I actually
applied this edit here well this is
actually going to override it since it
comes to last you can see it has indeed
overridden it most important numbers now
is set for a background color of purple
and let's say we want to match all
elements that are siblings of something
else so what we're going to do is we're
going to specifically target down here
where it says stuff one stuff to stuff
through what I'm going to tell it to do
is I'm going to tell it I want you to
match for all h4 tags this guy's in h4
that is a sibling of this guy right here
and this little guy right here actually
has an ID of R and stuff so how do you
match for R and stuff this ID name and
find a very specific sibling I'm going
to show you I'm in here we're going to
type in R and stuff since that's an ID
and then we're going to hit tilde it's
in the upper left hand corner of your
keyboard if you don't know I'm going to
say I want to match any h4 tags that are
siblings of that guy and let's just copy
this down here put up these is paste it
in there file save and you can see it's
now purple just like we wanted it to
find and you say well I want to also get
the other tag well the tag underneath
that's an h5 tag so we're just going to
type in comma
h5 and we'll be able to grab both of
them and as you can see I just did that
so that is how you actually get
blings of other things inside of jQuery
we can also make all child elements of
the class superhumans italic this is how
we do that so come in here super humans
and then we want to get the child
elements so everything that lies inside
of super humans is going to be changed
to italic so how do we say every element
well we just put a star inside of there
that represents every element and I'm
just gonna say font dash down sound like
close that off jump over here reload and
you can see all the children elements
that lie inside of that guy are now
italic so that's what that brace does
that targets children elements there's
literally almost anything you could
imagine defined inside a jQuery in
regards to grabbing something like here
we're going to underline all the
elements in a div that contains a h4 tag
so we're going to say div we're looking
for a div that has h4 tag inside of it
say just speak it out just like you
think it and we're going to come in here
dot CSS now when you get a text
decoration comma underlined and you can
see and underlined all of those
different guys inside of there because
that div contained an h4 tag okay so
that's why those are all underlined now
you can also select a div for example
with an ID defined and if you choose put
a border around it same sort of thing if
ID dot CSS in here border and let's
create ourselves a border px let's make
it solid black and you can see that now
these divs have borders around them just
like that and the reason why is because
this div has an ID associated with it
and this div as an ID associated with it
let's say we come in here and we say we
don't want this ID in there anymore if
I'll save it and it'll go away C went
away so that's how you can define based
off of whether an element has an ID or
not just simply having that attribute
you can also select let's say Li tags
based off of having a class which is
equal to a value of hero be very
specific about what you're looking for
make sure you put double quotes in front
of that right now
and let's say we want to put CSS and
let's just say we want to put a border
around all our heroes to protect them
from the villains and the unknown just
copy that paste it in there and let's
just change this to blue and maybe two
pixels so these are the two heroes let's
reload it and you can see now they're
surrounded by blue borders again we can
change all these based off of events
based off a timers based off of anything
almost anything's available and possible
inside of jQuery and what's really neat
let's actually just copy this line
remember I said this is a very specific
way we're looking just for classes with
heroes well we can search for things in
very nonspecific ways let's just put a
caret symbol inside of that what that's
going to do is it's going to return all
the tags that have an attribute set of
type class and these attributes can be
any attributes they could be border they
could be anything you want and let's say
that we just demand that it begins with
a letter V so we want an li tag that
just begins with a letter V and if you
give us one we want to change it to
purple what's that going to match it's
gonna match galactus who is of type
class villain see we didn't have to type
all that out and you can see there now
he's surrounded with a purple border
let's come in here copy and paste us
again and let's say that we want to find
any matches that end with a certain
number of characters and let's just put
in unknown okay we got that in there and
let's change this to orange
I'll say boink now they are both
surrounded with orange we want to just
come in here and select the Beyonder put
in a W that's gonna get me unknown and
unknown easy and it's going to leave
Galactus as purple as we left him in the
past you can put multiple different
letters in there you put just one letter
you can do anything you want we can also
select based off of whether a certain
element in this situation I'm going to
say that it's a list item whether inside
of there the text contained with inside
of it is of type let's say Richards so
here we're specifically looking for the
text that's inside of it close that off
with that there and then let's just jump
up here and grab background color dot
CSS and then we'll change this to cyan
to make it stand out so these two are
going to change background color cyan
and they did so that was just based off
the text
is contained inside of them now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to do some
styling on this absolutely god-awful
looking table up here so first off let's
come up here and let's get rid of this
gray so it doesn't look quite so hideous
and then I'm going to jump into the
styling area I'm going to show you how
to change classes and I'm gonna get more
into this in later tutorials I just want
to give you a taste to this just so you
see some of the other power that's
available inside of take query so let's
say I want to do some styling and I want
to say table th and TD and let's say we
want to create a border of one pixel
make it solid make it black there we are
and then we're going to also create
table row we're going to call it nice
table column do some styling on this
background FA F a g2 and we're going to
create another definition that is going
to be triggered when Mouse rolls over
this guy okay
this mouse on has nothing to do with
this event though I just wanted to give
you a taste of what can be done with
events background in here we're gonna
say one e9o FF so we just find these
three different types of styles these
are the two we're going to be playing
but with the let's jump back down into
our jquery area and here i'm going to
show you how to change the class
definitions for elements of the ID
numbers which is up here let's just file
save this just so we can say okay so you
can see it's a little bit nice or not
doesn't have that hideous grayness to it
all right so let's come in here again
changing elements of type ID numbers so
numbers is this right here and yes this
is true actually by the way so I'm going
to say TR and I'm going to say that I
want to change the class on just the odd
rows in this table and I go dot add
class which is jQuery method or function
or whatever you want to call it and I'm
going to say I want to change the class
to nice so this is going to make it look
a little bit prettier say now the colors
are a little bit changed on here so it
looks a little bit nicer if you want
this to affect just the even rows you
just change odd to even it's not rocket
science II know it's like that but I
like odd better so I'm gonna leave it
odd alright let's do some more just one
more example this is nice
now I'm going to show you how to change
the class definition based off of my
movements and in the next tutorial going
to show you how to change a ton of
things based off of events as they are
triggered on the page so that should be
really fun okay so I'm going to go TR
and then I'm going to come in here and
I'm going to say on a mouse-over and if
you're used to JavaScript you know
what's going on here
trigger an anonymous function by
anonymous I just mean it doesn't have a
name that's all this this is a reference
to this element that I'm performing
these changes on so it's going to be
this guy anything that matches up over
here that's what this is and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say mouse on
so I'm going to change the class to the
mouse on class and I'm going to close
off this anonymous function right like
that well then I'm not done because now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
into numbers again and I'm going to say
if the mouse moves out so Mouse out too
hard to remember function call this
anonymous function this and then I'm
going to say remove class doink curly
braces on and that okay super so what I
do
I'll save rewind it so you can see the
colors are now changed but what's also
neat is as my mouse moves over it's
changing the background color to that
bluish color and then changing it back
when my mouse moves off of it so there's
a ton of different ways to select
numerous different things with jQuery
have any questions or comments leave
them below I will be getting into event
handling I will cover everything in
jQuery in the upcoming tutorials and all
the code is available there's a link in
the underbar if you don't want to
actually type this out till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
