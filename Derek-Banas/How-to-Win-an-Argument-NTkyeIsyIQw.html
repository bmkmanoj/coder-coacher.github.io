I win an argument so in this
presentation I'm gonna go through the
step-by-step way to win an argument
first off this is a rundown of exactly
how to win an argument I will of course
code deeply into all of these subjects
however don't argue use welcoming body
language get them to like you listen to
their side avoid saying the word that
they dislike get them to agree that they
will listen outloud meaning get them to
say out loud that they will listen get
them to agree with your core principle
out loud again tell them they have
crafted your new beliefs and then simply
list all of the issues you agree on and
the new one they previously disagreed on
now I'm gonna go over how not to argue
when most people are trying to win an
argument they do the following they
tighten up their body language into an
aggressive pose rattle off a bunch of
reasons why they are right dismiss the
other person's points raise their tone
of voice shake their head no and provide
other negative actions ask yourself
would you be willing to discuss an issue
with a person that is putting off all of
this negative energy if you knew they
weren't listening to you would you even
bother to listen to them it is very
important to get the other person to
like and respect you first you have to
change the word argument into the word
discussion you also have to stop
thinking about winning and it said
strive to come to an amicable decision
so why do people disagree very often
people disagree just because they don't
like each other they may dislike each
other personally or simply dislike
people of a certain profession or a
certain person based off of religion or
other things if you sense they dislike
you then winning the argument is
secondary you must first get them to
like you you do this by finding common
interests and beliefs people like people
who are like themselves so show them how
you are similar and win them over that
way people also like people that like
them in your conversation find something
that you both love tell them that you
love that also if you can find any way
to say honestly to them
that you like them of course do that
past experiences also guide opinions I'm
going to assume you and the other person
have discovered some subjects that you
both agree on why then would they still
disagree with you well we all have
beliefs that have shown over time to be
correct and if someone challenges those
beliefs aggressively we'll push right
back on them so instead you need to let
them know you want to hear their side at
the same time you want to set up a
situation in which they understand if
you listen to them they'll hear you out
if someone is against a word just shift
the conversation towards a word they
bike abortion is a good example here
people are either for or against
abortion so don't use the word it's
instead easier to get someone to agree
that they are against killing a child of
course or saving a dying mother
so instead focus on those principles and
ignore the word abortion altogether try
hard also to get the other person to
agree with principles you agree with
ignore again the volatile work nobody is
100% for or against anything they just
act like they are when they feel they're
being attacked so don't try to just get
them to say I was wrong and I'm now for
or against whatever the issue is that
you both disagree on you then want to
get the other person to listen you
people will follow through on statements
they make out loud it's known as the
consistency principle so get them to
state out loud that they are going to
listen simply say I normally wouldn't
talk about my beliefs but you are a
person that's willing to listen am i
right if they give you a positive
response they will now listen to you you
then want to look for common ground I
found that people value freedom over all
other things especially the freedom to
do what they want
while not hurting anyone else if you can
somehow latch on to this idea of
limiting freedom you may be on to
something find the core reason why you
believe what you believe and then get
the person to admit that that core value
is important to them as well anything
you believe in strongly is based off of
core personal values never attack a
person's core values if
you do it we'll build walls and it will
not listen to you also if your body
language also shows that you're
listening you'll gain an edge best
possible position you can take includes
sitting with legs slightly spread elbows
on calves as you lean forward cross
fingers with your palms facing downwards
then place your head on top of your
hands as if on a platter maintain eye
contact and of course smile you also
want to pay attention to the other
person's body language if they start
mirroring your position which means
copying it
they are agreeable to you and like you
if however they have their arms and legs
crossed items between you and them are
maintaining almost no eye contact and a
frown on their face they are not liking
you and they are be disagreeable towards
you to get them out of this pose you
need to mirror them and then shift back
into an agreeable pose and hope that
they follow you so here's where you
currently act the other person has
agreed with you on other subjects they
also have agreed to like certain things
about you they have agreed to listen to
you out loud of course you've gotten
them to agree to your core belief out
loud and also your body language is
welcoming and hopefully you have turned
their body language into a welcoming
position now you need to listen to them
listen to their ideas don't enter at
this point and only question for clarity
on a subject not to be disagreeable now
it's time to win the argument you need
to now get the person to agree that you
are right in the smallest of ways let's
say they are completely against
immigration of any kind get them to
agree to a question such as this would
you agree that there is one person of
value outside of the United States who
doesn't then say do you think the United
States would benefit from having this
one person as a citizen if they say yes
to both of these you're well on your way
to winning your argument then you want
to continue slowly building that person
towards an understanding of the benefits
of immigration for example now you want
to provide some additional information
that the other person doesn't currently
know give them an opportunity to save
face it's much easier for a person to
say well with this new information you
provided I now see your point than it is
to change their opinion because you have
told them they are stupid after you'll
follow these steps tell the other person
that you have been influenced by their
opinions state those new ways that you
agree but at the same time interject how
you may disagree here's an example
I agree them unbridled immigration can
have dire consequences then go on to
list other things that they brought up
that would be negative reasons why
immigration should be limited and then
here's the important point state at the
end of this statement and we both agree
that eliminating immigration altogether
would be a mistake the important word
there is and as you were listing your
agreements and disagreements don't use
the word but but as a negative word you
should constantly aim instead to build a
positive atmosphere and but will disturb
that atmosphere this is a bit of
trickery based off of what is called the
yes set the yes set states that if
someone says yes a certain number of
times that they will continue to say yes
would you want to do is first to get
them to agree with something they
definitely agree with then agree with
something they pretty much agree with
then agree with something they partially
agree with and then finally you want
them to agree with your core belief and
the basic principles that you believe it
if you separate the first three
statements with the word and you will of
course dramatically increase your
results if you can as well make the
other person think they crafted your new
beliefs you have won the argument I did
this presentation because Kelly B asked
me to here are a list of other things I
could do presentations on if you'd like
me to talk about any of those things
