examples writing copy that sells part
two twice as nice as the first one and
by all means if you didn't watch part
one you should most definitely watch it
before you watch part 2 or it will make
no sense I'm going to go over today some
proven steps for writing headline
teasers to end tons and tons of other
things first here are some tips begin
headlines with words such as introducing
announcing new now at last I'm gonna
blow through these because if you want
to look at them you can just simply
pause the video or you've got a website
and copy paste wanted this because if
advice put a date in your headline this
all comes from proven techniques and
tons and tons of research on what works
in regards to headline teasers offer a
free offer offer information about you
tell a story use testimonial style and
so forth and so now on to the headlines
what you want to do right now is write a
paragraph that describes your product or
service including your company while
keeping in mind that information we
reviewed so far in the previous
presentation and since so far today now
take that information as well as from
the rest of the presentation and try to
write headlines if you actually went
through the activities I provided in the
last presentation that should be no
problem at all now ask questions of your
headlines does the headline promise a
benefit or a reward for reading the copy
does it get your point across simply and
quickly is the headline as specific as
possible does it reach out and grab your
attention with a strong selling message
does the headline logically relate to
the product do that headline and visual
work together does the headline arouse
curiosity as a headline select the
audience mentioned in a previous
presentation if you provide a service
for bed wetters and nobody else you
should address the bed
letters in your headline is the
advertisers name used in the headline
and always always always avoid negatives
in regards to illustration xand pictures
after your headline the next logical
place that people look in your
advertisement is your photograph or
photographs and then what they do is
they look at any information that is
written that provides more information
on the photograph and then it would move
on to the beginning of your copying and
into the body of your copy the subject
of your illustration you must remember
is very important and the kind of
photographs which work hardest are those
which arouse readers curiosity don't
have a story to tell it's often good to
present or show the product you're
trying to sell it as an illustration and
very recently a gallup poll found by
studying seventy campaigns that not a
single before-and-after campaign did not
increase sales so if there's any way to
fit in it before and after campaign into
your presentation go for it photographs
also attract more readers than
illustrations because it more believable
the use of characters known to people
who may see your advertisement will
boost recall keep your illustrations as
simple as possible crowd scenes do not
pull attention don't ever show human
faces enlarge beyond their natural signs
historical subjects have been shown for
the majority of readers do not assume
that subjects which interest you will
necessarily interest consumers
especially if it's jargon laden
full-color advertisements cost fifty
percent more but pull a hundred percent
more people that find them more
memorable so go color what are the best
polling photos of all these are on order
first off you must understand men buy
products from ads featuring men and
women too as well then the most polling
photograph of all Brides then babies
animals famous people people in on
costumes people in what situations
pictures the tell story romantic
pictures catastrophe pictures news
pictures
santa claus the president's pictures of
the product in use a close-up picture of
the product photos pull better than
illustrations make sure you remember
that and the best polling picture of all
is a face looking directly at the reader
okay we got the customer to read a
headline then look at the photograph now
what you better have a very dynamic
first paragraph here are some ways to
start off your first paragraph use an
interrupting idea start with a startling
statement or a novel twist that brings
through the board a barrier that often
exists in them under the reader a
shocker closely related to the above
however more shocking news II make a
current event statement preview a
sentence that briefly previews the copy
quotation you know that is a story begin
the copy as if you would a book so let's
say you are trying to sell a product for
bed wetters you might provide a nice
catchy headline and then open your
paragraph with she was running down the
street something was following her she
was trying to get away she didn't know
what to do like that I know I'm not a
novelist but either way you basically
want to do the opposite of what the
headline says and jump right into the
middle of story what an example of how
to do that in a great way read Reader's
Digest note while using the above
openings you must stay on track in
regards to your headlines if you catch
their eye with the headline don't lose
interest with a disjointed first
paragraph the most important five
percent of people are reading your
copies so make sure you don't waste
their time and you must also remember
the purpose of the advertisement is to
get attention by providing the strongest
benefit through the use of the headline
of visual recreate a need for your
service in the headline and first
paragraph satisfy the need in the second
paragraph prove your superiority
throughout the following paragraphs
through the use of testimonials product
comparison studies years of business
benefit lists and at the end of the ad
ask for the order either by offering for
example or coupon or some way for them
to contact you everybody is a story of
Pavlov and how a sugar Belle one may
just all salivate why did Pavlov choose
to use a bell instead of an image
there was no reason it was just the
first thing he did because he later on
tested the dog to see if he could make
it sound of HS by showing in an image
and he did it salivated when they showed
us a simple circle and then stop
salivating over time by showing him an
ellipse what pavlov did was he slowly
started to make the circle more
elliptical and made the elliptic o blips
more circular and what did he do he
confused the dog you have to understand
that the main point of your
advertisement is to get people to take
action through focus repetitive actions
mixed signals such as Pavlov found with
this dog will only cause the public to
totally ignore your advertiser so now
what we want to do and then exercises
picture someone you know and write them
a letter that describes in detail how
excited you are about your new business
or your own business ask yourself while
writing will the reader understand what
I wrote doesn't letter tell them
something important new are useful and
does this letter influence the reader to
buy from me here are some tips on you
talking in a conversational tone use
pronouns such as I we you and I use
colloquial expressions a short thing
turn on rip off ok use contractions
there your it's here we've I'm etc use
simple words right naturally even if you
might not always be grammatically
correct how to add interest your copy
speak directly to the readers length
emotions needs and desires rate about
real people use copy that tells a story

security family careers education social
issues answer important issues society
