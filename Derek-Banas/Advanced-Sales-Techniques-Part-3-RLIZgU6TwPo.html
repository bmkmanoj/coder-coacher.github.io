3 of my sales and closing strategies
tutorial today I'm going to go over how
to identify needs how to establish a yes
set how to test rapport and then go over
why customers say no while training
sales people over the years I've been
amazed that most never ask customers
about needs most simply just jump in and
explain why they personally like the
product you should never do this in this
video I'm going to cover the reasons
customers by I'm going to show you how
to get customers to give the reasons
they won't buy to talk a little bit
about how to build rapport I did a whole
entire video on rapport building called
get people to like you if you want more
information report is extremely
important and with this information you
will now just simply feedback the
positives and disqualify the negatives
and then assume the sale in talking with
your customers you must get them to list
their needs and then prioritize them you
then feedback those main needs using
their chosen strategy which I talked
about in part 2 of this tutorial system
for making buying decisions so simply
you must start off by asking a client to
list those needs that the product or
service needs to fill you then must
identify those needs that are the most
crucial versus the needs that would just
be nice to have after you nail down the
immediate needs ask the client what else
do you need this product or service to
do then as they list those features it's
your job to translate them into benefits
you want to get your customer to imagine
themselves owning the product throughout
the entire presentation start asking
them what other benefits can they see
this product providing don't ever
suggest benefits instead have them
explain their own personal benefits
again remember you are not buying this
product they are research is actually
shown if you get the client to confirm
positively seven times on topics
relating to your product the chances
they will buy go up dramatically this
becomes easy if you get them to list the
top seven benefits they wish to gain
from the product or service this is the
S set process in the next tutorial I'll
go over it definitively but this is
simply what you do get them to list the
features they're looking for get them to
translate those features into their
personal benefits not yours feed those
benefits back as you wait for their
positive affirmations say for example so
you're looking for a product or service
that will provide this benefit wait for
affirmation rinse and
p you should never disagree in any way
never say well we can get this this and
this but we can't get this at this price
if they stated that price is of least
importance this may be a possibility
though show them the triangle chart
again that I talked about in previous
tutorial to figure out what's most
important cost quality or convenience if
you get any pushback from the customer
to simply step back reestablish rapport
in question for more benefits if you
don't know what report is again go and
watch get people to like you throughout
your presentation you want the first
mirror the client and then check if
rapport is established you perform this
check by changing your position to see
if the client follows you if they do you
know then that you are definitively in
sync and if they follow you while you
are presenting you know that they are
more unlikely ready to buy at that
moment if time has passed between first
meeting client and now representing the
solution you must re-establish your poor
of course never offer a plan unless you
are certain that report has been
established rapport establishes trust
and without trust it does not matter how
good your plan is you're a couple
reasons a customer may say no I've
established that most customers say no
when they don't trust you personally
this occurs if you don't establish
rapport or you hesitate during your
presentation in fact most I need to
think about it objections occur because
the salesman hesitated somewhere during
presenting and did not constantly assume
that the client was going to buy the
product or service and you must ask
yourself if you don't believe in your
product why are you presenting it to the
customer at all it's your job to find
the benefits match them with the perfect
solution and then sell the perfect
solution and why would you ever hesitate
when you find what is best for the
customer another reason why a person
might say no is that some people are
just not in a hurry by nature so you
have to give them a reason to make a
decision but of course be honest one way
to do this is to introduce uncertainty
may your products price go up maybe the
product won't be available when the
client needs it I don't know that's
something you have to figure out on your
own but you must give them a reason to
buy now people do not also like losing
the ability or freedom to do anything so
figure out how they will lose that
ability to buy your scarce product and
then they will buy the excuse of having
no money should never be an ex
use if the customer says they don't have
enough money they're really saying you
haven't shown me this product provides
me enough value that is all you also
might find that you're not talking to a
decision maker you should make sure
everyone involved in making the final
decision is available at the time of the
presentation never provide the plan
until you are absolutely positive that
this is true in part 4 of the sales and
closing strategies tutorial I'll provide
a complete coverage on how to utilize
the yes set the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
