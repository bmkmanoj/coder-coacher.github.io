teach you some indirect hypnosis mind
games or more specifically how to fool
people into thinking you are controlling
them through suggestibility tests these
are tricks that make the other person
think you have power over them if you
master these techniques you'll be able
to hypnotize people without them knowing
and what's more important is once you
trick someone into thinking you have
power over them they'll accept the
wilder and louder commands these are
tricks I actually learned when I was
really really young these are tricks I
learned when I was really really young
of course I didn't know that they would
call suggest ability test until much
later and they're also tests this stage
hypnotists I use on people to see if
they are easy to hypnotize these tricks
can be used to amuse others or to
improve your ability to hypnotize people
I'll teach you the tricks in the order
of complexity the first one is extremely
simple so just know that right out front
while performing these always act in
control no matter how your subject acts
act as if the trick is working if the
subject acts as you want make sure you
complement them you want to constantly
be giving them positive affirmations
move the subject slowly through the test
these tests normally only fail if the
subject gets confused and doesn't know
exactly what you were asking them to do
first we'll do the real simple one they
get much more complicated and a lot more
interesting after this this is called
the hand relaxation trick after you do
this trick your subject will be more
likely to fall for the other tricks
basically all you need them to do is ask
them to perform the following tell them
to sit up and then stand up straight
then give them a positive affirmation
tell them to raise their hands in front
of them tell them to point straight up
with their right index finger and make
sure again that the hands are still out
in front of them give them another
positive affirmation tell them to place
their left hand palm onto their index
finger another positive affirmation and
while you are doing this demonstrate
this and make sure the left hand is out
in front say concentrate on relaxing
your left hand completely so relax that
the only thing holding it up is your
right finger tell them when your hand is
completely relaxed to the point you
can't relax it anymore to nod to you
when they nod say okay
three remove your right finger and then
proceed with one two three their hand
should immediately drop to their side
then what you want to do is to quickly
give them a positive affirmation and
move directly into the next trip this is
another trick that should never fail to
perform this trick you will need a
string with a ball coin or washer etc
tied to the end and then you want to say
following hold the pendulum in front of
you between your thumb and index finger
positive affirmation keep your hands
still keep it very still say concentrate
hard concentrate and think about the
pendulum swinging from side to side you
are following my directions very well
you want to give them again a positive
affirmation think about swinging back
and forth you're now following
directions very well think about it
swinging in a circle now make sure as
you are going through this exercise that
you give them time for the pendulum to
move however if you direct them to move
in a certain direction but it goes in
another just quickly switch your
suggestion around to make them feel as
if they are indeed following your
suggestions this is my absolute favorite
trick because it can't fail if they
follow your directions also this is the
first trick in which your subject will
believe you are truly controlling them
what you're actually doing is telling
them to do something that is physically
impossible something that they can't do
if they follow your directions tell them
you are going to show them how their
subconscious can make certain muscles
stop working tell them to sit in a chair
up straight hold your index finger
meaning you're going to hold your index
finger up and ask them to focus on the
tip then give a positive affirmation say
close your eyes but look at my finger
through your eyelids tell them you will
help them find your finger and then what
you want to do is place your finger on
in the middle of their forehead just a
right above their brow line and tell
them to look at it and their eyes move
complement them say now feel your eyes
becoming more relaxed feel them lock
down as they are glued shut
watch my finger as your eyelids become
more stuck together now move your finger
to the top of their scalp right at their
hairline and ask them to continue
watching your finger after you see their
eyes move say now as you watch my finger
try to open
while continuing to focus on my finger
if they focus on your finger they will
find it hard to open their eyes so state
that it is hard to open them because
they are sealed shut as you look at my
finger then give them another positive
affirmation say they will remain tightly
closed as you watch my finger but now
relax tell them to stop trying move your
finger away complement them and ask them
to open their eyes and they'll be able
to the reason why again they're unable
to open their eyes is because the
muscles in the eyes will not allow them
to do it so but either way they think
you did that you totally are controlling
them so that's what our whole entire
gain is here then you have the finger
lock trick this trick also takes
advantage of involuntary muscle
movements here I teach you how to trick
someone into thinking you can control
the movements of their hands tell them
to stand with their feet shoulder length
apart positive affirmation ask them to
hold their hands up stretch in front of
them and you want to demonstrate what
you want them to do here now say clasp
your hands together as if you are
praying tell them now twist your hands
only so your knuckles are pointed
towards the ceiling and again you want
to demonstrate this say extend your two
pointer fingers up and hold them an inch
apart from each other
tell them to concentrate on their
fingers and in a moment I'm going to
crank those fingers together they will
touch as I crank and you can make a
cranking noise or crank with your hand
or do whatever you want because you will
feel as if I have wrapped a rubber band
around them you want to say say you feel
them being pulled closer and closer
together now tighter and tighter and
again make cranking noises or do
whatever you want to help move them
along and then you want to just continue
with the previous phrase until they
touch don't worry it will work because
of involuntary muscle tension they will
find it very hard to resist your
commands so I hope you like this this is
just a couple little goofy tricks you
can try and like I said before if you
have people go through the
suggestibility test they are more than
likely going to be easily hypnotized by
you in the future
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
