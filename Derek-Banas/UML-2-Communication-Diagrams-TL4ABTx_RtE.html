my UML 2 video tutorial today I'm going
to talk about communication diagrams
however before you watch this if you
haven't watched the tutorial on sequence
diagrams you should definitely check
that out first and I provide a link
above to that because I'm going to be
teaching about communication diagrams by
comparing them to the more common
sequence diagrams so let's get into it
this presentation is going to be a
little bit different than my normal ones
because I wanted to do a lot of
comparisons I have to fit everything on
the screen so on the left side of your
screen you see the sequence diagrams
which focus on the order of interactions
between the different participants in
your program or system on the right side
you see the communication diagram a
communication diagram is used to show
links between participants and it has
four main parts being the participants
which are the same as you can see right
here these two guys here communication
links there are no lifelines there are
communication links that link the
different participants that interact and
the messages that are going to be passed
and the messages have the same main
format as a sequence diagram meaning the
message name or the method name any
arguments followed by their class
separated by a colon and then another
colon and the return type and you can
see those documented down here and then
the fourth part of a communication
diagram which is often disregarded is
the number which is going to label how
all of these different participants are
going to interact and how their messages
are going to interact and I'm going to
show you this in a big detailed frame
but as you can see here whenever you
create your first message you're going
to just put a number the second message
is just going to increment that however
once you hit a new participant you are
then going to add an additional number
on the end and then if we would continue
to send additional messages from this
participant over here we would increment
this second number while leaving the
first number as it is so there you go
it's the links the participants the
messages and the message numbers so
let's focus in even further here you can
see what a nested method looks like
inside of a sequence diagram and what I
mean by a nested method
is you send a message which causes
another message to be sent to another
participant then there's a response and
maybe the another messages type and then
another response and then finally we
come back to the original participant
that's what I mean by a nested method
inside of communication diagram however
we are going to send message a then
remember we hit a new participant so we
have to add an additional number and
then we are not going to need to have
the returned arrows like you see right
here because this is just showing the
main one-time interaction between the
different participants now we move on to
if multiple messages are executed at the
same time as you can see here with
sequence diagrams we had to surround
those by what we're called sequence
fragments if we wanted to show messages
that were sent in parallel however with
communication diagrams what we're going
to do is just simply add a letter onto
this guy
the first message sent in parallel is
gonna have an A and then a B and then C
D F G and just keep going on and on and
on I also want to draw your attention to
a call to self with sequence diagrams
you're going to draw a little arrow out
that's then going to bounce back and
this will be used to demonstrate an
object calling its own method
if this specific participant was an
object in this situation however a call
to self with a communication diagram is
going to be shown with a box with no
arrows and then you're outside of that
box that's going to sort of look like
it's laying underneath of this
participant you're going to draw an
arrow inside of there then put a message
number and the message itself and I'm
abbreviating these messages just to make
everything fit so those are the
different ways to show parallel
executions of methods using both
sequence diagrams and communication
diagrams as well as how call to self
differs between the two different types
of diagrams and if it makes more sense
to show it in a non left-to-right manner
this is another example of communication
diagram nested message as you see
there's one for the message it's the
second participant adds another number
on to there sends another message here
if we were going to then send another
message from this participant we would
add another number one after that as
you're gonna see later on and as well
here's another way to show parallel
method executions using communication
diagrams just basically have to remember
the link between those participants that
are interacting and then drawing an
arrow based off of who is asking who a
specific message and then you have to
draw in an arrow that represents who is
sending a message to whatever
participant that is in the diagram now
here I'm going to show you the
difference between executing methods
multiple times with a sequence diagram
once again you're going to use a
sequence fragment with sequence diagrams
this little box here and here I'm going
to loop through sending this message to
this participant 10 times the same exact
thing is going to be done down here with
this communication diagram I'm going to
be sending this same message ten times
as well and in this situation you're
just going to put zero through nine
representing the first index being a
zero and that is really the only thing
that's going to change you're going to
rely less on boxes with communication
diagrams and rely more on object
constraints as we're going to get to
here in a second you can just see here
you're just going to put a star inside
of there a variable equals and then how
many times you want to loop through
that's basically all you need to do to
show that a message will be executed
based on conditions we're going to use
guard conditions as you see here is a
guard condition and here is the same
guard condition and assert is going to
work in exactly the same way you can see
here I have option and alt and this is
going to work like an if or an else
statement in this situation we're just
going to send these two messages in
parallel however we are not going to
execute certain messages if the guard
statement does not come back as true so
that's really how that is going to work
out there and just review the object
constraint language don't really need to
worry about these data types but these
are the basic arithmetics types being
addition subtraction multiplication
division modulus which is going to
return the remainder absolute value
minimum and maximum and really with
comparison operators the only thing you
have to worry about is this guy right
here is equal to not equal and then you
have your boolean and or XOR and knots
and then we move into the random sort of
things you're going to create new
objects or new participants in exactly
the same way except of course you're
going to have a message number inside of
here and a communication diagram
where you did not have them in sequence
diagrams destroy instead of having an X
you're just going to put destroy inside
of here just like you did with the
sequence diagrams however you're going
to point towards the guy that you're
ultimately going to destroy inside of
communication diagram in regards to
reference SD technically stands for
interaction diagrams I know that doesn't
make sense since this is an SD sequence
diagrams or whatever but I have seen
because there is not a specific way to
reference other sequences of events and
these guys really aren't used with
communication diagrams at all however
like I said I have seen people use
things like the reference and critical
and negative in exactly the same way
with communication diagrams I'm not
saying that's right but that is
definitely something to look out for and
whenever you want to define that a
message has been lost like we did with
sequence diagrams you're going to do it
in exactly the same way with
communication diagrams now to review
here we have a sequence diagram and we
are going to show that the messages are
going across and then as we hit new
participants we're going to add an
additional number onto that and then you
can see that I'm adding those additional
numbers here and thereafter how this guy
right here is going to difference to a
communication diagram is the
communication diagram is going to be a
lot more compact however you're also
going to see the messages being sent the
major major thing you have to worry
about and figure out how to do is create
these numbers right here everything else
for the most part is going to be exactly
the same except there are no return
arrows inside of a communication diagram
so you're going to have to really fixate
on creating the right message numbers
which I hope I can make really easy on
the next frame you're going to see a
pretty complicated sequence diagram and
by the way I have all of this stuff
available as a cheat sheet underneath
the video so click on that link and you
can see everything there and use it as a
cheat sheet and everything should be
pretty easy in regards to creating
communication diagrams because you guys
seem to be pretty good at creating
sequence diagrams here what I did was I
labeled everything this being the first
message second message third message
fourth message and then you can see as
we hit a new participant we're going to
add an additional number onto that guy
and then you're going to directly be
able to
relay to these guys over here and as you
can see I'm sending messages on both
sides of the link so there's the message
one two and three and message four as
you can see over there
and then you can see how these guys are
bouncing back and forth so part two
which is this guy right here you can see
how it is pointing three point one just
as three point one is pointing to create
this new participant and then over here
as we bounce to a new participant we're
creating yet another number which you
can see that is exactly what's happening
over here and by understanding how these
message numbers work you can see the
flow of the interaction between these
guys pretty easily once you get used to
working with it so message one message
two message three message four it's a
new participant this is going to be the
next participant that is going to be
created and then since you don't see any
additional fries anywhere you realize
that free has served its part and it is
not going to send any messages as you
can see no messages are being sent over
here then we can go to four then we get
to this participant you can see the flow
as well and this of course will make a
lot more sense if these participants add
names either way then we're going to go
for one and then because you don't see a
for two until you come back up here well
you know that that means that this is
going to send a message and then it's
not going to sending in additional
messages until it ends up with the
response or the return in that situation
so that is the major difference between
sequence diagrams and communication
diagrams the major part is going to be
understanding these message numbers as I
said before because pretty much
everything else is pretty understandable
but if you focus in on first message
after a new participant means add an
additional number and every message
thereafter sent by that same participant
means increment that number that you
then add it on everything should be
pretty understandable leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
