my programming with python 2.5 through
2.7 tutorial today I'm going to talk
about file input and output first what
I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna import a
module in the OS module this is going to
allow me to interact with the file
system then of course I have to define
my main function because that's what
it's the last line of code is going to
be calling and I'm gonna pass at this
point if you haven't seen any other
tutorials most definitely check those
out otherwise you're gonna be completely
confused
now I'm gonna define another function
here what I'm gonna do with this
function is retrieve information from a
file that is available here import the
information which is going to be student
grades and then I'm going to take those
student grades and put them in order
based off of which student actually
gored the best on a test and here you
didn't see the previous exception
handling tutorial check that out
otherwise this isn't gonna make any
sense basically what I'm going to do
here is catch any errors triggered if
the file that I'm calling for doesn't
exist
and here I'm just creating an empty
dictionary here I'm going to create a
string I'm gonna put a beginning string
in here and I'm gonna be adding to this
as I code here and with this code right
here this is something you haven't seen
before I'm going to open up the student
grades file and I could put an R in here
which would mean I'm opening it to read
or a W that I'm hoping in it to write to
it or a I'm opening it to append to the
end of it but I'm opening it to read it
and that's default so I don't need to do
anything with that the next line of code
what I'm trying to block with this
exception handling you see here on the
screen is actually an i/o error which
would be triggered if I try to open a
file that didn't exist I'm gonna pend
the e there so that I get more
information if an error does occur and
if the file cannot be found or some
other i/o error occurs
I'm print this message followed by E now
if everything does work itself out I'm
gonna use a for statement to split each
line in the file into two separate
strings and then create a dictionary
using those two strings as key valued
pairs so I'm just gonna cycle through
this file that I just pulled down here
I'm going to split two values that are
found and I'll just show you here
student grades right here this is where
I'm pulling the information from so what
it's doing is it's going to pull in line
by line and it's going to be to split
mark and the score that he got and then
store them into name and grade and here
I'm creating these name valued pairs and
then after I get all that done I'm gonna
close the file because I don't need it
anymore and with this next for statement
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sort
through all the grades from highest to
lowest and store them in the new string
that I created which is this string
right here and here I'm going to append
the new sorted in order based off of the
best grade to the lowest grade to the
string that students string put the
score in and then at the end of this put
in a new line now after I'm done with
this for statement print a new line to
screen to try and keep everything nice
and clean here on the stage and just so
you can see it I'm going to print out a
student string to the screen as well and
then I'm gonna output that string to a
new file and this time I'm gonna have to
use the W because I want to write so I'm
going to call the name this file out the
file it's equal to open again you use
the statement open because we're opening
that file it's actually gonna be a new
file called student rank and like I said
before I'm gonna have to put W in here
because I'm going to be writing to the
file then I'm gonna use the write
function just to copy my best student
string that I created out to that file
and I should have actually surrounded
this with a exception handling but I
didn't because I know it's right but
that's exactly whenever you have an
error
whenever you're positive that it's right
and then close off the function so I'm
gonna have to come down here in domain
now and call retrieve file just copy
this go over pass paste that in and if I
run it all this code by the way is free
and available at new think tank on you
can see that everything printed itself
out what is being printed here on the
screen right now is what is going on
here with this for say
so it's basically taking the key value
pair best students score day and then
whatever they scored and this is all
this information is pulled from the
dictionary that we actually created
right here so I used that grade as the
key and then the name is that value and
then we were able to print that to
screen and then you can see here also
best students ranked it automatically
put everything in order right here what
actually did it right here with this
fourth statement which I use sorted and
you can see finished output we know that
everything printed out the screen and if
I actually go to student rank dot text
and open that file up you can see right
here that everything printed out to it
on just exactly the way that I wanted to
so that's how you open files read
information from files and then print
new information to a file and of course
how to close files and how to do a whole
bunch of other things but you may have
noticed I did not use this module that I
imported up here I'm actually going to
show you that right now it's going to
show you how to manipulate a bunch of
different files in the file system with
Python and I'm just gonna call this
directory play and then of course come
down into main this is just kind of
goofing around a little bit but it's
just some different things that you can
do like let's say for example you want
to output the files stored in a specific
directory real simple print OS for the
module we imported directory and then
just put in I'm gonna put in my user
directory just for an example you can
see it automatically went out there and
it's printed out onto screen all of the
different directories and files that
exist in my directory user I'm just
gonna copy this there's a whole bunch of
different methods that are available
inside of this pen let's say I wanted to
check if user bin slash Python is a
directory or not what's actually the
location for my Python interpreter so
you know that it isn't but this is
indeed how you would check that for an
f5 and you can see back it shot out
false you could also check if this is a
file instead of a directory and just
replace dir with file and f5 you can see
that that indeed is a file now I'm going
to come down here and actually copy all
of the different files that lie inside
of user to a variable called list dir a
list and then what I'm going to do
I'm going to use a for statement to do
something kind of interesting I'm gonna
cycle through all of the files and
directories in my user directory and and
if I come across a directory I'm gonna
output to the screen all of the files
that lie inside of that directory
hopefully that makes sense it should so
use the for statement if OS dot path is
a directory I want to do is output all
the files that lie inside of that
directory so I'm gonna print out OS dot
list dir I'm just gonna copy this paste
that in and if it's file well obviously
we can't do that so I'm gonna put an
Alice in here and then continue
jump back to the next file in your
directory and if we run this you can see
that it's cycled through all the
different files inside of my directory
user and if it was a directory it
printed them out to screen of course
that might not be something you would
often use but it does show you how to
cycle through files inside of a
directory using Python so that is usable
and then also and there's a bunch of
different methods I'm not covering in
this OS module but let's say you're
gonna need to want to make a directory
how would you do that like for example
and users slash if I want to create a
new directory and I already showed you
how to make the files I wanted to make a
new directory called testing that's all
whole that you would have to do but OS
don't make directory and if you are
allowed you can also remove directories
by using rmdir so there's a bunch of
different ways to manipulate files
inside of Python if you have any
questions or comments leave them below
