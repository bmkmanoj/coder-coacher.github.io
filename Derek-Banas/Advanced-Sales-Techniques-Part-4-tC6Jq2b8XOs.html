sales and closing strategies tutorial
today I'm going to provide a complete
coverage on how to properly utilize the
yes set if you did not watch part 1
through 3 go watch those now otherwise
you will be confused the yes set is
extremely important is just a process of
asking questions that are guaranteed to
get the other person to respond with a
yes I wrote sales scripts from many
major corporations over the years and my
research has shown that by utilizing the
S set and sales scripts we were able to
double our sales and sometimes to get
results that were even better than that
psychology researchers have actually
found if you get a person to answer
affirmatively to topics that relate 7 to
8 times you are almost guaranteed to get
another yes why is that we all have a
conscious and unconscious mind the
conscious mind is bad at making
decisions the unconscious mind can make
very complicated decisions in a second
research is showing that the conscious
mind can only process five to nine ideas
at one time so if you're trying to get a
point across to someone and they're
trying to make a conscious decision they
will soon become confused and if a
person becomes confused they're more
than likely to say now everyone decides
to agree with an idea for numerous
reasons so if they will only buy
something if five specific needs are met
and they can only process five topics at
a time I think you can see that it would
be extremely hard to sell to them these
are the five reasons why I would buy a
television first off I need to be a 100
percent sure it won't easily break
secondly I need to be sure it won't fall
over on my daughter also I would need to
make sure it will look nice for at least
10 years I need to be sure that the
picture is gonna be nicer than my
current TV of course and I need to be
sure it can connect to the internet what
will happen if the salesman focuses
first on sound system remote control
blu-ray player menu system in color am I
going to buy this television nope hence
you need to sell to the unconscious with
the yes set to avoid this issue people
use their unconscious mind to make
instant decisions when a deer runs in
front of your car your unconscious keeps
you from crashing how does it do that
you're unconscious makes decisions based
on rules and past experiences one of the
rules that strongly governs the
unconscious mind is the consistency
principle which I've talked about in
previous tutorials this principle states
that a person will strive to remain
consistent with their past decisions and
statements people that don't are
considered mentally ill so the yes set
gets people to agree with
you by accessing the unconscious mind by
placing them in a trance by asking
simple questions making them believe
they are answering consistent to their
past responses asking them questions
that will definitely return a yes
response and then at that point you can
start asking questions that are less
probable and the people will continue to
say yes using the asset and sales just
requires you to get the person to agree
to a few simple questions like for
example how are you doing today pretty
good can you please sit down there is
the temperature in the room comfortable
or I see you're looking at whatever
product or services in front of them
then you need the client to list the
needs the product or service must
provide now ask repetitively if there
are any other requirements after you
have all the needs get the client to
prioritize those needs which are most
important which are second most
important which release here's how you
would sell me a television you would say
your daughter's safety is most important
right I would answer yes this mounting
bracket it will keep it out of her reach
won't it yes you also don't want to
worry about the set breaking right yes
we guarantee it for five years against
any damage we could extend that to ten
though of course like you're asking
right if you get all the needs
qualifying the customer answers
affirmatively that this product meets
those needs they simply will by then you
just simply repeat back what they said
to you make a statement everyone agrees
with it that is true like for example
the weather's beautiful today or you
could make a statement better safe than
sorry right metaphors are great give
them a compliment to agree with or you
could reference a past experience that
everyone has had you could ask them for
example you remember what high school
was like right a lot of times we want to
ask hard questions of people like for
example imagine this flat-screen TV in
your living room how could we soften
things such as that so that they
actually feel comfortable imagining the
television in their living room you
could use words such as perhaps maybe
possibly or might and here is an example
at the bottom of the screen perhaps you
can imagine this beautiful flat-screen
TV in your home can also establish a yes
set without questions some people have a
problem getting people to agree with
them or they don't know what questions
to ask when you ask a question do you
notice how your tonality goes up at the
end of the question and if you use that
upward tonality with any statement the
mind will see it as a question whether
it isn't or not
when this tonality use is combined with
a yes head shake you can guarantee a
positive response just be careful not to
look like a bobble head
many people freeze up if they're yeah
set is broken with a no response don't
worry about it all you need to do is
jump back to a previous statement the
customer agreed with if you get a no
that means you're just moving too fast
too close the customer and now you know
you need to slow down your closing
process you must throughout the entire
presentation think of all customer
interactions as feedback instead of an
argument you could actually use the yes
set in dating you can slowly build
physical interactions as well when you
meet somebody of the opposite sex
whenever you're reaching out to shake
hands lightly touch the money elbow
briefly when you agree with them lightly
touch them on the floor arm or shoulder
when you're crossing the street reach
out and hold their hand when you agree
again lightly touch their leg when you
admire their earring lightly touch their
cheek by doing this throughout the night
you're almost guaranteed to get what you
want which would be a kiss of course
some people won't allow you to easily
get them into a yes set they will
constantly be hitting you with questions
and interrupting you one way to get them
out of this mode is to hit them with
some indirect hypnosis one of the
easiest ways to throw someone into
trance is to make a statement that's
hard to process using homonyms would be
an example of that a homonym is just
simply a word that sounds alike such as
realized realize realize break and break
principle in principle they're there and
I think you get the point just use a
couple homonyms in a couple sentences
and you'll pretty easily throw somebody
into a trance situation which you can
then use to throw them into a yes set
there's some other ways you can confuse
somebody into a trance so you can easily
put them into a yes set state of mind
using double negatives also forces
people into trance however it's best to
use a double negatives as you are
looking or walking away from someone and
here is an example of that don't not
think about you could also use overly
complicated references to throw somebody
into a trance here's an example of that
my aunt told me that his friend knows
it's time to relax when she sits in
front of the TV this will more than
likely knock somebody out
important five of my sales and closing
strategies tutorial I'm going to cover

techniques if you have any questions
